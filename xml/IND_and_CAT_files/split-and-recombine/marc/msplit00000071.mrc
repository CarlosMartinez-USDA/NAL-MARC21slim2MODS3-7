During the period of September 2000 to January 2002, were accomplished 70h of collections of the preys captured in twelve nests of Polybia platycephala Richards, placed in urban areas of Juiz de Fora municipality, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The preys captured by P. platycephala include five orders of insects: Diptera (33.4%), Lepidoptera (28.6%), Hemiptera (12.0%), Hymenoptera (9.4%) e Coleoptera (7.2%). The mean weight of protein charge carried by the wasps was 1.9 +/-1.6mg (n = 34, 0.3 - 6.2 mg), and the mean of protein transported per day was 22.8 mg. According to the results, we could estimate that 4,380 preys are captured by a single colony of P. platycephala during one year. Thus, this species could be used in management programs of urban pests, helping the equilibrium of this environment. 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3apredatory insects 3aLepidoptera 3aHemiptera 3abiological control agents 3asurveys 3abiological control 3ainsect control 3apredator-prey relationships 3aPolybia 3aBrazil 0aHymenoptera 0aPolybia platycephala1 aLima, M.A.P.1 aMachado, V.L.L.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2005 , v. 34, no. 5 p.849-851x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20050005000193Available from publisher's Web site  a20060605b20060702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03039naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245010300203300001600306500001500322520183500337650002002172650002402192653001702216653001702233653002302250653000802273700001702281700002102298700002402319700002102343700002502364773011202389852000902501856008502510930003302595946001302628655001202641IND4448815720221120051420.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444881572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10439-010-0184-22doi7 aPMC30722752pmcid7 a209765582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jingshu 10aNumerical Investigation of the Effects of Channel Geometry on Platelet Activation and Blood Damage  ap. 897-910.  a2019-12-04  aThromboembolic complications in Bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs) are believed to be due to the combination of high shear stresses and large recirculation regions. Relating blood damage to design geometry is therefore essential to ultimately optimize the design of BMHVs. The aim of this research is to quantitatively study the effect of 3D channel geometry on shear-induced platelet activation and aggregation, and to choose an appropriate blood damage index (BDI) model for future numerical simulations. The simulations in this study use a recently developed lattice-Boltzmann with external boundary force (LBM-EBF) method [Wu, J., and C. K. Aidun. Int. J. Numer. Method Fluids 62(7):765-783, 2010; Wu, J., and C. K. Aidun. Int. J. Multiphase flow 36:202-209, 2010]. The channel geometries and flow conditions are re-constructed from recent experiments by Fallon [The Development of a Novel in vitro Flow System to Evaluate Platelet Activation and Procoagulant Potential Induced by Bileaflet Mechanical Heart Valve Leakage Jets in School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Atlanta: Georgia Institute of Technology] and Fallon et al. [Ann. Biomed. Eng. 36(1):1]. The fluid flow is computed on a fixed regular ‘lattice' using the LBM, and each platelet is mapped onto a Lagrangian frame moving continuously throughout the fluid domain. The two-way fluid-solid interactions are determined by the EBF method by enforcing a no-slip condition on the platelet surface. The motion and orientation of the platelet are obtained from Newtonian dynamics equations. The numerical results show that sharp corners or sudden shape transitions will increase blood damage. Fallon's experimental results were used as a basis for choosing the appropriate BDI model for use in future computational simulations of flow through BMHVs. 3afluid mechanics 3aplatelet activation 0aoptimization 0aChannel flow 0aBlood damage index 0aCFD1 aYun, B.

Symposium held January 12-16, 2003, Cape Town, South Africa.  aUse of animal by-products for crop production has the potential to be an economical way for our society to protect the environment and to conserve natural resources. Swine farms are an important source of animal manure production. In this experiment, the effect of swine manure and mineral fertilisation on the mass yield of different parts of the cucumber plant (Cucumis sativus L.) was studied. Fertilizer treatments were fresh and composted solid fractions of swine manure slurry fertilization (FSF and CSF, respectively) at two different rates (300 and 450 kg N ha(-1)), mineral fertilization (MF, equivalent to 300 kg N ha(-1)), and a control (C) without fertilization. All fertilizing scenarios produced a higher biomass yield of the different plant parts analyzed than the control. The aerial total biomass (expressed on both a fresh and dry mass basis) from CSF at 300 kg N ha(-1) plots was the greatest. In the first sampling, the leaf biomass production was greater, in general, for the organic fertilization treatments. However, in the second sampling, in most cases, differences were not found in the leaf biomass production between organic and inorganic fertilization. Shoot mass of plants fertilized at 300 kg N ha(-1) swine manure was similar to that of the MF plots. The application rate of swine manure did not affect the shoot yield, except in plants with FSF treatment at the first sampling. The fruit production by plants fertilized with FSF and CSF at 300 and 450 kg N ha(-1), respectively, was not different from fruit production produced by the MF. The greatest cucumber yield was observed in plots with CSF at 300 kg N ha(-1) treatment. The fruit size was smaller in plants fertilised with CSF at 300 kg N ha(-1) than in the other fertilization treatments. These plants had the greatest number of fruits. 3apig manure 3asoil amendments 3amanure spreading 3acomposted manure 3aslurries 3aapplication rate 3acrop yield 3aCucumis sativus 3acucumbers 3aplant growth 3adry matter accumulation 3aleaves 3ashoots 3acrop quality 3aSpain1 aMoreno-Caselles, J.1 aPerez-Murcia, M.D.1 aPerez-Espinosa, A.1 aParedes, C.1 aSosa, F.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 4-6 p.517-524x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000432653Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle03660naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175072001700192100001500209245011100224300001600335500015600351500001500507520198000522650001902502650002102521650002002542650001002562650002702572650002602599650002702625650001702652650002202669650001602691650001502707650001102722650001102733651001302744653001702757653002402774653002702798700001502825700001302840773010402853852000902957856008102966930003303047945002503080946001303105655001203118IND4375741920221120051332.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574192DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000432992doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Symposium held January 12-16, 2003, Cape Town, South Africa.  a2019-12-04  aPhosphorus (P) deficiency is a universal constraint to crop production, including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and fertilizer P use in deficient situations has biological and economic benefits. Although plant analysis is a fundamental tool for determining P nutritional status of crops, foliar analysis diagnostic indices are not well defined even for major crops like wheat. The critical concentration approach to interpreting plant analysis has inherent limitations; thus, critical concentration ranges have been suggested instead. We conducted six rainfed field experiments on P-deficient soils (Ustochrept, Haplustalf) for three seasons (1997-2000) to develop plant analysis interpretative guidelines for diagnosing the P nutritional status of spring wheat. In each experiment, substantial crop yield increases as well as plant P concentration enhancements were observed with applied P. In general, fertilizer P requirements for maximizing P concentration in foliar plant parts were similar to the ones needed to attain maximum yields. Grain P concentration increases were comparable to whole-shoot P concentrations. As with crop yields, P concentrations were greater with banded than broadcast P. However, there was no consistency between plant P concentration relationship with soil type or seasonal rainfall. Estimated critical P concentrations for near-maximum crop yield (95%) were greater with banded than broadcast P, except for whole shoots and grain grown in the noncalcareous soil. Moreover, estimated critical levels for the same plant part varied between soils, years (rainfall regimens), and even fertilizer application methods. To cope with such inconsistencies, the proposed critical P concentration ranges for spring wheat in Pakistan are as follows: young whole shoots, 0.13-0.28%; recently matured leaves, 0.27-0.36%; and mature grain, 0.13-0.27%. Plant analysis remains imprecise and should be used to complement growth observations and soil analysis. 3aband placement 3anutrient content 3aplant nutrition 3aseeds 3afertilizer application 3anutrient deficiencies 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aspring wheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3aphosphorus 3aleaves 3ashoots 3aPakistan 0abroadcasting 0aapplication methods 0acritical concentration1 aAwan, Z.I.1 aRyan, J.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 4-6 p.609-622x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000432993Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle02868naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001800175245007100193300001600264500015600280520156100436650001201997650001902009650002302028650002002051650001402071650001402085650002002099650001502119650002302134650002102157651001502178773010402193852000902297856008102306930003302387945002502420946001302445655001202458IND4375741820221120043815.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574182DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000432962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Symposium held January 12-16, 2003, Cape Town, South Africa.  aLong-term agricultural sustainability and food quality are threatened by a range of chemicals capable of persisting in the environment and entering the food chain at concentrations that can pose threats to human health. The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is one of these, despite the existence of Cd food standard developed by Food Standards Australia New Zealand and standards for Cd in fertilizer. This article collates information from northeast Australia (mostly Queensland) by river catchment on historical inputs of Cd as an impurity in P fertilizers and on total concentrations in a broad selection of soils used primarily for sugar cane and vegetable production. How Cd partitions by soil depth and how it recycles in sugar cane production systems is explored in the context of sustainability. Actions by state governments to regulate the maximum permitted concentrations and encourage the fertilizer industry to lower Cd impurities in commercial products have helped reduce the quantity of Cd entering the two cropping systems. The study also reports briefly on the assessment of four soil chemical tests for Cd to assess the likelihood of edible vegetables grown on nonsaline soils from Queensland exceeding a concentration of 0.025 mg Cd kg(-1) fresh weight. The order of accumulation of Cd (fresh weight basis) in the vegetables studied was as follows: leaf vegetables > roots and bulbs > vegetable stems and fruits > seed vegetables approximately equal to brassica. Silverbeet accumulated the most Cd, a finding in accord with international reports. 3acadmium 3asoil pollution 3aagricultural soils 3abioaccumulation 3asugarcane 3aSaccharum 3avegetable crops 3avegetables 3afood contamination 3ahuman food chain 3aQueensland0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 4-6 p.597-608x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000432963Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle03604naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002400193245022000217300001600437520169800453650001702151650001202168650001102180650001202191650004802203650001702251650003002268650003102298650003802329650004502367650003102412650003902443650003902482650002602521650003702547650000902584650001902593650003602612650002402648650002302672650004102695653003402736653002502770773013402795852000902929856009202938930003303030946001103063655001203074IND4413320920221123045346.0081205e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441332092DNAL7 a190768352pmid7 aPMC26656872pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03801.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbedi-Valugerdi, M.10aMercury and silver induce B cell activation and anti-nucleolar autoantibody production in outbred mouse stocks: are environmental factors more important than the susceptibility genes in connection with autoimmunity?  ap. 117-124.  aEnvironmental and predisposing genetic factors are known to play a crucial role in the development of systemic autoimmune diseases. With respect to the role of environmental factors, it is not known how and to what extent they contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of systemic autoimmunity. In the present study, I considered this issue and asked if environmental factors can induce autoimmunity in the absence of specific susceptible genes. The development of genetically controlled mercury- and silver-induced B cell activation and anti-nucleolar autoantibodies (ANolA) production in genetically heterozygous outbred Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) and Black Swiss mouse stocks were analysed. Four weeks of treatment with both mercury and silver induced a strong B cell activation characterized by increased numbers of splenic antibody-secreting cells of at least one or more immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype(s) in all treated stocks. The three stocks also exhibited a marked increase in the serum IgE levels in response to mercury, but not silver. More importantly, in response to mercury a large numbers of ICR (88%), NMRI (96%) and Black Swiss (100%) mice produced different levels of IgG1 and IgG2a ANolA (a characteristic which is linked strictly to the H-2 genes). Similarly, but at lower magnitudes, treatment with silver also induced the production of IgG1 and IgG2a ANolA in 60% of ICR, 75% of NMRI and 100% of Black Swiss mice. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that long-term exposure to certain environmental factors can activate the immune system to produce autoimmunity per se, without requiring specific susceptible genes. 3aautoimmunity 3amercury 3asilver 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Antinuclearxbloodximmunology. 2aAutoimmunity 2aB-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCell Nucleolusximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aHemolytic Plaque Technique 2aImmunoglobulin Exanalysisxblood. 2aImmunoglobulin Gxanalysisxblood. 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMercuryxadministration & dosage 2aMice 2aModels, Animal 2aSilverxadministration & dosage 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpleenximmunology 2aXenobioticsxadministration & dosage 0aanti-nucleolar autoantibodies 0aoutbred mouse stocks0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2009 Jan., v. 155, no. 1 p.117-124dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03801.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081205b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03551naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175100002300192245011800215300001600333500015600349520177400505650002302279650001802302650001802320650000902338650003502347650001602382650003602398650001302434650001902447650001202466650002202478650002102500650002002521650002502541650002002566650002102586650001102607650001002618700002402628700001402652700002302666700001602689700001502705773010402720852000902824856008102833930003302914945002502947946001302972655001202985IND4375741520221123042719.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574152DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000432862doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Symposium held January 12-16, 2003, Cape Town, South Africa.  aThe increasing demand for growth media for greenhouse horticultural uses, the rising new uses of substrates, and the scarcity and cost of traditional sources, such as sphagnum peat moss in Mediterranean countries, have focused research on new substrate materials. Use of composted sewage sludges as a component of growth media could be a feasible alternative, with the benefit of their high availability and their very low cost. In this study, the effects of composted sewage sludge, blended with sphagnum peat moss in growth media, on germination and trace element extraction of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var italica Plenc cv. Tenere), broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. Botryti cv. Marathon), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa c.v. Malta) were studied. Four treatments were established, on the basis of the addition of increasing quantities of composted sewage sludge to peat (0, 15, 30, and 50%, v/v). Germination percentage and trace elements (Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, B, Pb, Ni, Cd, and Cr) extraction and differential root/aerial part distribution were studied. Increasing sewage sludge treatments (especially 30 and 50%) reduced germination of lettuce and broccoli. In cauliflower seedlings, an increment of germination was observed for the 15 and 30% treatments compared with the control. The contents of Fe, Cu, Mn, and Zn in plant tissues increased with the increasing rate of sewage sludge in the media. The highest micronutrient extraction efficiency was observed in broccoli (roots) and lettuce (leaves). Fe and Zn were the micronutrients extracted to a higher degree in all plants. Mn was mainly accumulated in aerial parts. Heavy metal extraction was very low in relation to micronutrients. Cd, Pb, and Cr were mainly accumulated in roots and Ni in the aerial parts. 3abiosolids composts 3asewage sludge 3agrowing media 3apeat 3aBrassica oleracea var. italica 3acauliflower 3aBrassica oleracea var. botrytis 3abroccoli 3aLactuca sativa 3alettuce 3avegetable growing 3aseed germination 3aplant nutrition 3aplant micronutrients 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient content 3aleaves 3aroots1 aMoreno-Caselles, J.1 aMoral, R.1 aPerez-Espinosa, A.1 aParedes, C.1 aRufete, B.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 4-6 p.571-582x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000432863Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle03960naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245010200168300001800270520210500288650001202393650001002405650001602415650002002431650001302451650001502464650002002479650001402499650001402513650001802527650001502545650001202560650002302572650002302595650002002618650001702638650001302655650002502668650001802693650002002711650001702731650001802748650007402766650001302840650001602853650002502869650001502894650001702909650005502926650002402981653002803005653001403033653003003047653002503077700001903102700001703121773008003138852000903218930003303227945001303260946001303273655001203286IND2049337520221123021406.0951227e199512  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204933752DNAL7 a74943012pmid7 aPMC1897332pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParcells, M.S.10aRetention of oncogenicity by a Marek's disease virus mutant lacking six unique short region genes  ap. 7888-7898.  aWe previously reported the construction of Marek's disease virus (MDV) strains having mutations in various genes that map to the unique short (US) region of the viral genome (J. L. Cantello, A. S. Anderson, A. Francesconi, and R. W. Morgan, J. Virol. 65:1584-1588, 1991; M. S. Parcells, A. S. Anderson, and R. W. Morgan, Virus Genes 9:5-13, 1994, M. S. Parcells, A. S. Anderson. and R. W. Morgan, J. Virol. 68:8239-8253, 1994). These strains were constructed by using a high-passage-level serotype 1 MDV strain which grew well in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Despite the growth of the parent and mutant viruses in cell culture, in vivo studies were limited by poor growth of these strains in chickens. One of the mutants studied lacked 4.5 kbp of US region DNA and contained the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli inserted at the site of the deletion. The deletion removed MDV homologs to the US1, US2, and US10 genes of herpes simplex virus type 1 as well as three MDV-specific open reading frames. We now report the construction of a mutant MDV containing a similar deletion in the US region of the highly oncogenic RB1B strain. This mutant, RB1B delta 4.5lac, had a growth impairment in established chicken embryo fibroblasts similar to that described previously for MDVs lacking a functional US1 gene. In chickens, RB1B delta 4.5lac showed decreased early cytolytic infection, mortality, tumor incidence, and horizontal transmission. Several lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from RB1B delta 4.5lac induced tumors, and virus reactivated from these cell lines was LacZ+. These results indicate that the deleted genes are nonessential for the transformation of chicken T cells or for the establishment and maintenance of latency. On the basis of the growth impairment observed for RB1B delta 4.5lac in cell culture and in vivo, we conclude that deletion of these genes affects the lytic replication of MDV. This is the first MDV mutant constructed in the RB1B oncogenic strain, and the methodology described herein provides for the direct examination of MDV-encoded determinants of oncogenicity. 3amutants 3agenes 3amutagenesis 3acarcinogenicity 3achickens 3acell lines 3agene expression 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3aMarek disease 3aMardivirus 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCells, Cultured 2aChick Embryo 2aChickens 2aDNA, Viralxanalysis 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Viral 2aGenome, Viral 2aHerpesvirus 2, Gallidxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aKinetics 2aMutagenesis 2aRNA, Viralxanalysis 2aSerotyping 2aTime Factors 2aTumor Virus Infectionsxphysiopathologyxvirology. 2aVirulencexgenetics 0aexperimental infections 0adeletions 0alymphoblastoid cell lines 0acytolytic infections1 aAnderson, A.S.1 aMorgan, R.W.0 tJournal of virology.g1995 Dec., v. 69, no. 12 p.7888-7898x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02721naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100001500158245014300173300001600316500015600332520150300488650001401991650001902005650001902024650001802043650001502061653001602076700001402092773010402106852000902210856008102219930003302300945002502333946001302358655001202371IND4375744720221123004120.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574472DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000434042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Symposium held January 12-16, 2003, Cape Town, South Africa.  aMehlich 3, Mehlich 2, CAL (calcium lactate), Schachtschabel, 0.01 M CaCl2, and aqua regia were compared as soil potassium extractants. Comparison was focused on the relationships between Mehlich 3 as a Czech official soil-testing method and the extractants used for this purpose in the past (Mehlich 2, Schachtschabel) or frequently studied in some other countries (CAL, 0.01 M CaCl2, aqua regia); 1 181 agriculture soil samples were collected for the study (157 light soils, 968 medium soils, and 56 heavy soils). The soil samples represented all major soil types, climatic regions, and proportions of agronomic cultures in the Czech Republic. The amount of potassium extracted by the chosen methods relative to Mehlich 3 (100%) was approximately as follow: aqua regia (1500%); CAL (85%); Mehlich 2 (85%); Schachtschabel (80%); 0.01 M CaCl2 (40%). Statistically highly significant linear relationships between Mehlich 3 and Mehlich 2, Schachtschabel, CAL, and 0.01 M CaCl2 were found. No relationship was found between aqua regia and the other extractants. Coefficient of determination (R2) for the linear regression between Mehlich 3 and the other methods for all soils were 0.943 (Mehlich 2), 0.842 (CAL), 0.850 (Schachtschabel), and 0.727 (0.01 M CaCl2). The results of the study enabled us in many cases to recalculate the criteria for the evaluation of the chosen methods without conducting new field and pot experiments but recalculation of the individual measurements cannot be recommended. 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3asoil nutrients 3asoil analysis 3aextraction 0aextractants1 aNemec, P.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 4-6 p.795-803x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000434043Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle02056naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009900129300001600228520123900244650002301483650002301506650001101529650001201540650002101552651001201573700001901585700001601604773008101620852000901701939003301710946001101743655001201754IND8800507020221123004245.0880509s1987    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880050702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeskimen, G.F.10aDevelopment of Eucalyptus clones for a summer rainfall environment with periodic severe frosts  ap. 197-205.  aEucalyptus grandis, E. grandis hybrid, and E. saligna hybrid trees, developed through as many as four generations of selection in southern Florida, were naturally exposed to exceptionally low winter temperatures. In a genetic base population and related field studies, 100 phenotypically superior cloning candidates were selected after an 8-h freeze with a low of −11 °C. Following propagation as rooted cuttings, 55 clones (typically 11–42 ramets per clone) were outplanted in a single-tree plot design and evaluated for 3.8 years which included two additional severe freezes. Significant clonal variation was observed in frost resilience, vigor, and quality. After composite evaluation for frost resilience, size, and form, only three clones were considered suitable for operational planting. Selection of further clones for outplanting requires major commitments to locate candidates and to test them. Field testing for frost resilience requires considerable investment, much beyond the requirements for developing fast-growing clones alone. Clones identified by testing will not be resistant to freezing conditions but will be resilient and greatly reduce the risks now associated with plantation culture in southern Florida. 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aEucalyptus saligna 3aclones 3atesting 3afrost resistance 3aFlorida1 aRockwood, D.L.1 aReddy, K.V.0 tNew forests.g1987, v. 1, no. 3 p.197-205wJournal:jnl40921x0169-42867nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880509c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02751naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181100001600190245015900206300001800365500002400383500001500407520077000422650002401192650002401216650001701240650001601257650001401273650001601287650003101303650001501334650001501349650001701364650001901381650002001400650002701420650002101447650001201468650002601480650002701506650001701533650002501550650001901575650001501594650002601609650002901635650001501664651001001679653001701689653001701706700002501723700001801748700001501766700002301781773011201804852000901916856005901925930003301984945002502017946001102042655001202053IND4387405620221123004309.0070201e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438740562DNAL7 a169294612pmid7 a10.1002/ps.12802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL001 0aH0001 aMaymo, A.C.10aRelationship between esterase activity and acrinathrin and methiocarb resistance in field populations of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis  ap. 1129-1137.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), is a serious pest in the south-east of Spain owing to its direct feeding on crops, transmission of the tomato spotted wilt virus and its very high level of resistance to insecticides. Mechanisms of resistance were examined using field populations of F. occidentalis with different susceptibilities to acrinathrin, methiocarb (selective insecticides), endosulfan, metamidophos and deltamethrin (broad-spectrum insecticides). Esterase activity towards α-naphthyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate in resistant strains was significantly higher than in the reference strain (MLFOM) for both model substrates. This higher activity was significantly correlated with acrinathrin and methiocarb resistance. 3amechanism of action 3ahorticultural crops 3ainsect pests 3aacrinathrin 3aesterases 3aplant pests 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3amethiocarb 3aendosulfan 3adeltamethrin 3ainsect control 3aenzyme activity 3ainsecticide resistance 3aapplication rate 2aAnimals 2aEsterasesxmetabolism 2aInsecticide Resistance 2aInsecticides 2aInsectaxenzymology. 2aLethal Dose 50 2aMethiocarb 2aNaphtholsxmetabolism 2aNitrophenolsxmetabolism 2aPyrethrins 3aSpain 0ainsecticides 0ametamidophos1 aCervera Espinosa, A.1 aGarcera, M.D.1 aBielza, P.1 aMartinez-Pardo, R.0 tPest management science.g2006 Dec., v. 62, no. 12 p.1129-1137dPublished for SCI by Wileyx1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.12803electronic resource  a20070214b20070303c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/02/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03521naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001500175245013100190300001600321500015600337520206100493650001302554650001602567650002602583650002302609650002002632650001902652650001402671650002302685650001302708651001302721653002002734653002402754700001402778700001802792773010402810852000902914856008102923930003303004945002503037946001303062655001203075IND4375744620221123004335.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574462DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000433862doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Symposium held January 12-16, 2003, Cape Town, South Africa.  aThe widespread use of atrazine (AT) as a preemergent herbicide has raised concerns about its persistence in soils of sugarcane plantations in Barbados. Reported are results of field studies to measure the dissipation of AT and two primary metabolites at two sites in sugarcane plantations in Barbados. The investigation was intended to provide values of the half-lives for dissipation of the herbicide at various depths in the soil profile. Field studies indicated that there is significant potential for AT to leach from Barbados soils to vulnerable groundwater. Residues of the parent and the two metabolites persisted and leached to all profiles of the soil throughout the study period. AT dissipation occurred at all soil depths, was described by first-order kinetics, and proceeded with half-life values of 15-28 days. In Profile 1 at the Henley study site, AT concentration decreased exponentially by 72% from 1.16 microgram/g on the application day of the herbicide to 0.084 microgram/g at the end of day 84 of the study period. A similar decrease occurred in soils from a second site, Edgecumbe; from 2.84 g/g to 0.077 g/g. At deeper depths, the concentration of AT appeared to decrease at a slower rate than near-surface soils. Dissipation of AT concentration in both fields was generally accompanied by increases in the concentration of the dealkylated metabolites: deethylatrazine (DEAT) and deisopropylatrazine (DIAT). For example, 14% and 7% conversion of AT to DEAT and DIAT occurred by day 14 of the application, respectively. Generally, the deethylated metabolite was present at a higher concentration than the deisopropylated metabolite. By day 274, the day before the second application of AT, the concentration was 0.01 microgram/g, typically only 0.3-0.9% of the AT applied. In general, dissipation of AT appeared to be independent of localized factors, such as soil type (silt, clay, and sand), organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity, total pore size, bulk density, particle density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. 3aatrazine 3ametabolites 3apesticide persistence 3aenvironmental fate 3asugarcane soils 3asoil pollution 3ahalf life 3aherbicide residues 3aleaching 3aBarbados 0adeethylatrazine 0adeisopropylatrazine1 aGumbs, F.1 aHeadley, J.V.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 4-6 p.783-794x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000433863Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle03019naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100002200175245011000197300001600307500015600323500001500479520139900494650002301893650001901916650001101935650000901946650000901955650001501964650002001979650001201999650001802011650001702029650001102046650002502057650001302082651001002095653001102105653001902116700002402135700002502159700002102184700001902205773010402224852000902328856008102337930003302418945002502451946001302476655001202489IND4375743920221123004215.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574392DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000433542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Symposium held January 12-16, 2003, Cape Town, South Africa.  a2019-12-04  aRisks of soil contamination when waste materials are used as fertilizers have been a matter of frequent concern. The effect of compost from municipal organic waste on trace element status was examined in short-term field trials at neighboring areas of A Coruna (northwest Spain). The study sites were characterized as medium textured soils, with a range of pHs, organic matter content, and cation exchange capacity. The objective of this work was to compare two extraction methods (DTPA and Mehlich-3) to determine micronutrient contents in soils with and without compost additions. DTPA and Mehlich-3 extractions were carried out, and then analyses for Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Pb, and Cd contents were performed by ICP-AES. Overall, DTPA was less efficient than Mehlich-3 for Fe and Mn extraction. Lead, Ni, and Cd were extracted more effectively by DTPA than by Mehlich-3. In general, the efficiency of the extractants was related to compost addition, a trend that was most apparent for Zn and Cu. Levels of trace metals extracted by DTPA and Mehlich-3 from soils without compost addition were already highly variable, because of traditional farmyard manure and slurry fertilization. Diagnostic criteria for allowable loading limits of heavy metals during compost application should take into account direct measurements of background levels and relevant soil properties such as soil acidity. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil pollution 3acopper 3azinc 3alead 3aextraction 3asoil amendments 3acadmium 3asoil analysis 3aMSW composts 3anickel 3aplant micronutrients 3achromium 3aSpain 0ametals 0atrace elements1 aCaridad-Cancela, R.1 aTaboada-Castro, M.M.1 aPaz-Gonzalez, A.1 aAbreu, C.A. de0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 4-6 p.717-727x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000433543Available from publisher's Web site  a20060111b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/16  aOther US 7aarticle02521naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100001800158245010500176300001600281520128000297650001901577650001501596650001801611650002101629650001501650650002101665650001701686653001601703653002901719653002001748700001401768700001901782700001601801700001701817773010401834852000901938856008101947930003302028945002502061946001302086655001202099IND4375746820221122233115.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574682DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000494822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFuhrman, J.K.10aWater-soluble phosphorus as affected by soil to extractant ratios, extraction times, and electrolyte  ap. 925-935.  aOne of the most important nutrients for plant production is phosphorus (P). However mismanagement of fertilizer or manure can lead to P build-up in surface soils and elevate P loss in runoff possibly resulting in accelerated eutrophication. Concern of excess P in runoff has increased interest in water-soluble soil P and its use in determining potential for runoff P loss. Several variations of this procedure are currently in practice causing difficulty in comparing research findings. This study evaluated the effectiveness of several common variations of the water-soluble P procedures. Water-soluble soil P was analyzed for 10 soils using four different soil to solution ratios (1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:50) and four extraction times (10, 30, 60, and 900 min.). In addition, calcium chloride solutions (0.005 M, 0.01 M, 0.02 M) were compared to deionized water (DW) as extractant. The average amount of water-soluble P increased with wider soil to solution ratio, whereas the extraction time had no effect on the amount of P extracted. Water-soluble P extracted by the various soil to solution ratios and extraction times was significantly related to Mehlich 3 P (r2 > 0.83; p < 0.001). These findings suggest that a standardized procedure be used for water-soluble P analysis. 3asoil nutrients 3aphosphorus 3asoil analysis 3awater solubility 3aextraction 3acalcium chloride 3aelectrolytes 0aextractants 0awater soluble phosphorus 0aextraction time1 aZhang, H.1 aSchroder, J.L.1 aDavis, R.L.1 aPayton, M.E.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 7-8 p.925-935x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000494823Available from publisher's Web site  a20051214b20060102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/22  aOther US 7aarticle02417naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245005000202300001600252506007600268520110700344506003701451650000801488650004001496650002101536650002701557650002401584650002001608650003201628650002401660650001401684650002401698650001301722650001401735700002301749773008001772852000901852856007801861930003301939946001101972655001201983IND4416959920221207051036.0090228e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441695992DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9962doi7 aPMC26472922pmcid7 a190737012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorman, Charles J.10aBacterial DNA topology and infectious disease  ap. 672-678.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and its close relative Salmonella enterica have made important contributions historically to our understanding of how bacteria control DNA supercoiling and of how supercoiling influences gene expression and vice versa. Now they are contributing again by providing examples where changes in DNA supercoiling affect the expression of virulence traits that are important for infectious disease. Available examples encompass both the earliest stages of pathogen-host interactions and the more intimate relationships in which the bacteria invade and proliferate within host cells. A key insight concerns the link between the physiological state of the bacterium and the activity of DNA gyrase, with downstream effects on the expression of genes with promoters that sense changes in DNA supercoiling. Thus the expression of virulence traits by a pathogen can be interpreted partly as a response to its own changing physiology. Knowledge of the molecular connections between physiology, DNA topology and gene expression offers new opportunities to fight infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aSalmonella enterica 3agene expression 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainfectious diseases 3apathogens 3aphysiological state 3atopology 3avirulence1 aCorcoran, Colin P.0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Feb., v. 37, no. 3 p.672-678x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9963Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01954naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002100180245004800201300001600249506007600265520085700341506003701198650000801235650002201243650001201265650002401277650001301301650001301314700001701327700002401344773008001368852000901448856007901457930003301536946001101569655001201580IND4416960120221207051008.0090228e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441696012DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn10092doi7 aPMC26472832pmcid7 a191061402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Nicole M.10aStructural studies of type I topoisomerases  ap. 693-701.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTopoisomerases are ubiquitous proteins found in all three domains of life. They change the topology of DNA via transient breaks on either one or two of the DNA strands to allow passage of another single or double DNA strand through the break. Topoisomerases are classified into two types: type I enzymes cleave one DNA strand and pass either one or two DNA strands through the break before resealing it, while type II molecules cleave both DNA strands in concert and pass another double strand through the break followed by religation of the double strand break. Here we review recent work on the structure of type I enzymes. These structural studies are providing atomic details that, together with the existing wealth of biochemical and biophysical data, are bringing our understanding of the mechanism of action of these enzymes to the atomic level.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3achemical elements 3aenzymes 3amechanism of action 3aproteins 3atopology1 aRajan, Rakhi1 aMondragón, Alfonso0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Feb., v. 37, no. 3 p.693-701x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn10093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02708naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100002000158245009000178300001800268500001500286520136000301650002101661650001101682650002001693650001001713650002001723650000901743650002501752650002601777650001701803650001601820650001401836650001501850650002601865650001101891653003501902653001501937700001801952773010701970852000902077856008102086930003302167945002502200946001302225655001202238IND4375893420221122233052.0051108s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437589342DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000568912doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

For all species, diagnostic critical P in dried whole shoots generally decreased with increasing plant age and was larger for grain than dried whole shoots near maturity. For dried whole shoots, diagnostic critical P ranges (%P, dry weight basis) [days from sowing (DAS)] were oats, 0.72 (30 DAS)-0.23 (105 DAS); barley, 1.09 (30 DAS)-0.24 (203 DAS); triticale, 1.2 (30 DAS)-0.11 (120 DAS); and lupin, 0.60 (66 DAS)-0.21 (163 DAS). For grain, mean diagnostic critical P (range) was oats, 0.27 (0.18-0.39); barley, 0.32 (0.23-0.35); triticale, 0.22 (0.19-0.25); and lupin, 0.31 (0.25-0.41). In addition, we related the P concentration in dried whole shoots to grain yield measured at the end of that growing season (prognostic critical P). For dried whole shoots of each of the four plant species, the decrease in both diagnostic and prognostic critical P concentration as the plants matured was very similar, so both procedures predicted similar grain yields at the end of that growing season. 3anutrient content 3abarley 3aplant nutrition 3aseeds 3aHordeum vulgare 3aoats 3adevelopmental stages 3anutrient requirements 3aAvena sativa 3agrain yield 3atriticale 3aphosphorus 3aLupinus angustifolius 3ashoots 0adiagnostic critical phosphorus 0acrop yield1 aBrennan, R.F.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 9-10 p.1177-1186x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000568913Available from publisher's Web site  a20051221b20060102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/22  aOther US 7aarticle02525naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175100001700192245013100209300001600340520117200356650001701528650000901545650001401554650002201568650001001590650002001600650001701620650001901637650001901656650001601675651001501691700001901706700001701725700001601742700001501758700001701773773010401790852000901894856008101903930003301984945002502017946001302042655001202055IND4375746320221122222706.0051104s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437574632DNAL7 a10.1081/CSS-2000494702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChamon, A.S.10aInfluence of cereal varieties and site conditions on heavy metal accumulations in cereal crops on polluted soils of Bangladesh  ap. 889-906.  aThe present work describes results of pot experiments and field studies including three contaminated sites in Bangladesh. The aim was to investigate possible differences between cereal varieties with regard to heavy metal uptake and accumulation. A total of 10 rice (Oriza sativa L.) and 3 wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties were studied. Soil samples were digested with HCl:HNO3 (3:1), and plant samples were digested with a HNO3:HClO4 (5:1) mixture in closed systems. All elements with exception of cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) were measured in the extracts by plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Cadmium was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), with a heated graphite-tube system (HGA). Mercury was measured by AAS, using mercury-hydride system (MHS-20). The rice variety BR-14 exhibited the highest yield and in most cases the lowest heavy metal accumulations at harvest. Wheat varieties showed significantly different heavy metal accumulation. It can be concluded that selection of cereal varieties may add to safer crop production on heavy metal contaminated sites. Nevertheless, site specificity of this measure has to be taken into account. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3avarieties 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3abioaccumulation 3aheavy metals 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3agrain yield 3aBangladesh1 aGerzabek, M.H.1 aMondol, M.N.1 aUllah, S.M.1 aRahman, M.1 aBlum, W.E.H.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2005, v. 36, no. 7-8 p.889-906x0010-36247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1081/CSS-2000494703Available from publisher's Web site  a20051214b20060102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/11/22  aOther US 7aarticle02461naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245007600202300001600278506007600294520124200370506003701612650000801649650001501657650004001672650002601712650001901738650002901757650001101786650001301797700001901810773008001829852000901909856007801918930003301996946001102029990002302040655001202063IND4416960620221207073430.0090228e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441696062DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9372doi7 aPMC26473152pmcid7 a190429702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeweese, Joseph E.14aThe DNA cleavage reaction of topoisomerase II: wolf in sheep's clothing  ap. 738-748.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTopoisomerase II is an essential enzyme that is required for virtually every process that requires movement of DNA within the nucleus or the opening of the double helix. This enzyme helps to regulate DNA under- and overwinding and removes knots and tangles from the genetic material. In order to carry out its critical physiological functions, topoisomerase II generates transient double-stranded breaks in DNA. Consequently, while necessary for cell survival, the enzyme also has the capacity to fragment the genome. The DNA cleavage/ligation reaction of topoisomerase II is the target for some of the most successful anticancer drugs currently in clinical use. However, this same reaction also is believed to trigger chromosomal translocations that are associated with specific types of leukemia. This article will familiarize the reader with the DNA cleavage/ligation reaction of topoisomerase II and other aspects of its catalytic cycle. In addition, it will discuss the interaction of the enzyme with anticancer drugs and the mechanisms by which these agents increase levels of topoisomerase II-generated DNA strand breaks. Finally, it will describe dietary and environmental agents that enhance DNA cleavage mediated by the enzyme.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell viability 3achromosome translocation 3agenome 3aleukemia1 aOsheroff, Neil0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Feb., v. 37, no. 3 p.738-748x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9373Available from publisher's Web site  a20090228b20090301c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02824naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072001700151072001700168072001700185072001700202100001500219242014000234245014600374300001600520500002400536500001500560520129900575650002201874650002401896650002101920650001701941650002101958650001301979650002301992650001902015653001902034653001602053653002202069700001802091773007602109852000902185856009102194930003302285945002502318946001102343655001202354IND4376093120221122132633.0051117e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND437609312DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20050005000062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Thus, three experiments were performed: a) rearing and development of S. catenifer on pulp and seed of avocado cultivars Breda and Margarida; b) rearing and development of S. catenifer on artificial diet and seeds of cultivars Margarida and Breda; and c) adaptation of S. catenifer to the artificial diet for seven generations. Morphological and biometrical parameters were used to evaluate insect development on all experiments. Larval and pupal survival, fecundity and longevity (males and females) were higher in avocado seeds than pulp. So, nutrition-wise it was a more adequate substrate despite the longer larval stage as compared to that obtained from pulp. Likewise, larval duration and survival were higher in avocado seeds than in artificial diet with five instars regardless the rearing substrate. The artificial diet used for insect rearing for seven generations proved to be suitable since the biological and morphological parameters evaluated did not change throughout all generations studied. Therefore, it is possible to rear S. catenifer using natural and artificial diet through the approaches presented in this paper. 3ainsect morphology 3ainsect biochemistry 3aartificial diets 3aElachistidae 3aPersea americana 3aavocados 3ainsect development 3ainsect rearing 0ainsect biology 0aLepidoptera 0aStenoma catenifer1 aParra, J.R.P.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2005 , v. 34, no. 5 p.751-759x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20050005000063Available from publisher's Web site  a20060605b20060702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03298naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245013800185300001600323520161400339650001101953650001501964650001501979650000901994650001802003650001702021650001102038650002402049650001202073650003302085650002502118650001202143650002702155650005602182650001602238650001102254650000902265650002002274650001202294650002402306650002502330653002502355653001702380653002502397700002202422700001802444773013702462852000902599856009202608930003302700946001102733655001202744IND4440266720221122132552.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444026672DNAL7 a206461162pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2010.00853.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldi, F.10aRandom regression models on Legendre polynomials to estimate genetic parameters for weights from birth to adult age in Canchim cattle  ap. 289-299.  aThe objective of this work was to estimate covariance functions for direct and maternal genetic effects, animal and maternal permanent environmental effects, and subsequently, to derive relevant genetic parameters for growth traits in Canchim cattle. Data comprised 49 011 weight records on 2435 females from birth to adult age. The model of analysis included fixed effects of contemporary groups (year and month of birth and at weighing) and age of dam as quadratic covariable. Mean trends were taken into account by a cubic regression on orthogonal polynomials of animal age. Residual variances were allowed to vary and were modelled by a step function with 1, 4 or 11 classes based on animal's age. The model fitting four classes of residual variances was the best. A total of 12 random regression models from second to seventh order were used to model direct and maternal genetic effects, animal and maternal permanent environmental effects. The model with direct and maternal genetic effects, animal and maternal permanent environmental effects fitted by quadric, cubic, quintic and linear Legendre polynomials, respectively, was the most adequate to describe the covariance structure of the data. Estimates of direct and maternal heritability obtained by multi-trait (seven traits) and random regression models were very similar. Selection for higher weight at any age, especially after weaning, will produce an increase in mature cow weight. The possibility to modify the growth curve in Canchim cattle to obtain animals with rapid growth at early ages and moderate to low mature cow weight is limited. 3aadults 3aanimal age 3acovariance 3acows 3agrowth traits 3aheritability 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aweaning 2aAgingxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBirth Weightxgenetics 2aCattlexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aMothers 2aRegression Analysis 2aStochastic Processes 0acovariance functions 0agrowth curve 0aLegendre polynomials1 aAlbuquerque, L.G.1 aAlencar, M.M.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2010 Aug., v. 127, no. 4 p.289-299dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2010.00853.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01842naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245015300185300001600338520044000354650001600794650001200810650002000822650005500842650000900897650000900906650003600915650002900951650003400980650003501014653002101049653002101070700005401091700002301145773012601168852000901294856008501303930003301388946001101421655001201432IND4443176120221122102427.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444317612DNAL7 a212344592pmid7 a10.1007/s10517-010-0986-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArkhipov, S.

The problem is more serious in less developed countries in The Asia Pacific Region including Thailand. The losses also limit the productivity and competitiveness of developing countries in the global market. On the other hand demand for quality and safe agricultural produce is increasing due to increased population, improved standards of living as a result of high economic growth, and better education which increases consumer’s awareness of food quality and safety. The problem of postharvest losses and the need to ensure an increased and enduring supply of quality and safe agricultural produce are better addressed by developing a strong and solid human resource who can ably design, innovate, implement, and manage technological and non-technological interventions. A regional approach to human resource development (HRD) in postharvest technology is imperative in this era of market globalization. In Thailand, the postharvest technology course was established in Kasetsart University and Chiang Mai University for more than 30 years ago. After that this course has been expanded to many universities. The content of postharvest subjects and the curriculum depends on the policy of each university. The development of postgraduate education and research in close collaboration with industry is considered as an effective and optimum measure to address the various constraints and challenges in an interpreted manner. During 2000-2005, The Postgraduate Education Research Program in Postharvest Technology was implemented through a university consortium, with Chiang Mai University (CMU) as a leader and Kasetsart University (KU), Khon Kaen University (KKU) and King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) as members. Ultimately, a Postharvest Technology Center was created and supported by the university consortium members. The program aimed to produce postgraduate students, high quality and coordinated research, effective collaboration with industry, and transfer of postharvest technologies. During 2006-2009, the program was expanded with new members of Maejo University, Naresuan University, Prince of Songkla University, Suranaree University of Technology and Ubon Ratchathani University, emphasizing on increasing of Ph.D. students, more apparent research focus, and formation of postharvest technology research groups among academic/research staff of participation universities, in order to tackle the present and future national postharvest technology problems. The program name was changed to be “Postharvest Technology Innovation Center” (PHTIC), finally. Besides, the PHTIC also transfers postharvest technology to many sectors including growers, exporters and other private sectors. 3acrops 3acurriculum 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aeducational research 3aextension education 3afood quality 3aglobalization 3agrowers 3ahigher education 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3apopulation growth 3apostharvest losses 3apostharvest technology 3astudents 3atrade 3auniversities 3aThailand1 aWongs-Aree, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1011 p.35-40dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1011/1011_2.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02850naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009000166300001400256520177600270650001402046653001802060653000902078653000802087653004002095700001902135700001902154700002102173700001802194700002302212773012502235852000902360856008502369930003302454946001302487655001202500IND4447503720221122102431.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444750372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00418-010-0770-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUz, Yesim Hulya 10aIncreased c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation in human endometriotic endothelial cells  ap. 83-91.  aEndometriosis is a common inflammatory gynecological disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a subfamily of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) involved in cellular processes ranging from cytokine expression to apoptosis, and is activated in response to inflammation and cellular stress. We hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines in the peritoneal microenvironment increase JNK MAPK activity in endometriotic endothelial cells, and that human endometrial endothelial cells (HEECs) may be involved in inflammatory pathogenesis of endometriosis. Thus, we evaluated the expression of the total- and phosphorylated-(phospho)-JNK in endometrial and endometriotic endothelial cells in vivo, and in HEECs treated with normal peritoneal fluid (NPF), endometriotic peritoneal fluid (EPF), and the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in vitro. Phospho-JNK immunoreactivity in HEECs in normal endometrium was significantly higher in the early proliferative and late secretory phases compared to other phases. Both eutopic and ectopic HEECs from the early secretory phase also revealed higher phospho-JNK immunoreactivity, compared to their respective cycle-matched normal HEECs. Moreover, HEECs treated with EPF showed significantly higher phospho-JNK levels compared to that in HEECs treated with NPF. In conclusion, our in vivo and in vitro findings suggest that increased phosphorylation of JNK in HEECs from women with endometriosis is likely due to high level of IL-1β and TNF-α in peritoneal fluid; this in turn may up-regulate inflammatory cytokine expression and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. 3acytokines 0aEndometriosis 0aMAPK 0aJNK 0aHuman endometrial endothelial cells1 aMurk, William 1 aBozkurt, Idil 1 aKizilay, Gulnur 1 aArici, Aydin 1 aKayisli, Umit Ali 0 tHistochemistry and cell biology.g2011 Jan., v. 135, no. 1 p.83-91dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0948-61437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00418-010-0770-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02875naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072001700151072001700168072001700185100002300202242018500225245018100410300001600591500002400607520133000631650003301961650001601994650003002010650001602040650001602056650001702072650001602089650002302105650001602128650001602144650001302160651001102173773007602184852000902260856009102269930003302360945002502393946001102418655001202429IND4376095620221122102432.0051117e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND437609562DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20050005000122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Pre-release evaluation of the parasitoid complex is important because the releases initiate a continuous and irreversible colonization process. Surveys of native fruit fly parasitoids were conducted in the region of the Reconcavo Baiano, in Conceicao do Almeida, BA, Brazil. Surveys were undertaken before and after the release of the exotic braconid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead). Pre-release survey showed that the following species were present in the study area: Doryctobracon areolatus (Szepligeti), Utetes anastrephae (Viereck), Opius spp., Asobara anastrephae (Muesebeck) and Aganaspis pelleranoi (Brethes). Following D. longicaudata releases, the same species were obtained. Despite of interspecific competition for oviposition sites, no biodiversity losses were observed. Notwithstanding, an alteration in the relative frequencies of native species was observed. The exotic parasitoid was recovered from infested fruits of carambola, guava and Spondia sp. 17 months after the releases ceased. Nevertheless, in 2004 and 2005, no individuals of D. longicaudata were recovered from infested fruit samples collected in the same locality of release. 3aDiachasmimorpha longicaudata 3aparasitoids 3abiological control agents 3aTephritidae 3afruit flies 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3abiological control 3afruit trees 3ahost plants 3aorchards 3aBrazil0 tNeotropical entomology.g2005 , v. 34, no. 5 p.799-805x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20050005000123Available from publisher's Web site  a20060605b20060702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01826naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245008700171300001600258520087100274650001501145653002701160653002801187653002801215653001401243700002101257773010801278852000901386856008501395930003301480946001101513655001201524IND4441868720221122063152.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444186872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9518-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuntohar, Agus Setyo 10aRainfall infiltration: infinite slope model for landslides triggering by rainstorm  ap. 967-984.  aShallow slope failure due to heavy rainfall during rainstorm and typhoon is common in mountain areas. Among the models used for analyzing the slope stability, the rainwater infiltration model integrated with slope stability model can be an effective way to evaluate the stability of slopes during rainstorm. This paper will propose an integrated Green-Ampt infiltration model and infinite slope stability model for the analysis of shallow type slope failure. To verify the suitability of the proposed model, seven landslide cases occurred in Italy and Hong Kong are adopted in this paper. The results indicate that the proposed model can be used to distinguish failed and not-yet failed slopes. In addition, the proposed model can be used as the first approximation for estimating the occurrence time of a rainfall-induced shallow landslide and its depth of sliding. 3alandslides 0aRainwater infiltration 0aInfinite slope analysis 0aGreen-Ampt infiltration 0aRainstorm1 aLiao, Hung-Jiun 0 tNatural hazards.g2010 Sept., v. 54, no. 3 p.967-984dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9518-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100827b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02470naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245011300180300001600293500002400309520134500333650002301678650001501701650002401716650000901740650001401749650001801763650001401781650002301795650002301818650001001841650001201851700001501863700001601878700001601894773011001910852000902020856005502029655001202084IND4406421920221122063130.0080606e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440642192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2008.00157.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo, R.

However, consumers in developed countries mainly choose beans for their sensory qualities, especially for their texture. This article describes the constitution, training and validation of a panel of judges to evaluate the texture of dry beans. The judges were trained in the perception of different textures, analyzed a wide range of beans and selected seed-coat roughness, seed-coat perceptibility and creaminess/mealiness of the cotyledon as the main attributes to be scored. After training, the panel was capable of discriminating between different varieties of beans and even between beans of the same variety grown at different locations. The analysis of the behavior of the panel in a standard tasting session 2 years after its formation showed that periodic inclusion of samples from the extremes of the scales for the attributes during tasting sessions was sufficient to keep the panel trained. This article could serve as a guide for the training of sensory panels to evaluate the texture of dry beans. It describes the selection of the attributes on which the analysis is based, references for the extreme values of the attributes and how to train the panel. It also provides a practical example of the analysis of the behavior of the panel some time after training. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3acotyledons 3adeveloped countries 3adiet 3adry beans 3anormal values 3aroughness 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ataste 3atexture1 aValero, J.1 aCasanas, F.1 aCostell, E.0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2008 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.303-319dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2008.00157.x 7aarticle02209naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245008700176300001800263520094900281650001901230650001901249650002001268650001801288650002101306650001701327653002501344653001901369653001301388653001401401653002601415653002901441653002201470653001701492700001601509773013601525852000901661856008501670930003301755946001101788655001201799IND4448613120221122043943.0110128e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444861312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-4559-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoontornworajit, Boonchoy 10aNucleic acid aptamers for clinical diagnosis: cell detection and molecular imaging  ap. 1591-1599.  aNucleic acid aptamers have recently attracted significant attention in the field of clinical diagnosis because they have numerous merits, such as high affinity, high specificity, small size, little immunogenicity, stable structures, and ease of synthesis. This review focuses on discussing the potential applications of aptamers in cell detection and molecular imaging. For the ex vivo cell detection, this review discusses the status of five strategies: endogenous nucleic acid analysis, flow cytometry analysis, nanoparticle-based cell sensing, microfluidic cell separation, and histological examination. This review also discusses in vivo molecular and cell imaging by introducing aptamer-based molecular imaging, cell imaging, and integrated imaging and therapy. On the basis of the status of these promising studies, this review summarizes several challenging issues and unmet needs that may require more effort or attention in the future. 3aflow cytometry 3aimage analysis 3aimmune response 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides 3atherapeutics 0aNucleic acid aptamer 0aAntibody mimic 0aAntibody 0aDendrimer 0aMolecular recognition 0aUltrasensitive detection 0aMolecular imaging 0aCell imaging1 aWang, Yong 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2011 Feb., v. 399, no. 4 p.1591-1599dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-4559-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110128b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01997naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245014500168300001800313520082700331650001401158650001401172650001101186650001301197650001801210650001901228650001201247650002401259650001101283650001201294653001901306653002001325700002501345773010301370852000901473856008501482930003301567946001101600655001201611IND4444059220221122043941.0101022e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444405922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-010-9435-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Ana Gisela 10aTurning polysaccharides into hydrophobic materials: a critical review.

(Hemiptera: Aphididae) was evaluated. Plants were treated with silicon incorporated to the soil and by foliar spraying. Aphid development was evaluated by observing the duration of the pre-reproductive, reproductive and post-reproductive periods, as well as fecundity and longevity. Probing behaviour was investigated by using the DC electrical penetration graphs (EPG) technique and a "honeydew clock". Silica treated plants had a clear adverse effect on aphid development. Stylet penetration was not affected by treatments showing no physical barriers by the plant tissue. However, stylet was withdrawn more often on plants treated with silica, resulting in reduction of probing time. Sieve elements were reached equally by aphids in all treatments and the insects remained ingesting phloem sap for similar periods. However, honeydew excretion was highly reduced indicating lower sap ingestion rate or higher sap retention inside the body. Chemical changes and induced resistance are possibly related to the reduction of aphid performance. 3ainsect pests 3asilicon 3aSchizaphis graminum 3aplant pests 3awheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3ainsect development 3aplant protection 0ainsect biology1 aPrado, E.1 aMoraes, J.C.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2005 , v. 34, no. 5 p.807-813x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20050005000133Available from publisher's Web site  a20060605b20060702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/06/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02170naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245012400158300001600282520086100298650001601159650001701175650002001192650002601212650002601238650001301264650000901277650002101286653003301307653002801340653002701368653002701395653003001422700001901452700001701471700001401488700001201502700001501514773010201529852000901631856008501640946001101725655001201736IND4440664820221122033412.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444066482DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-010-1640-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu 10aIon-pair LC-UV Method for the Determination of Boanmycin in Mouse Plasma and Its Application to a Pharmacokinetic Study  ap. 357-359.  aAn ion-pair LC-UV detection assay was developed for the determination of boanmycin (BAM) in mouse plasma. The mobile phase contained methanol, acetonitrile, 0.055 M sodium hexanesulfonate and 0.08 M acetic acid in water, with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min⁻¹. This assay involved a rapid and simple extraction process and subsequent detection at 291 nm. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.04 and 0.09 μg mL⁻¹, respectively. Using bleomycin (BLM A₅) as the internal standard, the assay was linear over the concentration range from 0.1 to 30 μg mL⁻¹ (r ² > 0.99). The extraction recovery of BAM in mouse plasma was >66.5%, and the intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision were ≤7.5%. The assay was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study after intravenous injection of BAM (40 mg kg⁻¹) to mice. 3aacetic acid 3aacetonitrile 3adetection limit 3aintravenous injection 3aliquid chromatography 3amethanol 3amice 3apharmacokinetics 0aColumn liquid chromatography 0aIon-pair chromatography 0aPharmacokinetics study 0aSodium hexanesulfonate 0aBoanmycin in mouse plasma1 aYoo, Sun Dong 1 aFang, Liang 1 aJin, Xin 1 aLi, Li 1 aLi, Tiefu 0 tChromatographia.g2010 Aug., v. 72, no. 3-4 p.357-359dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-010-1640-83Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01693naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245006900173300001600242520071200258650001300970650001700983650001101000650002901011650001901040650001201059653001701071653002301088773010901111852000901220856009201229930003301321946001301354655001201367IND4442182020221122020513.0100910e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444218202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2010.00694.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhazoul, Jaboury10aDiamonds or Dragonflies?

As a society, Nature is grossly undervalued relative to other commodities and priorities despite its integral and central role in our psyche and culture. The increasing dissociation of humans from nature, physically, intellectually and culturally, threatens the conservation ethic and all our efforts at conserving Nature in the long term, for human benefit or for its own sake. We need to reverse the increasing human isolation from the natural environment by encouraging our children and the wider public to engage with Nature.

The ∑₁₆PAHs concentrations [ng/(sample·day)] were high at urban sites (315 ± 206), followed by rural sites (222 ± 160), suburban site (142 ± 114) and background site (128 ± 107). The urban fractionation effect was observed along the transect with increasing proportions for low molecular weight PAHs and decreasing proportions for high molecular weight PAHs. PAHs were found to be higher in winter and spring than in summer and autumn, most likely due to the combustion of coal and biomass for domestic heating. Sources of PAHs were investigated by principal component analysis in combination with diagnostic ratios, which both indicated that pyrogenic sources were the main sources of PAHs in the air of Harbin, China. 3aair 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acoal 3acombustion 3afoams 3afractionation 3aheat 3amolecular weight 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolyurethanes 3aprincipal component analysis 3asamplers 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3aurban areas 3awinter 3aChina 0aPAHs 0aPassive air sampler 0aSpatial and seasonal variations1 aQi, Hong 1 aLi, Yi-fan 1 aLiu, Li-yan 1 aSun, De-zhi 1 aWang, De-gao 1 aZhang, Zhi 1 aTian, Chong-guo 1 aShen, Ji-min 0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2011 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.43-49dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-010-0169-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20110108b20110205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02682naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245012000185300001600305520101200321650001201333650001201345650001301357650001101370650001401381650000901395650001101404650001101415650001601426650001501442650001201457650001501469650000901484650002901493650002701522650002801549650002001577650002401597650002101621650004101642650005901683651001401742651002001756653001901776653001901795653001201814700001801826773013401844852000901978856008501987930003302072946001102105655001202116IND4442072120221122020741.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444207212DNAL7 a198598222pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-009-1195-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirch, Gavin F. 10aStormwater metal loading to a well-mixed/stratified estuary (Sydney Estuary, Australia) and management implications  ap. 531-551.  aStormwater modelling indicated an average annual discharge from Sydney estuary catchment of 215,300 mL and loadings of 0.8, 0.5, 1.7, 3.2, 1.1, 3.6 and 17.7 tonnes for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively. Priority for remediation should be given to creeks with high-metal loads in the upper and central estuary, as well as discharging to the western shores of Middle Harbour. Managerial strategies need to target dissolved and particulate metal phases to ensure effective remediation. The proportion of metals discharged under low- (<5 mm rainfall/day), medium- (>5 to <50 mm/day) and high-flow conditions (>50 mm/day) was approximately 10%, 60% and 30% of total loading, respectively. Under high-flow conditions the estuary becomes stratified and most metals are exported to the sea, whereas metals discharged during low-flow may be remediated by infiltration. Effective remediation will depend on the extent to which ‘first-flush' metals associated with medium-flow conditions can be remediated. 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aestuaries 3alead 3amodels 3anickel 3aremediation 3astormwater 3astreams 3awatersheds 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRainxchemistry 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aWaste Management 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aAustralia 0aNew South Wales 0aSydney estuary 0aStratification 0aLoading1 aRochford, L. 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2010 Oct., v. 169, no. 1-4 p.531-551dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-009-1195-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02287naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008500126300001800211520130400229650002201533650000901555650001101564650000901575650001201584650001801596650001801614650002001632650001001652650002601662650001701688650003701705700001701742700001701759773008201776852000901858939003301867946001301900655001201913IND9300098320221122020245.0930108s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930009832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKastori, R.10aEffect of excess lead, cadmium, copper, and zinc on water relations in sunflower  ap. 2427-2439.  aThe effect of excess concentrations of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) on water relations in young sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants was studied in water culture under greenhouse conditions. The accumulation of the heavy metals was-more intensive in the root than in the shoot. The rates of heavy metal accumulation in root were arranged in the following decreasing order: Cu, Cd, Zn, and Pb. Their transport into the above-ground parts followed the order: Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd. Transpiration and relative water content were significantly decreased by excess concentrations of the heavy metals. The number of stomata per unit leaf area was increased while the size of the stomata was decreased. The concentration of free proline significantly increased in the leaves of intact plants as well as in leaf discs incubated in the presence of heavy metals. The concentration of soluble proteins decreased as well, particularly when plants were exposed to high concentrations of the heavy metals. It was concluded that excess concentrations of the heavy metals significantly affected plant water status, causing water deficit and subsequent changes in the plants. The most intensive effect on the plants was exerted by Cd, less intensive by Cu and Zn and the least intensive by Pb. 3aHelianthus annuus 3alead 3acopper 3azinc 3acadmium 3aphytotoxicity 3aion transport 3amineral content 3aroots 3aplant-water relations 3awater stress 3atranslocation (plant physiology)1 aPetrovic, M.1 aPetrovic, N.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1992, v. 15, no. 11 p.2427-2439x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03038naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013900163300001600302520188700318650002802205650001402233653003102247653003002278653001702308653002202325700002302347700002102370700001602391700001802407773012502425852000902550856008502559930003302644946001102677655001202688IND4444346720221121230419.0101029e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444434672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10654-010-9499-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniel, Mark 10aAssociation of fast-food restaurant and fruit and vegetable store densities with cardiovascular mortality in a metropolitan population  ap. 711-719.  aMost studies that link neighbourhoods to disease outcomes have represented neighbourhoods as area-level socioeconomic status. Where objective contextual attributes of urban environments have been measured, few studies of food availability have evaluated mortality as an outcome. We sought to estimate associations between the availability of fast-food restaurants (FFR), fruit and vegetable stores (FVS), and cardiovascular mortality in an urban area. Food business data were extracted from a validated commercial database containing all businesses and services in the Montréal Census Metropolitan Area (MCMA). Mortality data (1999-2003) were obtained for the MCMA (3.4 million residents). Directly standardised mortality rates for cardiovascular deaths (n = 30,388) and non-cardiovascular deaths (all causes − cardiovascular deaths) (n = 91,132) and FFR and FVS densities (n/km²) were analysed for 845 census tracts. Generalised additive models and generalised linear models were used to analyse food source-mortality relationships. FVS density was not associated with cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular mortality (relative risk (RR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76, 1.36, and RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.50, respectively). Higher FFR density was associated with mortality in bivariate and multivariable analyses. Relative risks of death (95% CI) per 10% increase in FFR density were similar for both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality: 1.39 (1.19, 1.63) and 1.36 (1.18, 1.57), respectively, accounting for socio-demographic covariates. FFR density is associated with cardiovascular mortality but this relationship is no different in magnitude than that for non-cardiovascular mortality. These results together with null associations between FVS density and mortality do not support a major role for food source availability in cardiovascular outcomes. 3acardiovascular diseases 3amortality 0aEpidemiologic measurements 0aResidence characteristics 0aUrban health 0aFood environments1 aPaquet, Catherine 1 aAuger, Nathalie 1 aZang, Geng 1 aKestens, Yan 0 tEuropean journal of epidemiology.g2010 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.711-719dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0393-29907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10654-010-9499-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20101029b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02628naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001900168245009600187300001600283500002400299500001500323520104200338650001801380650002301398650002301421650001901444650001301463650001901476650001701495650001501512650001901527650001301546650003301559650001601592650001301608650002201621650002401643650001701667650002701684653001101711700001701722700003101739700003601770773011201806852000901918856009001927930003302017945002502050946001102075655001202086IND4429443420221121220826.0091130e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2009.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ400 0aX1001 aSzumny, Antoni10aComposition of rosemary essential oil (Rosmarinus officinalis) as affected by drying method  ap. 253-260.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of the drying method on volatile compounds of Rosmarinus officinalis was evaluated. The drying methods tested were convective (CD) and vacuum-microwave (VMD), as well as a combination of convective pre-drying and VM finish-drying (CPD-VMFD). Rosemary drying kinetics was described by a simple exponential model for CD and VMD, while VMFD kinetics consisted of two periods: linear until a critical point and exponential beyond that point. Volatile compounds of rosemary samples were extracted by steam-hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. Thirty-four compounds were tentatively identified, with α-pinene, bornyl acetate, camphene and 1,8-cineole being the major components. The total volatiles concentration of fresh rosemary (135gkg⁻¹) decreased considerably during both CD (87.2gkg⁻¹) and VMD (61.9gkg⁻¹). CPD-VMFD was the best option for drying rosemary because the time required was relatively short (30min), and the aroma quality was good according to both instrumental (100gkg⁻¹) and sensory analyses. 3avacuum drying 3avolatile compounds 3asensory evaluation 3aessential oils 3akinetics 3aplant extracts 3aalpha-pinene 3aflavorings 3adrying quality 3arosemary 3ascanning electron microscopy 3adried herbs 3asteaming 3aconvection dryers 3amicrowave treatment 3adistillation 3aRosmarinus officinalis 0adrying1 aFigiel, Adam1 aGutiérrez-Ortíz, Antonio1 aCarbonell-Barrachina, Ángel A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2010 Mar., v. 97, no. 2 p.253-260dElsevier Science Pub.

The dilution technique and simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE), using Likens-Nickerson apparatus, were two techniques used to isolate volatiles from lime oil sample in this project. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was involved in identification and quantitation of the volatile constituents. The results obtained show that the amount of limonene is the highest amongst all volatiles extracted, thus it is the major volatile component. The other major components of lime oil were β-pinene, γ-terpinene, neral, α-pinene and sabinene. This results obtained suggest that SDE technique leads to poor recovery of polar and water-soluble , low boiling point compounds such as monoterpenes (limonene, β-pinene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, myrecene) and oxygenated monoterpenes (nerol, neral, geranial, 4-terpineol, α-terpineol) compared to the dilution technique. The direct temperature exposure associated with SDE leads to some changes in aroma profile of lime oil. These changes may be due to losses of volatiles and formation of new volatile compounds. Thermal degradation and interaction of reactive compounds may occur, leading to artefact formation. Some losses occur among low-boiling volatile compounds such as (bergaptene) during concentration steps. 3aCitrus 3aalpha-pinene 3aalpha-terpineol 3abergapten 3abeta-pinene 3aboiling point 3adistillation 3agamma-terpinene 3agas chromatography 3ageranial 3aimmune system 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aneral 3anerol 3aodors 3aoils 3asabinene 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3avolatile compounds1 aSrzednicki, G.1 aCraske, J.D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1011 p.55-62dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1011/1011_5.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01728naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001900149245004800168300001800216520038400234650002800618650001800646650002100664650001200685650001300697650001200710650002600722650002400748650001300772650002500785650005000810650003500860650002900895650001300924650005500937700001500992700001701007700002001024700001701044700001801061773009901079852000901178930003301187945001301220946001301233655001201246IND2205521820221121183049.0000629e199911  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220552182DNAL7 a105438332pmid7 aPMC916912pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNetherwood, T.10aGene transfer in the gastrointestinal tract  ap. 5139-5141.  aThe maximum in vivo transfer rate of plasmid pAMbeta1 in the gut was 0.03 transconjugant per recipient cell, and this rate could be simulated in vitro only by forced filter mating.

We studied the seasonal trends in plant water status and hydraulic properties in a natural stand of Eucalyptus gomphocephala through cycles of varying environmental moisture (rainfall, groundwater depth, evaporative demand) in order to test for isohydry and to provide physiological information for the mechanistic interpretation of seasonal trends in plant water status. Over a 16 month period of monitoring, spanning two summers, midday leaf water potential (Ψleaf) correlated with predawn Ψleaf, which was correlated with water table depth below ground level, which in turn was correlated with total monthly rainfall. Eucalyptus gomphocephala was therefore not seasonally isohydric. Despite strong stomatal down-regulation of transpiration rate in response to increasing evaporative demand, this was insufficient to prevent midday Ψleaf from falling to levels below -2 MPa in the driest month, well into the region likely to induce xylem air embolisms, based on xylem vulnerability curves obtained in the study. However, even though midday Ψleaf varied by over 1.2 MPa across seasons, the hydrodynamic (transpiration-induced) water potential gradient from roots to shoots (ΔΨplant), measured as the difference between predawn and midday Ψleaf, was relatively constant across seasons, averaging 0.67 MPa. This unusual pattern of hydraulic regulation, referred to here as isohydrodynamic, is explained by a hydromechanical stomatal control model where plant hydraulic conductance is dependent on transpiration rate. 3aEucalyptus 3aair 3agreenhouses 3aleaf water potential 3amodels 3amonitoring 3arain 3aroots 3ashoots 3atranspiration 3awater table 3axylem 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aSeasons 2aWaterxmetabolism 2aXylemxmetabolism1 aDRAKE, PAUL L.1 aFROEND, RAY H.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2007 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.19-30dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01600.x 7aarticle02359naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008900175300001800264500002400282520132900306650001101635650002301646650001401669650002401683650002501707650002301732650002301755650001401778650001001792700001901802700002001821773010401841852000901945856005501954655001202009IND4445685720221121183050.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444568572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01739.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrdonez, Alejandro10aFunctional differences between native and alien species: a global‐scale comparison  ap. 1353-1361.  aIncludes references  a1. A prevalent question in the study of plant invasions has been whether or not invasions can be explained on the basis of traits. Despite many attempts, a synthetic view of multi‐trait differences between alien and native species is not yet available. 2. We compiled a database of three ecologically important traits (specific leaf area, typical maximum canopy height, individual seed mass) for 4473 species sampled over 95 communities (3784 species measured in their native range, 689 species in their introduced range, 207 in both ranges). 3. Considering each trait separately, co‐occurring native and alien species significantly differed in their traits. These differences, although modest, were expressed in a combined 15% higher specific leaf area, 16% lower canopy height and 26% smaller seeds. 4. Using three novel multi‐trait metrics of functional diversity, aliens showed significantly smaller trait ranges, larger divergences and a consistent differentiation from the median trait combination of co‐occurring natives. 5. We conclude that the simultaneous evaluation of multiple traits is an important novel direction in understanding invasion success. Our results support the phenotypic divergence hypothesis that predicts functional trait differences contribute to the success of alien species. 3acanopy 3acolonizing ability 3adatabases 3aecological invasion 3afunctional diversity 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aleaf area 3aseeds1 aWright, Ian J.1 aOlff, H.q(Han)0 tFunctional ecology.g2010 Dec., v. 24, no. 6 p.1353-1361dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01739.x 7aarticle02878naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001600146245009300162300001800255500002400273520155200297650002301849650001101872650001001883650001201893650002701905650000901932650001801941650002301959650002401982650002602006650002302032700002502055700001802080700001602098700003002114773013302144852000902277856007702286930003302363945002502396946001102421655001202432IND4425842120221121183103.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442584212DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.37062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aAwati, Ajay10aEndogenous lysine in ileal digesta in the growing rat determined using different methods  ap. 2200-2206.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Endogenous lysine in ileal digesta has been determined directly using highly digestible proteins and hydrolysates and assuming a complete absorption of dietary amino acids. In this study, the endogenous lysine in the ileal digesta of rats fed casein was determined using the guanidination method (baseline) and directly (assuming complete digestion and absorption) for casein and a highly hydrolysed casein. The peptide alimentation/ultrafiltration technique was also used to determine the endogenous ileal lysine for the casein hydrolysate (Peptopro®).RESULTS: Mean endogenous ileal lysine for rats given the unguanidinated casein and determined directly assuming complete digestion and absorption (644 mg kg⁻¹ dry matter intake (DMI)) or for a highly hydrolysed casein with the same assumption (596 mg kg⁻¹ DMI) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the endogenous ileal lysine for casein determined using the guanidination method (274 mg kg⁻¹ DMI). The endogenous lysine in ileal digesta for a casein hydrolysate determined using the alimentation/ultrafiltration method (302 mg kg⁻¹ DMI) was not significantly (P < 0.05) different from that based on the guanidination method but was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the equivalent endogenous lysine determined directly.CONCLUSION: Dietary amino acids are not completely absorbed from casein or its hydrolysate and determining endogenous amino acids in ileal digesta directly, assuming complete absorption, overestimates the amount of endogenous ileal amino acids. 3aendogenous sources 3alysine 3aileum 3adigesta 3agrowth and development 3arats 3aanimal models 3aexperimental diets 3acasein hydrolysates 3aintestinal absorption 3anutrition research1 aRutherfurd, Shane M.1 aKies, Arie K.1 aVeyry, Aude1 aMoughan, P.

Food, urine, and fecal composites were collected during the last 8 d of each feeding period. Bowel transit time was not significantly affected; however, total dry fecal weight was significantly increased after the refined fibers compared with that after the basal diet. Adding refined fibers to the basal diet did not significantly affect apparent mineral balance of calcium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, or zinc, with the exception of a negative mineral balance for manganese with carboxymethylcellulose. Karaya gum had a mean positive balance for all minerals tested. These results indicate that the hypocholesterolemic effect of the fibers that form gels occurs without compromising mineral balance in those subjects consuming Recommended Dietary Allowance levels of the minerals studied.(author) 3amanganese 3abalance studies 3adiet 3anutritional status 3amen 3acopper 3azinc 3acalcium 3airon 3acellulose 3amagnesium 2aAdult 2aCarboxymethylcellulose Sodiumxpharmacology 2aCellulosexpharmacology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEnergy Intake 2aGalactans 2aHumans 2aKaraya Gumxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMannans 2aMiddle Aged 2aMineralsxmetabolism 2aPlant Gums 2aPolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 0agums1 aScholfield, D.J.1 aLee, K.1 aPowell, A.S.1 aMoser, P.B.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1987 Aug., v. 46, no. 2 p.307-314x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880418c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245010800203300001600311500002800327520186700355650001302222653001402235653000902249653001502258700001602273700001502289700001402304700001602318700001502334700002002349773010702369852000902476856008502485946001102570655001202581IND4416972920221121144806.0090228s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441697292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-009-1260-82doi7 aPMC43361532pmcid7 a191839382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikugawa, R.10aDifferentiation of COPAS-sorted non-endocrine pancreatic cells into insulin-positive cells in the mouse  ap. 645-652.  aPublisher supplied data  aAims/hypothesis The regenerative process in the pancreas is of particular interest, since insulin-producing beta cells are lost in diabetes. Differentiation of new beta cells from pancreatic non-endocrine cells has been reported in vivo and in vitro, a finding that implies the existence of pancreatic stem/progenitor cells. However, while tissue-specific stem cells are well documented in skin, intestine and testis, pancreatic stem cells have been elusive. We hypothesised that pancreatic stem/progenitor cells within the non-endocrine fraction could be a source of new islets in vitro. Methods To test if there were such cells within the pancreas, we generated pancreatic cell aggregates from tissue remaining after islet isolation from mouse insulin promoter 1-green fluorescent protein (MIP-GFP) mice. To eliminate any contamination of insulin-positive cells, we deleted all GFP-positive aggregates using COPAS Select and cultured with Matrigel. Immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR and single-cell nested RT-PCR were performed to confirm formation of insulin-producing cells. Results The GFP-negative cells were expanded as monolayers and then differentiated into three-dimensional cystic structures. After 1 week of culture, GFP-positive cells were found as clusters or single cells. By quantitative real-time PCR, no insulin mRNA was detected immediately after COPAS sorting, but after differentiation insulin mRNA of the whole preparation was 1.91 ± 0.31% that of purified MIP-GFP beta cells. All GFP-positive cells expressed insulin 1; most expressed insulin 2, pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 and cytokeratin 19 by single cell nested RT-PCR. Conclusions/interpretation Our data support the concept that within the exocrine (acinar and ductal) pancreas of the adult mouse there are cells that can give rise to insulin-positive cells in vitro. 3apancreas 0aBeta cell 0aDuct 0aNeogenesis1 aKatsuta, H.1 aAkashi, T.1 aYatoh, S.1 aWeir, G.

We have therefore investigated: (1) whether sRAGE is associated with greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and microvascular complications in type 1 diabetic individuals; and (2) the extent to which any such associations are explained by markers of endothelial and renal dysfunction and inflammation. Methods The study included 477 individuals (234 women; mean age 42 ± 10 [SD] years) from the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study. We used linear regression analyses to investigate the differences in sRAGE levels between individuals with and without vascular complications. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, HbA₁c, duration of diabetes and other risk factors. Results Individuals with CVD (n = 116) had higher levels of sRAGE than those without CVD or any microvascular complications (n = 178): β = 0.15 (95% CI 0.04-0.27). Further adjustments for markers of endothelial (β = 0.13 [0.02-0.24]) and renal dysfunction (β = 0.10 [-0.01, 0.20]) and inflammation (β = 0.12 [0.01-0.23]) attenuated these differences; altogether these variables explained about 50% of the association between sRAGE and prevalent CVD. sRAGE levels tended to be higher in the presence and across the levels of severity of albuminuria (p for trend = 0.087) and retinopathy (p for trend = 0.057); adjustments for endothelial and renal dysfunction and inflammation also attenuated these differences. Conclusions/interpretation sRAGE is associated with greater prevalence of CVD in type 1 diabetic individuals, and these associations may be partly explained by endothelial and renal dysfunction and low-grade inflammation. 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiabetes mellitus 3ainflammation 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xblood 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxblood 2aEndothelium, Vascularxphysiopathology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInflammationxphysiopathology 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aKidneyxphysiopathology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMulticenter Studies as Topic 2aReceptors, Immunologicxblood 2aRisk Factors 2aYoung Adult 0aEndothelial dysfunction 0aMicrovascular complications 0aRenal dysfunction 0aSoluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products1 aFerreira, I. 1 aSchalkwijk, C.

Olsen, M. Collins, and W. Rice, Can. J. Microbiol. 38:506-509, 1992; P. Olsen, S. Wright, M. Collins, and W. Rice, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60:654-661, 1994). The nature of the antigens (i.e., the MAb epitopes), however, were not determined in those studies. For this report, the epitopes for five of the anti-S. meliloti MAbs were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-immunoblot analyses of the polysaccharides extracted from S. meliloti and Sinorhizobium fredii. This showed that the strain-specific MAbs recognized K antigens, whereas the strain-cross-reactive MAbs recognized the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core. The MAbs were then used in the analysis of the LPS and K antigens extracted from S. meliloti bacteroids, which had been recovered from the root nodules of alfalfa, and the results supported the findings of Olsen et al. The size range of the K antigens from bacteroids of S. meliloti NRG247 on polyacrylamide gels was altered, and the epitope was greatly diminished in abundance compared to those from the cultured cells, and no K antigens were detected in the S. meliloti NRG185 bacteroid extract. In contrast to the K antigens, the LPS core appeared to be similar in both cultured cells and bacteroids, although a higher proportion of the LPS fractionated into the organic phase during the phenol-water extraction of the bacteroid polysaccharides. Importantly, immunoblot analysis with an anti-LPS MAb showed that smooth LPS production was modified in the bacteroids. 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aSinorhizobium fredii 3aalfalfa 3acultured cells 3aendophytes 3aepitopes 3agels 3alipopolysaccharides 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolyacrylamide 3aroot nodules 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aAntigens, Bacterialxanalysisximmunology. 2aAntigens, Surfacexanalysisximmunology. 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCross Reactions 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aEpitopesxanalysis 2aLipopolysaccharidesxanalysisximmunology. 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSinorhizobium melilotixclassificationximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aSoil Microbiology 0aChina 0aNorth America1 aStephens, S.B.1 aGeller, D.P.1 aKim, J.S.1 aGlenn, J.1 aPrzytycki, J.1 aOjanen-Reuhs, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Nov., v. 65, no. 11 p.5186-5191x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02156naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012000164300001600284520088100300650001601181650000901197650001801206650001201224650001301236650001101249650001001260650001401270650001001284650002001294650001201314650000901326653002801335653002401363653002001387700002501407700002201432773013001454852000901584856008501593930003301678946001101711655001201722IND4441646120221121115148.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444164612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-009-9136-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKujawa, Roman 14aThe effect of tannin concentration and egg unsticking time on the hatching success of tench Tinca tinca (L.) larvae  ap. 339-343.  aThe influence of dose and time of eggs exposure in tannin solution on tench embryonic development, survival of embryos and percentage of larvae hatched were studied.

II  ap. 2471-2490.  aFoliar wilting, epinasty, abscission, chlorosis, and necrosis are common symptoms in plants affected by water and salinity stresses. Ethylene evolution and ammonium accumulation frequently accompany the expression of the symptoms of stresses from various origins. These symptoms and physiological phenomena have been associated with other environmental stresses, such as ammonium toxicity. Intact and excised tomato plants Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.'Heinz 1350' and neglecta-1) were subjected to stresses of waterlogging, water-deficit, or saline conditions (NaCl or CaCl2). In soil culture in the greenhouse, tomato plants subjected to waterlogging developed epinasty and chlorosis and had increased ethylene evolution and ammonium accumulation. The application of aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) ameliorated the symptoms and reduced ethylene evolution and ammonium accumulation. Tomato subjected to drought developed chlorosis and had enhanced ammonium accumulation, but no increased ethylene evolution was observed. The chlorotic and necrotic symptoms were observed for plants receiving NaCl or CaCl2. Application of ammonium nutrition or water stress aggravated the development of toxic symptoms. Ammonium accumulation and ethylene evolution were enhanced with intact plants or excised seedlings under these stresses. Application of AOA through stems of excised seedlings suppressed the enhancement. 'Heinz 1350' receiving CaCl2 accumulated more Ca++ and had higher ethylene evolution than those receiving NaCl or the neglecta-1 receiving CaCl2. Neglecta-1 accumulated more Na with the NaCl treatment and had higher ethylene evolution than 'Heinz 1350'. The results indicate that environmental stresses stimulate ammonium accumulation and initiate ethylene evolution, which may function in development of stress induced symptoms. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3awater stress 3achlorosis 3anecrosis 3anitrogen content 3aethylene production 3aphytotoxicity 3acalcium chloride 3aflooded conditions 3aammonium compounds 0awater deficit 0astress1 aBarker, A.V.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1992, v. 15, no. 11 p.2471-2490x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02817naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002300155245010100178300001800279500002400297520135700321650002101678650001101699650001001710650000901720650002701729650001101756650002001767650002301787650002001810650001701830650001801847650001801865650001801883650002001901650001801921650002001939653001401959700002601973700002401999773013302023852000902156856007702165930003302242945002502275946001102300655001202311IND4425842620221121115112.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442584262DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.37132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aThacker, Philip A.10aComparison of normal and low-lignin hull/high-oil groat oat as energy sources for broiler chicks  ap. 2236-2242.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Oats are not widely utilised in poultry rations. The principal reason for this is their high fibre content. Fibre is not very digestible by poultry and its presence impairs the digestibility of energy and other nutrients. A new low-lignin hull/high-oil groat (LLH/HOG) oat was developed recently and the present study was conducted to determine its nutritional value for poultry.RESULTS: In experiment 1, gain of broiler chicks fed the control was higher (P < 0.01) than that of birds fed normal oat. Gain and intake of birds fed LLH/HOG oat were superior (P < 0.01) to those of birds fed normal oat. Feed conversion (FC) was higher for birds fed the control than for birds fed normal oat (P < 0.01), while FC for birds fed the control and LLH/HOG oat did not differ (P > 0.05). FC was better for birds fed LLH/HOG than for birds fed normal oat (P < 0.01). In experiment 2, weight gain (P < 0.01), feed intake (P < 0.01) and FC (P = 0.07) declined as the level of LLH/HOG oat in the diet increased.CONCLUSION: Feeding LLH/HOG oat to broilers improved weight gain and FC compared with feeding normal oat. These results give a strong indication that LLH/HOG oat is superior to normal oat as an energy source for poultry. However, despite improvements in chemical composition, LLH/HOG oat is still inferior to wheat for use in broiler rations. 3abroiler chickens 3alignin 3ahulls 3aoats 3adietary energy sources 3achicks 3abroiler feeding 3aexperimental diets 3aliveweight gain 3aAvena sativa 3afiber content 3adietary fiber 3adigestibility 3anutritive value 3aanimal growth 3afeed conversion 0agroat oat1 aWidyaratne, Gemunu P.1 aRossnagel, Brian G.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2009 Oct., v. 89, no. 13 p.2236-2242dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.37133Available from publisher's Web site  a20091119b20091204c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02814naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072001700151072001700168072001700185072001700202100001900219242011400238245011000352300001600462500002400478520137900502650001001881650003001891650001101921650002301932650001601955650002401971650002001995650001902015650002302034653001902057700001802076700001702094773007602111852000902187856009102196930003302287945002502320946001102345655001202356IND4374331820221121115134.0050915e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||por||7 aIND437433182DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20050004000112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of different temperatures on nymphal development of Orius thyestes Herring when fed with Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) eggs in climatic chambers at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28 and 31 +/- 1 degrees C, 70 +/- 10% RH and 12h photophase. The thermal requirements and nymphal consumption were also determined. O. thyestes presented five instars. The nymphal period was about six times shorter at 31 degrees C (9.8 days) than at 16 degrees C (58.2 days). Nymph survival was lowest at 16 degrees C, with only 40% of the nymphs reaching adult stage. The higher nymph survival were found at 22 degrees C (96.4%), 25 degrees C (94.5%) and 28 degrees C (100%). Each nymph of O. thyestes consumed 39.4 eggs of A. kuehniella. The lower temperature threshold and thermal constant for the nymphal development of O. thyestes were 12.8 degrees C and 173.82 day-degrees, respectively. The interval from 22 degrees C to 28 degrees C is more suitable for nymphal development of O. thyestes. O. thyestes finds probably better chance for colonization and establishment in tropical and subtropical regions. 3aOrius 3abiological control agents 3anymphs 3ainsect development 3atemperature 3aEphestia kuehniella 3astorage insects 3ainsect control 3abiological control 0aOrius thyestes1 aBueno, V.H.P.1 aMendes, S.M.0 tNeotropical entomology.g2005 , v. 34, no. 4 p.607-612x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20050004000113Available from publisher's Web site  a20060602b20060702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/06/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02231naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072001700151072001700168072001700185100002100202245008000223300001600303500002700319500001500346520098400361650001001345650001101355650001401366650002201380650001701402650001301419650001801432651001101450653001501461653002301476700002001499700002101519773007601540852000901616856009101625930003301716945002501749946001101774655001201785IND4374326020221121115141.0050915e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437432602DNAL7 a10.1590/S1519-566X20050004000032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The total number of galling species and the richness of galling Cecidomyiidae (Diptera) were influenced by plant gender. Male plants supported a higher richness of galling insects than female plants, supporting the hypothesis of sex-biased herbivory at the community level. The total number of galling species and the richness of galling cecidomyiids showed a peak at intermediate altitudes. The richness of all galling species and galling cecidomyiids were strongly influenced by habitat. Plants in xeric habitats supported more galling species than plants in mesic habitats, corroborating the hypothesis of hygrothermal/nutritional stress. Our results indicate that local factors may be the most important factors structuring the galling insect community on B. concinna. 3agalls 3ashrubs 3aBaccharis 3aspecies diversity 3agrowth habit 3aaltitude 3aCecidomyiidae 3aBrazil 0aAsteraceae 0aBaccharis concinna1 aFernandes, G.W.1 aSouza, O.F.F. de0 tNeotropical entomology.g2005 , v. 34, no. 4 p.547-553x1519-566X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X20050004000033Available from publisher's Web site  a20060601b20060702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/06/01  aNon-US 7aarticle01356naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245007300131300001300204520058000217650002400797650002500821650001300846651001000859653001100869653002400880773009900904852000901003939003301012945000801045946001301053655001201066991578327380742620221121114330.0820420e198111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE829201042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarma, J.S.10aGrowth and equity: policies and implementation in Indian agriculture  ap. 7-54.  aExtract: Improving the standard of living and promoting the welfare of the population have been the basic objectives of the successive five-year economic development plans in India, although the relative emphases placed on measures for achieving rapid growth and securing social justice have varied from time to time.

However, some hybrids did fruit at the intermediate temperature at 18?C when grown on appropriate substrates, indicating incomplete dominance of the low-temperature requirement.

In this study, the influence of K⁺ supply (0.02-40 mM) and nitrogen source (10 mM NH₄⁺ or NO₃⁻) on root plasma membrane K⁺ fluxes and cytosolic K⁺ pools, plant growth, and whole-plant K⁺ distribution in the NH₄⁺-tolerant plant species rice (Oryza sativa L.) was examined. Using the radiotracer ⁴²K⁺, tissue mineral analysis, and growth data, it is shown that rice is affected by NH₄⁺ toxicity under high-affinity K⁺ transport conditions. Substantial recovery of growth was seen as [K⁺]ext was increased from 0.02 mM to 0.1 mM, and, at 1.5 mM, growth was superior on NH₄⁺. Growth recovery at these concentrations was accompanied by greater influx of K⁺ into root cells, translocation of K⁺ to the shoot, and tissue K⁺. Elevating the K⁺ supply also resulted in a significant reduction of NH₄⁺ influx, as measured by ¹³N radiotracing. In the low-affinity K⁺ transport range, NH₄⁺ stimulated K⁺ influx relative to NO₃⁻ controls. It is concluded that rice, despite its well-known tolerance to NH₄⁺, nevertheless displays considerable growth suppression and disruption of K⁺ homeostasis under this N regime at low [K⁺]ext, but displays efficient recovery from NH₄⁺ inhibition, and indeed a stimulation of K⁺ acquisition, when [K⁺]ext is increased in the presence of NH₄⁺.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3ahomeostasis 3anitrogen 3aplant growth 3aplasma membrane 3arice 3aroots 3ashoots 3atissue analysis 3atoxicity1 aBritto, Dev T.1 aAli, Shabana A.1 aBalkos, Konstantine D.1 aKronzucker, Herbert J.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 Sept., v. 59, no. 12 p.3415-3423dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern1903Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03894naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002100155245019200176300001600368500002400384520139800408650004001806650002201846650002601868650002901894650002601923650002701949650001301976650001901989650001702008650002002025650001002045650001602055650001502071650001202086650002402098650001102122650002702133650002302160650001102183650002402194650002802218650001802246650002302264650002302287650002602310650003202336650002002368650002002388650003002408650001102438650004102449650005202490650002202542650002802564650002402592650003102616650004502647650002402692650001302716650003302729650005202762650003402814650004302848700001502891700002002906700002002926700001802946773008802964852000903052856003903061655001203100IND4439826020221120204304.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443982602DNAL7 a201464022pmid7 a10.1002/yea.17612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Tomotake14aThe role of PaAAC1 encoding a mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier in the biosynthesis of extracellular glycolipids, mannosylerythritol lipids, in the basidiomycetous yeast Pseudozyma antarctica  ap. 379-388.  aIncludes references  aPseudozyma antarctica produces large amounts of the glycolipid biosurfactants known as mannosylerythritol lipids (MEL), which show not only excellent surface-active properties but also versatile biochemical actions. A gene homologous with a mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier was dominantly expressed in P. antarctica under MEL-producing conditions on the basis of previous gene expression analysis. The gene encoding the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier of P. antarctica (PaAAC1) contained a putative open reading frame of 954 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 317 amino acids. The deduced translation product shared high identity of 66%, 70%, 69%, 74%, 75% and 52% with the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (AAC1), S. cerevisiae (AAC2), S. cerevisiae (AAC3), Kluyveromyces lactis (KlAAC), Neurospora crassa (NcAAC) and human (ANT1), respectively, and conserved the consensus sequences of all ADP/ATP carrier proteins. The gene expression by introducing a plasmid pUXV1-PaAAC1 into the yeast cells increased the MEL production. In addition, the expression of PaAAC1 in which the conserved arginine and leucine required for ATP transport activity were replaced with isoleucine and serine, respectively, failed to increase MEL production. Accordingly, these results suggest that PaAAC1 encoding a mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier should be involved in MEL biosynthesis in the yeast. 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aNeurospora crassa 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aarginine 3abiosurfactants 3abiosynthesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycolipids 3aisoleucine 3aleucine 3aopen reading frames 3aserine 3atranslation (genetics) 3atransport proteins 3ayeasts 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Vectors 2aGlycolipidsxbiosynthesis 2aHumans 2aKluyveromycesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocasesxmetabolism 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Structure 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNeurospora crassaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlasmids 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aUstilaginalesxenzymologyxmetabolism.1 aItō, Emi.1 aFukuoka, Tokuma1 aImura, Tomohiro1 aKitamoto, Dai0 tYeast.g2010 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.379-388dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1761 7aarticle03451naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245007900201300001800280500001500298506007600313520168300389506003702072650002602109650001802135650002702153650001102180650002402191650001402215650004202229650001502271650005202286650001802338650001502356650001002371650001202381650002202393653001002415700001302425700001802438700001602456700002502472700002302497700001602520700002502536700001302561773017302574852000902747856008302756939003302839946001302872655001202885IND4449825420221207070826.0110225e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444982542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10128341082doi7 aPMC30410632pmcid7 a212826402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Shihao10aWidespread establishment and regulatory impact of Alu exons in human genes  ap. 2837-2842.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution. Thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from Alu elements. However, identifying Alu exons that have acquired genuine biological functions remains a major challenge. We investigated the creation and establishment of Alu exons in human genes, using transcriptome profiles of human tissues generated by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) combined with extensive RT-PCR analysis. More than 25% of Alu exons analyzed by RNA-Seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of Alu exons in human genes. Genes encoding zinc finger transcription factors have significantly higher levels of Alu exonization. Importantly, Alu exons with high splicing activities are strongly enriched in the 5'-UTR, and two-thirds (10/15) of 5'-UTR Alu exons tested by luciferase reporter assays significantly alter mRNA translational efficiency. Mutational analysis reveals the specific molecular mechanisms by which newly created 5'-UTR Alu exons modulate translational efficiency, such as the creation or elongation of upstream ORFs that repress the translation of the primary ORFs. This study presents genomic evidence that a major functional consequence of Alu exonization is the lineage-specific evolution of translational regulation. Moreover, the preferential creation and establishment of Alu exons in zinc finger genes suggest that Alu exonization may have globally affected the evolution of primate and human transcriptomes by regulating the protein production of master transcriptional regulators in specific lineages.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 3ahumans 3aopen reading frames 3aevolution 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aluciferase 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptome 3acerebellum 3aexons 3atissues 3azinc finger motif 0agenes1 aLin, Lan1 aCai, James J.1 aJiang, Peng1 aKenkel, Elizabeth J.1 aStroik, Mallory R.1 aSato, Seiko1 aDavidson, Beverly L.1 aXing, Yi0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 108, no. 7 p.2837-2842dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10128341083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02284naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245011500148300001500263300002900278520097500307650002301282650001301305650002701318650002001345650001601365650002301381650001401404650001001418650002801428650001101456650003701467650001101504650001401515650002701529650002301556650001401579650003101593700001901624773009501643852001301738939003301751945000801784946001301792852000901805655001201814991578321650742620221120183842.0880411e198707  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880000052DNAL7 a36049762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMannan, S.10aInfluence of maternal selenium status on human milk selenium concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity  ap. 95-100.  ap. 95-100. ill., charts.  aExtract: This study assessed whether relationships existed between maternal indices of selenium (Se) nutrition and milk content of Se and activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Samples of milk (n = 72) collected at 4, 8, 12, and 16 week postpartum and blood from lactating (n = 10) and control (n = 8) women were analyzed. Plasma and erythrocyte Se concentrations and plasma GSH-Px activity were significantly lower in lactating than in control women. Maternal plasma Se concentration was positively correlated with plasma GSH-Px activity (r = 0.53, p less than 0.01) and with milk Se content (r = 0.61, p less than 0.01) and GSH-Px activity (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01). Stage of lactation did not influence either milk or blood values. Milk Se concentration was positively correlated with milk GSH-Px activity (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001). Results indicate that human milk Se content and GSH-Px activity are directly influenced by maternal Se nutrition.(author) 3amaternal nutrition 3aselenium 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aenzyme activity 3abreast milk 3anutritional status 3alactation 2aAdult 2aErythrocytesxanalysis. 2aFemale 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexanalysis 2aHumans 2aLactation 2aMilk, Humanxanalysis. 2aNutritional Status 2aPregnancy 2aSeleniumxanalysisxblood.1 aPicciano, M.F.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1987 July, v. 46, no. 1 p.95-100x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880411c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005500125300001600180500017900196500002400375520089100399650001501290650001101305650001601316650001601332650001401348650001301362650001801375650001101393650001501404700001501419700001201434700001201446773012301458852000901581856008801590655001201678IND4474195020221120173220.0131122s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447419502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaluyo, S.10aApple crispness estimation from optical parameters  ap. 227-234.  aPaper presented at the Second Asia Pacific Symposium on Postharvest Research Education and Extension : APS2012, held September 18 - September 20, 2012, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  aIncludes references  aThe possibility of using optical absorbance and total coefficient of attenuation was investigated on apple crispness evaluation. Partial least-squares (PLS) technique was applied to construct a regression model for sensory crispness prediction from the optical properties. The results showed that absorbance spectrum through apple typically had two dominant peaks at 670 and 980 nm corresponding to absorption of chlorophyll and water in apple, respectively. Different apple cultivars produced different absorbance and total coefficient of attenuation. The correlation coefficients of the calibration models were 0.760 (RMSE=0.688) and 0.820 (RMSE=0.607) using, respectively, absorbance and total coefficient of attenuation. It is recommended that the optical properties both absorbance and total coefficient of attenuation be potentially used to predict the sensory crispness of apple. 3aabsorbance 3aapples 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3ahardness 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aprediction1 aShuaib, A.1 aYao, G.1 aTan, J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1011 p.227-234dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1011/1011_27.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04015naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001900149245012000168300001800288520162700306650002101933650002401954650001601978650001101994650001102005650002402016650001302040650002002053650002502073650001302098650002102111650002202132650001702154650001302171650001702184650002902201650001602230650001802246650004002264650006002304650004602364650002402410650003202434650002802466650004902494650003002543650002402573650002602597650002302623650003602646650003802682651001302720651001302733653002202746653002802768653002102796653002102817653002102838653002102859653002102880653002102901653002102922653002102943653002102964653002102985653002103006700001503027773009903042852000903141930003303150945001303183946001303196655001203209IND2205509720221120173218.0000629e199911  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220550972DNAL7 a105438012pmid7 aPMC916592pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnabel, E.L.10aDistribution of tetracycline resistance genes and transposons among phylloplane bacteria in Michigan apple orchards  ap. 4898-4907.  aThe extent and nature of tetracycline resistance in bacterial populations of two apple orchards with no or a limited history of oxytetracycline usage were assessed. Tetracycline-resistant (Tc(r)) bacteria were mostly gram negative and represented from 0 to 47% of the total bacterial population on blossoms and leaves (versus 26 to 84% for streptomycin-resistant bacteria). A total of 87 isolates were screened for the presence of specific Tc(r) determinants. Tc(r) was determined to be due to the presence of Tet B in Pantoea agglomerans and other members of the family Enterobacteriacae and Tet A, Tet C, or Tet G in most Pseudomonas isolates. The cause of Tc(r) was not identified in 16% of the isolates studied. The Tc(r) genes were almost always found on large plasmids which also carried the streptomycin resistance transposon Tn5393. Transposable elements with Tc(r) determinants were detected by entrapment following introduction into Escherichia coli. Tet B was found within Tn10. Two of eighteen Tet B-containing isolates had an insertion sequence within Tn10; one had IS911 located within IS10-R and one had Tn1000 located upstream of Tet B. Tet A was found within a novel variant of Tn1721, named Tn1720, which lacks the left-end orfI of Tn1721. Tet C was located within a 19-kb transposon, Tn1404, with transposition genes similar to those of Tn501, streptomycin (aadA2) and sulfonamide (sulI) resistance genes within an integron, Tet C flanked by direct repeats of IS26, and four open reading frames, one of which may encode a sulfate permease. Two variants of Tet G with 92% sequence identity were detected. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aPseudomonas 3aapples 3aleaves 3aopen reading frames 3aorchards 3aoxytetracycline 3aphylloplane bacteria 3aplasmids 3aresistance genes 3asequence analysis 3astreptomycin 3asulfates 3atransporters 3atransposition (genetics) 3atransposons 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aEnterobacteriaceaexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPantoeaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRosalesxmicrobiology 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTetracycline Resistancexgenetics 3aMichigan 0aMichigan 0anontarget effects 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af157802 0agenbank/af157803 0agenbank/af137804 0agenbank/af157804 0agenbank/af157797 0agenbank/af157798 0agenbank/af157799 0agenbank/af157800 0agenbank/af157801 0agenbank/af133139 0agenbank/af1331401 aJones, Al.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Nov., v. 65, no. 11 p.4898-4907x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02890naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245007400205300001800279506007600297520161000373506003701983650001102020650001102031650003102042700002002073700001802093700001602111700002002127700002402147700002202171773017302193852000902366856008302375939003302458946001302491655001202504IND4449822920221207065056.0110225e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444982292DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10117341082doi7 aPMC30410872pmcid7 a212826282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, Joseph M.10aImpaired theory of mind for moral judgment in high-functioning autism  ap. 2688-2692.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh-functioning autism (ASD) is characterized by real-life difficulties in social interaction; however, these individuals often succeed on laboratory tests that require an understanding of another person's beliefs and intentions. This paradox suggests a theory of mind (ToM) deficit in adults with ASD that has yet to be demonstrated in an experimental task eliciting ToM judgments. We tested whether ASD adults would show atypical moral judgments when they need to consider both the intentions (based on ToM) and outcomes of a person's actions. In experiment 1, ASD and neurotypical (NT) participants performed a ToM task designed to test false belief understanding. In experiment 2, the same ASD participants and a new group of NT participants judged the moral permissibility of actions, in a 2 (intention: neutral/negative) x 2 (outcome: neutral/negative) design. Though there was no difference between groups on the false belief task, there was a selective difference in the moral judgment task for judgments of accidental harms, but not neutral acts, attempted harms, or intentional harms. Unlike the NT group, which judged accidental harms less morally wrong than attempted harms, the ASD group did not reliably judge accidental and attempted harms as morally different. In judging accidental harms, ASD participants appeared to show an underreliance on information about a person's innocent intention and, as a direct result, an overreliance on the action's negative outcome. These findings reveal impairments in integrating mental state information (e.g., beliefs, intentions) for moral judgment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aautism 3alaboratory experimentation1 aYoung, Liane L.1 aSaxe, Rebecca1 aLee, Su Mei1 aO'Young, Daniel1 aMavros, Penelope L.1 aGabrieli, John D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 108, no. 7 p.2688-2692dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10117341083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04278naa a2200961 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002100193245016000214300001600374500002400390500001500414520154200429650003701971650002302008650002502031650001202056650002302068650001002091650001702101650002102118650001702139650000802156650001802164650001702182650002502199650002102224650002002245650001902265650001602284650002302300650002302323650001702346650001702363650002202380650001002402650000902412650002002421650002002441650001502461650001202476650001102488650001102499650002102510650001802531650002102549650001802570650001102588650000902599650001602608650006402624650001502688650006702703650001502770650003202785650001702817651001102834651001002845651001102855651002602866651002602892651002502918653002602943653001602969653001302985653001502998700002703013700001703040773008203057852000903139856008703148930003303235945002503268946001103293655001203304IND4429440020221120173059.0091130e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944002DNAL7 a197127152pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2009.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT300 0aX3801 aPieniak, Zuzanna10aAssociation of overweight and obesity with interest in healthy eating, subjective health and perceived risk of chronic diseases in three European countries  ap. 399-406.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper analyses cultural differences in consumers' interest in healthy eating, subjective health and perceived risk of (chronic) diseases, and identifies the association between nutritional status (obesity and overweight) and the above mentioned variables as well as people's socio-demographic characteristics and health conditions that may influence food choice. Cross-sectional data were collected through a consumer survey (n =2400) in 2008 with samples representative for age and region in France, Poland and Spain. Body-mass-index (BMI) was inversely associated with education and positively associated with age. Women were less likely to be overweight than men. Subjective health was negatively associated with the likelihood of being obese. The likelihood of being obese decreased with higher perceived risk of suffering from stress and from cancer, whilst the likelihood of being overweight decreased with higher perceived risk of suffering from stress. Despite a tendency of lower interest in healthy eating among obese consumers, interest in healthy eating was not significantly associated with the likelihood of being obese or overweight after Holm-Bonferroni correction. The findings of this study suggest that health consequences and disease risks of excessive weight should be better communicated to European populations. Furthermore, factors associated with obesity such as subjective health and perceived risk of chronic diseases should be considered both at individual counselling and at public health policy levels. 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aat-risk population 3acultural differences 3aobesity 3aeducational status 3awomen 3ahuman health 3afunctional foods 3afood beliefs 3amen 3ahealth status 3arisk factors 3apsychosocial factors 3achronic diseases 3abody mass index 3aweight control 3afood intake 3adisease prevalence 3agender differences 3afood choices 3adiet therapy 3adisease incidence 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Mass Index 2aChronic Disease 2aCounseling 2aCulture 2aEating 2aFemale 2aHealth Education 2aHealth Policy 2aHealth Promotion 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aOdds Ratio 2aOverweightxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aPerception 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 3aFrance 3aSpain 3aPoland 0aFrancexepidemiology. 0aPolandxepidemiology. 0aSpainxepidemiology. 0adiet-related diseases 0arisk groups 0afoodways 0aoverweight1 aPérez-Cueto, Federico1 aVerbeke, Wim0 tAppetite.g2009 Dec., v. 53, no. 3 p.399-406dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2009.08.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100217b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/01/18  aNon-US 7aarticle04164naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002100179245010500200300001300305500002400318506007600342520211300418506003702531650001202568650001202580650001402592650001102606650000902617650001802626650001002644650001302654650001602667650000902683650001102692650001102703650001202714650001102726650001002737650001002747650000902757650002602766650001702792650001002809650001102819650000902830650006502839650003702904650001102941650000902952650002302961650002302984650004403007650002303051700002003074700001803094700001903112700001903131700001903150700001803169700001903187700002003206700002003226773009703246852000903343856007803352655001203430IND4413702620221207051004.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441370262DNAL7 a189777642pmid7 aPMC27072842pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcn2072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurie, Catherine10aMetal movement within the plant: contribution of nicotianamine and yellow stripe 1-like transporters  ap. 1-11.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Since the identification of the genes controlling the root acquisition of iron (Fe), the control of inter- and intracellular distribution has become an important challenge in understanding metal homeostasis. The identification of the yellow stripe-like (YSL) transporter family has paved the way to decipher the mechanisms of long-distance transport of Fe. SCOPE: Once in the plant, Fe will systematically react with organic ligands whose identity is poorly known so far. Among potential ligands, nicotianamine has been identified as an important molecule for the circulation and delivery of metals since it participates in the loading of copper (Cu) and nickel in xylem and prevents Fe precipitation in leaves. Nicotianamine is a precursor of phytosiderophores, which are high-affinity Fe ligands exclusively synthesized by Poaceae species and excreted by roots for the chelation and acquisition of Fe. Maize YS1 is the founding member of a family of membrane transporters called YS1-like (YSL), which functions in root Fe-phytosiderophore uptake from the soil. Next to this well-known Fe acquisition role, most of the other YSL family members are likely to function in plant-wide distribution of metals since (a) they are produced in vascular tissues throughout the plant and (b) they are found in non-Poaceae species that do not synthesize phytosiderophores. The hypothesized activity as Fe-nicotianamine transporters of several YSL members has been demonstrated experimentally by heterologous expression in yeast or by electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes but, despite numerous attempts, proof of the arabidopsis YSL substrate specificity is still lacking. Reverse genetics, however, has revealed a role for AtYSL members in the remobilization of Cu and zinc from senescing leaves, in the formation of pollen and in the Fe, zinc and Cu loading of seeds. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data on the YSL family of transporters clearly argues in favour of its role in the long-distance transport of metals through and between vascular tissues to eventually support gametogenesis and embryo development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPoaceae 3aXenopus 3achelation 3acopper 3acorn 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3agenetics 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3aleaves 3anickel 3aoocytes 3apollen 3aroots 3aseeds 3asoil 3asubstrate specificity 3atransporters 3axylem 3ayeasts 3azinc 2aAzetidinecarboxylic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transportxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlantsxmetabolism1 aCassin, Gaëlle1 aCouch, Daniel1 aDivol, Fanchon1 aHiguchi, Kyoko1 aLe Jean, Marie1 aMisson, Julie1 aSchikora, Adam1 aCzernic, Pierre1 aMari, Stéphane0 tAnnals of botany.g2009 Jan., v. 103, no. 1 p.1-11dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcn2073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03357naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100002300184245012500207300001600332500002400348500001500372520127400387650002101661650001101682650001601693650001801709650001101727650001801738650000901756650001801765650001001783650001701793650001201810650002101822650001701843650001701860650001701877650002201894650001501916650001001931650000901941650002301950650004301973650001802016650001102034650001202045650001102057650001102068650000902079650001602088650001102104650001402115650001002129650001102139650001302150650004202163653001302205653002402218653002002242700002402262700002402286700001802310773008202328852000902410856008702419930003302506945002502539946001102564655001202575IND4429439520221120132410.0091130e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442943952DNAL7 a196431572pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2009.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT3001 aSchroeder, Natalia10aInfluence of whole grain barley, whole grain wheat, and refined rice-based foods on short-term satiety and energy intake  ap. 363-369.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study compared the effect of whole grain high-fiber barley, whole grain wheat and refined rice-based foods on energy intake and satiety. Forty-seven healthy subjects consumed a breakfast of hot cereal and a snack mix containing either barley, wheat, or refined rice, followed by an ad libitum smorgasbord lunch using a crossover design. Energy intake was measured at the lunch using plate waste. Hunger, fullness, desire to eat, amount of food consumed, and thirst were assessed using a modified Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after the breakfast, snack and lunch. Energy intake at lunch did not differ among products. There were no differences in the area under the time curve in modified VAS scores among products for any parameter. However, subjects reported significantly less hunger before lunch compared to their hunger before breakfast when consuming the barley, but there was no significant reduction in hunger before lunch after consumption of wheat or rice. In conclusion, intake of a whole grain high-fiber barley, whole grain wheat, or refined rice breakfast and snack did not decrease energy intake acutely, but consumption of whole grain high-fiber barley foods significantly decreased hunger whereas whole wheat and refined rice foods did not. 3afunctional foods 3ahunger 3afood intake 3adietary fiber 3abarley 3aenergy intake 3arice 3ahealth status 3awheat 3ahuman health 3asatiety 3afood composition 3afood choices 3abeta-glucans 3adiet therapy 3awhole grain foods 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aHordeum 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOryza. 2aSatiation 2aSeeds 2aThirst 2aTriticum 2abeta-Glucansxadministration & dosage 0aappetite 0aVisual Analog Scale 0ahuman nutrition1 aGallaher, Daniel D.1 aArndt, Elizabeth A.1 aMarquart, Len0 tAppetite.g2009 Dec., v. 53, no. 3 p.363-369dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2009.07.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20100217b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03344naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100002500156245013900181300001600320500002400336500001500360520199900375650001702374650001302391650001402404650001102418650002202429650001302451650001902464650001402483650001902497650002002516650001102536653002702547653002602574653002002600700002202620773007902642852000902721856008702730930003302817945002502850946001102875655001202886IND4429445520221120132343.0091130s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2008.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF4001 aAliscioni, Sandra S.10aAtypical foliar anatomy related to Kranz syndrome in Paspalum inaequivalve and Paspalum microstachyum (Poaceae: Panicoideae: Paniceae)  ap. 718-729.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPaspalum L. is a large and complex genus, enclosing more than 300 species, whose boundaries and infrageneric classification are still being studied. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that Paspalum inaequivalve Raddi and Paspalum microstachyum J. Presl, from the Inaequivalvia informal group, should be excluded from Paspalum. Focused on the unclear taxonomic position of P. inaequivalve and P. microstachyum, their leaf anatomy was studied, and some atypical features related to C₄ photosynthesis were found. This atypical Kranz syndrome is the aim of this research. Transverse leaf blade sections from fresh and herbarium material of P. inaequivalve were studied by light, fluorescence, and transmission microscopy. Additionally, sheaths and culms of P. inaequivalve and leaf blades of P. microstachyum were observed by light microscopy. δ¹³C isotope discrimination was determinated for P. inaequivalve. We compared our results with available anatomical data from related taxa. As well as typical mesophyll cells (PCA) and mestome sheath cells (PCR), a third type of cells, here called ‘globose parenchymatous cells', was observed in leaf blades of P. inaequivalve and P. microstachyum. These cells are placed externally to the mestome sheaths of the first and second vascular bundles, they have thin walls, with no developed suberine lamella, few chloroplasts with 1-2 starch grains, thylakoids not organized in grana, and a large central vacuole. The globose parenchymatous cells represent a novel trait in P. inaequivalve and P. microstachyum, further supporting the close relation between both species and their exclusion from the genus Paspalum. This atypical Kranz syndrome has not been described in Paspalum before, but the globose parenchymatous cells here described resemble the distinct cells considered as remnants of the outer parenchymatous sheath described for Anthaenantiopsis, some sections of Panicum L., and Chaetium Nees, providing possible taxonomic significance. 3achloroplasts 3aPaspalum 3aphylogeny 3acarbon 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aherbaria 3aultrastructure 3amesophyll 3aplant taxonomy 3astable isotopes 3aleaves 0aPaspalum microstachyum 0aPaspalum inaequivalve 0acell structures1 aDenham, Silvia S.0 tFlora.g2009, v. 204, no. 10 p.718-729dG.

Melilotus indicus (L.) All., Yellow sweet clover, occurs as a weed in different habitats in Egypt. It grows in moderately saline areas, where traditional forage legumes cannot be cultivated. Our extensive field studies have recorded the species in many different habitats ranging from healthy agricultural lands to abandoned saline areas. The studied plants maintained high nodulation capacity (68 - 95%) and nitrogenase activities (about 1.81μmolC₂H₄ plant⁻¹ h⁻¹) in different habitats. Greenhouse experiments demonstrated that seed germination was maintained at 80% when growing on substrats containing 200mM NaCl and that 25% of the germination capability was preserved when 300mM NaCl was added to the growth medium. The growth rate of seedlings was not significantly affected by 200mM NaCl but was reduced by 30% under 300mM NaCl. It is supposed that M. indicus uses a salt inclusion mechanism for maintaining growth under saline conditions, as it accumulated high amounts of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. Leaf succulence and indices of leaf water status did not differ among the salt treatments, whereas relative water content was reduced by only 3% and water content at saturation increased by about 14% at high salt concentrations in the growing medium. Our results suggest recommending the cultivation of M. indicus in salt-affected soils, which are widespread and pose a problem for the farmers of Egypt and other countries in the world's arid belt. 3asalt tolerance 3aMelilotus indicus 3aforage crops 3asoil salinity 3aagricultural land 3aseed germination 3agreenhouse experimentation 3anodulation 3asodium chloride 3awater content 3aEgypt0 tFlora.g2009, v. 204, no. 10 p.737-746dG.

Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and fertilization have been used successfully to increase growth of coniferous trees, vegetative succession, and overall stand structure in second-growth stands. This study was designed to test the hypotheses (H) that PCT and repeated fertilization of young (20-25 years) even-aged lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands would enhance (H1) coniferous stand structure; (H2) abundance and diversity of understory vegetation; and (H3) abundance and diversity of forest-floor small mammals, to levels found in mature and old-growth forests. Replicate study areas were located near Summerland and Kelowna in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had six stands: young plantation, thinned stand (1000 stems/ha), thinned-fertilized stand (1000 stems/ha), unthinned stand, mature forest, and old-growth forest. Coniferous stand structure, understory vegetation, and forest-floor small mammals were sampled during a 5-year period from 1999 through 2003. The smaller tree sizes (diameter, height, basal area) in the young lodgepole pine stands did not support the tree size part of H1. Similar abundance of overstory and total conifers did support the abundance part of H1. The diversity component was supported by the similarity in species and structural diversity of total conifers among the intensively managed and older unmanaged stands. Response of understory vegetation was dominated by the abundance of herbs in the thinned-fertilized stands. There was no difference in shrub abundance among stands, but mosses and terrestrial lichens were most numerous in the mature and old-growth stands. Our results supported the abundance part of H2, at least for herbs and shrubs. Species richness and diversity of vascular plants were similar in managed and old-growth forests, and richness was lowest in the mature stands. H3 was supported for total abundance, species richness, and diversity of small mammals, and for the generalist species Peromyscus maniculatus and Tamias amoenus, but not for the old forest specialist Myodes gapperi. Two insectivores, Sorex monticolus and Sorex cinereus, were at comparable or higher abundance in the managed stands than in the older unmanaged forests. Three other microtines: Microtus pennsylvanicus, Microtus longicaudus, and Phenacomys intermedius were early successional vegetation specialists, and hence did not fit the prediction of H3. Thus, despite overall quantitative differences in stand structure and species-specific variability between our intensively managed and older natural stands, old-growth attributes seem to be developing in a time-span of decades rather than the centuries depicted by long rotations. 3aforest plantations 3atree growth 3aold-growth forests 3afertilizer application 3aeven-aged management 3aconiferous forests 3asecondary forests 3aPinus contorta 3aspecies diversity 3aforest thinning 3aeven-aged stands 3asmall mammals 3aunderstory 3aBritish Columbia 0aforest management 0astand structure1 aSullivan, Druscilla S.1 aLindgren, Pontus M.F.1 aRansome, Douglas B.0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 Dec. 14, v. 258, no. 1 p.S127-S141dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.06.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100120b20100205c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/01/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02995naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001400185245013600199300001600335500002400351500001500375520158200390650001701972650002701989650002102016650002802037650001202065650001402077650002602091650002302117650001002140650001602150650001602166650002402182653002402206700002402230773009202254852000902346856008902355930003302444945002502477946001102502655001202513IND4429445120221120112552.0091130e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2009.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ401 0aQ501 0aQ403 0aQ5031 aYang, Xin10aEffects of sucrose on egg white protein and whey protein isolate foams: Factors determining properties of wet and dry foams (cakes)  ap. 227-238.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of sucrose on the physical properties of foams (foam overrun and drainage 1/2 life), air/water interfaces (interfacial dilational elastic modulus and interfacial pressure) and angel food cakes (cake volume and cake structure) of egg white protein (EWP) and whey protein isolate (WPI) was investigated for solutions containing 10% (w/v) protein. Increasing sucrose concentration (0-63.6 g/100 mL) gradually increased solution viscosity and decreased foam overrun. Two negative linear relationships were established between foam overrun and solution viscosity on a log-log scale for EWP and WPI respectively; while the foam overrun of EWP decreased in a faster rate than WPI with increasing solution viscosity (altered by sucrose). Addition of sucrose enhanced the interfacial dilational elastic modulus (E') of EWP but reduced E' of WPI, possibly due to different interfacial pressures. The foam drainage 1/2 life was proportionally correlated to the bulk phase viscosity and the interfacial elasticity regardless of protein type, suggesting that the foam destabilization changes can be slowed by a viscous continuous phase and elastic interfaces. Incorporation of sucrose altered the volume of angel food cakes prepared from WPI foams but showed no improvement on the coarse structure. In conclusion, sucrose can modify bulk phase viscosity and interfacial rheology and therefore improve the stability of wet foams. However, the poor stability of whey proteins in the conversion from a wet to a dry foam (angel food cake) cannot be changed with addition of sucrose. 3awhey protein 3achemical concentration 3aprotein isolates 3afood processing quality 3asucrose 3aviscosity 3amodulus of elasticity 3afoaming properties 3acakes 3astabilizers 3aegg albumen 3ainterface phenomena 0aphysical properties1 aFoegeding, E.

During winter, the risk of frost damage is highest at windblown and often snow-free sites. During summer, actively growing plants are particularly endangered by episodic cold spells, but also by short-term overheating. The current review gives an overview of extreme temperatures in the European Alps and observations of temperature damage on plants in their natural habitats. Furthermore, seasonal time courses of frost and heat resistance derived from laboratory tests on different plant growth forms are presented. Study species were the cushion plants Silene acaulis, Minuartia sedoides, Saxifraga oppositifolia and Carex firma collected on wind-exposed ridges; the rosette plant Soldanella alpina collected on snow-protected sites, and three Sempervivum species collected in xerothermic habitats. The temperature resistance of leaves, stems, rhizomes and roots were tested in two annual time courses. Frost treatments were conducted in controlled freezers by rapid cooling (10Kh⁻¹, for current resistance) as well as by stepwise cooling (1-3Kh⁻¹, for hardening capacity). Heat treatments followed a standardised procedure by exposing samples to heat for 30min in hot water baths. The damage was visually estimated using the topographic tetrazolium test. During winter, cushion plants from exposed sites were fully hardened (LT₅₀ below −70°C). Rosette plants, which are protected by a constant snow cover, survived temperatures of down to −25°C. During the growing period, foliage and shoot tips of the investigated species were damaged at −5 to −8°C (LT₅₀). Stems and rhizomes were only partially damaged by temperatures of −10 to −15°C. Heat resistance in cushion plants generally reached 56-58°C (LT₅₀), shoots and rhizomes of C. firma could reach 60°C. Succulent plants like Sempervivum arachnoideum and S. tectorum from hot and dry microsites were the most heat resistant among the tested species (62-64°C). The investigated mountain plant species showed highly varying resistance patterns, with variation in maximum hardening capability and seasonal time courses of resistance. Plants were capable of rapid adjustments to extreme temperatures, which is crucial for survival in a high mountain climate. 3amountains 3asummer 3aCarex 3aaltitude 3aheat treatment 3aroots 3aSilene 3aSoldanella 3aSaxifraga 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3awinter 3afrost injury 3atemperature 3amortality 3astress tolerance 3aplant stress 3asnow 3afrost resistance 3arhizomes 3aplant ecology 3aEurope 0aliterature reviews 0aCarex firma 0astems 0aSilene acaulis 0aSoldanella alpina 0aMinuartia sedoides 0aadaptation 0aSaxifraga oppositifolia1 aKainmüller, Christine1 aWagner, Johanna0 tFlora.g2010, v. 205, no. 1 p.3-18dG.

M110-M116.  a2019-12-05  aEstablishment of a high-pressure sterilization process requires data on pressure and temperature-dependent inactivation kinetics of target pathogenic, spoilage, or surrogate spore-forming bacteria in the food being tested. The objective of this study was to examine the response of Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 10149 spores to various temperature, time, and pressure combination treatments (500 to 700 MPa; 92 degrees C to 111 degrees C, 0.01 to 360 s). The pressure inactivation of spores was characterized at elevated temperatures under isobaric and isothermal conditions during the holding time using a laboratory-scale high-pressure unit. The inactivation kinetics was well described by the log-linear regression model. As expected, the rate of spore inactivation increased with increasing pressure and temperature. Decimal reduction times at constant pressure (D(T,P) values) varied from 29.4 to 108.8 s at 92 degrees C, 17.4 to 76 s at 100 degrees C, and 6.1 to 51.3 s at 111 degrees C within the pressure range of 500 to 700 MPa. The resistance of spores to temperature and pressure was characterized with z(T) and z(P) values and compared with their resistance to conventional steam heating. The conventional thermal resistance of G. stearothermophilus species did not correlate to the thermal resistance at high pressure. The study provides kinetic data on the effects of pressure and temperature on the inactivation of a heat-resistant bacterial spore species under conditions applicable to the commercial processing of low-acid foods. 3aheat inactivation 3abacterial contamination 3asanitizing 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3aspore-forming bacteria 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3akinetics 3asteam pasteurization 3ahot water treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 0aBacillus stearothermophilus1 aKoutchma, T.1 aRamaswamy, H.S.0 tJournal of food science.g2006 Apr., v. 71, no. 3 p.M110-M116x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL  a20060802b20060906c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/06  aOther US 7aarticle02269naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245008900147300001600236520094200252650002301194650002701217650001801244650002001262650002601282650002401308650001401332650001201346650002801358650003101386650002901417650004501446650002501491650002601516653001701542700001901559700001801578700002001596700001501616700001801631700001501649773008001664852000901744939003301753946001301786655001201799IND9301928220221120082637.0930401e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930192822DNAL7 a14266222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastiani, M.J.10aPosition-specific expression of the annulin protein during grasshopper embryogenesis  ap. 129-142.  aAnnulin, named for its annular expression in developing limb buds, is a -100 kDa membrane-associated protein that is expressed in a complex and changing pattern during grasshopper embryogenesis. Its expression is dynamic along the developing midline and in the mesoderm, transient in neuroepithelial sheath cells around mitotic neuroblasts, and position-specific in circumferential stripes in each limb bud segment. Annulin expression begins along the midline of the embryo at the onset of gastrulation. Mesoderm cells express the protein as they migrate away from the midline as do new cells that come to lie at the midline. During neurogenesis, annulin expression disappears from many midline cells until only a specific subset of midline glial cells expresses high levels of the protein. Starting at the beginning of neurogenesis, sheath cells express annulin in correlation with the mitotic activity of the neuroblasts they surround. 3aLocusta migratoria 3aSchistocerca americana 3aembryogenesis 3aanimal proteins 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ahistology 2aAnimals 2aExtremitiesxembryology 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGrasshoppersxembryology 2aMembrane Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMesodermxmetabolism 2aNeurogliaxmetabolism 0anuerogenesis1 aDe Couet, H.G.1 aQuinn, J.M.A.1 aKarlstrom, R.O.1 aKotrla, K.1 aGoodman, C.S.1 aBall, E.E.0 tDevelopmental biology.g1992 Nov., v. 154, no. 1 p.129-142x0012-16067nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01364naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245005200176300001600228520055500244650001800799650001700817650001200834773011400846852000900960856008500969930003301054946001101087655001201098IND4445224620221120082641.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444522462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00580-010-1016-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd Ellah, Mahmoud Rushdi 10aInvolvement of free radicals in animal diseases  ap. 615-619.  aThe balance between free radicals and antioxidants is disrupted in many diseases.

Significant interactive effects between life history stage, temperature and food quantity were observed for otolith Ba/Ca, while significant interactions between stage and food were observed for Sr/Ca. Specific growth rates were negatively correlated with DBa and DSr for juveniles and sub-adults. These interactions indicated elemental incorporation dynamics varied depending on the life history stage, suggesting variation in effects of stage-specific metabolism or reproductive status.

Growth rate is a fundamental property of organisms. In trees, growth is indeterminate and varies in space and time depending on resource availability, genetic constraints, competition and stress from biotic and abiotic environmental factors. 2. The ratio between the abundance of RNA and DNA in the tissue has been used to indicate recent growth rates in many systems, but not for trees. We assessed the applicability of using RNA : DNA ratios for assessing intraspecific and interspecific differences in growth rates in two species of mangrove trees under field conditions. We manipulated growth by fertilizing mangrove trees over a period of 4 years and measured tree growth as increments in linear extension of tagged shoots. The C, N and P contents per unit biomass were measured to test the hypothesis that faster growing organisms require more P per unit biomass (the Growth Rate Hypothesis). 3. We found that interspecific differences in the RNA : DNA ratio clearly reflected the difference in shoot elongation rates between the species. Intraspecific differences in RNA : DNA were significantly correlated with growth rates only for Avicennia marina and not for Ceriops australis. C : N and C : P ratios were lower in trees with higher growth rates and exhibited a negative correlation with RNA : DNA ratios. 4. Our results indicate that RNA : DNA ratios can reliably predict interspecific differences in growth rates between the two mangrove species and that RNA : DNA ratios can be used as an indication of variation in growth rate for Avicennia marina. The interaction between C : N : P ratios, RNA : DNA ratios and growth rates supported the Growth Rate Hypothesis on an interspecific level, but not on an intraspecific level. 3aAvicennia marina 3aCeriops australis 3aDNA 3aRNA 3abiomass 3aenvironmental factors 3aindeterminate growth 3ainterspecific variation 3aintraspecific variation 3ashoots 3aspace and time 3astoichiometry 3atree growth 3atrees 0aC : N : P 0aecostoichiometry 0agrowth rate hypothesis 0aplant 0ashoot elongation1 aBall, Marilyn C.1 aFeller, Ilka C.1 aLovelock, Catherine E.0 tFunctional ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 24, no. 5 p.1064-1072dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01722.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03284naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010200169300001600271520185400287650002802141650001102169650001102180650001202191650002602203650001402229650002102243650001302264650001402277650001402291650002102305650001202326650001702338650001402355650002602369650002402395650001802419650001002437653003202447653001602479700002402495700002802519773010502547852000902652856008502661930003302746946001102779655001202790IND4447225920221120071300.0110107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444722592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-010-1751-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodbeck, Brent V. 10aNutrient mediation of behavioral plasticity and resource allocation in a xylem-feeding leafhopper  ap. 111-122.  aPhenotypic plasticity may be critical for nutrient-limited organisms that allocate ingested nutrients to the competing demands of reproduction and survivorship. Leafhoppers that feed on xylem fluid allow assessment of plasticity in response to the constant selective pressure of nutritional inadequacy. We examined feeding behavior (host selection and consumption rates) and nutrient allocation (fecundity, change in body mass and composition) of the xylem fluid-feeding leafhopper Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera:Cicadellidae) on ten genotypes of related Prunus germplasm when adults first seasonally appear, and later during population peaks, to examine the effects of genotypes and season on plasticity of life history and behavioral traits. Behavior and resource allocation to life history traits were both mediated by xylem nutrients, although nutrients impacting behavior differed from those mediating life history. Host selection and consumption varied with genotype between June and July, yet behavior consistently reflected concentrations of dietary glutamine. Resource allocations also increased linearly with nutrient concentrations, but were best correlated to ingested essential amino acids rather than glutamine. Body mass and composition were highly correlated to dietary essential amino acids in June; 6 weeks later, fecundity was instead proportional to essential amino acids. The discrepancy in nutrients which impact behavior versus those mediating life history may explain the weak preference-performance linkage documented for many insects. The demarcation in allocating resources to biomass in June to fecundity in July suggests increased allocation to reproduction during periods of nutrient stress as predicted by the theory of optimal resource allocation; other contributing biotic and abiotic factors are also discussed. 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3aPrunus 3aadults 3abiomass 3aessential amino acids 3afecundity 3afeeding behavior 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aglutamine 3ahost preferences 3ainsects 3alife history 3anutrients 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aresource allocation 3asurvival rate 3axylem 0aOptimal resource allocation 0aXylem fluid1 aAndersen, Peter C. 1 aMizell, Russell F.

Neurochem. (2010) 115, 606-613. We examined the effect of concanamycin A and bafilomycin A1, inhibitors of the vacuolar proton-ATPase, on maturation and expression of Ret, a tyrosine kinase receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Ret appeared as 150- and 170-kDa bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and both forms were sensitive to peptide-N-glycosidase F. Western and immunocytochemical analyses revealed that the 150-kDa immature form of Ret accumulated in the Golgi apparatus upon treatment with vacuolar proton-ATPase inhibitors, whereas, the 170-kDa mature form of Ret was dramatically decreased. The result suggests that glycosylation of Ret during the conversion from immature forms to mature forms is pH sensitive, and is likely initiated in the acidic trans-Golgi apparatus. In contrast, glycosylation of nascent receptors to become immature receptors appeared to be pH insensitive, and are likely to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum. The immature form of Ret was present in the plasma membrane when the cells were treated with the vacuolar proton-ATPase inhibitors. In conclusion, the acidification of the Golgi apparatus is crucial for maturation of Ret but not indispensable for trafficking of receptors to the membrane. 0abafilomycin A1 0aconcanamycin A 0aEGFR 0aPC12 cells 0aRet1 aShimokawa, Norihiro1 aOh-hashi, Kentaro1 aYu, Zu-Xi1 aKiuchi, Kazutoshi0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Nov., v. 115, no. 3 p.606-613dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06966.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03552naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001700186245012900203300001600332506007600348520141600424506003701840650002101877650000901898650001001907650002201917650001301939650003501952650001501987650001102002650002502013650001102038650001102049650002202060650003502082650004802117650002802165650001202193650002702205650001902232650001102251650002202262650001102284650000902295650001902304650001302323650003602336650004802372650003102420650002402451653001002475653002402485653003202509700002102541700001902562700002002581773012702601852000902728856008502737930003302822946001102855655001202866IND4442660620221207072033.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444266062DNAL7 a206615902pmid7 aPMC29546052pmcid7 a10.1007/s00438-010-0560-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZangerl, B. 10aIdentification of genetic variation and haplotype structure of the canine ABCA4 gene for retinal disease association studies  ap. 243-250.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOver 200 mutations in the retina specific member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily (ABCA4) have been associated with a diverse group of human retinal diseases. The disease mechanisms, and genotype-phenotype associations, nonetheless, remain elusive in many cases. As orthologous genes are commonly mutated in canine models of human blinding disorders, canine ABCA4 appears to be an ideal candidate gene to identify and study sequence changes in dogs affected by various forms of inherited retinal degeneration. However, the size of the gene and lack of haplotype assignment significantly limit targeted association and/or linkage approaches. This study assessed the naturally observed sequence diversity of ABCA4 in the dog, identifying 80% of novel variations. While none of the observed polymorphisms have been associated with blinding disorders to date, breed and potentially disease specific haplotypes have been identified. Moreover, a tag SNP map of 17 (15) markers has been established that accurately predicts common ABCA4 haplotypes (frequency > 5%) explaining >85% (>80%) of the observed genetic diversity and will considerably advance future studies.

Thereafter, both groups were directly subjected to osmotic challenge (from 0 to 10 ppt) for 168 h. Blood samples were collected at −240, 0, 6, 24, 72 and 168 h after challenge. Survival and serum cortisol, glucose, sodium and chloride levels were measured to determine stress response and osmoregulation condition. While TRP group showed no mortality until 168 h, cumulative mortality was near 100% at 72 h after challenge in control group. Feeding tryptophan-supplemented diet led to increase in prechallenge cortisol, but not glucose, sodium and chloride values at −240 h that stayed elevated until 0 h after challenge. After challenge, cortisol and glucose values did not significantly affected by time of sampling but type of diet and diet × time interaction. Sodium values significantly affected by diet type and time of sampling but not their interaction. Chloride values significantly affected by time of sampling but not diet type and their interaction. Control group had higher cortisol, glucose and sodium than TRP at each time of sampling. Control and TRP group showed increasing and decreasing pattern in cortisol and glucose values when experiment progressed after osmotic challenge. Both group showed increasing pattern in sodium and chloride values when experiment progressed after osmotic challenge. Results indicated that tryptophan supplementation enhanced salt water tolerance of carp that is due to increase in basal cortisol and anti-stress effect of tryptophan and possibly increase in serotonergic activity. 3aCyprinus carpio 3ablood serum 3acarp 3acortisol 3adiet 3aglucose 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3aosmoregulation 3aosmotic stress 3asaline water 3asodium 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atryptophan 0aStress 0al-tryptophan1 aHosseini, Seyed Abbas 0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2010 Dec., v. 36, no. 4 p.1061-1067dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-010-9383-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101105b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01566naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245003900128300001800167300003200185500013400217520057300351650001600924650001200940650002800952650002300980653001101003653002501014700001601039773009701055852001301152939003301165945000801198946001301206852000901219655001201228991578309980742620221120060324.0880411e198705  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880000172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeaf, A.12aA new era for science in nutrition  ap. 1048-1053.  ap. 1048-1053. ill., charts.  aProceedings of a symposium: "Diet and health: scientific concepts and principles," October 19-22, 1986, Alvor, Algarve, Portugal.  aA technical review contrasts paleolithic with current dietary intakes, focusing on dietary factors affecting cardiovascular disease risks.

Besides the threat to public health, the financial and reputational damage to pharmaceutical companies is substantial. The lack of robust information on the prevalence of fake drugs is an obstacle in the fight against drug counterfeiting. It is generally accepted that approximately 10% of drugs worldwide could be counterfeit, but it is also well known that this number covers very different situations depending on the country, the places where the drugs are purchased, and the definition of what constitutes a counterfeit drug. The chemical analysis of drugs suspected to be fake is a crucial step as counterfeiters are becoming increasingly sophisticated, rendering visual inspection insufficient to distinguish the genuine products from the counterfeit ones. This article critically reviews the recent analytical methods employed to control the quality of drug formulations, using as an example artemisinin derivatives, medicines particularly targeted by counterfeiters. Indeed, a broad panel of techniques have been reported for their analysis, ranging from simple and cheap in-field ones (colorimetry and thin-layer chromatography) to more advanced laboratory methods (mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and vibrational spectroscopies) through chromatographic methods, which remain the most widely used. The conclusion section of the article highlights the questions to be posed before selecting the most appropriate analytical approach.

During the middle month, low-GI foods were substituted for those with a higher GI with minimal change in dietary macronutrient and fiber content. Only in the group (24 patients) with raised triglyceride levels (types IIb, III, and IV) were significant lipid reductions seen: total cholesterol 8.8 +/- 1.5% (p less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol 9.1 +/- 2.4% (p less than 0.001), and serum triglyceride 19.3 +/- 3.2% (p less than 0.001) with no change in HDL cholesterol. The percentage reduction in serum triglyceride related to the initial triglyceride levels (r = 0.56, p less than 0.01). The small weight loss (0.4 kg) on the low-GI diet did not relate to the lipid changes. Low-GI diets may be of use in the management of lipid abnormalities associated with hypertriglyceridemia.(author) 3adiet 3astarch 3ahyperlipidemia 3atriacylglycerols 3alipid metabolism 3apatient care 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucose 2aBody Weight 2aC-Peptidexurine 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFructosamine 2aHexosaminesxblood 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemiasxdiet therapy 2aInsulinxurine 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aWolever, T.M.S.1 aKalmusky, J.1 aGuidici, S.1 aGiordano, C.1 aPatten, R.1 aWong, G.S.1 aBird, J.N.1 aHall, M.1 aBuckley, G.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1987 July, v. 46, no. 1 p.66-71x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19880406c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01778naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002000175245010200195300001600297500002400313500001500337520034200352650001100694650002100705650001600726650001800742650002600760650001100786650001200797650001600809650002500825650002300850650000900873650003300882650001100915650002300926650002600949653001400975653001300989653002301002773008201025852000901107856008701116930003301203945002501236946001101261655001201272IND4429440820221120052008.0091130e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944082DNAL7 a196952972pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2009.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aBooth, David A.14aThe basics of quantitative judgment.

Patients with type 2 diabetes have reduced EPC and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is reduced by multifactorial intervention. Our aim, therefore, was to evaluate in type 2 diabetic patients whether the numbers of EPC derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is influenced by a multifactorial treatment strategy. Methods We enrolled 28 patients newly referred for initiation of multifactorial treatment, which consisted of improving glycaemic, lipid and blood pressure control, as well as antithrombotic therapy and lifestyle modification. EPC count was assessed by in vitro cultures at baseline and after 90 days of treatment. After 7 days in culture, we identified EPC by fluorescent staining of attached cells. Patients were treated with metformin, aspirin, statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and divided accordingly into groups of mono-, dual-, triple- or quadruple therapy. Results After 90 days of treatment, glycaemic control improved and total cholesterol decreased. Multifactorial intervention for 90 days significantly increased EPC count in cultures by 35% (from 105 [SE 8] to 140 [11] cells per field [p = 0.002]). The change in EPC among patients with quadruple therapy was higher (63%) than in untreated patients (−32%, p = 0.043). Conclusions/interpretation Numbers of EPC derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased significantly after multifactorial intervention in type 2 diabetic patients. It remains to be shown whether these changes contribute to the beneficial effects of multifactorial intervention on diabetic micro- and macroangiopathy. 0aEndothelial progenitor cells 0aMultifactorial cardiovascular intervention 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus1 aJacobsen, P.

The first three narratives of lay ethics do not take stock of what has radically changed in the modern world under the triple and joint evolution of science, religion, and philosophy. The modern narratives, in turn, are in serious need of a post-modern deconstruction. Both critiques express the limits of humanism. They do not imply, however, that these narratives should not be taken seriously. In particular, the enduring presence of three ancient narratives in laypeople's symbolic thought is highly significant in terms of the role that the logic of the sacred keeps playing in the workings of modern societies. Lay people's implicit understanding of how modern technology tends towards catastrophe and apocalypse provides the strongest argument for taking these narratives seriously. 3ananotechnology 0aLay ethics 0aNarrative 0aCatastrophism 0aViolence and the Sacred0 tNanoethics.g2010 Aug., v. 4, no. 2 p.153-170dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1871-47657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11569-010-0097-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100910b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02815naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003700133040001800170072000900188072000900197100003100206245009000237300001600327500002400343500001500367506007600382520071900458506003701177650001301214650001401227650002501241650001501266650002001281650001001301650001301311650001801324650002201342650000901364650001801373650002001391650006501411650003501476650003801511650001201549650002501561650003701586650002301623650003301646650000901679650001101688650001501699650004901714650000901763650003601772650004101808653001501849700001801864773008201882852000901964856008701973930003302060945002502093946001102118655001202129IND4429440420221207072602.0091130e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944042DNAL7 a196355142pmid7 aPMC28179822pmcid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2009.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aX3801 aSalamone, J.

Accumbens DA depletions reduce the tendency of rats to work for food, and alter effort-related choice, but leave other aspects of food motivation and appetite intact. DA and adenosine receptors interact to regulate effort-related processes. Adenosine A₂A antagonists can reverse the effects of DA D₂ antagonists on effort-related choice, and intra-accumbens injections of a adenosine A₂A agonist produce effects that are similar to those produced by accumbens DA depletion or antagonism. These studies have implications for understanding the neurochemical interactions that underlie activational aspects of motivation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adopamine 3aadenosine 3aoperant conditioning 3amotivation 3aanimal behavior 3abrain 3aappetite 3aanimal models 3aneurotransmitters 3arats 3amental health 3adecision making 2aAdenosinexantagonists & inhibitorsxdeficiencyxphysiology. 2aAdenosine A2 Receptor Agonists 2aAdenosine A2 Receptor Antagonists 2aAnimals 2aDopaminexphysiology 2aDopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFood 2aHumans 2aMotivation 2aNucleus Accumbensxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aRats 2aReceptors, Dopaminexphysiology 2aReceptors, Purinergic P1xphysiology 0apsychology1 aCorrea, Merce0 tAppetite.g2009 Dec., v. 53, no. 3 p.422-425dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2009.07.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20100217b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02096naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245008200150300001400232300002200246520066300268650001200931650003000943650003100973650002301004650001201027650001101039650002201050650002801072650002101100650001101121650001101132650001901143650002301162650002201185650002201207650001901229650000901248650001601257650001901273650002401292650001801316700001801334700001501352700001701367773009401384852001301478930003301491945000801524946001301532852000901545655001201554991578308000742620221120044318.0880406e198707  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870034212DNAL7 a33002512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchauder, P.10aSex-specific differences in plasma branched-chain keto acid levels in obesity  ap. 58-60.  ap. 58-60. charts.  aExtract: Obesity was associated with a significant increase in postabsorptive plasma concentrations of the branched-chain keto acids in men but not in women matched for body-mass index and age. Plasma glucose and serum insulin were significantly higher in obese subjects than in nonobese control subjects. Obese women had more adipose tissue than did obese men from the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. It is suggested that augmentation in plasma branched-chain keto acids in obesity may reflect insulin resistance and that the apparent differences observed between obese women and men may be due to differences in body composition.(author) 3aobesity 3abranched chain keto acids 3abranched chain amino acids 3agender differences 3ainsulin 3aadults 3ablood composition 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Composition 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aIsoleucinexblood 2aKeto Acidsxblood 2aLeucinexblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxblood 2aSex Characteristics 2aValinexblood1 aZavelberg, D.1 aLanger, K.1 aHerbertz, L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1987 July, v. 46, no. 1 p.58-60x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a20050114b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002000175245012000195300001600315500002400331500001500355520101000370650001701380650002101397650001801418650001801436650002601454650001101480650001301491650001701504650001301521650001601534650001301550650001701563650001301580650001101593650003301604650000901637650001101646650001101657650003101668650002001699650001401719650001101733653001601744653001401760653002301774773008201797852000901879856008701888930003301975945002502008946001102033655001202044IND4429440720221120044244.0091130e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944072DNAL7 a196952982pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2009.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aBooth, David A.10aLines, dashed lines and “scale” ex-tricks. Objective measurements of appetite versus subjective tests of intake  ap. 434-437.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInvestigators of appetite for food have been tricked into the twin illusions that ratings of the disposition to eat are subjective and amounts eaten at meals are objective. The reality is the opposite. Making a mark on a continuous or broken line specified by two levels of what the rater uses as a single concept is the objective performance of a quantitative judgment. In contrast, the amount of a test meal that a person eats is a completely subjective outcome accumulated from many choices of another mouthful, each subject to several rapidly changing influences. Hence, rather than intake at test meals providing any validation for ratings of appetite, measurements of effects on the judged disposition to eat available food at each moment during a meal are needed to explain the amount consumed. This short paper is written in the hope of exorcising such self-deception from the research community and restoring systematic ratings of appetite to the uses for which they were introduced 35 years ago. 3aportion size 3aresearch methods 3arating scales 3aeating habits 3aquantitative analysis 3ahumans 3aappetite 3aserving size 3avalidity 3ameasurement 3aaccuracy 3ameals (menu) 2aAppetite 2aEating 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFood 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aReproducibility of Results 2aResearch Design 2aSatiation 2aThirst 0afood intake 0ametrology 0aliterature reviews0 tAppetite.g2009 Dec., v. 53, no. 3 p.434-437dAcademic Pressx0195-66637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2009.08.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100217b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02487naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002100169245012500190300001700315500002400332520094800356650001001304650000901314650002701323650001201350650001301362650002301375650001401398650001101412650001001423650001301433650001301446650001501459650001201474650002601486650003101512650002201543650001001565650002601575650004701601650005301648650005201701651001101753700001801764700002901782773009601811852000901907856005301916655001201969IND4402089020221120044139.0080227e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440208902DNAL7 a174628822pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNehrenheim, Emma10aMetal retention on pine bark and blast furnace slag - On-site experiment for treatment of low strength landfill leachate  ap. 998-1005.  aIncludes references  aTreatment of landfill leachate using blast furnace slag and pine bark as reactive sorbents was studied in an in situ column experiment at the Lilla Nyby landfill site in Eskilstuna, Sweden. The columns were filled with approximately 10l of each sorbent and leachate was supplied at three different flow rates during a period of 4months. Samples of inflow and outflow were collected three times a week and were analyzed for physical and chemical parameters, including concentrations of some metals, and toxicity. It was found that pine bark removed metals more efficiently than did the blast furnace slags; that Zn was most efficiently retained in the filters and that both retention time and initial concentration played an important role in the sorption process. It was also observed that the pine bark column did not release COD. No toxicity of the untreated or the treated leachate was found with the test organisms and test responses used. 3aPinus 3abark 3achemical oxygen demand 3afilters 3afurnaces 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3ametals 3aslags 3asorption 3atoxicity 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aIndustrial Wastexanalysis 2aMetalsxchemistry 2aPinus 2aPlant Barkxchemistry 2aRefuse Disposalxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxprevention & control 3aSweden1 aWaara, Sylvia1 aJohansson Westholm, Lena0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Mar., v. 99, no. 5 p.998-1005dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.006 7aarticle01847naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012800129300001800257520074300275650001901018650003901037650001501076650001901091650001101110650001701121650002701138650001801165650001001183650001201193650001301205700001501218700002101233700001301254700001501267773009901282852000901381930003301390945001301423946001301436655001201449IND2197679320221123042751.0990320e199811  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219767932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Sullivan, D.10aDesign of a phage-insensitive lactococcal dairy starter via sequential transfer of naturally occurring conjugative plasmids  ap. 4618-4622.  aThe plasmid-free Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1614 is highly phage sensitive and lacks lactose fermenting ability (Lac) and primary casein degrading ability (Prt).

In Indonesia about 13.3 million ha is flooded every year. The flood causes a reduction in quality and quantity of rice, especially when the floods happen when the panicle is being filled at the end of the reproductive and maturation phase. The aim of this research was to determine the effect of flooding on characteristics of husk, hulled and cooked rice of ‘Cilamaya Muncul’ at various ages after planting. The research used a descriptive method with statistical analysis to observe significance and relationship among treatments. This research was conducted in the village of Pamotan sub district Kalipucang, Ciamis, West Java. The observations were carried out at the age of 90, 95, 100, 105 and 110 days after planting. The result showed that the submerged rice grain had higher protein, moisture, amylase contents than the normal rice. However, it had lower yield, hardness, stickiness, and brightness than the normal rice. After planting 65-110 days, the height of the water flood decreased, and similarly the rate of respiration. This phenomenon made harvesting of flooded rice possible in the earlier age. Based on chemical composition in each phase (reproductive and maturation), flooded rice had the potency to be utilised as food. Harvesting in older age would cause further decrease in quality. 3achemical composition 3afloods 3ahardness 3aharvesting 3ahulls 3ainflorescences 3apaddies 3aplanting 3arice 3astatistical analysis 3astickiness 3aIndonesia1 aDjali, M.1 aNurhasanah, S.1 aLembong, E.1 aRahmat, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1011 p.285-291dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1011/1011_35.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03240naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245010000201300001800301506007600319520163900395506003702034650001802071650002502089650001602114650001402130650001602144650001302160650002102173650001302194650002002207650002002227650001902247650001602266650000902282650001202291650001802303650003602321650002702357700002102384700001802405773017302423852000902596856008302605939003302688946001302721655001202734IND4449825920221207062616.0110225e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444982592DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10192701082doi7 aPMC30410762pmcid7 a212826352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qingde10aSignaling mechanisms in the restoration of impaired immune function due to diet-induced obesity  ap. 2867-2872.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOur previous data have linked obesity with immune dysfunction. It is known that physical exercise with dietary control has beneficial effects on immune function and the comorbidities of obesity. However, the mechanisms underlying the improvement of immune function in obesity after physical exercise with dietary control remain unknown. Here we show that moderate daily exercise with dietary control restores the impaired cytokine responses in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and improves the resolution of Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis. This restoration of immune responses is related to the reduction of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) and TNF. Both FFAs and TNF induce an Akt inhibitor, carboxyl-terminal modulator protein (CTMP). The expression of CTMP is also observed increased in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMΦ) from DIO mice and restored after moderate daily exercise with dietary control. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which increases CTMP induction by FFAs, is inhibited in BMMΦ from DIO mice or after either FFA or TNF treatment, but unexpectedly is not restored by moderate daily exercise with dietary control. Furthermore, BMMΦ from DIO mice display reduced histone H3 (Lys-9) acetylation and NF-κB recruitment to TNF, IL-10, and TLR2 promoters after P. gingivalis infection. However, moderate daily exercise with dietary control restores these defects at promoters for TNF and IL-10, but not for TLR2. Thus, metabolizing FFAs and TNF by moderate daily exercise with dietary control improves innate immune responses to infection in DIO mice via restoration of CTMP and chromatin modification.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorphyromonas 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aacetylation 3achromatin 3acomorbidity 3aexercise 3afree fatty acids 3ahistones 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-10 3amacrophages 3amice 3aobesity 3aperiodontitis 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factors1 aLeeman, Susan E.1 aAmar, Salomon0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 108, no. 7 p.2867-2872dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10192701083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02694naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013900126300001600265500017900281500002400460500001500484520125600499650001601755650001801771650001201789650003301801650001801834650003101852650001801883650001301901650001501914650002301929650001501952653004301967700001902010700002002029700001502049773012302064852000902187856008802196655001202284IND4474196320221123022357.0131122s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447419632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndasuryani10aApplication of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy for determination of gambir (Uncaria gambir roxb.) moisture and catechin content  ap. 299-306.  aPaper presented at the Second Asia Pacific Symposium on Postharvest Research Education and Extension : APS2012, held September 18 - September 20, 2012, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aMoisture and catechin content of gambir are indicators of its quality. Near Infrared Reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy is one of the technologies which can determine the content of moisture and catechin in gambir quickly and precisely. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between NIR characteristics with moisture, and catechin content of gambir through calibration process which could be used for their accurate prediction. Calibration model was established using Principal Component Regression (PCR) and Partial Least Square (PLS) algorithm with pretreatment of normalization between 0 to 1 (n01). Performance of calibration model was determined by the coefficient of correlation for the calibration set (Rc) and validation set (Rv), coefficient of determination (R(2)), the average difference (bias) between predicted and reference values, coefficient of variation (CV), relative predictive determinant (RPD), the standard error of calibration (SEC) and validation set (SEP), and the consistency between SEC and SEP. The results showed that NIR spectroscopy could predict both moisture and catechin content of gambir. The calibration model for moisture content was more accurate and precise than the model for catechin content. 3acorrelation 3anormal values 3aUncaria 3aprincipal component analysis 3aleast squares 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3awater content 3acatechin 3aalgorithms 3astatistical models 3aprediction 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy1 aPurwanto, Y.A.1 aBudiastra, I.W.1 aSyamsu, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1011 p.299-306dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1011/1011_37.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02195naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166100002500175245015700200300001600357500002400373520067900397650001401076650001901090650001301109650001301122650002501135650001101160650001401171650001401185650001001199650002601209650003301235650001301268650001101281650001401292650001101306650000901317650001101326650001101337650001901348650003501367700001601402773008201418852000901500856008701509930003301596945002501629946001101654655001201665IND4429441620221123022538.0091130e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442944162DNAL7 a198359212pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2009.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aEdmonds, Caroline J.10aDoes having a drink help you think? 6-7-Year-old children show improvements in cognitive performance from baseline to test after having a drink of water  ap. 469-472.  aIncludes references  aLittle research has examined the effect of water consumption on cognition in children.

There were significant interactions between time of test and water group (water/no water), with improvements in the water group on thirst and happiness ratings, visual attention and visual search, but not visual memory or visuomotor performance.

The filters were probed with a digoxigenin-labeled PCR product generated by amplification of a conserved verotoxin gene sequence. Replication of the growth on filters allowed probe-positive colonies to be picked. When ground beef samples were inoculated with VTEC strains, 100% of the strains were recovered, and the detection limit was 0.1 CFU per g. Similar results were obtained with seven types of artificially contaminated vegetables. A survey of 32 packages of vegetables and 23 samples of apple cider obtained at the retail level did not reveal the presence of VTEC. However, the intestinal fecal contents of a moose, 1 of 35 wild mammals and birds examined, contained E. coli O157:H7. The DNA hybridization-HGMF method was also used in a prevalence survey of 327 raw and 744 ready-to-eat products; VTEC strains were recovered from 4.9% of the raw products and 0.7% of the ready-to-eat products. No serotype O157:H7 strains were detected. This method is particularly suited for surveys in which low numbers of VTEC-positive samples are expected and isolates are required. 3aAlces alces 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aagar 3aapple cider 3abirds 3adetection limit 3afeces 3afilters 3afood contamination 3aground beef 3aintestines 3amammals 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aready-to-eat foods 3aserotypes 3asurveys 3atoxigenic strains 3avegetables 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBeveragesxmicrobiology 2aBirds 2aDeer 2aEscherichia coli O157xgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFood Microbiology 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aMammals 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aShiga Toxin 1 2aVegetablesxmicrobiology1 aSzabo, R.A.1 aMackenzie, J.M.1 aMartin, A.1 aRahn, K.1 aGyles, C.1 aGao, A.1 aAlves, D.1 aYee, A.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Nov., v. 65, no. 11 p.4775-4780x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03622naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002300193245010700216300001600323520142300339650001301762650001401775650001801789650002201807650001201829650006201841650005501903650002501958650006401983650005502047650003302102650002402135650005402159650000902213650003902222650002602261650000902287650006502296650005302361650005202414650004002466653001302506653002102519700002202540700002502562700001302587700002702600700002502627700002902652700002102681700002402702773012302726852000902849856009202858930003302950946001302983655001202996IND4421674320221123004141.0090612e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442167432DNAL7 a194571002pmid7 aPMC27372712pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06145.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanwood, Gregg D.10aManganese exposure is cytotoxic and alters dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons within the basal ganglia  ap. 378-389.  aManganese is an essential nutrient, integral to proper metabolism of amino acids, proteins and lipids. Excessive environmental exposure to manganese can produce extrapyramidal symptoms similar to those observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). We used in vivo and in vitro models to examine cellular and circuitry alterations induced by manganese exposure. Primary mesencephalic cultures were treated with 10-800 μM manganese chloride which resulted in dramatic changes in the neuronal cytoskeleton even at subtoxic concentrations. Using cultures from mice with red fluorescent protein driven by the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter, we found that dopaminergic neurons were more susceptible to manganese toxicity. To understand the vulnerability of dopaminergic cells to chronic manganese exposure, mice were given i.p. injections of MnCl₂ for 30 days. We observed a 20% reduction in TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) following manganese treatment. Quantification of Nissl bodies revealed a widespread reduction in SNpc cell numbers. Other areas of the basal ganglia were also altered by manganese as evidenced by the loss of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 in the striatum. These studies suggest that acute manganese exposure induces cytoskeletal dysfunction prior to degeneration and that chronic manganese exposure results in neurochemical dysfunction with overlapping features to PD. 3adopamine 3amanganese 3aneurotoxicity 3aParkinson disease 2aAnimals 2aBasal Gangliaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aCytoskeletonxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDopaminexmetabolism 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aGlutamate Decarboxylasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMagnesium Chloridextoxicity 2aManganesextoxicity 2aManganese Poisoningxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aMice 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNeurotoxinsxtoxicity 2aRats 2aSubstantia Nigraxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aSynaptic Transmissionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTyrosine 3-Monooxygenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2agamma-Aminobutyric Acidxmetabolism 0astriatum 0asubstantia nigra1 aLeitch, Duncan B.1 aSavchenko, Valentina1 aWu, Jane1 aFitsanakis, Vanessa A.1 aAnderson, Douglas J.1 aStankowski, Jeannette N.1 aAschner, Michael1 aMcLaughlin, BethAnn0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 July, v. 110, no. 1 p.378-389dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06145.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090612b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02911naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245013500209300001800344506007600362520126800438506003701706650001401743650002201757650002001779650003201799650001801831650001101849650002201860650000901882650001401891650001401905650001501919650001501934650001201949700002401961700002301985700002002008700002302028700002102051700002202072773017302094852000902267856008302276939003302359946001302392655001202405IND4449826820221207071300.0110225e20110215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444982682DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10197521082doi7 aPMC30410732pmcid7 a212853722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstedgaard, Lynda S.10aCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator with a shortened R domain rescues the intestinal phenotype of CFTR⁻/⁻ mice  ap. 2921-2926.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGene transfer could provide a novel therapeutic approach for cystic fibrosis (CF), and adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising vector. However, the packaging capacity of AAV limits inclusion of the full-length cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cDNA together with other regulatory and structural elements. To overcome AAV size constraints, we recently developed a shortened CFTR missing the N-terminal portion of the R domain (residues 708-759, CFTRΔR) and found that it retained regulated anion channel activity in vitro. To test the hypothesis that CFTRΔR could correct in vivo defects, we generated CFTR⁻/⁻ mice bearing a transgene with a fatty acid binding protein promoter driving expression of human CFTRΔR in the intestine (CFTR⁻/⁻;TgΔR). We found that intestinal crypts of CFTR⁻/⁻;TgΔR mice expressed CFTRΔR and the intestine appeared histologically similar to that of WT mice. Moreover, like full-length CFTR transgene, the CFTRΔR transgene produced CFTR Cl⁻ currents and rescued the CFTR⁻/⁻ intestinal phenotype. These results indicate that the N-terminal part of the CFTR R domain is dispensable for in vivo intestinal physiology. Thus, CFTRΔR may have utility for AAV-mediated gene transfer in CF.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achlorides 3acomplementary DNA 3acystic fibrosis 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3agene transfer 3ahumans 3aintestinal crypts 3amice 3apackaging 3aphenotype 3aphysiology 3atransgenes 3aviruses1 aMeyerholz, David K.1 aVermeer, Daniel W.1 aKarp, Philip H.1 aSchneider, Lindsey1 aSigmund, Curt D.1 aWelsh, Michael J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Feb. 15, v. 108, no. 7 p.2921-2926dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10197521083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02587naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245014700132300001600279500017900295500002400474520133800498650002501836650001201861650002401873650001801897650001701915650001201932650001901944650001701963651000901980651001001989651001801999773012302017852000902140856008802149655001202237IND4474198420221122232617.0131122s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447419842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnderhill, S.J.R.13aAn overview of postharvest research, extension and education capacity in the pacific with a focus on Western Samoa, Tonga and the Fiji islands  ap. 425-432.  aPaper presented at the Second Asia Pacific Symposium on Postharvest Research Education and Extension : APS2012, held September 18 - September 20, 2012, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  aIncludes references  aHistorically there has been limited institutional postharvest research, education and training in the South Pacific. In Fiji, Western Samoa and Tonga, of the three universities, four government ministries and one regional agency, that currently posses horticulture research, extension or training capacity, few have any dedicated postharvest specialists. While private-sector postharvest extension services do exist they are often fragmented and commonly limited to specific export-focused supply chains. In the last decade, increasing concerns about regional food security and a greater emphasis towards expanding horticultural trade and exports have resulted in significant investment in new postharvest infrastructure in the region. Since 2008, postharvest research infrastructure has been established in Western Samoa and in Tonga, coupled with ongoing donor assistance of private-sector postharvest-export infrastructure in Fiji. Unfortunately there has been desultory attention towards concurrently improving postharvest skills and training. This is of particular concern as it undermines the ultimate effectiveness of this investment, creating questionable sustainability. This paper reviews the current postharvest horticulture research and education capacity in the Pacific highlighting the key challenges and opportunities. 3aeducational research 3aexports 3aextension education 3afood security 3ahorticulture 3aislands 3aprivate sector 3auniversities 3aFiji 3aTonga 3aWestern Samoa0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Nov., , no. 1011 p.425-432dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1011/1011_54.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02555naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012500166300001600291520123400307592002801541650001501569650001401584650001901598650001001617650001301627650001801640650001301658650002001671650001401691650001301705650001601718650001201734653002901746653001101775653001501786653001701801653002801818700006201846700001701908773009001925856008502015852000902100655001202109IND60629985320221117234645.0191220e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062998532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Pin-Wei13aAn experimental study of the effect of nitrogen origin on the formation and reduction of NOx in fluidized-bed combustion  ap. 319-327.  aThe relative importance of char-N and volatile-N on NOx emissions is examined in a pilot-scale fluidized-bed combustor. Coke and toluene are used as the base fuels, and nitrogenous compounds (nitrobenzene, pyridine, and pyrrole) are mixed with them alternatively to study the effect of nitrogen origin on NOx formation and reduction. The results show that NOx evolution would be greatly changed if the nitrogenous species are present in the volatile, and NOx reduction inside the combustor may be the key factor that determines the final emissions. When nitrobenzene is employed, the conversion of volatile-N to NOx is 13.17–15.42%, while that of char-N is 4.49–7.59% in the bed temperature of 750–900 °C, indicating that nitrogen present in volatiles may be much more prone to elicit higher NOx. Moreover, the volatile-N conversion to NOx is always greater than that of char-N, regardless of the nitrogen functionality. However, the degree of formation and reduction of NOx would depend firmly on the functional groups of nitrogen, which are nitro, pyridine, and pyrrole in this case. NOx reduction mainly occurs in the splash zone, and NOx generated from char-N is reduced in a manner dissimilar to that of volatile-N.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aemissions 3afluidized beds 3afuels 3amoieties 3anitrobenzenes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3apyridines 3apyrroles 3atemperature 3atoluene 0aFluidized-bed combustion 0aChar-N 0aVolatile-N 0aNOx emission 0aNOx reduction mechanism1 aChyang, Chien-Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7879-677X1 aNi, Hung-Wen0 tEnergy.g2018 July 01, v. 154 p.319-327dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001600284520252700300592002802827650001702855650001302872650001902885650001102904650002402915650001402939650001202953650000902965650001302974650001202987650001102999650001203010650002903022650001103051650001703062700001903079700002203098773009103120856008103211852000903292655001203301IND50090099320221123035836.0151105e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009009932DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-013-9724-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrebs, Justin M.10aAssessing the Link Between Coastal Urbanization and the Quality of Nekton Habitat in Mangrove Tidal Tributaries  ap. 832-846.  aTo assess the potential influence of coastal development on habitat quality for estuarine nekton, we characterized body condition and reproduction for common nekton from tidal tributaries classified as undeveloped, industrial, urban or man-made (i.e., mosquito-control ditches). We then evaluated these metrics of nekton performance, along with several abundance-based metrics and community structure from a companion paper (Krebs et al. 2013) to determine which metrics best reflected variation in land-use and in-stream habitat among tributaries. Body condition was not significantly different among undeveloped, industrial, and man-made tidal tributaries for six of nine taxa; however, three of those taxa were in significantly better condition in urban compared to undeveloped tributaries. Palaemonetes shrimp were the only taxon in significantly poorer condition in urban tributaries. For Poecilia latipinna, there was no difference in body condition (length–weight) between undeveloped and urban tributaries, but energetic condition was significantly better in urban tributaries. Reproductive output was reduced for both P. latipinna (i.e., fecundity) and grass shrimp (i.e., very low densities, few ovigerous females) in urban tributaries; however a tradeoff between fecundity and offspring size confounded meaningful interpretation of reproduction among land-use classes for P. latipinna. Reproductive allotment by P. latipinna did not differ significantly among land-use classes. Canonical correspondence analysis differentiated urban and non-urban tributaries based on greater impervious surface, less natural mangrove shoreline, higher frequency of hypoxia and lower, more variable salinities in urban tributaries. These characteristics explained 36 % of the variation in nekton performance, including high densities of poeciliid fishes, greater energetic condition of sailfin mollies, and low densities of several common nekton and economically important taxa from urban tributaries. While variation among tributaries in our study can be largely explained by impervious surface beyond the shorelines of the tributary, variation in nekton metrics among non-urban tributaries was better explained by habitat factors within the tributary and along the shorelines. Our results support the paradigm that urban development in coastal areas has the potential to alter habitat quality in small tidal tributaries as reflected by variation in nekton performance among tributaries from representative land-use classes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalaemonetes 3aPoecilia 3abody condition 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahypoxia 3anekton 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3ashrimp 3aurbanization1 aBell, Susan S.1 aMcIvor, Carole C.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.832-846dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9724-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03005naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013400167500001900301520131900320592002801639650002101667650001701688650003501705650001201740650001301752650002101765650001601786653001801802653003501820653003101855653001301886653001501899653002801914653000801942653000801950653000801958653000801966653000801974653001001982653001201992700001702004700001702021700001402038700001602052700002002068700001202088700001302100700001502113700001702128700001902145700001602164700001302180700001302193773009002206856008602296852000902382655001202391IND60649480520221116145612.0190718e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064948052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2019.1024202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Wencui14aThe piggyBac-based double-inducible binary vector system: A novel universal platform for studying gene functions and interactions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEukaryotic inducible overexpression systems, including Tet-On and mifepristone-inducible systems, have been widely used to study gene functions by reverse genetics. Among the transposon systems reported to date, the piggyBac transposon system is one of the most efficient in cultured mammalian cells. Here, we report a piggyBac-based double-inducible system that combined the advantages of previous systems. To create this system, the trans- and cis-elements of the Tet-On and mifepristone-inducible systems were cloned into a piggyBac-based trans-vector and cis-vector, respectively. The coding regions of two splicing variants of RUNX1, RUNX1a and RUNX1b, were inserted into the cis-vector to test its ability to express foreign genes along with fluorescent marker proteins. Transgenic 293 T cells were established, and the system was tested by inducing expression of foreign genes with DOX and/or mifepristone; GFP and/or mCherry were used as reporter genes. The system efficiently and stringently induced expression of GFP/mCherry and their co-expressed genes without significant mutual interference, as determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. This piggyBac-based double-inducible system represents a new genetic tool for studying gene functions and interactions in vitro and in vivo in almost all organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3afluorescence 3agenetically modified organisms 3amammals 3aplasmids 3areverse genetics 3atransposons 0aTet-On system 0aMifepristone-inducible systems 0aEukaryotic gene expression 0apiggyBac 0aTransposon 0aDouble-inducible system 0aGFP 0aDOX 0aCMV 0aUAS 0aCDS 0aRUNX1 0aqRT-PCR1 aTeng, Jiawen1 aZeng, Jiahui1 aXue, Yuan1 aChang, Jing1 aZhang, Yonggang1 aPan, Xu1 aZhou, Ya1 aLai, Mowen1 aBian, Guohui1 aZhou, Qiongxiu1 aLiu, Jiaxin1 aChen, Bo1 aMa, Feng0 tPlasmid.g2019 Sept., v. 105 p.102420-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12341x0147-619X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2019.1024203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166300001800256520108100274592002801355650001401383650004401397650001601441650001101457650001001468650001301478650002201491650001201513650001501525650003301540650001101573650002101584650002101605653001301626653001401639653001101653653001401664653002301678700002301701700001701724700001401741700001901755700001701774700001701791773010501808856008401913852000901997655001202006IND60122276620221120205754.0150325e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012227662DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9274692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaya, Murat14aThe quick extraction of chitin from an epizoic crustacean species (Chelonibia patula)  ap. 2186-2190.  aChitin was isolated from the shells of Chelonibia patula (barnacle, Crustacea), which lives on blue crab epizoically, following a 10-min demineralisation process through HCl and a 20-min deproteinisation process through NaOH. Due to the low-crystalline structure, and mineral-rich and low-protein content of the shells, chitin isolation was convenient. It was observed that the shell structure of C. patula contains 3.11% chitin per its dry weight. Following characterisation of the isolated chitin by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffractometry, elemental analysis and scanning electron microscopy, it was determined that there was close similarity with the α-chitin isolated from crabs, shrimps and insects in various studies. It was observed that chitin was composed of nanofibres with a width of 10–20 nm. It was concluded that this was an economically advantageous chitin resource compared with crustaceans such as shrimp, crayfish and crab, because it is possible to isolate chitin in a significantly shorter time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3achitin 3acrabs 3acrayfish 3ahydrochloric acid 3ainsects 3ananofibers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrimp 3asodium hydroxide 3athermogravimetry 0abarnacle 0aisolation 0achitin 0ananofibre 0athermal properties1 aKaraarslan, Muhsin1 aBaran, Talat1 aCan, Esra1 aEkemen, Gulcin1 aBitim, Betul1 aDuman, Fatih0 tNatural product research.g2014 Dec. 2, v. 28, no. 23 p.2186-2190dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.9274693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245015500162300001600317520136100333592002801694650002001722650002501742650001101767650001101778650002901789650001601818650001301834651001001847653001501857653002301872653001501895653002001910653001501930700001801945700001701963700001501980773009001995856008502085852000902170655001202179IND60629985420221117234714.0191220e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062998542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Yu14aThe dynamic relationship between energy consumption, investment and economic growth in China's rural area: New evidence based on provincial panel data  ap. 374-382.  aThis study investigates the dynamic relationship between rural GDP, rural energy consumption and rural investment based on a provincial panel data set covering the 1995–2010 period. The vector error correction model (VECM) and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) are utilized to examine the short- and long-run causal relationship between the variables of interest. Then, the impulse response function (IRF) and variance analysis are used to examine the dynamic impact of the process and the contribution of relevant factors. The estimation results indicate that there is two-way Granger causality between rural GDP and rural investment and unilateral Granger causality extending from rural energy consumption to rural GDP and investment in the long term. Furthermore, the results also verify the existence of unidirectional causal relationship from rural GDP to rural investment and bilateral causal relationship between rural GDP and rural energy consumption in the short run. Hence, it is feasible for China to promote economic development through hastening the optimization and upgrading of its rural industrial structure and encouraging and promoting the use of green energy. Additionally, rural economic growth is helpful for stimulating rural investment and energy consumption, which in turn benefits economic development in rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3arural areas 3avariance 3aChina 0aRural area 0aEnergy consumption 0aInvestment 0aEconomic growth 0aPanel data1 aWang, Ling'ou1 aZhu, Lingyun1 aYe, Minjie0 tEnergy.g2018 July 01, v. 154 p.374-382dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010200210520179900312592002802111650001602139650001302155650002202168650001202190650001102202650001102213650001402224650001102238650002502249650002602274650002502300650002602325650001502351650001302366650001502379650002002394650001502414650002302429650001602452650001702468651001402485653002202499653001602521653002402537653002302561653002102584700001802605700002302623700001902646700001902665773010702684856008602791852000902877655001202886IND60696305820221118134806.0200601e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069630582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeery, Eliza C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5318-889010aEvaluating seaweed farming as an eco-engineering strategy for ‘blue’ shoreline infrastructure  aGreen spaces and agronomy have long been used in terrestrial urban environments to help mitigate the negative effects of urbanization on social-ecological systems. However, they represent an unexplored frontier in marine urban environments, which are also central to human–environment interactions in coastal cities. We evaluated the feasibility and potential environmental impacts of integrating small-scale seaweed farming into urban seawalls. We developed and tested the efficacy of a prototype “planter” unit for cultivating the red, agar-producing seaweed, Hydropuntia edulis, above its typical tidal range on urban seawalls in Singapore. Field trial results suggest that H. edulis can be successfully grown in the mid- and upper-intertidal zones on seawalls by using planters with water-retaining features. However, based on results from life cycle assessment (LCA) and integrated biological models of seaweed production, we found that the choice of materials for constructing planters and their positioning on the seawall were critical in determining net environmental impacts. Farmed seaweeds had an impressive capacity for carbon, nutrient, and metal uptake according to model estimates, but these benefits were outweighed by emissions from energy- and contaminant-intensive materials that are commonly used in seawall “eco-engineering.” At low tidal heights, farmed seaweeds were also more readily dislodged, potentially leading to greater flux of detrital biomass to adjacent systems. This work highlights both the potential of seaweed farming for enhancing the multifunctionality of urban waterfronts, and the importance of objectively weighing overall environmental consequences of such approaches before advancing them as eco-engineering solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydropuntia 3aagronomy 3abiological models 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acities 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afield experimentation 3agreen infrastructure 3alife cycle assessment 3amacroalgae 3aplanters 3aprototypes 3aseaweed culture 3ashorelines 3asocial environment 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aSingapore 0aUrban agriculture 0aAquaculture 0aMarine urbanization 0aShoreline armoring 0aCoastal defenses1 aLian, Kay Yee1 aLoke, Lynette H.L.1 aTan, Hugh T.W.1 aTodd, Peter A.0 tEcological engineering.g2020 June 01, v. 152 p.105857-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009700169300001600266520184200282592002802124650000802152650001902160650001602179650002702195650002602222650001902248650002102267650001902288650001802307650001102325650001802336650001802354650001002372650001702382650002902399650001602428650001902444653002302463653002102486653002302507653002102530653002102551700005802572773011602630856008702746852000902833655001202842IND60611509620221117181420.0200712e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061150962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, In-guk,10aSpent nuclear fuel with a hybrid heat pipe for electricity generation and thermal management  ap. 233-243.  aThe global warming resulting from the emission of the greenhouse gases has led to tightened restrictions on the use of fossil. Therefore, renewable energy for new energy sources is being widely investigated. However, renewable energy has limitations such as location, environmental conditions, and the potential construction of a new electricity grid. Spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is one of the potential new energy candidates that does not emit the greenhouse gases or suffer from limitations of other renewable energy sources. In this research, generating electricity by using SNF is suggested with a hybrid heat pipe system. Thermal energy from SNF worldwide is ∼750 MWth; however, this energy is not used as an energy source but just removed by chilling in water or in air in storage facilities. To achieve electricity generation from SNF, a dry storage cask with heat pipes and a Stirling engine (UCAN, UNIST CANister) are designed. Using a 1/10-scale test facility, the experimental test of heat transfer and electricity generation as the module of the storage system is conducted. The results yield good agreement with those predicted by the thermal resistance network model, and the electricity generation of the Stirling engine is in the range from 2.3% to 3.2% of the total heat load. The calculated temperature distributions are a good agreement, deviating within 12.2%, and the cooling efficiencies range from 17.51% to 26.33%. The results show the advantages of the use of SNF and its effects, focusing on thermal management and energy generation. The amount of SNF will gradually increase because of the continued operation of nuclear power plants. The usable heat from the SNF is generated due to the decay of fission products during at least several hundred years, which enables to use the SNF as one of the energy sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acold treatment 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenvironmental factors 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat tolerance 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3anuclear fuels 3anuclear power 3apipes 3apower plants 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aThermal management 0aPower generation 0aSpent nuclear fuel 0aDry storage cask 0aHybrid heat pipe1 aBang, In Cheol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5776-84380 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 173 p.233-243dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010600168300001600274520180700290592002802097650001402125650002102139650002302160650001202183650001702195650001302212650001102225650002402236650000902260650001302269650001302282650001102295650002202306650001202328650001702340700002202357700001902379773009102398856008102489852000902570655001202579IND50090099520221119032138.0151105e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009009952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-013-9726-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrebs, Justin M.10aNekton Community Structure Varies in Response to Coastal Urbanization Near Mangrove Tidal Tributaries  ap. 815-831.  aTo assess the potential influence of coastal development on estuarine-habitat quality, we characterized land use and the intensity of land development surrounding small tidal tributaries in Tampa Bay. Based on this characterization, we classified tributaries as undeveloped, industrial, urban, or man-made (i.e., mosquito-control ditches). Over one third (37 %) of the tributaries have been heavily developed based on landscape development intensity (LDI) index values >5.0, while fewer than one third (28 %) remain relatively undeveloped (LDI < 3.0). We then examined the nekton community from 11 tributaries in watersheds representing the four defined land-use classes. Whereas mean nekton density was independent of land use, species richness and nekton-community structure were significantly different between urban and non-urban (i.e., undeveloped, industrial, man-made) tributaries. In urban creeks, the community was species-poor and dominated by high densities of poeciliid fishes, Poecilia latipinna and Gambusia holbrooki, while typically dominant estuarine taxa including Menidia spp., Fundulus grandis, and Adinia xenica were in low abundance and palaemonid grass shrimp were nearly absent. Densities of economically important taxa in urban creeks were only half that observed in five of the six undeveloped or industrial creeks, but were similar to those observed in mosquito ditches suggesting that habitat quality in urban and mosquito-ditch tributaries is suboptimal compared to undeveloped tidal creeks. Furthermore, five of nine common taxa were rarely collected in urban creeks. Our results suggest that urban development in coastal areas has the potential to alter the quality of habitat for nekton in small tidal tributaries as reflected by variation in the nekton community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aFundulus grandis 3aGambusia holbrooki 3aMenidia 3aPalaemonetes 3aPoecilia 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3afish 3ahabitats 3aland use 3anekton 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 3aurbanization1 aMcIvor, Carole C.1 aBell, Susan S.0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.815-831dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9726-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245011100170300001600281520187800297592002802175650001402203650001902217650002202236650001302258650002102271650001502292650002402307650001302331650001802344650001002362650002202372650001402394650002502408650001402433650001502447651001302462651001002475700002202485700002502507700001902532700002102551773013602572856007602708852000902784655001202793IND60594715120221119111700.0180522e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059471512DNAL7 a10.1656/058.016.04072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith-Hicks, Kathryn N.10aNest Height and Vertical Vegetation Associated with Black-capped Vireo Breeding Success in Southwest Texas  ap. 567-583.  aVireo atricapilla (Black-capped Vireo) is an endangered songbird whose habitat use has been well studied in central portions of its breeding range, which is characterized by successional vegetation communities. To expand our understanding of habitat use as it relates to reproductive success, we studied Black-capped Vireo habitat use at the territory and nest-site scales in southwest Texas in 2009 and 2010, an area characterized by xeric and stable vegetation communities. We measured vegetation in territories and at nests to evaluate the influence of habitat variables on nest parasitism and nest survival. Our results showed that Black-capped Vireo nest-site use in southwest Texas differed from that in breeding areas of central Texas and Oklahoma. Black-capped Vireos in southwest Texas used nest sites with a wide range of woody cover (70 ± 13%) and used Juniperus spp. (junipers) as a nest substrate proportionately more than its availability in territories, which is contradictory to previously published literature. Nest parasitism increased significantly with greater nest height, likely due to increased visibility to Molothrus ater (Brown-headed Cowbird). Increasing height of vertical cover above the nest was associated with decreased overall nest survival, likely because nests placed in habitat with taller vegetation are more susceptible to avian predators and Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism. Unlike the findings of studies conducted in the northern part of the species' breeding range, we found that parasitism did not increase the likelihood of depredation or abandonment. Our results indicate that Black-capped Vireo habitat structure and composition, as well as factors influencing nest success in Southwest Texas, differ from their breeding habitat in central Texas and Oklahoma, indicating that management guidelines need to be regi on-specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus 3aMolothrus ater 3aVireo atricapilla 3abreeding 3abrood parasitism 3aguidelines 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3anesting sites 3anests 3aplant communities 3apredators 3areproductive success 3asongbirds 3avegetation 3aOklahoma 3aTexas1 aConkling, Tara J.1 aMorrison, Michael L.1 aCain, James W.1 aWilkins, R.

Cows with ear tags ending with even digits at calving were enrolled in Presynch-10 (Presynch-10): two 25-mg injections of PGF₂α (i.e., PG-1 and PG-2) 14 d apart. Cows with ear tags ending with odd digits were enrolled in PG-3-G: one 25-mg injection of PG (Pre-PG) 3 d before injection of 100μg of GnRH (Pre-GnRH), with the Pre-PG injection administered at the same time as PG-2 in the Presynch-10 treatment. Ten days after PG-2 or Pre-PG, all cows were enrolled in a timed AI protocol (Ovsynch-56; injection of GnRH 7 d before GnRH-1 and 56 h after GnRH-2 PG with AI 16 to 18 h after GnRH-2). Median days in milk (DIM) at scheduled timed AI were 75 d, which did not differ among herds. Cows detected in estrus before the scheduled timed AI were inseminated early (early bred, EB). Pregnancy was diagnosed at d 32 to 38 and at d 60 to 66 after timed AI by transrectal ultrasonography or transrectal palpation. Data were analyzed with herd as a random effect and with fixed effects of treatment (EB, Presynch-10, or PG-3-G), parity (primiparous vs. multiparous), season [hot (June through September) vs. cool-cold (October through May)], DIM, estrus at timed AI (0 vs. 1), and all 2-way interactions with treatment. The P/AI at d 32 to 38 for EB (n=472), Presynch-10 (n=1,247), and PG-3-G (n=1,286) were 31.4, 35.0, and 41.2%, respectively; P/AI at d 60 to 66 was 29.8, 32.2, and 37.3%, respectively. Season significantly influenced P/AI at d 32 to 38 and d 60 to 66, but a treatment by season interaction was not detected. The P/AI for PG-3-G and Presynch-10 treatments did not differ during cool-cold weather (d 32 to 38: 46.8 vs. 44.3%; d 60 to 66: 41.6 vs. 41.1%, respectively), but PG-3-G and Presynch-10 produced more P/AI than EB at d 32 to 38. During the summer, P/AI in PG-3-G was greater than in Presynch-10 (d 32 to 38: 35.9 vs. 26.7% and d 60 to 66: 33.2 vs. 24.4%, respectively), and P/AI in EB cows did not differ from that of Presynch-10 cows. Although pregnancy loss did not differ for EB, Presynch-10, and PG-3-G treatments (4.0, 6.7, and 9.3%, respectively), pregnancy loss from d 32 to 38 and d 60 to 66 was 2-fold greater in thinner cows (<2.5 vs. ≥2.5; 9.0 vs. 4.4%). We concluded that presynchronizing estrous cycles with PG-3-G produced more P/AI than inseminating cows at estrus during cooler weather and was superior to Presynch-10 during the summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3acalving 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3aear tags 3aestrus 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3alactation 3apregnancy 3aprostaglandins 3asummer 3aultrasonography 3aweather1 aPulley, S.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Nov., v. 95, no. 11 p.6513-6522dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-57073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001500192245008200207500002200289506007600311520222500387592002802612506003702640650002502677650001702702650001102719650001802730650001502748650002102763650001802784650001102802650001702813650001402830650001202844650000902856650002102865650001302886650002402899650000902923650001102932650001502943650002002958650002002978650002002998651001003018700001703028700001703045773008403062856008603146852000903232655001203241IND60609494120221207144921.0190318s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060949412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.12.0042doi7 aPMC65882202pmcid7 a312932812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanham, D.10aCities as hotspots of indirect water consumption: The case study of Hong Kong  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the last years, the city of Hong Kong has made large investments to make its urban water supply system more water efficient and sustainable. As such, its municipal water abstraction – often defined as direct water use – has decreased from 355 litre per capita per day (l/cap/d) in 2005 to 326 l/cap/d in 2013. Due to its political history, Hong Kong is unique in the world in data availability on urban food consumption. It is therefore the ideal case study to show typical urban food consumption behaviour and its related indirect water use. The objective of this paper is to show the large water quantities associated with indirect water use and that the citizens of Hong Kong can additionally save much more water by looking at this indirect water use. The current average diet in Hong Kong is very different to the average Chinese diet. It is characterised by a high intake of water intensive products like animal products and sugar, leading to a food related indirect water use or water footprint (WFcons) of 4727 l/cap/d. According to recommendations from the Chinese Nutrition Society for a healthy diet, the intake of some product groups should be increased (vegetables and fruit) and of other product groups reduced (sugar, crop oils, meat and animal fats). This would result in a reduction of the WFcons of 40% to 2852 l/cap/d. Especially the reduced intake of meat (including offals) from currently 126 kg per capita per year (kg/cap/yr) to the recommended value 27 kg/cap/yrwould results in a substantial WFcons reduction. Meat consumption in Hong Kong is extremely high. A pesco-vegetarian diet would result in a reduction of 49% (to 2398 l/cap/d) and a vegetarian diet in a 53% (to 2224 l/cap/d) reduction. Hong Kong citizens can thus save a lot of water through a change in their diet. Many of the products consumed, contribute to different levels of blue water scarcity in the regions of origin Hong Kong imports from. This poses a water-related risk to food security in Hong Kong. As all diet scenarios also result in a lower blue WFcons, they decrease this risk. In order to become sustainable, (mega)cities should reduce their dependency on distant resources and ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal fats and oils 3acase studies 3acities 3aeating habits 3aecosystems 3afood consumption 3afood security 3afruits 3ahealthy diet 3ahydrology 3aimports 3ameat 3ameat consumption 3apolitics 3apublic water supply 3arisk 3asugars 3avegetables 3avegetarian diet 3awater footprint 3awater shortages 3aChina1 aGawlik, B.M.1 aBidoglio, G.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013200168300001600300500001500316520138400331592002801715650001201743650001001755650001401765650001001779650002601789650001301815650002201828650001801850650001101868650002601879650001501905650001301920650001401933650001101947651001201958653001601970700002301986700002302009700002302032700002802055773009102083856008102174852000902255655001202264IND50090099620221119032252.0151105e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009009962DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-013-9727-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrexler, Michael10aBiological Assessment of Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) Inhabiting Reef, Mangrove, Seawall, and Restoration Substrates  ap. 962-972.  a2019-12-05  aThe eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, plays an essential functional role in many estuarine ecosystems on the east and Gulf coasts of the USA. Oysters form biogenic reefs but also live on alternative intertidal substrates such as artificial surfaces and mangrove prop roots. The hypothesis tested in this study was that non-reef-dwelling oysters (i.e., those inhabiting mangrove, seawall, or restoration substrates) were similar to their reef-dwelling counterparts based upon a suite of biological parameters. The study was carried out at six sites in three zones in Tampa Bay on the west coast of Florida using monthly samples collected from October 2008–September 2009. The timing of gametogenesis and spawning, fecundity, and juvenile recruitment were the same for oysters in all four habitats. Oyster size (measured as shell height), density, and Perkinsus marinus infection intensity and prevalence varied among habitats. This study indicates that oysters on mangroves, seawalls, and oyster restoration substrates contribute larvae, habitats for other species, and likely other ecosystem benefits similar to those of intertidal oyster reefs in Tampa Bay. Oysters from alternative intertidal substrates should be included in any system wide studies of oyster abundance, clearance rates, and the provision of alternate habitats, especially in highly developed estuaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoysters 3aroots 3afecundity 3areefs 3abiological assessment 3aspawning 3aPerkinsus marinus 3agametogenesis 3acoasts 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3aestuaries 3alarvae 3aFlorida 0arecruitment1 aParker, Melanie L.1 aGeiger, Stephen P.1 aArnold, William S.1 aMuller, Pamela Hallock,0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.962-972dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9727-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009700175300001800272520112500290592002801415650002001443650001301463650002201476650001301498650002001511650001501531650001201546650001301558650001901571650001701590653004301607653001701650653001801667700001401685700002201699700002401721773010501745856008401850852000901934655001201943IND60122276920221120235726.0150325e20141202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012227692DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9282922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalah El Dine, Riham10aTriterpenes as uncompetitive inhibitors of α-glucosidase from flowers of Punica granatum L.  ap. 2191-2194.  aThe α-glucosidase and maltase inhibitory effects of Punica granatum L. flowers (PGF) were investigated. The methanol extract (PGFMe), n -hexane extract (PGFH), chloroform extract (PGFC) and the remaining water fraction (PGFW) were assayed for their α-glucosidase and maltase inhibitory effects. PGFW showed potent α-glucosidase inhibition with IC ₅₀ of 0.8 μg/mL followed by PGFMe (IC ₅₀ of 4.0 μg/mL) then PGFC (IC ₅₀ of 5.21 μg/mL) in comparison to acarbose (0.9 μM). Due to its selectivity towards α-glucosidase, PGFC was subjected to bioactivity-guided isolation of its main active constituents. Five known compounds (1 – 5) were identified as β-sitosterol (1), oleanolic acid (2), ursolic acid (3), p -coumaric acid (4) and apigenin (5). Ursolic and oleanolic acids showed potent α-glucosidase inhibition (IC ₅₀ of 39.0 and 35.0 μM, respectively), while they did not show significant maltase inhibition. Kinetic study using the double Lineweaver–Burk plot revealed that ursolic acid uncompetitively inhibited α-glucosidase in comparison with acarbose as a competitive inhibitor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPunica granatum 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aapigenin 3abeta-sitosterol 3achloroform 3aflowers 3amethanol 3aoleanolic acid 3aursolic acid 0aPunica granatum flower; α-glucosidase 0aursolic acid 0auncompetitive1 aMa, Qiong1 aKandil, Zeinab A.1 aEl-Halawany, Ali M.0 tNatural product research.g2014 Dec. 2, v. 28, no. 23 p.2191-2194dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2014.9282923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01308naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008900159300002000248520035300268592002800621650002000649650001100669650001300680650002200693650001700715650001700732700001700749700002000766773012400786856007500910852000900985655001200994IND60665119620221119235323.0220325e20140725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066511962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra05311g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhba, Tomonori12aA new route to nanoscale ceramics in asymmetric reaction fields of carbon nanospaces  ap. 32647-32650.  aWe fabricated nanoscale BaTiO₃ and its asymmetric crystal structure was obtained using an asymmetric reaction field in carbon nanospaces.

Chronic kidney disease impairs adaptive and innate immunity. Thus, patients with chronic kidney disease are prone to opportunistic infections by potentially pathogenic FLA. Therefore, in the present study, the investigation of Acanthamoeba genotypes isolated from the oral cavity of hemodialysis patients of reference hospitals in Iran was aimed, using both morphology and molecular (sequence-based analysis) tools. Furthermore, classification of the strains at the genotype level was performed on the basis of differences in the diagnostic fraction 3 (DF3) region of the 18S rRNA gene. The pathogenic potential of the isolated amoebae was also determined using thermotolerance and osmotolerance assays. Out of the 187 oral cavity samples investigated, nine (4.8%) were positive for FLA. DNA sequencing of the ASA.A1 region of the 18S rRNA gene revealed that the isolated strains belonged to the Acanthamoeba T1 and T4 genotypes. Genotype T1 was isolated for the first time from a patient in Iran. Interestingly, the T1 strain (AN2 strain) exhibits a high pathogenic potential in tolerance assays. The pathogenicity assay revealed that five strains were able to grow at high temperatures (37–40 °C) and high osmolarity (0.5 and 1 M D-mannitol) conditions; thus, they were considered as potentially pathogenic strains. Moreover, two of the patients were positive for Vermamoeba genus. The present study is the first report of genotype T1 isolation in Iran and the first to identify the occurrence of Acanthamoeba and Vermamoeba genera in patients undergoing hemodialysis worldwide. Monitoring hemodialysis and renal failure patients should be a priority for possible control of Acanthamoeba and other FLA-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3agenes 3agenotype 3aheat tolerance 3ahemodialysis 3ainnate immunity 3amannitol 3amonitoring 3amouth 3aosmolarity 3aosmotolerance 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3arenal failure 3aribosomal RNA 3asecondary infection 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3avirulent strains 3aIran1 aArab-Mazar, Zahra1 aLasjerdi, Zohreh1 aLorenzo-Morales, Jacob1 aEspotin, Adel1 aYadegarynia, Davood1 aGachkar, Latif1 aRahmati Roodsari, Sara0 tParasitology research.g2017 Nov., v. 116, no. 11 p.2965-2969dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-017-5605-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012200154300001800276500002000294520132600314592002801640596006501668596005101733596005401784596005501838596005301893596002201946650001201968650000901980650001401989650001302003650001702016650001202033650001402045650001702059651001502076651001202091700002602103700001502129700001902144700001402163700001402177700001602191773012402207856007402331852000902405655001202414IND60786992420221116173536.0220807e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078699242DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.134582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhodes, K.10aGoldspotted spinefoot Siganus punctatus (Siganidae) age‐based reproductive life history and fisheries vulnerability  ap. 1392-1406.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBetween February 2015 and 2016, samples of the Indo‐Pacific goldspotted spinefoot Siganus punctatus were taken from local fish markets, feeding sites and nursery grounds on the main island of Pohnpei, Micronesia, to ascertain sexual pattern, reproductive seasonality, age, growth and mortality. Microscopic examinations of gonads identified two seasonal peaks in reproduction: February to May and September to December, with evidence of some spawning activity in most months. Ripe females were observed 4 days on either side of the new moon. Females first matured at c. 180 mm fork length (LF) and 1 year of age, which coincides with their entry into the fishery. Ninety five per cent of individuals were less than 3 years and the oldest fish were 8 years. To examine the species vulnerability to fishing, a tag‐and‐recapture study was conducted over 4 months in 2015 in a locally managed marine area and at an unprotected site. Findings suggest high residency and high vulnerability to fishing at shallow‐water feeding sites and restricted migration overall. The placement of marine protected areas within critical habitat appears to be an effective conservation strategy for this species, particularly when combined with gear and seasonal market restrictions during vulnerable life‐history phases.  aPublisher supplied data  a0302.14.044364cNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF)  aNA14NMF4270055cThe NOAA Saltenstall‐Kennedy  cPohnpei State Office of Fisheries and Aquaculture  cFSM Department of Marine Resources and Development  cDepartment of Lands and Natural Resources (DLNR)  cNan Wap Community 3aSiganus 3afish 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3alife history 3amarkets 3amortality 3areproduction 3aMicronesia 3aPohnpei1 aHernandez‐Ortiz, D.1 aIoanis, M.1 aWashington, W.1 aMaxim, S.1 aOlpet, K.1 aMalakai, S.0 tJournal of fish biology.g2017 Nov., v. 91, no. 5 p.1392-1406dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.134583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014200167300001800309520169500327592002802022650001702050650001202067650001002079650001002089650000902099650001502108650000902123650001402132650001902146650001402165650000902179650002202188650001102210651001102221700001802232773009302250856008102343852000902424655001202433IND50090099720221119032159.0151105e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009009972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-013-9728-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Melisa C.10aRole of Invasive Green Crabs in the Food Web of an Intertidal Sand Flat Determined from Field Observations and a Dynamic Simulation Model  ap. 1004-1016.  aA benthic focussed food web model of intermediate complexity was developed for the intertidal sand flat in the Kejimkujik National Park Seaside, NS, Canada. The goal was to understand the role of invasive green crabs and to investigate potential effects of its removal on the ecosystem. Inputs of biomass, production, consumption and diet composition for each model compartment were obtained through targeted field collections in summers 2008–2010. Simulation (via Ecosim) was used to develop a data-driven baseline steady-state food web of summer conditions and to evaluate effects of ecosystem perturbations that included moderate and extreme removal of crab biomass, in the presence and absence of migrating shorebirds. In the baseline model, green crabs were important benthic predators and also prey for fishes and birds. Ecosystem properties (e.g. size, energetics, organisation) suggested a stable ecosystem. Scenario analyses predicted that crab removal caused only slight perturbations to overall ecosystem properties, but affected some trophic components. Predators that consumed mainly crabs (e.g. gulls) decreased in biomass with crab removal because diet changes could not compensate for lost crab prey. Predators that consumed crabs and also other prey (e.g. plovers) increased in biomass with crab removal because shared benthic prey increased. Migrating shorebirds had a greater impact on the food web than crab removal. Our study suggests that removal of invasive green crabs will likely not drastically change food web biomass and productivity. This study illustrates how field data can be synthesised with food web models for effective management of coastal ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharadriidae 3abiomass 3abirds 3acrabs 3adiet 3aecosystems 3afish 3afood webs 3anational parks 3apredators 3asand 3asimulation models 3asummer 3aCanada1 aDowd, Michael0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2014 July, v. 37, no. 4 p.1004-1016dSpringer USx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-013-9728-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011600162500001400278520157800292592002801870650001501898650001401913650001301927650001701940650001301957650002501970650003001995650002402025650000902049650001302058650001402071650001902085650001702104650002002121650004302141653003202184653001002216653001002226653001902236700001602255700001702271700001602288700001202304700002002316700001302336700001502349700001202364700001302376773009802389856008202487852000902569655001202578IND60713062620221120103319.0201104e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071306262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1184882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Dong10aNorcantharidin protects against renal interstitial fibrosis by suppressing TWEAK-mediated Smad3 phosphorylation  aNAL-light  aThis study investigated the role and mechanism of action of tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) in the pathogenesis of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF), and its involvement in the anti-RIF effect of norcantharidin (NCTD).Mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction and BUMPT mouse proximal tubular cells exposed to transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were used as in vivo and in vitro models of RIF, respectively. NCTD was administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (0.075 mg kg⁻¹·day⁻¹). Hematoxylin–eosin and Masson's trichrome staining were performed to assess pathologic changes in the kidney. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time PCR were performed to evaluate the expression of TWEAK and the fibrotic factors fibronectin (FN) and collagen type I (Col-I). The role of TWEAK in RIF and in the anti-RIF effect of NCTD was evaluated by TWEAK overexpression and neutralization with a specific antibody, and specific inhibitor of Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)3 (SIS3) was used to examine the involvement of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling.TWEAK was mainly expressed in renal tubules in mice; the level was markedly elevated in both in vivo and in vitro RIF models. TWEAK overexpression in BUMPT cells increased the levels of phosphorylated Smad3, FN, and Col-I, which were reduced by treatment with SIS3. NCTD suppressed FN and Col-I expression by blocking TWEAK-mediated Smad3 phosphorylation.Upregulation of TWEAK contributes to RIF by promoting Smad3 phosphorylation, while NCTD inhibits this process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3acollagen 3afibronectins 3afibrosis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amechanism of action 3amice 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aneutralization 3apathogenesis 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aRenal interstitial fibrosis 0aTWEAK 0aSmad3 0aNorcantharidin1 aXiao, Zheng1 aXu, Qianqian1 aLuo, Hanwen1 aWen, Lu1 aTang, Chengyuan1 aShan, Yi1 aTian, Jiao1 aWei, Ju1 aLi, Ying0 tLife sciences.g2020 Nov. 01, v. 260 p.118488-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1184883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01745naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008000165300001800245520078200263592002801045650001901073650002301092650001501115650001101130650001401141700001701155700001801172700002001190773009601210856008101306990002301387852000901410655001201419IND60093902120221119021050.0141104e20130720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009390212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2013.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Woo-Suk10aEnergy harvester using PZT nanotubes fabricated by template-assisted method  ap.

An empirical study of nine industries in OECD countries  ap. 381-388.  aThis study analyzed the relationship between the CO2 emissions of different industries and economic growth in OECD countries from 1970 to 2005. We tested an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and found that total CO2 emissions from nine industries show an N-shaped trend instead of an inverted U or monotonic increasing trend with increasing income. The EKC hypothesis for sector-level CO2 emissions was supported in the (1) paper, pulp, and printing industry; (2) wood and wood products industry; and (3) construction industry. We also found that emissions from coal and oil increase with economic growth in the steel and construction industries. In addition, the non-metallic minerals, machinery, and transport equipment industries tend to have increased emissions from oil and electricity with economic growth. Finally, the EKC turning point and the relationship between GDP per capita and sectoral CO2 emissions differ among industries according to the fuel type used. Therefore, environmental policies for CO2 reduction must consider these differences in industrial characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aconstruction industry 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3aenvironmental policy 3aequipment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aincome 3aminerals 3aoils 3apaper 3apulp 3apulp and paper industry 3asteel 3awood 0aEnvironmental Kuznets curve 0aCO2 emissions 0aIndustrial sector1 aManagi, Shunsuke0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 June, v. 57 p.381-388dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2013.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245018800173300001600361520134800377592002801725650004301753650001901796650001801815650001801833650002701851650001801878650001601896650001101912650001901923650001701942650000901959650001101968650001401979650002001993650001302013650001302026650001302039650001502052650001402067650001202081650000902093650001302102650002502115650000902140773014102149856008702290852000902377655001202386IND60608789920221122131809.0200511e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060878992DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2011.115127572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMostafa, M.

Mixtures of KH and FYM were applied at the rates of 50 kg KH + 25 metric tonnes (MT) FYM, 50 kg KH + 50 MT FYM, 100 kg KH + 25 MT FYM, and 100 kg KH + 50 MT FYM ha–¹. No mineral-N fertiliser was included in any of these treatments. In addition, the recommended dose of mineral-N fertiliser was used as a control. Significant positive effects of 100 kg KH + 50 MT FYM ha–¹ were observed on shoot dry weight (DW) plant–¹, root DW plant–¹, leaf free proline content, leaf mineral composition (N, P, K, Fe, Mn, and Zn), leaf and fruit nitrite (NO₂–) and nitrate (NO₃–) contents, total fruit yield ha–¹, and fruit vitamin C and total soluble solids (TSS) contents when compared with the other three KH + FYM treatments. In contrast, there were no significant differences in these parameters between the 100 kg KH + 50 MT FYM ha–¹ and the recommended mineral-N fertiliser treatments, except for leaf and fruit NO₂– and NO₃– contents, where significant reductions occurred in the 100 kg KH + 50 MT FYM treatment.

Regulation of HIFs are traditionally considered to occur post-translationally, but we have recently shown that HIF-2α is unconventionally regulated also at the transcriptional level in neuroblastoma cells. Regulatory factors binding directly to EPAS1 (encoding HIF-2α) to promote transcription are yet to be defined. Here, we employ the novel CRISPR/Cas9-based engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) – mass spectrometry (MS) methodology to, in an unbiased fashion, identify proteins that associate with the EPAS1 promoter under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Our enChIP analysis resulted in 27 proteins binding to the EPAS1 promoter in neuroblastoma cells. In agreement with a general hypoxia-driven downregulation of gene transcription, the majority (24 out of 27) of proteins dissociate from the promoter at hypoxia. Among them were several nucleosome-associated proteins suggesting a general opening of chromatin as one explanation to induced EPAS1 transcription at hypoxia. Of particular interest from the list of released factors at hypoxia was the highly divergent homeobox (HDX) transcription factor, that we show inversely correlates with HIF-2α in neuroblastoma cells. We propose a putative model where HDX negatively regulates EPAS1 expression through a release-of-inhibition mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3achromatin 3agene expression regulation 3ahypoxia 3amass spectrometry 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aenChIP 0aHIF-2α 0aHDX 0aMYCN 0aHypoxia 0aNeuroblastoma1 aVaapil, Marica1 avon Stedingk, Kristoffer1 aFujita, Toshitsugu1 aPersson, Camilla U.1 aEriksson, Pontus1 aVeerla, Srinivas1 aDe Preter, Katleen1 aSpeleman, Frank1 aFujii, Hodaka1 aPåhlman, Sven1 aMohlin, Sofie0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 May 05, v. 499, no. 2 p.291-298dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.1503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245009100169300001800260520118800278592002801466650001501494650002401509650002801533650001601561650001501577650001101592650001201603650001101615650002301626650002001649650001401669650001901683650001401702650001001716700001701726700002301743700006201766700005901828773017001887856008002057852000902137655001202146IND60601971620221122080452.0180709e20180228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060197162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.7b047882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoong, Steve Z. Y.12aA Systematic Approach for the Synthesis and Optimization of Palm Oil Milling Processes  ap. 2945-2955.  aA palm oil mill (POM) requires large amounts of steam and electricity to convert fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) into multiple products. During the extraction of crude palm oil (CPO) from FFBs, byproducts such as empty fruit bunch (EFB), palm kernel shell (PKS), etc., and palm oil mill effluent (POME) are generated. In the past decades, palm oil millers have attempted various improvements in milling technologies individually and collectively to enhance extraction efficiency to meet the process and product requirements. However, oil lost in the milling process remains the major issue in POM and leads to huge loss of profit. In order to address such issue, oil recovery technologies were introduced and implemented in the current POM. Nevertheless, such technologies come with additional capital investment and operating costs that may outweigh the profit generated. Therefore, in this work, a systematic approach is presented to synthesize the palm oil milling processes with oil recovery technologies which is technically feasible and economically viable. Multiperiod consideration is also incorporated in the optimization model to address the variation in feedstock availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3aeconomic investment 3aeconomic sustainability 3aelectricity 3afeedstocks 3afruits 3amilling 3amodels 3aoil mill effluents 3aoperating costs 3apalm oils 3aprocess design 3araw fruit 3asteam1 aLam, Yi Ling1 aAndiappan, Viknesh1 aFoo, Dominic C.

The present study quantifies the dynamics of pesticide loads in a tropical river during three runoff events. To elucidate the processes involved in pesticide transport from agricultural fields to the stream water we used a high temporal resolution of sampling (1h) and applied a time series analysis. Water samples were analyzed for seven pesticides (atrazine, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, dichlorvos, α- and β-endosulfan). Six of the seven pesticides were detected in the river water. Only dichlorvos was below the detection limit in all samples. In particular, pesticides with low Kₒc value such as atrazine and dimethoate were transported during the runoff peaks. In case of chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, α- and β-endosulfan and cypermethrin, short concentration peaks lasting about 1h were detected during the falling limbs of the runoff peaks, indicating that a fast and sporadic sub-surface flow component (e.g., preferential interflow) plays an important role as a transport pathway. Our study demonstrates that in tropical areas sampling schemes with a high temporal resolution are needed to adequately assess the pesticide contamination of rivers. Otherwise, extreme situations may remain unsampled.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aatrazine 3achlorothalonil 3achlorpyrifos 3acypermethrin 3adetection limit 3adichlorvos 3adimethoate 3alowlands 3ariver water 3arivers 3arunoff 3astreams 3asubsurface flow 3atime series analysis 3atropics 3awater pollution 3aThailand1 aHugenschmidt, C.1 aIngwersen, J.1 aSchwadorf, K.1 aThavornyutikarn, P.1 aPansombat, K.1 aStreck, T.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 158 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.x0167-88097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2012.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245011800158500001900276520182300295592002802118650002002146650001502166650001102181650001702192650001502209700001502224700001702239773015902256856007602415852000902491655001202500IND60703101220221120221110.0200720e20200409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070310122DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90402312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xianjin 10aRecognizing Linear Building Patterns in Topographic Data by Using Two New Indices based on Delaunay Triangulation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBuilding pattern recognition is fundamental to a wide range of downstream applications, such as urban landscape evaluation, social analyses, and map generalization. Although many studies have been conducted, there is still a lack of satisfactory results, due to the imprecision of the relative direction model of any two adjacent buildings and the ineffective extraction methods. This study aims to provide an alternative for quantifying the direction and the spatial continuity of any two buildings on the basis of the Delaunay triangulation for the recognition of linear building patterns. First, constrained Delaunay triangulations (CDTs) are created for all buildings within each block and every two adjacent buildings. Then, the spatial continuity index (SCI), the direction index (DI), and other spatial relations (e.g., distance) of every two adjacent buildings are derived using the CDT. Finally, the building block is modelled as a graph based on derived matrices, and a graph segmentation approach is proposed to extract linear building patterns. In the segmentation process, the edges of the graph are removed first, according to the global thresholds of the SCI and distance, and are subsequently subdivided into subgraphs on direction rules. The proposed method is tested using three datasets. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method can recognize both collinear and curvilinear building patterns, given that the correctness values are all above 92% for the three study areas. The results also demonstrate that the novel SCI can effectively filter many insignificant neighbor relationships in the graph segmentation process. It is noteworthy that the proposed DI is capable of measuring building relative directions accurately and works efficiently in linear building pattern extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aspatial data 3atopography1 aDeng, Min 1 aLuo, Guowei 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Apr. 09, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90402313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001100148245013200159300001100291520132100302592002801623596009401651596005001745596008001795596005901875650001501934650001601949650001701965650001501982650000901997650001902006650001502025650002002040650001002060700002002070700001902090700001602109700001902125700001902144773009302163856008302256852000902339655001202348IND60786498320221121223503.0221002e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078649832DNAL7 a10.1186/s12284-022-00588-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qi10aSalicylic Acid Acts Upstream of Auxin and Nitric Oxide (NO) in Cell Wall Phosphorus Remobilization in Phosphorus Deficient Rice  ap. 42.  aSalicylic acid (SA) is thought to be involved in phosphorus (P) stress response in plants, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we showed that P deficiency significantly increased the endogenous SA content by inducing the SA synthesis pathway, especially for up-regulating the expression of PAL3. Furthermore, rice SA synthetic mutants pal3 exhibited the decreased root and shoot soluble P content, indicating that SA is involved in P homeostasis in plants. Subsequently, application of exogenous SA could increase the root and shoot soluble P content through regulating the root and shoot cell wall P reutilization. In addition, − P + SA treatment highly upregulated the expression of P transporters such as OsPT2 and OsPT6, together with the increased xylem P content, suggesting that SA also participates in the translocation of the P from the root to the shoot. Moreover, both signal molecular nitric oxide (NO) and auxin (IAA) production were enhanced when SA is applied while the addition of respective inhibitor c-PTIO (NO scavenger) and NPA (IAA transport inhibitor) significantly decreased the root and shoot cell wall P remobilization in response to P starvation. Taken together, here SA-IAA-NO-cell wall P reutilization pathway has been discovered in P-starved rice.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDB15030300c‘Strategic Priority Research Program’ of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a31501825cNatural Science Foundation of China  aBK20190050cFoundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Jiangsu Province  a2015250cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS 3acell walls 3ahomeostasis 3anitric oxide 3aphosphorus 3arice 3asalicylic acid 3astarvation 3astress response 3axylem1 aJing, Huai-Kang1 aFeng, Zhi-Hang1 aHuang, Jing1 aShen, Ren-Fang1 aZhu, Xiao-Fang0 tRice.g2022 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.42-42dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-022-00588-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002400141245007100165300001300236520081800249592002801067650001701095650002001112650001401132650001301146650001301159650001301172700002401185773009801209856008101307852000901388655001201397IND4524926520221119140325.0160105e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452492652DNAL7 a10.1093/sysbio/syr0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHÃ¶hna, Sebastian10aGuided Tree Topology Proposals for Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference  ap. 1-11.  aIncreasingly, large data sets pose a challenge for computationally intensive phylogenetic methods such as Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

With horizontal transmission, virulence will increase as a byproduct of a trade-off between fitness gained through increased among-host transmission (infectivity) and fitness lost through increased virulence. With vertical transmission, virulence will decrease because a parasite's reproductive potential will be maximized only by decreasing harm to the host, allowing parasite transmission to more host offspring. To test both predictions, we transmitted barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) horizontally and then vertically in its host, barley (Hordeum vulgare). After four generations of horizontal transmission, we observed a nearly twofold increase in horizontal infectivity and nearly tripled virulence. After three generations of subsequent vertical transmission, we observed a modest (16%%) increase in vertical transmissibility and a large (40%%) reduction in virulence. Increased horizontal transmission is often due to increased pathogen replication which, in turn, causes increased virulence. However, we found no correlation between within-host virus concentration and virulence, indicating that the observed changes in virulence were not due to changes in viral titer. Finally, horizontally transmitted BSMV had reduced vertical transmission and vertically transmitted BSMV had reduced horizontal infectivity. These two observations suggest that, in nature, in different host populations with varying opportunities for horizontal and vertical transmission, different viral strains may be favored.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBarley stripe mosaic virus 0aHordeum vulgare 0ainfectivity 0atransmissibility 0aviral evolution 0avirus concentration1 aLogsdon, John M.1 aKelley, Steven E.0 tEvolution.g2005 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.730-739dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F03-3303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005900169300001600228520199300244592002802237650001902265650002502284650001902309650001302328650002102341650001502362650001902377650001202396650001502408650001102423650001702434650002202451650001302473650002102486650001602507700001902523700002102542700001902563700001702582700001902599700002002618700001802638773011102656856008502767852000902852655001202861IND60629152520221122170259.0190326e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062915252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2019.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetukhov, D.I.10aThin graphene oxide membranes for gas dehumidification  ap. 184-194.  aThin graphene oxide (GO) membranes supported on porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) substrates prepared by spin-coating and pressure-assisted filtration are tested in gas dehumidification experiments. Graphene oxides with different specific nanosheet sizes ranged from 10 × 140 to 3300 nm synthesized by modified Hummer's method were used for membrane preparation. We have shown that 25–60 nm-thick GO membranes exhibit barrier properties towards most of the gases (CH4, N2, O2, C4H10), while revealing high permeance for water and water soluble vapors (CO2). The influence of the GO nanosheet size and the membrane preparation technique on the gas transport characteristics of the composite membranes are investigated. The best membrane performance has been achieved for membranes prepared from medium-flake-sized GO nanosheets providing high enough defect density at the surface to allow water entrance to the interlayer space and large enough nanosheet size to cover AAO nanochannels and create continuous barrier coating towards permanent gases on the surface. Water permeance and H2O/N2 selectivity measured in the relative humidity range of 10–80% shows strong humidity dependence due to the sorption of water vapors in the interlayer space of GO. Maximum H2O/N2 selectivity of 13,000 at water permeance of GO membranes of ~1.4 m3/(m2 h) has been achieved at standard conditions (298 K, 1 bar) and relative humidity of 80%. Water permeance of GO membranes strongly depends on the transmembrane pressure, diminishing an order of magnitude from equi-pressure conditions to 0.1 MPa pressure difference. The effect has been ascribed to a pressure-driven ousting of water molecules from the interlayer spacing of GO. Permeability of the GO membranes towards CO2 in humid mixed gas experiments has been shown to be enhanced strongly due to gas solubility in liquefied water enabling sweetening and dehumidification of natural and technological gases in a single stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aasymmetric membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3acoatings 3adehumidification 3afiltration 3agraphene oxide 3amethane 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3arelative humidity 3asorption 3awater solubility 3awater vapor1 aChernova, E.A.1 aKapitanova, O.O.1 aBoytsova, O.V.1 aValeev, R.G.1 aChumakov, A.P.1 aKonovalov, O.V.1 aEliseev, A.A.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2019 May 01, v. 577 p.184-194dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2019.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008500163506002800248520112200276592002801398506003701426650002301463650001801486650001001504650001701514650001501531650001501546650002101561651001401582700002501596700002001621773012001641856007901761852000901840655001201849IND60777276320221207135136.0220422s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077727632DNAL7 a10.18343/jipi.27.2.2482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhayrah, Ummul10aKarakteristik dan Evaluasi Prebiotik Tepung Biji Cempedak (Artocarpus champeden)  aResource is Open Access  aThis study aims to carry out chemical characterization and evaluate the prebiotic potential of cempedak (Arthocarpun champeden) seed flour. Cempedak seeds were processed by boiling and roasting, then dried and grinded. Boiled cempedak seed flour (BCF), roasted cempedak flour (RCF), and untreated cempedak seed flour (UCF) were analyzed proximately and measured the profiles of total starch and undigestable carbohydrates, which included resistant starch, total dietary fiber, insoluble dietary fiber, and soluble dietary fiber. Resistant starch content increased significantly (p<0.05) from 8% in UCF to 19% in BCF and RCF. Boiling and roasting treatments caused a decrease in SDF levels and an increase in IDF levels. The resistance of starch to hydrolysis by artificial gastric acid decreased after boiling. The value of prebiotic effect (PE) and prebiotic index (PI) showed a positive value of UCF on the growth of L. plantarum 1-S27202 (PE 0.27; PI 0.68) and the BCF on the growth of L. rhamnosus R23 (PE 0.18; PI 0.44).

The aim of this article is to develop a new theory of space modeling of network structures according to six value aggregation paths: minimum and maximum value difference, minimum and maximum value decrease, and minimum and maximum value increase. The authors show how values presenting (describing) various phenomena or states in urban space can be designed as network structures. The dynamic development of spatial structures entails looking for new methods of spatial analysis. This study analyzes these networks in terms of their nature: random or scale-free. The results show that the paths of minimum and maximum value differences reveal one stage of the aggregation of those values. They generate many small network structures with a random nature. Next four value aggregation paths lead to the emergence of several levels of value aggregation and to the creation of scale-free hierarchical network structures. The models developed according to described theory present the quality of urban areas in various versions. The theory of six paths of value combination includes new measuring tools and methods which can impact quality of life and minimize costs of bad designs or space destructions. They are the proper tools for the sustainable development of urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquality of life 3aspatial data 3asustainable development1 aBajerowski, Tomasz 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90402343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009900154300001800253520107800271592002801349650001101377650001401388650002301402650000901425650001301434650001301447650001801460650001401478650003101492650001301523650001601536700001301552700001401565773014101579856007401720852000901794655001201803IND60670576920221122120014.0191002e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067057692DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ta14121g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yan10aBimetallic nanodendrites via selective overgrowth of noble metals on multiply twinned Au seeds  ap. 6130-6137.  aMastery over the morphology of nanomaterials usually enables control of their properties and enhancement of their usefulness for a given application. Herein, we present a general approach, which is based on the preferential nucleation and growth of noble metals on the active twins of Au seed particles, for the fabrication of bimetallic Au–noble metal nanoparticles with dendritic morphologies. This strategy involves the synthesis of multiply twinned Au seeds and the subsequent reduction of other noble metal precursors in oleylamine at elevated temperature. In comparison with commercial Pt/C catalysts, the bimetallic Au–Pt nanodendrites display superior catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation due to the electronic interaction between the Au core and Pt branches in dendritic bimetallic particles and the abundant atomic steps, edges, and corner atoms in the Pt branches. The synthetic universality and mechanistic understanding may provide new opportunities to design and fabricate heterogeneous nanostructures with interesting physicochemical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3amethanol 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplatinum 3atemperature1 aLiu, Hui1 aYang, Jun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Apr. 1, v. 2, no. 17 p.6130-6137dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ta14121g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001500173245010300188300001800291520086000309592002801169650002701197650001401224650001501238650001101253650006401264650001701328650002501345650006101370650002301431700002101454700001701475700001901492773011801511856005501629852000901684655001201693IND50068205520221119030051.0130730e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006820552DNAL7 a177143052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01376.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGUDELJ, I.10aConstraints on microbial metabolism drive evolutionary diversification in homogeneous environments  ap. 1882-1889.  aUnderstanding the evolution of microbial diversity is an important and current problem in evolutionary ecology. In this paper, we investigated the role of two established biochemical trade‐offs in microbial diversification using a model that connects ecological and evolutionary processes with fundamental aspects of biochemistry. The trade‐offs that we investigated are as follows:(1) a trade‐off between the rate and affinity of substrate transport; and (2) a trade‐off between the rate and yield of ATP production. Our model shows that these biochemical trade‐offs can drive evolutionary diversification under the simplest possible ecological conditions: a homogeneous environment containing a single limiting resource. We argue that the results of a number of microbial selection experiments are consistent with the predictions of our model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aevolution 3ametabolism 3amodels 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiodiversity 2aBiological Evolution 2aFungixclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological1 aBEARDMORE, R.

The geographical size variation of most snakes and some lizards counters Bergmann's rule in that, among related taxa, the larger ones live at warmer latitudes. However, exceptions notwithstanding, and despite being ectothermic, turtles as a group tend to obey Bergmann's rule. We examined this idea in Testudo graeca, ranging from Morocco to Romania and to Iran with disputed systematics, both at the global scale (using literature) and within the focal area of Israel (using museum specimens). Both globally and locally, carapace length correlated with latitude, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. The scant data on reproduction fully support the hypothesis that Bergmann's rule enables larger clutches where the climate would limit repeated clutches. The sexual size dimorphism (SSD) was approached using two methodologies: (1) ‘conventional’, using globally literature data and locally museum samples and (2) ‘innovated’, using photographs of copulating tortoises from Israel and Turkey. By each methodology, SSD emerged as being male biased in the larger‐bodied populations and female biased in the smaller‐bodied populations, obeying Rensch's rule. Some observations support the hypothesis that the evolution of large males serves intermale combating. Finally, Rensch's rule was found to apply separately within Anatolia and within the Levant, possibly indicating that these populations are separate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTestudo graeca 3abody size 3aclimate 3acounters 3aevolution 3afemales 3alatitude 3alizards 3amales 3aphotographs 3areproduction 3asexual dimorphism 3asnakes 3atortoises 3aturtles 3aIran 3aIsrael 3aMorocco 3aRomania 3aTurkey (country)1 aKorolker, Nuphar1 aSion, Guy1 aGöçmen, Bayram,0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2016 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.796-811dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.127173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245006700175506002800242520145300270592002801723506003701751650001501788650001501803650001101818650003901829650002001868650002001888650001401908650001501922650001101937653001301948653001901961653001301980653002001993653001202013653001302025700002302038700002002061700002002081700001602101700002002117700003302137700001602170700002402186700002002210700002002230700002202250700002002272773011302292856008902405852000902494655001202503IND60777276720221207133245.0220426s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077727672DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.2.53942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarangon, Matteo14aThe macromolecular diversity of Italian monovarietal red wines  aResource is Open Access  aWhile red wine phenolics have been extensively studied, polysaccharides and proteins have not received the same level of attention, especially when considering Italian wines. In this study, for the first time, quantitative and qualitative data on the macromolecular (proteins and polysaccharides) and tannin composition of 110 monovarietal red wines from 11 of the most important Italian grape varieties are reported. The winemaking did not include any filtration, oak contact, fining treatments, or ageing on yeast lees. Results highlighted a great inter- and intra- varietal diversity. The protein content ranged between 0 and 159 mg/L, polysaccharides between 211 and 1081 mg/L and total tannins between 171 and 3746 mg/L, with averages of 41 mg/L, 497 mg/L and 1687 mg/L, respectively. Six varieties with protein content representative of the variability observed were selected and submitted to electrophoresis. Within each variety, the SDS-PAGE mobility of protein-tannin complexes was similar but showed two distinct patterns for wines of different varieties (higher mobility for Corvina, Teroldego and Raboso Piave, lower mobility for Nebbiolo, Aglianico, Cannonau), suggesting that the Italian monovarietal wines can be diverse also in their colloidal-forming structures. This can be explained by looking at the different percentages of protein-reactive tannins (TBSA) on the total tannin content (TMCP), which is a varietal characteristic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSciaenidae 3afiltration 3agrapes 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein content 3ared wines 3awinemaking 3ayeasts 0ared wine 0amacromolecules 0aproteins 0apolysaccharides 0atannins 0acolloids1 aIseppi, Alberto De1 aGerbi, Vincenzo1 aMattivi, Fulvio1 aMoio, Luigi1 aPiombino, Paola1 aParpinello, Giuseppina Paola1 aRolle, Luca1 aSlaghenaufi, Davide1 aVersari, Andrea1 aVrhovsek, Urska1 aUgliano, Maurizio1 aCurioni, Andrea0 tOENO One.g2022, v. 56, no. 2dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.2022.56.2.53943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007900167300001400246520109800260592002801358650001901386650001401405650002201419650003001441650002201471650002101493650001701514651001001531653002501541653002901566653002301595700001501618700001601633773007601649856008301725852000901808655001201817IND60096928320221118033207.0160903e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009692832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaoyan10aIndustrial structural transformation and carbon dioxide emissions in China  ap. 43-51.  aUsing provincial panel data from the period 1995–2009 to analyze the relationship between the industrial structural transformation and carbon dioxide emissions in China, we find that the first-order lag of industrial structural adjustment effectively reduced the emissions; technical progress itself did not reduce the emissions, but indirectly led to decreasing emissions through the upgrading and optimization of industrial structure. Foreign direct investment and intervention by local governments reduced carbon dioxide emissions, but urbanization significantly increased the emissions. Thus, industrial structural adjustment is an important component of the development of a low-carbon economy. In the context of industrial structural transformation, an effective way to reduce a region’s carbon dioxide emissions is to promote the upgrading and optimization of industrial structure through technical progress. Tighter environmental access policies, selective utilization of foreign direct investment, and improvements in energy efficiency can help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aforeign direct investment 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aIndustrial structure 0aCarbon dioxide emissions 0aTechnical progress1 aZhang, Jie1 aLi, Junpeng0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 June, v. 57 p.43-51dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006900162500001900231520105500250592002801305650001101333650001401344650001301358650000901371650002301380650001901403650001001422700002801432700002201460700002201482773011901504856007301623852000901696655001201705IND60724622020221118224849.0210122e20210112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072462202DNAL7 a10.3390/w130201652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrispino, Gaetano 10aEnergy Head Dissipation and Flow Pressures in Vortex Drop Shafts  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVortex drop shafts are special manholes designed to link sewer channels at different elevations. Significant energy head dissipation occurs across these structures, mainly due to vertical shaft wall friction and turbulence in the dissipation chamber at the toe of the shaft. In the present study two aspects, sometimes neglected in the standard hydraulic design, are considered, namely the energy head dissipation efficiency and the maximum pressure force in the dissipation chamber. Different physical model results derived from the pertinent literature are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the energy head dissipation efficiency is mostly related to the flow impact and turbulence occurring in the chamber. Similarly to the drop manholes, a relation derived from a simple theoretical model is proposed for the estimation of the energy head loss coefficient. The analysis of the pressures measured on the chamber bottom allows to provide a useful equation to estimate the pressure peak in the chamber as a function of the approach flow energy head.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3afriction 3ahead 3atheoretical models 3aturbulent flow 3awater1 aContestabile, Pasquale 1 aVicinanza, Diego 1 aGisonni, Corrado 0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 12, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130201653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010300168300001600271520129000287592002801577650002501605650002401630650001601654650001101670650001301681650001901694650002201713650001301735650001901748651001001767651001801777653001501795653002201810653002801832700001901860700002101879773007801900856008301978852000902061655001202070IND60096928420221118033218.0160903e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009692842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.12.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chen-Chun12aA comparison of innovation policy in the smart grid industry across the pacific: China and the USA  ap. 119-132.  aUtilities are increasing their investment in smart grid technologies because of the rising demand for electricity, the aging transmission and distribution infrastructure in developed countries and the need for real-time visibility of energy supply and demand to optimize service reliability and cost. Government policies are contributing to this rising investment in the smart grid in many countries around the globe. Using Rothwell and Zegveld's innovation policy framework as a starting point, this paper compares innovation policy in smart grids across the Pacific; specifically, China and the USA. This research describes the policy tools used by both countries and presents results that indicate national preferences for innovation policy that differ in the ways in which they are linked with the state of the power system. China has preferred to use “supply-side policy,” which focuses on “public enterprise, scientific and technical development and legal regulation.” The USA has preferred to use “environmental-side policy,” which focuses on “scientific and technical development, financial, political and public enterprise.” This paper also describes in detail a number of innovation policies being pursued in the smart grid industry in both China and the USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3adeveloped countries 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3asupply balance 3aChina 3aUnited States 0aSmart grid 0aInnovation policy 0aCross national analysis1 aYang, Chia-Han1 aShyua, Joseph Z.0 tEnergy Policy.g2013 June, v. 57 p.119-132dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.12.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010900162500001900271520100500290592002801295650001501323650001701338650001601355650001101371650002001382650001001402700002101412700002201433700002101455700002301476700002501499700002101524700001901545773011901564856007301683852000901756655001201765IND60724622120221118224802.0210122e20210112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072462212DNAL7 a10.3390/w130201662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPresta, Valentina 10aDifferent Waters for Different Performances: Can We Imagine Sport-Related Natural Mineral Spring Waters?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPreserving the hydration status means to balance daily fluids and salt losses with gains, where the losses depend on several physiological and environmental factors. Especially for athletes, these losses could be relevant and negatively influence the performance: therefore, their hydro-saline status must be preserved with personalized pre- and rehydration plans all along the performance period. Scientific literature in this field is mainly dedicated to artificial sport drinks. Different territories in most world areas are rich in drinking natural mineral spring waters with saline compositions that reflect their geological origin and that are used for human health (often under medical prescription). However, scarce scientific attention has been dedicated to the use of these waters for athletes. We therefore reviewed the existing literature from the innovative viewpoint of matching spring water mineral compositions with different athletic performances and their hydro-saline requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody water 3ahuman health 3arehydration 3asports 3asprings (water) 3awater1 aAmbrosini, Luca 1 aCarubbi, Cecilia 1 aMasselli, Elena 1 aMirandola, Prisco 1 aArcari, Maria  Luisa1 aGobbi, Giuliana 1 aVitale, Marco 0 tWater.g2021 Jan. 12, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130201663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245011600194300001600310520110800326592002801434650001901462650002301481650001401504650002001518650001201538650001501550650001301565650001901578650003701597650001201634650003001646650002401676650002901700650003801729650002301767650002801790650006801818650005101886650002401937700002201961700002001983773009602003856008402099852000902183655001202192IND60086619720221121221509.0141101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008661972DNAL7 a212365372pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2010.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez-Eyles, Jose L.10aUsing deuterated PAH amendments to validate chemical extraction methods to predict PAH bioavailability in soils  ap. 918-923.  aValidating chemical methods to predict bioavailable fractions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by comparison with accumulation bioassays is problematic. Concentrations accumulated in soil organisms not only depend on the bioavailable fraction but also on contaminant properties. A historically contaminated soil was freshly spiked with deuterated PAHs (dPAHs). dPAHs have a similar fate to their respective undeuterated analogues, so chemical methods that give good indications of bioavailability should extract the fresh more readily available dPAHs and historic more recalcitrant PAHs in similar proportions to those in which they are accumulated in the tissues of test organisms. Cyclodextrin and butanol extractions predicted the bioavailable fraction for earthworms (Eisenia fetida) and plants (Lolium multiflorum) better than the exhaustive extraction. The PAHs accumulated by earthworms had a larger dPAH:PAH ratio than that predicted by chemical methods. The isotope ratio method described here provides an effective way of evaluating other chemical methods to predict bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3aLolium multiflorum 3abioassays 3abioavailability 3abutanol 3aearthworms 3aisotopes 3apolluted soils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aButanolsxchemistry 2aCyclodextrinsxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aLoliumxmetabolism 2aOligochaetaxmetabolism 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aSolventsxchemistry1 aCollins, Chris D.1 aHodson, Mark E.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2011 Apr., v. 159, no. 4 p.918-923dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2010.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245007200184300001400256506002800270520134400298592002801642506003701670650001201707650001201719650001301731650001301744650001201757650001101769650001101780650001001791651001401801700001601815700001301831773010401844856008901948852000902037655001202046IND60777277320221207133331.0220420e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077727732DNAL7 a10.21776/ub.habitat.2022.033.1.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDessy, Vetty Seily Kurnia10aMarket Integration Analysis of Cayenne Pepper in East Java Province  ap. 24-32.  aResource is Open Access  aMarket integration research has often been used to evaluate agricultural products' marketing performance. However, the involvement of marketing agencies in chili marketing resulted in a relatively high price difference and impacted market integration. So it is essential to understand how the chili market integration as an effort to improve marketing efficiency and price control policies. The study analyzed the causality and market integration of cayenne pepper prices at the farmers' and retailers' levels in East Java Province. The study used weekly cayenne pepper price data at the farmers' and retailers' levels from 2016 - 2020. The secondary data was obtained from the Department of Industry and Trade of East Java Province. The analytical methods used in this study were Engle-Granger Causality analysis and Error Correction Model (ECM). The findings showed that retail prices caused the farmgate prices, but not the other way. However, the price of cayenne pepper at the farmer and retail level in East Java Province has been integrated. Therefore, this study showed that there needs to be an improvement in the farmers' institutional system to improve the farmers' bargaining position to reduce the power of the selling price control at the farmers' level by traders.

We have previously shown that LXRα is post-translationally modified by O-linked β-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) with increased transcriptional activity. Moreover, we showed that LXRα associates with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in vitro and in vivo in mouse liver. In this study, we report that human LXRα is O-GlcNAc modified in its N-terminal domain (NTD) by identifying a specific O-GlcNAc site S49 and a novel O-GlcNAc modified peptide 20LWKPGAQDASSQAQGGSSCILRE42. However, O-GlcNAc site-mutations did not modulate LXRα transactivation of selected target gene promoters in vitro. Peptide array and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that LXRα interacts with OGT in its NTD and ligand-binding domain (LBD) in a ligand-independent fashion. Moreover, we map two new O-GlcNAc sites in the longest OGT isoform (ncOGT): S437 in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 13 domain and T1043 in the far C-terminus, and a new O-GlcNAc modified peptide (amino acids 826–832) in the intervening region (Int-D) within the catalytic domain. We also map four new O-GlcNAc sites in the short isoform sOGT: S391, T393, S399 and S437 in the TPRs 11–13 domain. Future studies will reveal the biological role of identified O-GlcNAc sites in LXRα and OGT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3acholesterol 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amice 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 0aLXRα 0aO-GlcNAc 0aOGT 0aHCD MS 0aETD MS1 aMoen, Anders1 aAnonsen, Jan Haug1 aBindesbøll, Christian1 aSæther, Thomas1 aCarlson, Cathrine Rein1 aGrønning-Wang, Line M.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 May 05, v. 499, no. 2 p.354-360dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.03.1643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001300141245009700154520167500251592002801926650001401954650001401968650001001982650001101992650001102003650002502014650001302039650001602052650001702068700001602085700001402101700001702115773015902132856007602291852000902367655001202376IND60703102120221122203236.0200720e20200411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070310212DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi90402392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yi12aA Multi-Scale Representation of Point-of-Interest (POI) Features in Indoor Map Visualization  aAs a result of the increasing popularity of indoor activities, many facilities and services are provided inside buildings; hence, there is a need to visualize points-of-interest (POIs) that can describe these indoor service facilities on indoor maps. Over the last few years, indoor mapping has been a rapidly developing area, with the emergence of many forms of indoor representation. In the design of indoor map applications, cartographical methodologies such as generalization and symbolization can make important contributions. In this study, a self-adaptive method is applied for the design of a multi-scale and personalized indoor map. Based on methods of map generalization and multi-scale representation, we adopt a scale-adaptive strategy to visualize the building structure and POI data on indoor maps. At smaller map scales, the general floor distribution and functional partitioning of each floor are represented, while the POI data are visualized by simple symbols. At larger map scales, the detailed room distribution is displayed, and the service information of the POIs is described by detailed symbols. Different strategies are used for the generalization of the background building structure and the foreground POI data to ensure that both can satisfy real-time performance requirements. In addition, for better personalization, different POI data, symbols or color schemes are shown to users in different age groups, with different genders or with different purposes for using the map. Because this indoor map is adaptive to both the scale and the user, each map scale can provide different map users with decision support from different perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase maps 3abuildings 3acolor 3afloors 3agender 3ainformation services 3ajournals 3amethodology 3aspatial data1 aAi, Tinghua1 aYang, Min1 aZhang, Xiang0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2020 Apr. 11, v. 9, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi90402393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011500169300001400284500001500298520189200313592002802205650002902233650002402262650002302286650002102309650000802330650001602338650001202354650002502366650001002391650001602401650001002417650001402427650001802441650001202459650002102471650001302492653001402505653001102519653001402530653002102544700001802565700001902583700001902602700001502621700005402636773008502690856008502775852000902860655001202869IND60563979920221118135425.0190403e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056397992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Wen-Hui14aThe effects of closed circuit microbial fuel cells on methane emissions from paddy soil vary with straw amount  ap. 33-39.  a2019-12-06  aStraw return increases methane emissions from paddy fields due to carbon input. In closed circuit microbial fuel cells (CC-MFCs), because exoelectrogenic bacteria can compete with methanogens for soil organic carbon, CC-MFCs should reduce methane emissions. We aimed to study the effects of CC-MFCs on methane emissions from paddy soil that was amended with different amounts of straw. Paddy soil was packed into the CC-MFCs and flooded after amendments with 0.5%, 1% and 2% straw or without straw addition. The methane flux from the soil was assessed every seven days. Forty-five days after the CC-MFCs were put into operation, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the overlaying water was determined. Soil was collected from the CC-MFCs, the chemical properties of the soil were measured and DNA was extracted. This was followed by the quantification and sequencing of the methanogenic mcrA and methanotrophic pmoA genes. The results revealed that with 0.5% straw, CC-MFCs generated less methane than open circuit MFCs (OC-MFCs) which were set as references. However, the CC-MFCs generated more methane than the OC-MFCs under 1% and 2% straw conditions. The dissolved oxygen concentration, which was lower in CC-MFCs than in OC-MFCs, decreased as the straw amount increased. The abundance of methanotrophs in CC-MFCs was significantly lower than that in OC-MFCs with 2% straw. Methylococcaceae, which belong to type II methanotrophic bacteria, were more abundant in CC-MFCs than in OC-MFCs. Thus, we suggest that the effects of CC-MFCs on methane emissions vary with the straw amount. With 0.5% straw, the competition for organic carbon between methanogens and exoelectrogenic bacteria mitigated the production of methane. However, CC-MFCs with 2% straw decreased the concentration of dissolved oxygen, inhibiting the activity of methanotrophs and increasing the emissions of methane.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil organic carbon 3amethane production 3aMethylococcaceae 3aDNA 3amethanogens 3amethane 3amicrobial fuel cells 3agenes 3apaddy soils 3astraw 3aemissions 3amethanotrophs 3apaddies 3adissolved oxygen 3abacteria 0amcrA gene 0acarbon 0apmoA gene 0aDissolved oxygen1 aCai, Lv-Cheng1 aWei, Zheng-Gui1 aXue, Hong-Jing1 aHan, Cheng1 aDeng, Huan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1001-30270 tCatena.g2017 July, v. 154 p.33-39dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.02.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245010100212300001400313520143700327592002801764650001201792650001601804650001401820650001501834650001201849650001801861650001401879650001901893650002001912650001601932650001101948650001201959650002101971650002701992650004702019650002302066650001102089650001002100650000902110650003502119650001602154650004802170650005002218650002302268650001902291700002202310700002102332700003302353700002202386700002102408700002002429700002602449773008902475856008102564990002302645852000902668655001202677IND60093903320221119020832.0141104e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009390332DNAL7 a221779042pmid7 aPMC32583652pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWernet, Mathias F.,10aGenetic Dissection Reveals Two Separate Retinal Substrates for Polarization Vision in Drosophila  ap. 12-20.  aBACKGROUND: Linearly polarized light originates from atmospheric scattering or surface reflections and is perceived by insects, spiders, cephalopods, crustaceans, and some vertebrates. Thus, the neural basis underlying how this fundamental quality of light is detected is of broad interest. Morphologically unique, polarization-sensitive ommatidia exist in the dorsal periphery of many insect retinas, forming the dorsal rim area (DRA). However, much less is known about the retinal substrates of behavioral responses to polarized reflections. SUMMARY: Drosophila exhibits polarotactic behavior, spontaneously aligning with the e-vector of linearly polarized light, when stimuli are presented either dorsally or ventrally. By combining behavioral experiments with genetic dissection and ultrastructural analyses, we show that distinct photoreceptors mediate the two behaviors: inner photoreceptors R7+R8 of DRA ommatidia are necessary and sufficient for dorsal polarotaxis, whereas ventral responses are mediated by combinations of outer and inner photoreceptors, both of which manifest previously unknown features that render them polarization sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: Drosophila uses separate retinal pathways for the detection of linearly polarized light emanating from the sky or from shiny surfaces. This work establishes a behavioral paradigm that will enable genetic dissection of the circuits underlying polarization vision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aCephalopoda 3aCrustacea 3aDrosophila 3ainsects 3alight quality 3aommatidia 3aphotoreceptors 3apolarized light 3avertebrates 3avision 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aDrosophilaxphysiology 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDynaminsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aLight 2aMale 2aOcular Physiological Phenomena 2aOrientation 2aPhospholipase C betaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhotoreceptor Cells, Invertebratexphysiology 2aRetinaxphysiology 2aVision, Ocular1 aVelez, Mariel M.1 aClark, Damon A.,1 aBaumann-Klausener, Franziska1 aBrown, Julian R.1 aKlovstad, Martha1 aLabhart, Thomas1 aClandinin, Thomas R.0 tCurrent biology.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 22, no. 1 p.12-20dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100001900136245011900155300001600274520156300290592002801853653002201881653002201903653004301925653002501968653001401993700002302007700001802030773010302048856007202151852000902223655001202232IND60127164120221120165959.0151110e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012716412DNAL7 a10.1554/04-5272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyer, Kelly A.10aExpression and modulation of embryonic male-killing in drosophila innubila: opportunities for multilevel selection  ap. 838-848.  aOrganisms and the symbionts they harbor may experience opposing forces of selection. In particular, the contrasting inheritance patterns of maternally transmitted symbionts and their host's nuclear genes can engender conflict among organizational levels over the optimal host offspring sex ratio. This study uses a male-killing Wolbachia endosymbiont and its host Drosophila innubila to experimentally address the potential for multilevel selection in a host-symbiont system. We show that bacterial density can vary among infected females, and that females with a higher density have a more female-biased offspring sex ratio. Furthermore, bacterial density is an epigenetic and heritable trait: females with a low bacterial load have daughters with a lower-than-average bacterial density, whose offspring then experience less severe male-killing. For infected sons, the probability of embryonic mortality increases with the bacterial density in their mothers. The frequency distribution of Wolbachia density among individual D. innubila females, and therefore the dynamics of infection within populations of these flies, results both from processes affecting the growth and regulation of bacterial populations within cytoplasmic lineages and from selection among cytoplasmic lineages that vary in bacterial density. Estimates of effective population size of Wolbachia within cytoplasmic lineages and of D. innubila at the host population level suggest that selection among cytoplasmic lineages is likely to overwhelm the results of selection within lineages.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAntibiotic curing 0abacterial density 0aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0asex-ratio distortion 0aWolbachia1 aMinhas, Miranda S.1 aJaenike, John0 tEvolution.g2005 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.838-848dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F04-5273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024001700111024002100128024003500149024001100184040001800195100001800213245014000231300001600371500001500387506017300402520145100575650002102026650001402047650002702061650000902088650001302097650001702110650001602127650001402143650002402157650002102181650002002202650001502222650002802237650001302265650001702278650001202295650001802307650003102325650001402356650002702370650001302397650003602410650002802446650003902474650001302513650002602526650003302552650002702585653001502612700001702627700002002644700001802664700001402682700001802696773012502714856011202839856004802951956012202999961000903121852000903130655001203139IND4449096220221214223459.0130429e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444909622DNAL7 a211043982pmid7 a2578532aris7 a10113/563972hdl7 a10.1007/s00122-010-1488-12doi8 ans1530  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZalapa, J.

Switchgrass has two main ecotypes: the lowland ecotype being exclusively tetraploid (2n = 4x = 36) and the upland ecotype being mainly tetraploid and octaploid (2n = 8x = 72). Because there is a significant difference in ploidy, morphology, growth pattern, and zone of adaptation between and within the upland and lowland ecotypes, it is important to discriminate switchgrass plants belonging to different genetic pools. We used 55 simple sequence repeats (SSR) loci and six chloroplast sequences to identify patterns of variation between and within 18 switchgrass cultivars representing seven lowland and 11 upland cultivars from different geographic regions and of varying ploidy levels. We report consistent discrimination of switchgrass cultivars into ecotype membership and demonstrate unambiguous molecular differentiation among switchgrass ploidy levels using genetic markers. Also, SSR and chloroplast markers identified genetic pools related to the geographic origin of the 18 cultivars with respect to ecotype, ploidy, and geographical, and cultivar sources. SSR loci were highly informative for cultivar fingerprinting and to classify plants of unknown origin. This classification system is the first step toward developing switchgrass complementary gene pools that can be expected to provide a significant heterotic increase in biomass yield. 3aPanicum virgatum 3acultivars 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aloci 3aecotypes 3aenergy crops 3atetraploidy 3ahighlands 3acomplementary genes 3aplant adaptation 3agenetic markers 3aprovenance 3acultivar identification 3alowlands 3achloroplasts 2aAlleles 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Chloroplastxgenetics 2aGene Pool 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aGenotype 2aMinisatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPanicumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPloidies 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aadaptation1 aPrice, D.

A.10aLeaky prezygotic isolation and porous genomes: rapid introgression of maternally inherited dna  ap. 720-729.  aAccurate phylogenies are crucial for understanding evolutionary processes, especially species diversification. It is commonly assumed that ““good”” species are sufficiently isolated genetically that gene genealogies represent accurate phylogenies. However, it is increasingly clear that good species may continue to exchange genetic material through hybridization (introgression). Many studies of closely related species reveal introgression of some genes without others, often with more rapid introgression of maternally inherited chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA (cpDNA, mtDNA). We seek a general explanation for this biased introgression using simple models of common reproductive isolating barriers (RIBs). We compare empirically informed models of prezygotic isolation (for pre- and postinsemination mechanisms of both female choice and male competition) with postzygotic isolation and demonstrate that rate of introgression depends critically upon type of RIB and mode of genetic inheritance (maternal versus biparental versus paternal). Our frequency-dependent prezygotic RIBs allow much more rapid introgression of biparentally and maternally inherited genes than do commonly modeled postzygotic RIBs (especially maternally inherited DNA). After considering the specific predictions in the context of empirical observations, we conclude that our model of prezygotic RIBs is a general explanation for biased introgression of maternally inherited genomic components. These findings suggest that we should use extreme caution when interpreting single gene genealogies as species phylogenies, especially for cpDNA and mtDNA.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAssortative mating 0achloroplast DNA 0aconsequences of hybridization 0agene genealogy 0amitochondrial DNA 0apostzygotic 0aprezygotic 0areproductive isolating barrier1 aLevin, Simon A.0 tEvolution.g2005 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.720-729dSociety for the Study of Evolutionx1558-56467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1554%2F04-5343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245010200182300001400284520102500298592002801323650001901351650001501370650002001385650001601405650001101421650001601432650002501448650001201473650002301485650003001508650002601538650001001564650001401574650001101588650001601599650001401615650001101629650001301640650001301653650001301666650003301679651001101712653002401723653002001747653001801767653002101785700003101806773010001837856008901937852000902026655001202035IND60532890120221120155840.0190410e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053289012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Rafaele Regina10aPotential biological agents isolated from apple fail to control Glomerella leaf spot in the field  ap. 56-63.  aGlomerella leaf spot (GLS) has great impact on apple crops in Paraná/Brazil because the majority of the orchards in the state are planted with the cultivar ‘Gala’, which is very susceptible to the disease. The objectives of this study were to evaluate several potential biological control agents as well as a commercial biocontrol product were applied to apple plants and compared with mancozeb for control of GLS on leaves and fruit. Test plots included an experiment station orchard as well as a commercial orchard. In the experimental orchard, treatments showed different effects between the three crop seasons. In the commercial orchard, the effects of the biological controls were not significantly different from control in the two areas evaluated. The commercial biocontrol product showed no effect on GLS in leaves and fruits. Leaf cover with cells of the antagonists visualized by scanning electron microscopy revealed flaws in the biofilm, enabling germination and appressoria formation by Colletotrichum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aGlomerella 3aMalus domestica 3aantagonists 3aapples 3aappressoria 3abioactive properties 3abiofilm 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abiological resistance 3acrops 3acultivars 3afruits 3agermination 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amancozeb 3aorchards 3aplanting 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aBrazil 0aColletotrichum spp. 0aMalus domestica 0aBacillus spp. 0aPseudomonas spp.1 aMay De Mio, Louise Larissa0 tBiological control.g2015 Aug., v. 87 p.56-63dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245017600170300001800346520069600364592002801060650001901088650001601107650001501123650000901138653000901147653001801156653004401174653002201218700002201240700002401262700001901286773007601305856008401381852000901465655001201474IND60563980020221118140458.0170713e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056398002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaronci, Andrea10aNumerical investigation of a MCFC (Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell) system hybridized with a supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle and compared with a bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle  ap. 1063-1073.  aThe investigation has the aim to study the integration of a molten carbonate fuel cell and a Brayton cycle, that uses supercritical carbon dioxide (S–CO2) as working fluid.

A total of 123 respondents from across the Arkansas rice growing region returned the survey covering a total of 236,414 rice hectares, representing about 40% of the planted Arkansas rice hectares in 2020. The most problematic weeds were Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv. (ECG), Cyperus spp., and Oryza sativa L. (weedy rice), respectively, in flooded rice, and ECG, Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats., and Cyperus spp., respectively, in furrow-irrigated rice. Most respondents (78%) reported high concern with herbicide-resistant weeds, and crop rotation (&gt;74%) was the most common strategy listed to control and mitigate the development of herbicide-resistant weeds. A chi-square test of homogeneity showed that strategies implemented to control herbicide-resistant weeds and mitigate the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds were not dependent on occupation type (farmer, consultant, or industry rep) nor on years of involvement in rice production. Respondents failed to control ECG 44% of the time with their first postemergence herbicide. After initial herbicide failure, 53% of respondents stated two additional herbicide applications were required to control ECG escapes while another 21% of respondents stated it was never controlled. The average ECG population at 2020 harvest was between 0.1 and 1.0 plant m−2 according to 44% of the respondents; however, 41% of respondents indicated an ECG density of 2 to 10 plants m−2 at 2020 harvest. The reported annual average cost of herbicides for rice weed control was $266.40 ha−1 with ECG accounting for 81% of the total cost. Average yield loss attributed to ECG was estimated to be 505–959 kg ha−1 (economic loss of $134–254 ha−1). However, yield loss in the most heavily infested fields was estimated to be 757–1,464 kg ha−1 (economic loss of $200–387 ha−1). Effective, non-chemical approaches to weed management were ranked as the least important current research or educational effort, indicating a paradigm shift in rice producers' weed control line of thought is needed with dwindling herbicide options due to herbicide resistance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmaranthus palmeri 3aCyperus 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomy 3achi-square distribution 3acrop rotation 3afarmers 3afinancial economics 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3aindustry 3aoccupations 3arice 3asurveys 3aArkansas 0abarnyardgrass 0afurrow-irrigated rice 0aintegrated weed management (IWM) 0asurvey 0aweed competition 0ayield loss1 aKouame, K.

However, adult nervous system and neurogenesis studies of scallops are limited. Here, we studied the localization of neurotransmitters (serotonin/5-HT, FMRFamide, catecholamines) in adult ganglia and larvae of Azumapecten farreri using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: We found peptide FMRFamide in all adult scallop ganglia, whereas 5-HT-like immunoreactive (lir) somata were exclusively detected in the cerebropleural, pedal, and accessory ganglia. Scallop larval neurogenesis starts with the emergence of the 5-HT-lir neurons, which are part of the apical organ (AO) at the early veliger stage. Near the AO, paired anlagen of cerebral ganglion (CG) developed. 5-HT-lir neurites of the CG innervate the velum, ventral, and dorsal parts of the larva at the late veliger stage. Scallop pediveligers possess 5-HT-lir CG, pleural ganglia, and immunopositive signals in the developing enteric nervous system. FMRFamide-lir is first detected in dorsal, ventral, and AO cells of early veligers. Later, FMRFamide-lir extends to the visceral nervous cord, all ganglia, as well as in the enteric nervous system in pediveligers. Catecholaminergic neurons are detected near the larval mouth, in the vellum, and in the stomach in veligers. CONCLUSIONS: We described the distribution of neurotransmitters of the ganglia in adult scallops and the larval neurodevelopment in A. farreri. Immunostaining of neurotransmitters showed that the gross anatomy of adult scallop ganglia, in general, is similar to that in other bivalves, but complicated by the complexity of the structure of the ganglia and the appearance of additional ganglia not described in other molluscs. A comparison of larval neuromorphology suggests that 5-HT-lir structures are more conservative than FMRF-lir structures in Bivalvia. Notably, the latter are much more distributed in scallop A. farreri larvae than in other studied bivalves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzumapecten farreri 3aadults 3acatecholamines 3aganglia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alarvae 3amouth 3aneurites 3aneurodevelopment 3aneurogenesis 3aneurotransmitters 3apeptides 3ascallops 3astomach1 aDyachuk, Vyacheslav1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8100-73670 tFrontiers in zoology.g2022 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.22-22dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-022-00468-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245007900180300001600259500000900275500001500284520156300299592002801862650001401890650001901904650002001923650002101943650002601964650002201990650000902012650002102021650001202042650001802054650002102072650002102093651001102114653001002125653001502135700002102150773012202171852000902293856009702302655001202399IND2035854220221117032222.0191122e199303  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203585422DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500020012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulman, Patrick10aYield and Yield Component Response of Spring Barley to Fertilizer Nitrogen  ap. 226-231.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aBarley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important cereal crop in eastern Canada, where it is used mainly as a source of energy for monogastric animals. A 4-yr field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of N application on the yield of spring barley. Three cultivars, Cadette, Leger (adapted feed types), and Argyle (unadapted malting type) were grown with 0, 50, 100, 150, or 200 kg N ha⁻¹ applied as ammonium nitrate at seeding. Two other treatments consisted of 100 kg N ha⁻¹ at seeding plus 50 kg N ha⁻¹ as ammonium nitrate (broadcast) or urea (foliar spray) applied at Zadoks growth stage 50 (spike emergence). Grain yield generally did not respond to N treatments. Separate determination of main stem (MS) and tiller yield components revealed that the lack of response to progressively higher rates of N was due to the stable nature of MS yield components and to the relatively small contribution of tillers to grain yield. Very high levels of N occasionally reduced the grain set and yield of MS spikes. Mean weight per MS grain showed little variation among growing seasons and N treatments. High rates and split applications of N had few significant effects on tiller yield and yield components. Tiller spike densities were consistently low (81–147 spikes per square meter). Tiller spikes produced only 7 to 15 grains, with individual grains weighing 60 to 75% of the weight of MS grains. Previous cropping practices and environmental conditions seemed to affect spike development and grain-set more than application of fertilizer N.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3ainflorescences 3aHordeum vulgare 3acropping systems 3aenvironmental factors 3asplit application 3aurea 3ayield components 3atillers 3atop dressings 3aammonium nitrate 3aapplication rate 3aQuebec 0astems 0acrop yield1 aSmith, Donald L.0 tAgronomy journal.g1993 Mar., v. 85, no. 2 p.226-231dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500020012x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02603naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006000154245007800214300001200292520100700304592002801311650003101339650002001370650001501390650001801405650001101423650001201434650002301446650003001469650001301499650002101512650001201533650002001545650001401565650001601579650001101595650001101606650001001617651001001627653001001637653003601647653002301683653001301706653001401719700001701733700001601750700001601766700001801782700002001800700002001820773009901840856008901939852000902028655001202037IND60532890320221120160023.0190410e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053289032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jun-xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4430-511610aBacillus amyloliquefaciens GB1 can effectively control apple valsa canker  ap. 1-7.  aApple valsa canker (AVC), caused by Valsa mali, is one of the most serious diseases of apple trees in eastern Asia, and the most important factor limiting apple production in China. This disease is difficult to control by chemical and agricultural measures, thus biocontrol may constitute a desirable alternative strategy. A Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain denoted GB1 isolated from ageing cucumber stems, exhibited a strong antagonistic activity against V. mali, inhibiting significantly the germination of conidia and the growth of hyphae. GB1 conidial suspensions (above 106CFU/ml) applied prior to wound inoculation of apple twigs with V. mali resulted in total inhibition of infection. Strain GB1 colonized xylem and phloem tissues surrounding the wounds made on apple twigs and formed biofilms over them. Results indicate that B. amyloliquefaciens GB1 may be a promising agent for the biocontrol of AVC, and provide new insights into the ability of B. amyloliquefaciens to colonize apple trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aMalus domestica 3aValsa mali 3aagrochemicals 3aapples 3abiofilm 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abranches 3achemical control 3aconidia 3acrop production 3acucumbers 3agermination 3ahyphae 3aphloem 3axylem 3aChina 0aValsa 0aGreen fluorescent protein (GFP) 0aBiological control 0aBacillus 0aCytospora1 aGu, Yan-bing1 aChi, Fu-mei1 aJi, Zhi-rui1 aWu, Jian-yuan1 aDong, Qing-long1 aZhou, Zong-shan0 tBiological control.g2015 Sept., v. 88 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2015.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245016800173520108700341592002801428650001501456650001401471650001901485650001601504650003801520650000901558650001601567650001301583650002801596650001901624650001401643650000701657650002201664650002301686650001301709650002401722650001601746653001801762653001401780653001601794653002201810653002401832700001501856700001501871700001401886700001901900700001601919700001601935700001301951700001601964700001101980700001901991773009302010856009102103852000902194655001202203IND60649477720221116145732.0200607e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064947772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1193272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Yanlin10aTime-staggered delivery of erlotinib and doxorubicin by gold nanocages with two smart polymers for reprogrammable release and synergistic with photothermal therapy  aPhotochemotherapy is currently an effective anticancer therapy. Recently, it has been reported that cancer cells pretreated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib (Erl) can significantly synergize its apoptosis against the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin (Dox). As a result, we designed two gold nanocages (Au NCs) microcontainers covered with different smart polymer shell-PAA (pH responsive) and p (NIPAM-co-AM) (temperature responsive) containing Erl and Dox respectively. The acidic tumor microenvironment and NIR light irradiation can selectively activate the release of Erl and Dox. Time staggered release of Erl and Dox and photothermal therapy enhance the apoptotic signaling pathways, resulting in improved tumor cell killing in both MCF-7 (low EGFR expression) and A431 (very high EGFR expression) tumor cells, but more efficient in the latter. The photochemotherapy strategy controls the order and duration of drug exposure precisely in spatial and temporal, and significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy against high EGFR expressed tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3adoxorubicin 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3agold 3airradiation 3ananogold 3anear infrared radiation 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolymers 3asignal transduction 3atemperature 0aGold nanocage 0aErlotinib 0aDoxorubicin 0aChemophototherapy 0aCombination therapy1 aCheng, Yan1 aChang, Yun1 aJian, Hui1 aZheng, Runxiao1 aWu, Xiaqing1 aXu, Keqiang1 aWang, Li1 aMa, Xiaomin1 aLi, Xi1 aZhang, Haiyuan0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Oct., v. 217 p.119327-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1193273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012500171300001400296520088600310592002801196650001501224650001301239650001301252650001001265650001201275650001101287653001801298653003601316653001201352653002601364653001001390700002301400700002001423700002601443700002601469700002401495700002701519700002001546700002001566773010401586856008701690961001201777852000901789655001201798IND60581269920221117205519.0190409e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058126992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRene, Eldon R.10aEffects of concentration and gas flow rate on the removal of gas-phase toluene and xylene mixture in a compost biofilter  ap. 28-35.  aThe aim of this work was to study the performance of a compost/ceramic bead biofilter (6:4 v/v) for the removal of gas-phase toluene and xylene at different inlet loading rates (ILR). The inlet toluene (or) xylene concentrations were varied from 0.1 to 1.5gm−3, at gas flow rates of 0.024, 0.048 and 0.072m3h−1, respectively, corresponding to total ILR varying between 7 and 213gm−3h−1. Although there was mutual inhibition, xylene removal was severely inhibited by the presence of toluene than toluene removal by the presence of xylene. The biofilter was also exposed to transient variations such as prolonged periods of shutdown (30days) and shock loads to envisage the response and recuperating ability of the biofilter. The maximum elimination capacity (EC) for toluene and xylene were 29.2 and 16.4gm−3h−1, respectively, at inlet loads of 53.8 and 43.7gm−3h−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilters 3aceramics 3acomposts 3agases 3atoluene 3axylene 0aBiofiltration 0aVolatile organic compound (VOC) 0aMixture 0aFull factorial design 0aANOVA1 aSergienko, Natalia1 aGoswami, Torsha1 aLópez, M.

In recent decades, many kelp habitats have transformed into turf-dominated communities. This represents a fundamental change in the overall habitat structure in these communities, with an unknown impact on upper trophic level organisms. We investigated how macroalgae morphology affects a common residential mid-trophic level wrasse, Tautogolabrus adspersus (cunner), which utilizes macroalgae for both refuge and foraging. Three studies were conducted: in situ behavioral video observations, a refuge choice experiment, and a foraging efficiency experiment. Video observations revealed that in kelp-dominated and mixed habitat types cunner use macroalgae more often for refuge than for foraging, but in turf-dominated habitats refuge and foraging events were equal. In these habitats, refuge-seeking was more often associated with a tall, morphologically simple kelp. The refuge choice experiment supported our video observations with cunner preferentially seeking refuge beneath taller but less morphologically complex algae instead of shorter filamentous forms. In predation trials, macroalgae complexity did not significantly affect the number of prey the fish captured. Our results provide evidence that the refuge-seeking behavior of this residential mid-trophic level fish may be impacted by the ongoing shifts in macroalgae dominance in the Gulf of Maine. Loss of its preferred refuge (tall, canopy-forming kelps) may force it to use the less-preferred introduced turf algae instead. However, whether turf provides sufficient protection for this species remains unclear. With the ongoing loss of kelp in temperate coastal ecosystems worldwide, it is important to understand the potential indirect effects that changes in habitat structure will have on the trophic interactions of upper level organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTautogolabrus adspersus 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3afish 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3alawns and turf 3amacroalgae 3amacrophytes 3apredation 3atrophic levels 3aturf algae 3aGulf of Maine 0aHabitat structure 0aFunctional traits 0aFoundation species 0aKelp 0aTurf algae 0aMorphology1 aMello, Kristen1 aLitterer, Amber1 aDijkstra, Jennifer A.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2018 Sept., v. 506 p.1-8dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2018.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245012200163300001600285520130300301592002801604650002001632650001801652650002401670650000901694650001501703650001601718653002601734653004501760653002001805653001601825653002501841700001901866700002601885700001801911700001601929773009001945856008502035852000902120655001202129IND60629982220221117234502.0191220e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062998222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoni, R.10aExperimental and numerical study on dish concentrator with cubical and cylindrical cavity receivers using thermal oil  ap. 168-181.  aIn this study, a parabolic dish concentrator with two types of cavity receivers was investigated. The designed experimental setup included a parabolic dish concentrator, cavity receivers, a heat exchanger system, and hydraulic circuit unit. Two optimized shapes of cubical and cylindrical cavity receiver were made and studied. Also, numerical modeling was developed for predicting the cavity receiver performance. The numerical results of the cavity receivers show a good agreement with the experimental results. The results indicated that the receiver heat gain and thermal efficiency of the cavity receivers had a similar trend compared to the temperature difference of the heat transfer fluid between the inlet and outlet of the cavity receivers. The results also clarified that the thermal efficiency of the cubical cavity receiver was higher than the thermal efficiency of the cylindrical cavity receiver in the steady-state period. The average thermal efficiency of the cubical and cylindrical cavity receiver was obtained as 65.14% and 56.44% in the steady-state period, respectively. The cubical cavity receiver can be recommended for an efficient heat gain, in comparison with the cylindrical cavity receiver based on the conducted experimental tests on 11 October, and 26 September 2016.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3aoils 3aprediction 3atemperature 0aExperimental analysis 0aCubical and cylindrical cavity receivers 0aEnergy analysis 0aThermal oil 0aSolar parabolic dish1 aKasaeian, A.B.1 aAskari Asli-Ardeh, E.1 aGhobadian, B.1 aGorjian, Sh0 tEnergy.g2018 July 01, v. 154 p.168-181dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010300159300001600262500002000278520106200298592002801360596006401388596002401452596003301476596002801509650001901537650001201556650000901568650001401577650000901591650001701600650001401617650002601631650002901657650000901686700001701695700001601712700001601728700002101744700002401765700001801789773012301807856007401930852000902004655001202013IND60786989020221120095024.0220807e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078698902DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.133852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrégoir, A.

Fish that were exposed to simulated pool drying as juveniles did not show changes in reproductive output or life span. Adults reacted by doubling short term egg deposition at the cost of a shorter lifespan. Overall, these results suggest that annual fish species can use phenotypic plasticity to maximize their reproductive output when faced with early pond drying, but this response appears to be life‐stage specific. In addition to frogs and aquatic insects, phenotypic plasticity induced by forthcoming drought is now also confirmed in annual fishes and could well be a common feature of the limited number of fish taxa that manage to survive in this extreme environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a12F0716NcFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO) fellowship  cFWO‐SB fellowship  aPF/10/007cExcellence Center  cKU Leuven Research Fund 3aNothobranchius 3adrought 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afish 3alife history 3alongevity 3aphenotypic plasticity 3areproductive performance 3arisk1 aPhilippe, C.1 aPinceel, T.1 aReniers, J.1 aThoré, E.

Herein, we show a facile and smart “turning solid into gel” strategy to fabricate persistent luminescence hydrogel for high-efficient persistent luminescence-sensitized photodynamic therapy. The homogeneous persistent luminescence hydrogel was synthesized via dispersing high-temperature calcined persistent luminescence material without corrosion and screening into a biocompatible alginate-Ca2+ hydrogel. The simple synthesis strategy allows 100% of utilization efficiency and intact persistent luminescence of persistent luminescence material. The persistent luminescence hydrogel possesses favorable biocompatibility, bright persistent luminescence, red light renewability, good syringeability, and strong fixing ability in tumors. The persistent luminescence hydrogel can be easily injected in vivo as a powerful localized light source for superior persistent luminescence-sensitized photodynamic therapy of tumors. The “turning solid into gel” strategy enables taking full advantages of persistent luminescence for biological applications, and shows great potential in utilizing diverse theranostic agents regardless of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3abiocompatibility 3acorrosion 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aluminescence 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3ared light 3ascreening 0aPersistent luminescence 0aTurning solid into gel 0aPhotodynamic therapy1 aWu, Jian-Cheng1 aWang, Haoyu1 aZhou, Li1 aZhang, Cai1 aCheng, Ran1 aKan, Di1 aZhang, Xuejun1 aYu, Chunshui0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Oct., v. 218 p.119328-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1193283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003500132040001800167100002000185245012000205300002000325506017300345520152600518650001602044650002102060650001102081650001802092650002802110650001302138650002502151650002602176650001602202650002402218650001802242650002302260650002402283650002402307650001402331650002702345650001902372650000902391650001902400650001102419650001302430700002402443700002202467700002502489700001802514700002402532700002302556773012402579856011202703856004802815956008802863961000902951852000902960655001202969IND50071703420221214225542.0131212e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007170342DNAL7 a2696502aris7 a10113/581262hdl7 adoi.org/10.1021/jf202576k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaatz, Susan K.10aBaking reduces prostaglandin, resolvin, and hydroxy-fatty acid content of farm-raised Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)  ap. 11278-11286.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe consumption of seafood enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Several n-3 oxidation products from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) have known protective effects in the vasculature. It is not known whether the consumption of cooked seafood enriched in n-3 PUFA causes appreciable consumption of lipid oxidation products. We tested the hypothesis that baking Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) increases the level of n-3 and n-6 PUFA oxidation products over raw salmon. We measured the contents of several monohydroxy-fatty acids (MHFA), prostanoids, and resolvins. Our data demonstrate that baking did not change the overall total levels of MHFA. However, baking resulted in selective regioisomeric loss of hydroxy fatty acids from arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and EPA, while significantly increasing hydroxyl-linoleic acid levels. The contents of prostanoids and resolvins were reduced several-fold with baking. The inclusion of a coating on the salmon prior to baking reduced the loss of some MHFA but had no effect on prostanoid losses incurred by baking. Baking did not decrease n-3 PUFA contents, indicating that baking of salmon is an acceptable means of preparation that does not alter the potential health benefits of high n-3 seafood consumption. The extent to which the levels of MHFA, prostanoids, and resolvins in the raw or baked fish have physiologic consequence for humans needs to be determined. 3aSalmo salar 3aarachidonic acid 3abaking 3ablood vessels 3acardiovascular diseases 3acoatings 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afarmed fish 3ahydroxy fatty acids 3aisomerization 3alipid peroxidation 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aoxidation 3aphysiological response 3aprostaglandins 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asalmon 3aseafoods1 aGolovko, Mikhail Y.1 aBrose, Stephen A.1 aRosenberger, Thad A.1 aBurr, Gary S.1 aWolters, William R.1 aPicklo, Matthew J.0 tJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 59, no. 20 p.11278-11286wJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/581263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/doi.org/10.1021/jf202576k  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/HNRC1686.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012700152300002000279520108000299592002801379650004401407650002201451650001901473650001801492650001301510650001601523650001701539650001701556650000901573650001901582650002301601650002101624650001301645650001401658650003401672650002301706700001701729700001301746700001401759700001601773700001201789700001801801773012301819856007401942852000902016655001202025IND60667598620221123035237.0190919e20150522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066759862DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra07036h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Sa10aCrosslinking of collagen using a controlled molecular weight bio-crosslinker: β-cyclodextrin polyrotaxane multi-aldehydes  ap. 46088-46094.  aIn this study, a series of β-cyclodextrins (β-CD) polyrotaxane multi-aldehydes with different molecular weight were prepared and then were used as crosslinker for collagen. The properties of crosslinked collagen were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR), collagenase degradation assay, mechanical testing, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and in vitro cell studies. Compared to crosslinked by conditional crosslinkers, such as glutaraldehyde (GA) and N-ethyl-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), the collagen crosslinked by the novel biocrosslinker has been improved effectively in biodegradation rate, compress modulus and show lower cytotoxicity. Besides, the modified collagen was suitable for the cell adhesion and proliferation due to the appropriate swelling property, porosity and pore size. Considering the excellent properties, β-cyclodextrins (β-CD) polyrotaxane multi-aldehydes is a novel crosslinker for collagen and the obtained collagen gel shows great potential to use as tissue engineering scaffold.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abiodegradation 3acell adhesion 3acollagen 3acollagenase 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3agels 3aglutaraldehyde 3amechanical testing 3amolecular weight 3aporosity 3arotaxanes 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atissue engineering1 aXie, Renjian1 aCai, Jie1 aWang, Lin1 aShi, Xuetao1 aRen, Li1 aWang, Yingjun0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 22, v. 5, no. 57 p.46088-46094dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra07036h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245007100169500001900240520164300259592002801902650001801930650001201948650001901960650001201979650001301991650001502004650001502019650001402034650000902048650001302057650001502070650001502085650001302100650002802113650002002141650000902161653001102170653001402181653002802195653001902223700006302242700006102305773012102366856008802487852000902575655001202584IND60696303220221118132832.0201111e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069630322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1049122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Canxi10aNutritional and environmental losses embedded in global food waste  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReducing food waste can contribute positively towards multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) but the differences in the food waste across countries in terms of embedded nutrients and environmental impacts is not well-known. Here we assess the value of daily per capita food waste of 151 countries using two recent indicators for embedded nutrition losses (wasted nutrient days and wasted daily diets) and five indicators for environmental impacts. Globally, on average, 65 kg of food is wasted per year by one person of which 25% is through wasted vegetables, 24% through cereals and 12% through fruits. Daily wasted amounts of vitamin C, K, Zinc, Copper, Manganese and Selenium are especially high representing 25-50% of their daily dietary recommended intake (DRI) value. Cereals, fruits and vegetables are the three major food groups contributing the most to wasted nutrients followed by meat, dairy and eggs that contribute substantially to the wasted calcium, choline, riboflavin, zinc, and vitamin B₁₂. Global average amount of food waste per capita per year contains 18 healthy diets meaning it can fulfil the DRIs of 25 nutrients for one person for 18 days. The embedded environmental footprints in average person's daily food waste are: 124 g CO₂ eq., 58 Litre freshwater use, 0.36 m² cropland use, 2.90 g nitrogen and 0.48 g phosphorus use. Cereals, meat, and sugar are major food groups contributing to environmental impacts. Our results show that different countries have widely varying nutrients and environmental footprints embedded in their food waste entailing country-specific waste reduction interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acholine 3acropland 3afood waste 3afreshwater 3amanganese 3ameat 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3ariboflavin 3aselenium 3asustainable development 3awaste reduction 3azinc 0aGlobal 0aNutrition 0aEnvironmental footprint 0aSustainability1 aChaudhary, Abhishek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6602-72791 aMathys, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1633-848X0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2020 Sept., v. 160 p.104912-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.1049123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245016100173520143800334592002801772650001501800650001801815650001701833650001801850650002101868650002001889650000901909650001301918650002901931650003101960650001401991650002202005650002802027650001902055650001302074650002802087653003002115653002002145653002502165653001702190653001802207700001702225700001602242700001802258700001302276700002002289773009302309856009102402852000902493655001202502IND60649477920221116145744.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064947792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1193302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhen, Shijie10aDrug delivery micelles with efficient near-infrared photosensitizer for combined image-guided photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy of drug-resistant cancer  aThe combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy (CT) offers a promising approach for the tumor eradication for overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR), which is a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment. However, for PDT, simultaneously achieving near-infrared (NIR) emission and efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation with low dark toxicity is urgently needed but remains challenging. Herein, a series of novel fluorophores with strong NIR emission, hybridized local and charge transfer characteristics, good two-photon absorption, high photostability, low dark cytotoxicity and excellent ROS generation ability are developed. By encapsulating the NIR fluorophore (DEB-BDTO) as a photosensitizer along with a drug resistance inhibitor tariquidar (TQR) within a polymeric prodrug (PMP), a reduction-sensitive drug co-delivery system (DEB/TQR@PMP micelles) is constructed. The DEB/TQR@PMP micelles exhibit a prominent synergistic lethal effect of PDT and CT on SKOV-3 cells and SKOV-3/MDR cells, and can apparently enhance the inhibition of tumor growth compared with sole PDT or CT in the tumor-bearing mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments prove that the new NIR fluorophores are excellent photosensitizers and can furnish an efficient combination therapy of image-guided PDT and CT within drug delivery micelles, which is particularly useful for eradicating multidrug resistance cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanimal models 3acytotoxicity 3aencapsulation 3afluorescent dyes 3ain vivo studies 3amice 3amicelles 3amultiple drug resistance 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneoplasms 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aphotostability 3apolymers 3areactive oxygen species 0aNear-infrared fluorophore 0aPhotosensitizer 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aChemotherapy 0aDrug delivery1 aYi, Xiaoqing1 aZhao, Zujin1 aLou, Xiaoding1 aXia, Fan1 aTang, Ben Zhong0 tBiomaterials.g2019 Oct., v. 218 p.119330-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1193303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010200170506010400272506007600376520124200452592002801694506003701722650001001759650001001769650001301779650001101792650002101803650001001824650001301834650001301847650000901860650001201869650001401881650000901895650001401904650001001918650001301928650002201941650001201963650001201975650001501987650001202002650001002014650001002024650001202034650001602046650001102062650001602073650001502089650001102104650001402115651001202129651002202141651001002163653001702173653002002190653001602210653001302226653000902239653001002248700002102258700002202279700002002301700002202321700002902343700002602372700002002398700001902418700003202437700002602469700002502495700001902520700002802539700002302567700001502590700001902605700002202624700002902646773012002675856008702795852000902882655001202891IND60782710720221207055838.0220802e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078271072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1047252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOchando, Juan10aPalynological investigations in the Orce Archaeological Zone, Early Pleistocene of Southern Spain  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPalynological investigations in the Orce Archaeological Zone (OAZ) (Guadix-Baza Basin, Granada, Spain), Venta Micena 1 (VM1), Barranco León (BL) and Fuente Nueva 3 (FN3) are presented.

Cheesemaking was carried out concurrently in a 12-L pilot vat and a 10,000-L industrial vat following the normal cheesemaking protocol. Cheese moisture, whey fat content, hardness, springiness, and adhesiveness were measured during syneresis. The results obtained show that cutting time is best predicted by considering the coagulation ratio at the inflection point and the percentage increase in the ratio during coagulation, with no need for the first derivative. The large field of view reflectance ratio provided good results for the prediction of moisture content, yield, hardness, springiness, and adhesiveness of the final cheese.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acheesemaking 3acoagulation 3acutting 3agoat cheese 3ahardness 3alipid content 3amanufacturing 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3areflectance 3awater content 3awhey 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysisxstandards. 2aFood Quality 2aFood Technologyxmethods 2aGoats 2aWaterxanalysis1 aGarcía, V.1 aFerrandini, E.1 aNavarro Carrión, Jesús,1 aCastillo, M.1 aLópez, M.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Nov., v. 95, no. 11 p.6320-6331dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-55613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245011600195500001100311520140300322592002801725596004501753596005501798650001101853650001501864650001501879650001001894650001701904650002101921650001501942651001301957700002001970700002101990700002302011700002202034773011402056856007302170852000902243655001202252IND60741787320221122162429.0210618e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074178732DNAL7 a10.1111/lre.123552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharip, Zati1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3523-117812aA review of the importance, gaps and future directions of Integrated Lake Basin Management Planning in Malaysia  aREVIEW  aThe present study assessed the importance of basin management plans for managing lakes in Malaysia within the context of Integrated Lake Basin Management (ILBM) governance principles. Although ILBM has been promoted since 2007, less than 2% of the lakes in the country have basin management plan in place. Most of these management plans need to be fully adopted, reviewed and evolved as living documents by all relevant stakeholders for successful lake basin management. Increasing demands for resources and development within catchments, as well as emerging threats, require integrated management of lake resources for sustainable use, highlighting the need to develop basin management plans for all other lakes to support their effective management. The present study also provides a narrative for developing an ILBM plan, including consideration of lake characteristics, the linked lentic–lotic water systems comprising lake basins, ecosystem services, participatory planning and for performing continuous lake governance improvements within a cyclical process. Management planning for lakes should address specific focus areas or major threats, continuing the process until all its relevant governance pillars are strengthened. These ILBM plans can eventually be integrated to the larger river basin management and state water resources management planning towards effective water governance.  aPublisher supplied data  cKementerian Sumber Asli dan Alam Sekitar  aP23170000190001cMinistry of Environment and Water 3abasins 3aecosystems 3agovernance 3alakes 3astakeholders 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aMalaysia1 aZakaria, Salmah1 aMd Noh, Md Nasir1 aNakamura, Masahisa1 aMuhandiki, Victor0 tLakes & reservoirs.g2021 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.e12355-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2144x1320-53317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lre.123553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245013900192300001800331520185500349592002802204650002802232650002002260650001902280650001102299650001902310650001402329650000902343650001502352650004602367650002902413650000902442650001202451650002902463651001002492651001002502700002302512700001902535773011702554856008102671852000902752655001202761IND50090091920221120052528.0150215e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009009192DNAL7 a246826032pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-014-3717-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakraborty, Abhishek10aGeo-spatial analysis of the temporal trends of kharif crop phenology metrics over India and its relationships with rainfall parameters  ap. 4531-4542.  aThe Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies bimonthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of 8 × 8 km spatial resolution for the period of 1982–2006 were analyzed to detect the trends of crop phenology metrics (start of the growing season (SGS), seasonal NDVI amplitude (AMP), seasonally integrated NDVI (SiNDVI)) during kharif season (June to October) and their relationships with the amount of rainfall and the number of rainy days over Indian subcontinent. Direction and magnitude of trends were analyzed at pixel level using the Mann–Kendall test and further assessed at meteorological subdivision level using field significance test (α = 0.1). Significant pre-occurrence of the SGS was observed over northern (Punjab, Haryana) and central (Marathwada, Vidarbha and Madhya Maharashtra) parts, whereas delay was found over southern (Rayalaseema, Coastal Andhra Pradesh) and eastern (Bihar, Gangetic West Bengal and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal) parts of India. North, west, and central India showed significant increasing trends of SiNDVI, corroborating the kharif food grain production performance during the time frame. Significant temporal correlation (α = 0.1) between the rainfall/number of rainy days and crop phenology metrics was observed over the rainfed region of India. About 35–40 % of the study area showed significant correlation between the SGS and the rainfall/number of rainy days during June to August. June month rainfall/number of rainy days was found to be the most sensitive to the SGS. The amount of rainfall and the number of rainy days during monsoon were found to have significant influence over the SiNDVI in 24–30 % of the study area. The crop phenology metrics had significant correlation with the number of rainy days over the larger areas than that of the rainfall amount.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine monophosphate 3acrop production 3agrowing season 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aphenology 3arain 3avegetation 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgrowth & development 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSpatio-Temporal Analysis 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aSeshasai, M.

Risk factors for infection and food items implicated in outbreaks vary by antimicrobial resistance pattern. We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from four enteric disease surveillance systems capturing information on incidence, demographics, seasonality, geographic distribution, outbreaks, and antimicrobial resistance of Newport infections over a 10-year period from 2004 through 2013. Incidence increased through 2010, then declined to rates similar to those in the early years of the study. Incidence was highest in the South and among children <5 years old. Among isolates submitted for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, 88% were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested (pansusceptible) and 8% were resistant to at least seven agents, including ceftriaxone. Rates of pansusceptible isolates were also highest in the South and among young children, particularly in 2010. Pansusceptible strains of Newport have been associated with produce items and environmental sources, such as creek water and sediment. However, the role of environmental transmission of Newport in human illness is unclear. Efforts to reduce produce contamination through targeted legislation, as well as collaborative efforts to identify sources of contamination in agricultural regions, are underway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Newport 3aantibiotic resistance 3aceftriaxone 3achildren 3ademographic statistics 3adigestive system diseases 3adisease surveillance 3ageographical distribution 3ahuman diseases 3alaws and regulations 3arisk factors 3asalmonellosis 3asediments 3aserotypes 3astreams 3aUnited States 0aSalmonella 0aNewport 0asurveillance 0aantimicrobial resistance1 aChai, Shua J.1 aKarp, Beth E.1 aJudd, Michael C.1 aReynolds, Jared1 aSwanson, Krista C.1 aNisler, Amie1 aMcCullough, Andre1 aGould, L.

In a second trial, the female fecundity performances were evaluated by feeding teneral females on the same cattle. These females were then mated and their production parameters monitored, as well as the survival of freshly emerged flies. Fipronil had a significant effect on tsetse fly survival (p < 0.001). Over a period of 30 days, up to 40% of tsetse fly mortality was observed within 72 h after tsetse were released. The residual effects ranged between 51 and 74 days when tsetse flies were released twice within a 15-day interval in the presence of a treated animal. When tsetse flies were fed on treated cattle through a parafilm membrane, 92 days after the treatment, no significant effect of fipronil was observed on the reproductive performance of females, i.e., as well as on fecundity (p = 0.948) and emergence rates (p = 0.743), or puparial weight (p = 0.422). This was also the case for the survival of young flies, with no difference observed between the two groups. After this study, it is confirmed that fipronil is highly effective against tsetse flies. Its efficacy in controlling ticks is already known but other externalities such as the control of biting insects add value to its use.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlossina palpalis gambiensis 3acattle 3afecundity 3afemales 3afipronil 3ainsects 3amales 3amortality 3areproductive performance 3aresidual effects1 aRayaisse, J.

Xylooligosaccharides, high-purity lignin, and digestible substrates for producing glucose can be consecutively collected during the integrated process. The structural change and fate of lignin during autohydrolysis process was deeply investigated. Additionally, the structural characteristics and active functional groups of the lignin fractions obtained by these delignification processes were thoroughly investigated by NMR (2D-HSQC and 31P NMR) and GPC techniques. The chemical compositions (S, G, and H) and major linkages (β-O-4, β-β, β-5, etc.) were thoroughly assigned and the frequencies of the major lignin linkages were quantitatively compared. Considering the structural characteristics and molecular weights of the lignin as well as enzymatic saccharification ratio of the substrate, the combination of autohydrolysis and organic base-catalyzed ethanol pretreatment was deemed as a promising biorefinery mode in the future based on bamboo feedstock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys edulis 3abamboos 3abiorefining 3achemical composition 3adelignification 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3aglucose 3alignin 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3asaccharification 3astable isotopes 3axylooligosaccharides 0aBamboo 0aLignin changes 0aStructural characterization 0aPretreatment 0a2D-HSQC spectra1 aWen, Jia-Long1 aWang, Bing1 aWang, Hanmin,1 aLiu, Chuan-Fu1 aSun, Runcang,0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 244 p.717-725dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245010100181300001600282520155000298592002801848650001101876650001401887650002401901650001601925650001201941650001601953653003701969653002002006653002202026653001702048653002702065700006402092700002102156773009002177856008502267852000902352655001202361IND60629982620221117234612.0191220e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062998262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahangir, Mohammad Hossein12aA detailed theoretical modeling and parametric investigation of potential power in heaving buoys  ap. 201-209.  aThe present survey was conducted to theoretically envisage the dynamic behavior of general heaving power buoys, aimed at examining the behavior of buoy displacement in a realistic manner as well as obtaining the potential power and scrutinizing the interaction effect of various parameters i.e. water angular frequency and buoy overall mass on potential power. To make it more realistic, the coefficient of damping between heaving buoy and water was considered to be time-varying in three cases and the relative results were compared thoroughly. With the propagation of the wave, the buoy displacement and Submergence Response Delay (SrD) were modeled for various considered case functions and compared with undamped system. The potential power was numerically calculated by solving the dynamic motion of the buoy for various buoy masses and angular frequencies of the wave. According to the results, the heaving behavior of the buoy did not obediently follow the regular sinusoidal form of the wave, due to the synchronous effect of dynamic force together with considering time-varying damping. There was no significant difference, still not zero, between the three considered case functions for damping. The SrD values for all the angular frequencies were within the range of −0.5 to 0.5 considering time-varying damping. The potential power of the buoy increased exponentially as the angular frequency increased. Finally, the potential power was formulated as an exponential function of two variables, i.e. buoy mass and angular frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3amathematical models 3asubmergence 3asurveys 3awater power 0aDynamic behavior of heaving buoy 0aPotential power 0aAngular frequency 0aMass of buoy 0aTime-dependent damping1 aHosseini, Seyed Sina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5143-71551 aMehrpooya, Mehdi0 tEnergy.g2018 July 01, v. 154 p.201-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013400169500002200303520171600325592002802041653002902069653001302098653001202111653001002123653001202133700001602145700001402161700001902175700001302194700005502207773007602262856008602338852000902424655001202433IND60649478120221116145553.0190705e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064947812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.placenta.2019.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Zhiyong10aPotential role of microRNA-424 in regulating ERRγ to suppress trophoblast proliferation and invasion in fetal growth restriction  aPre-press version  aAbnormal expression of estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) protein is associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). The upstream regulators of ERRγ are still unknown.To evaluate the placental expression level of microRNA-424 (miR-424) and to demonstrate the relationship between miR-424 and FGR.The expression levels of miR-424 were detected in FGR and control placentas. HTR-8/SVneo cells were transfected with mimics or inhibitors to increase or decrease the miR-424 expression level, respectively. The transwell and CCK-8 assays were used to determine trophoblast-derived cell line invasion and proliferation. The expression levels of miR-424, ERRγ, and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD17B1) were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The relationship between miR-424, ERRγ, and HSD17B1 was determined by luciferase reporter assay.Compared to the normal pregnancy group, FGR placental tissues showed a significantly higher expression level of miR-424. The up-regulation of miR-424 decreased trophoblast-derived cell line invasion and proliferation. Down-regulation of miR-424 enhanced invasive and proliferative abilities of the cell lines. Over-expression of miR-424 reduced ERRγ protein levels and decreased both mRNA and protein levels of HSD17B1. Thus down-regulation of miR-424 induced protein expression of ERRγ and enhanced the mRNA and protein expressions of HSD17B1. MiR-424 probably mediated the expression of ERRγ via binding to sites other than mRNA 3′UTR.MiR-424 may be associated with the pathogenesis of FGR by modulating trophoblast-derived cell line proliferation and invasion. MiR-424 may play a role in mediating the protein expressions of ERRγ and HSD17B1.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFetal growth restriction 0aPlacenta 0amiR-424 0aERRγ 0aHSD17B11 aHe, Zhiming1 aCai, Jian1 aHuang, Linhuan1 aZhu, Hui1 aLuo, Yanmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7354-07670 tPlacenta.g2019 July 01, dElsevier LtdwJournal:19242x0143-40047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.placenta.2019.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03782naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245009600179300001600275520164200291592002801933650002501961650002301986650002502009650001502034650002002049650001402069650001102083650002202094650002402116650001102140650002402151650001202175650001102187650001702198650003002215650001302245650002502258650001902283650001302302650001302315650001002328650001302338650001302351650002902364650002202393653002102415653002002436653002002456653002902476653002202505700003802527700002902565700003902594700003502633700002702668700003202695700002802727700002902755700002302784700002002807700004002827773011202867856008402979852000903063655001203072IND60611507520221121054727.0200503e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061150752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerumen-Varela, Guillermo10aFunctional analysis of a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) rhamnogalacturonan lyase promoter  ap. 175-184.  aThe enzyme rhamnogalacturonan lyase (RGL) cleaves α-1,4 glycosidic bonds located between rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues in the main chain of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), a component of the plant cell wall polymer pectin. Although the mode of action of RGL is well known, its physiological functions associated with fruit biology are less understood. Here, we generated transgenic tomato plants expressing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of a −504 bp or a −776 bp fragment of the promoter of a tomato RGL gene, Solyc11g011300. GUS enzymatic activity and the expression levels of GUS and Solyc11g011300 were measured in a range of organs and fruit developmental stages. GUS staining was undetectable in leaves and roots, but high GUS enzymatic activity was detected in flowers and red ripe (RR) fruits. Maximal expression levels of Solyc11g011300 were detected at the RR developmental stage. GUS activity was 5-fold higher in flowers expressing GUS driven by the −504 bp RGL promoter fragment (RGFL3::GUS) than in the isogenic line, and 1.7-fold higher when GUS gene was driven by the −776 bp RGL promoter fragment (RGLF2::GUS) or the constitutive CaMV35S promoter. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the highest expression of GUS was in fruits at 40 days after anthesis, for both promoter fragments. The promoter of Solyc11g011300 is predicted to contain cis-acting elements, and to be active in pollen grains, pollen tubes, flowers and during tomato fruit ripening, suggesting that the Solyc11g011300 promoter is transcriptionally active and organ-specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aenzyme activity 3aflowering 3afruits 3agalacturonic acid 3aglycosidic linkages 3aleaves 3amechanism of action 3apectins 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolymers 3aregulatory sequences 3areporter genes 3arhamnose 3aripening 3aroots 3astaining 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 0aβ-Glucuronidase 0aPlant cell wall 0aPromoter region 0aRhamnogalacturonan lyase 0aTransgenic tomato1 aOchoa-Jiménez, Verónica-Alhelí1 aBurgara-Estrella, Alexel1 aTrillo-Hernández, Eduardo-Antonio1 aOjeda-Contreras, Ángel-Javier1 aOrozco-Avitia, Antonio1 aRivera-Domínguez, Marisela1 aTroncoso-Rojas, Rosalba1 aBáez-Sañudo, Reginaldo1 aDatsenka, Tatsiana1 aHanda, Avtar K.1 aTiznado-Hernández, Martín-Ernesto0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2018 Oct., v. 229 p.175-184dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004000150245007900190300001800269520044200287592002800729650001900757650001100776650001800787650001500805650001100820653001900831653001800850653001100868653001600879653002100895700003300916700003800949700002900987700002901016700004901045700002201094700002201116700003101138773010601169856008401275852000901359655001201368IND60122274520221120103058.0150325e20141117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012227452DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9203342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApolinário, Alexsandra Conceição10aPhysico-chemical quality parameters of herbal products from Agave sisalana  ap. 1992-1999.  aAgave sisalana components have great potential in different pharmaceutical applications, but the quality of herbal raw materials is essential to reach the desired product specifications.

Yet, empirical evidence of the legacy of long-term liquid manure application, and its interaction with crop rotation management on grain yield and soil properties is scarce. Here we evaluate the benefits and legacy of repeated liquid dairy manure (115 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) over 12 years (2003–2014) on corn yield, soil organic matter (SOM) content, and soil nutrient availability in three annual cash grain cropping systems under different crop rotation management in southern Wisconsin. The three systems include: continuous corn (CC); minimum-till corn-soybean (CS); and an organically managed corn-soybean-wheat/oat-clover rotation (CSW). Results showed that, liquid manure application increased corn yield, soil test phosphorus (STP), and soil test potassium (STK) content across the three systems, and soil pH and nitrate (0–90 cm) in CC over the 12 years. The lack of significant impact of manure on SOM content suggested that the liquid manure application was insufficient to build SOM on these fertile Mollisols. The legacy benefit of liquid manure application on corn yield was significant in 2015, but no longer detectable in 2017, three years after the last application, while STP and STK content remained higher in manure treated plots than no manure plots. In 2017, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil pH, and soil nitrate content were also greater in manured plots, but the effect was crop rotation specific. We show that manure is an equivalent or superior substitute for synthetic fertilizers providing a potential win-win scenario for both grain and dairy farms in the North Central US, where synthetic fertilizer is costly (cash-grain farms) and land for manure spreading is often limited (dairy farms). Our study suggest that liquid dairy manure application is beneficial for agroecosystem productivity but continual applications are needed to sustain its benefit in the crop production systems in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMollisols 3aagroecosystems 3acash grain farms 3acation exchange capacity 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3adairy farming 3adairy manure 3aenvironmental hazards 3agrain yield 3aliquid manure 3amanure spreading 3amineral fertilizers 3aminimum tillage 3anitrates 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aproduction technology 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3aWisconsin 0aCorn yield 0aLegacy effects1 aSanford, Gregg R.1 aHedtcke, Janet L.1 aRuark, Matthew D.0 tAgricultural systems.g2020 May, v. 181 p.102825-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2020.1028253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001700154245020700171300001800378520182400396592002802220650002002248650002502268650001402293650002502307650001802332650000902350650001602359650001502375650001302390650001002403650002302413650002602436650001802462650001402480650004302494650001502537650001202552650003002564650001102594650002502605650002302630650002002653650001802673650001902691651001202710700001602722773012702738856003802865852000902903655001202912IND4468593120221122055636.0200220e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446859312DNAL7 a215204862pmid7 a10.1002/ps.21842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Tina10aMonitoring of spirodiclofen susceptibility in field populations of European red mites, Panonychus ulmi (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae), and the cross‐resistance pattern of a laboratory‐selected strain  ap. 1285-1293.  aBACKGROUND: Phytophagous mites such as the European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), are serious pests in European fruit tree orchards, and a number of acaricides are frequently used to control them. Spirodiclofen (Envidor®) has been a commonly used acaricide for several years. In the present study, European field populations collected in 2009 and 2010 were checked for their susceptibility to spirodiclofen by using discriminating dose and full dose response bioassays. RESULTS: In 2009 and 2010, a total of 63 field populations (including winter eggs) of European red mites were collected in different European countries, and in several populations from south‐western Germany a shifting in susceptibility against spirodiclofen was observed. Full dose response bioassays on different developmental stages of field‐collected strains suggested an age‐dependent expression of resistance because eggs remain fully susceptible to spirodiclofen. Artificial selection with spirodiclofen of one of the field strains resulted in resistance ratios of > 7000. Synergism studies suggest a possible role of cytochrome‐P450‐dependent monooxygenases in spirodiclofen detoxification. Most of the other acaricides from different chemical classes displayed no or low cross‐resistance in a spirodiclofen‐selected strain. CONCLUSION: In order to preserve spirodiclofen as an important tool in spider mite resistance management, the efficacy situation should be continuously monitored, and it is suggested that spirodiclofen be alternated with acaricides coming from different mode‐of‐action classes. An observed age‐specific expression of resistance revealed full susceptibility of eggs, so targeting spirodiclofen particularly against eggs is likely to reduce the selection pressures imposed on other life stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanonychus ulmi 3aartificial selection 3abioassays 3adevelopmental stages 3adose response 3aeggs 3afruit trees 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3apests 3aphytophagous mites 3aresistance management 3aspirodiclofen 3asynergism 2a4-Butyrolactonexanalogs & derivatives 2aAcaricides 2aAnimals 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple 2aFemale 2aPesticide Synergists 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSpiro Compounds 2aTetranychidae 2aToxicity Tests 3aGermany1 aNauen, Ralf0 tPest management science.g2011 Oct., v. 67, no. 10 p.1285-1293dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2184  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013000165520186600295592002802161650001802189650001502207650001602222650001402238650001502252650001702267650002002284650002102304650000902325650001102334650001702345650001102362650001002373650001302383650001402396650001702410650001302427650001102440650001702451653001702468653001602485653002102501653001502522653003102537700001702568700001602585700001602601700001602617700001602633700001202649700001702661773010302678856008602781852000902867655001202876IND60782150120221120080339.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078215012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Weili10aSpatial bacterial subpopulations of a human lung lobe and their potential impact on the progression of pulmonary tuberculosis  aBetter understanding the spatial variation in resident pulmonary bacteria can help to link the disease severity of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with lung bacteriomes. This study aimed to investigate bacterial compositions in subniches of a lung lobe from pulmonary TB patient with two separate visible lesions. There were no significant differences between the bacterial compositions in normal tissue and TB lesions, but the bacterial compositions of the two TB lesions differed significantly (P = 0.009). Interestingly, 52 OTUs (relative abundance >1%) that specifically inhabiting certain lung niches were observed and they were affiliated with five phyla. Specific OTUs affiliated with Firmicutes mainly inhabited normal tissues. The dominant phylum in the lung subniches was Proteobacteria, with a relative abundance between 67.03% and 99.99%. Ralstonia, Achromobacter, and Pseudomonas were the most abundant genera, collectively accounting for 34.02% of total bacterial species. A total of 667 of the 700 bacterial connections in a co-correlation network of 145 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit) were positive, indicating a cooperative relationship between bacterial members. Using PICRUSt tool, we do predict bacterial MetaCyc functions responsible for lipid synthesis and heme biosynthesis across the lung lobe that are essential for generation of caseous necrosis and TB disease pathology. MetaCyc pathways responsible for the degradation of aromatic biogenic amines, sulfur oxidation, and denitrification were all related to M.tb growth status, and they were significantly enriched in the lesion with necrosis than that with inflammation. These results open a new insight for us to comprehend the spatial profile of bacteriomes in a pulmonary TB human lung lobe, and shed light on the design of future diagnosis and treatment for pulmonary TB disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter 3aFirmicutes 3aPseudomonas 3aRalstonia 3abacteriome 3abiosynthesis 3adenitrification 3adisease severity 3aheme 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alipids 3alungs 3anecrosis 3aoxidation 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3asulfur 3atuberculosis 0aPulmonary TB 0aBacteriomes 0aSpatial insights 0aTB lesions 0aBacterial MetaCyc function1 aZhao, Yingli1 aWang, Chong1 aDong, Yujie1 aQu, Xiaodie1 aLiu, Zichen1 aLi, Kun1 aChe, Nanying0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Aug., v. 169 p.105656-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010900173300001400282520152400296536041401820592002802234596011302262596005902375650001502434650001502449650001302464650002002477650001102497650001302508650003102521651001502552700001802567700001702585700002302602773010102625856008502726852000902811655001202820IND60646420920221118000758.0190610e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064642092DNAL7 a10.1080/00063657.2018.15630442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaksson, Natalie10aForaging behaviour of Razorbills Alca torda during chick-rearing at the largest colony in the Baltic Sea  ap. 11-21.  aCapsule: Foraging behaviour in the Razorbill Alca torda during breeding was similar to that found elsewhere, aside from dive shape. Aims: To investigate the foraging behaviour of Razorbills during the breeding season at the largest colony in the central Baltic Sea. Methods: A combination of global positioning system (GPS) and time-depth recorder (TDR) devices were used on Razorbills breeding on the island of Stora Karlsö, Baltic Sea, during the chick-rearing period. Results: Five GPS tracks and nine TDR logs were retrieved from 12 Razorbills, and 7399 dives were analysed. Razorbills foraged south and southwest of the colony. Maximum and mean (±sd) foraging range from the colony was 72.7 km and 13.1 ± 13.5 km, respectively. Mean dive depth (15.3 ± 2.4 m) and duration (53.1 ± 8.5 s) were similar to those of a more southern Baltic Sea Razorbill colony. Dive depth had a bimodal distribution, with 70% of dives deeper than 10 m and 30% shallower than 10 m. There was a clear diel foraging pattern with 89% of dives occurring during daytime and a higher proportion of shallow dives at night. Unexpectedly, dives were primarily U-shaped. The Razorbills spent 31% of their overall time activity budget flying or diving. Conclusion: Aside from dive shape, foraging behaviour was consistent with that reported at other colonies of Razorbills. Inconsistency in dive shape may be due to a bimodal foraging strategy, local prey behaviour or competition with the Common Guillemot Uria aalge.  aFunding for instrumentation and fieldwork was provided by research grants to S.

We compared various films having different nanoparticle content ratios, or different vertical (depth) material distributions, with quartz crystal microbalance and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy. We found that the decay times of quartz crystal microbalance were longer when there was an excess of nanoparticles in the film or if it was a uniform layered structure. Higher durabilities were also observed in these structures, which were correlated to the dissipation results.

Both feedstocks were previously mechanically pretreated to reduce their particle size. The study was planned according two factors: the feedstock to inoculum (F/I) ratio and the waste paper to macroalgae (WP/MA) ratio. The F/I ratios checked were 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 and the WP/MA ratios were 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 and 100:0. The highest methane yield (386 L kg−1 VSadded) was achieved at an F/I ratio of 0.2 and a WP/MA ratio of 50:50. A biodegradability index of 0.87 obtained in this study indicates complete conversion of feedstock at an optimum C/N ratio of 26. Synergistic effect was found for WP/MA 25:75, 50:50 and 75:25 mixing ratios compared with the substrates mono-digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3afeedstocks 3ainoculum 3amacroalgae 3amethane production 3amixing 3amixing ratio 3aparticle size 3asynergism 3awaste paper 0aAlgae 0aAnaerobic co-digestion 0aBiomass 0aRenewable energy 0aWaste paper 0aAD 0aANOVA 0aF/I 0aKDP 0aMC 0aRSM 0aTS 0aVS 0aWP/MA1 aAlaswad, Abed1 aEl-Hassan, Zaki1 aOlabi, Abdul G.0 tEnergy.g2018 July 01, v. 154 p.119-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245016100188520159000349592002801939650002501967650001501992650001402007650001802021650001702039650001302056650001502069650001102084650001602095650001302111650001202124650002502136650001602161650003002177650002602207650001702233650001102250650001502261650001902276650001702295650001702312650001402329651001102343653002302354653001102377653002602388653002202414700004102436700002602477700002502503700002902528700003902557700004102596700002302637700003002660700003402690773010302724856008602827852000902913655001202922IND60782150220221120080158.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078215022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCupozak-Pinheiro, Wellinton Jhon10aCandida species contamination in drinking groundwater from residence wells in three municipalities of midwestern Brazil and the potential human health risks  aGroundwater represents one of the largest safe drinking water sources worldwide; however, it has been threatened by increased human activities in recent years. Candida species express virulence factors that contribute to the establishment and worsening of infections, although little is known about the virulence profiles of these species in potable groundwater. The aim of this study was to detect the presence of yeasts in groundwater from residential wells and to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility profile, hydrolytic enzyme production, adhesion capacity, and biofilm formation of Candida spp. Fifty yeasts representing nine genera were isolated: Candida (48%), Meyerozyma (20%), Pichia (8%), Exophiala (8%), Clavispora (4%), Kodamaea (4%), Rhodotorula (4%), Hanseniaspora (2%), and Kazachstania (2%). Candida parapsilosis was the most commonly isolated species, and approximately 29% of the Candida isolates were resistant to at least one azole. All Candida isolates were able to produce hydrolytic enzymes and adhere to polystyrene, and most were classified as hydrophobic. Candida spp. can establish and form biofilms when cultivated in different media such as Sabouraud broth, water, and calcium hypochlorite. The use of contaminated groundwater for human consumption represents a possible route for the transmission of clinically relevant yeasts that can cause fungal infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and establish effective measures for groundwater treatment to ensure the quality and safety for consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aClavispora 3aExophiala 3aHanseniaspora 3aKazachstania 3aKodamaea 3aMeyerozyma 3aPichia 3aRhodotorula 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3acalcium hypochlorite 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater treatment 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ahydrolases 3ahydrophobicity 3apathogenesis 3apolystyrenes 3avirulence 3aBrazil 0aWater microbiology 0aYeasts 0aAntifungal resistance 0aVirulence factors1 aAraújo de Almeida-Apolonio, Adriana1 aSasaki, Melina Hatsue1 aMaran, Nayara Halimy1 aPires de Araújo, Renata1 aBeraldo dos Santos Silva, Danielly1 ade Andrade dos Santos, João Víctor1 aBarufatti, Alexeia1 aRodrigues Chang, Marilene1 aPires de Oliveira, Kelly Mari0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Aug., v. 169 p.105660-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100002000162245013700182300001800319520188500337592002802222650002502250650002302275650001302298650001302311650001702324650001902341650001202360650002302372650002802395650001202423650001502435650001602450650001802466650001102484650001502495650002102510650002802531650001802559650003302577650004202610650002402652650002402676650002502700650004802725650002702773650002602800700001502826700001502841773010002856856007702956852000903033655001203042IND60083431720221120073414.0141101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008343172DNAL7 a229815782pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-57642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimoto-Nira, H.10aCommensal symbiosis between a Lactococcus lactis strain and an Enterococcus mundtii strain increases cell yield in constituted broth  ap. 6372-6378.  aTo exert their beneficial effects, probiotics need to survive in the stringent conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Symbiosis between different bacteria is a potential way of enhancing this survival. In developing new probiotic cultures, we investigated the synergic effect between Enterococcus mundtii IFO 13712 and 7 strains of Lactococcus lactis, many of which are widely used as starter bacteria for making dairy products and have probiotic properties. The growth yield of a mixed culture of L. lactis strain Y and IFO 13712 in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth was greater than that of a single culture. Supernatant from culture of strain IFO 13712 enhanced the growth of strain Y, but that of strain Y did not enhance the growth of strain IFO 13712. This commensalism phenomenon was confirmed by using a simpler tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYG) broth. Increased cell yield in mixed culture of the 2 strains compared with single cultures was observed in TYG broth in the presence of both Tween 80 and citrate but not in TYG broth alone or TYG broth containing either Tween 80 or citrate. Thus, the Tween 80 and citrate in the broth contributed to the commensalism. Metabolite analysis revealed that ethanol production in the co-metabolism of glucose and citrate by strain Y was suppressed by mixed culture in TYG broth containing Tween 80 and citrate, compared with that in TYG broth containing citrate alone. The mechanism supporting the observed commensal symbiosis between strains Y and IFO 13712 was the increase in availability of glucose for lactate production by strain Y because, in glycolysis, the pathway from glucose to lactate is energic, whereas the pathway from glucose to ethanol is not. Whether growth stimulation of strain Y by mixing it with IFO 13712 in milk products will enhance the survival of strain Y in the intestine remains to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus mundtii 3aLactococcus lactis 3abacteria 3acitrates 3acommensalism 3adairy products 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ametabolites 3amixed culture 3amixing 3aprobiotics 3astarter cultures 2aCitric Acidxmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aDairy Productsxmicrobiology 2aEnterococcusxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aLactatesxmetabolism 2aLactococcus lactisxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProbioticsxmetabolism 2aSymbiosisxphysiology1 aOhmori, H.1 aSuzuki, C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2012 Nov., v. 95, no. 11 p.6372-6378dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-57643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010600175300001800281520074400299592002801043650003401071650001901105650003001124650001701154650001601171650001901187650003901206650002801245650001101273650002501284650001801309653001501327653001601342653002501358653002701383653001801410700001601428700002201444700002501466773010601491856008401597852000901681655001201690IND60122274920221120194437.0150325e20141117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012227492DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2014.9234222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMihaylova, Dasha Sp.10aStudy on the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Allium ursinum L. pressurised-liquid extract  ap. 2000-2005.  aAllium ursinum L. is widely used as a spice as well as a traditional medicine.

Resistance to metronidazole in treating trichomoniasis is a problematic health issue. We aimed to determine the minimum lethal concentration (MLC) of metronidazole for Trichomonas vaginalis isolates detected in Mansoura, Egypt and studied the genotypic profile of these isolates. Vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 320 symptomatic and 100 asymptomatic females, for whom clinical examination, vaginal discharge wet mount, Giemsa stain, and culture in modified Diamond’s media were performed. Metronidazole susceptibility testing by an aerobic tube assay was performed. Both sensitive and resistant isolates were examined by PCR amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 49/420 (11.7%) using either culture or PCR, while wet mount and Giemsa stain detected the parasite in 8.1 and 7.6% of participants, respectively. After 48 h incubation, most isolates were sensitive to metronidazole with a minimal lethal concentration (MLC) of 1 μg/ml. Mild resistance was observed in two isolates with MLCs of 64 μg\ml and mild to moderate resistance was observed in an additional two isolates with MLCs of 128 μg/ml. The four isolates that demonstrated low to moderate metronidazole resistance displayed a unique genotype band pattern by RFLP compared to the other 45 samples that were metronidazole sensitive. Our results highlight the presence of in vitro metronidazole tolerance in a few T. vaginalis isolates in Mansoura, Egypt that may lead to the development of drug resistance as well as the possibility of an identifying RFLP pattern in the isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichomonas vaginalis 3aclinical examination 3adrug resistance 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ametronidazole 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asexually transmitted diseases 3atrichomoniasis 3aEgypt1 aEl-Kholya, El-Said I.1 aAbou El-Khair, Salwa M.1 aAbdelmegeed, Eman S.1 aHamoudaa, Marwa M.1 aMohamed, Sara A.1 aEl-Tantawy, Nora Labeeb0 tParasitology research.g2017 Nov., v. 116, no. 11 p.3125-3130dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-017-5627-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01463naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015500157300001800312500002000330520034400350592002800694650001300722650001000735650000900745650001600754650001500770651001400785651001900799700001800818700002300836700001500859700002000874773012400894856007401018852000901092655001201101IND60786990120221120145803.0220807e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078699012DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.133972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBovcon, N.

Treatment of UTIs is becoming a challenge as uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which is the most common etiological agent, has developed resistance to the main classes of antibiotics. Small molecules that interfere with metabolic processes rather than growth are attractive alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Repurposing of already known drugs for treating infectious diseases could be an attractive avenue for finding novel therapeutics against infections caused by UPEC. Virtual screenings enable the rapid and economical identification of target ligands from large libraries of compounds, reducing the cost and time of traditional drug discovery. Moreover, the drugs that have been approved by the FDA have low cytotoxicity and good pharmacological characteristics. In this work, we targeted the HisC enzyme of the histidine biosynthetic pathway as enzymes of this pathway are absent in humans. We screened the library of FDA-approved drugs against HisC via molecular docking, and four hits (Docetaxel, Suramin, Digitoxin, and Nystatin) showing the highest binding energy were selected. These were further tested for antibacterial activity, which was observed only for Docetaxel (MIC value of 640 μg/ml); therefore, Docetaxel was further tested for its efficacy in vivo in murine catheter UTI model and antibiofilm activity using crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy. Docetaxel inhibited biofilm formation and reduced the bacterial load in urine, kidney, and bladder. Docking studies revealed that Docetaxel acts by blocking the binding site of HisC to the native substrate by competitive inhibition. Docetaxel may be a potential new inhibitor for UPEC with antibacterial and antibiofilm capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofilm 3abladder 3acatheters 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3adigitoxin 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aetiological agents 3agentian violet 3ahistidine 3akidneys 3aligands 3amice 3amicrobial load 3amodels 3anystatin 3apathogenesis 3asuramin 3atherapeutics 3aurine 3auropathogenic Escherichia coli 0aUPEC 0aIn silico 0aDrug repurposing 0aIn vitro 0aIn vivo1 aKalia, Manmohit1 aChaudhary, Naveen1 aSingh, Vikram1 aYadav, Vivek Kumar1 aModgil, Vinay1 aKant, Vishal1 aMohan, Balvinder1 aBhatia, Alka1 aTaneja, Neelam0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2022 Aug., v. 169 p.105665-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2022.1056653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03875naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245007800199300001800277500002000295520206800315592002802383596007402411650001902485650001202504650001902516650002302535650001202558650001602570650002102586650001902607650001602626650002602642650001102668650001302679650002102692650001702713650001102730651002202741651001302763651001002776700002002786700001802806700001502824700002102839700001702860700003602877700001902913700006802932700003003000700002303030700002103053773012903074856007303203852000903276655001203285IND60741788220221122033203.0210618e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074178822DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.132612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnor, Simon E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5685-239010aDrought, fire and grazing precursors to large‐scale pine forest decline  ap. 1138-1151.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Temperate forests are currently facing multiple stresses due to climate change, biological invasions, habitat fragmentation and fire regime change. How these stressors interact with each other influences how, when and whether ecosystems recover, or whether they adapt or transition to a different ecological state. Because forest recovery or collapse may take longer than a human lifetime, predicting the outcomes of different stressor combinations remains difficult. A clearer vision of future forest trajectories in a changing world may be gained by examining collapses of forests in the past. Here, we use long‐term ecological data to conduct a post‐mortem examination of the decline of maritime pine forests (Pinus pinaster Ait.) on the SW Iberian Peninsula 7000–6500 years ago. LOCATION: Portugal and Spain. METHODS: We compared four palaeoecological records—two with pine declines and two without—using a multiproxy approach. Bioclimatic differences between the four sites were explored. Proxies for past vegetation and disturbance (fire and grazing) were compared with independent palaeoclimatic records. We performed functional traits analysis and used phase plots to examine the causes of pine decline. RESULTS: The pine decline represents a critical transition in SW Iberia, which lies close to maritime pine's bioclimatic limits. Prolonged drought likely killed trees and suppressed the fires that normally stimulate pine germination and pinewood recovery. Increased grazing pressure facilitated the rapid spread of resprouter shrubs. These competed with pine trees and ultimately replaced them. Our data highlight complex interactions between climate, fire, grazing and forest resilience. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The pine decline occurred at least a century after post‐fire resprouters overtook obligate seeders in the vegetation, constituting an early‐warning signal of forest loss. Fire suppression, resprouter encroachment and grazing may threaten the persistence of Mediterranean forests as droughts become more frequent and extreme.  aPublisher supplied data  aPTDC/AAC‐CLI/108518/2008cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aPinus pinaster 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aconiferous forests 3adrought 3afire regime 3afire suppression 3aforest decline 3agermination 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahumans 3anecropsy 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3avision 3aIberian Peninsula 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 aAraújo, João,1 aBoski, Tomasz1 aGomes, Ana1 aGomes, Sandra D.1 aLeira, Manel1 aFreitas, Maria da Conçeição,1 aAndrade, Cesar1 aMorales‐Molino, César1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9464-862X1 aFranco‐Múgica, Fátima1 aAkindola, Rufus B.1 aVannière, Boris0 tDiversity & distributions.g2021 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.1138-1151dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.132613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016700155300002000322520119700342592002801539650001401567650002301581650001501604650001401619650002101633650001801654650001701672650001101689650001201700650000901712700001501721700001801736700001401754700001601768700001601784700001901800773012401819856007401943852000902017655001202026IND60667599720221123002150.0190919e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066759972DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra07078c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xuehua10aThree-dimensionally ordered macroporous SiO₂-supported transition metal oxide catalysts: facile synthesis and high catalytic activity for diesel soot combustion  ap. 49780-49790.  aThree-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) SiO₂ was synthesized by a colloidal crystal template (CCT) method, and 3DOM SiO₂-supported transition metal oxides catalysts were prepared by a facile incipient-wetness impregnation method.

The catalytic performances of 3DOM SiO₂-supported transition metal oxide catalysts are mainly controlled by three factors: the macroporous effects of the 3DOM structure, the redox properties of transition metal oxides and the sizes of transition metal oxide NPs. 3DOM SiO₂-supported transition metal oxide catalysts are promising for practical applications in soot combustion owing to high activity and low cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3ananoparticles 3aporous media 3asilica 3asilicon 3asoot1 aZhao, Zhen1 aWei, Yuechang1 aLiu, Jian1 aLi, Jianmei1 aDuan, Aijun1 aJiang, Guiyuan0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 03, v. 5, no. 61 p.49780-49790dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra07078c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245020200163300001800365520185000383592002802233650001902261650001102280650002802291650001102319650002102330650003002351650001802381650002202399650001202421650002402433650001102457650001202468650001202480650001002492650001002502650001402512650001602526650001602542650001402558650001502572650003302587650001402620651001002634700001502644700002202659700001802681700001502699700001802714700001702732773011102749856008102860852000902941655001202950IND60584949620221121050724.0171029e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058494962DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-017-5628-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Pinky10aMorphometric and molecular characterisation of Tenuiproboscis keralensis n. sp. infecting marine and brackish water fishes from the south-west coast of India with a note on morphological plasticity  ap. 3131-3149.  aA new species of acanthocephalan infecting marine and brackish water fishes from the south-west coast of India is described. The parasite belongs to the genus Tenuiproboscis, and the fish hosts include Lutjanus argentimaculatus, L. ehrenbergii, Siganus javus, Epinephelus malabaricus, E. coioides, Scatophagus argus, Parascolopsis aspinosa, Caranx ignobilis, Gerres filamentosus and Lates calcarifer. The parasite inhabits mid- and hindgut regions and is characterised by an elongated, cylindrical, bulbous and posteriorly tapering metasoma and a claviform proboscis having 14–15 rows of 14–15 hooks each. Females larger than males, measured 3898.16–10,318.00 μm (6430.00 ± 1417.30) in length and 458.93–1435.68 μm (929.81 ± 250.39) in width. Males measured 3234.89–8644.20 μm (5729.50 ± 1176.60) in length and 388.30–1584.61 μm (795.88 ± 184.12) in width. Parasites recovered from different host species showed morphological/morphometric variations. However, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed significant overlapping of characters indicating their similarities. Proboscis profiling based on variations in size and position of hooks also yielded similar results. Further, in molecular phylogenetic analysis, parasites from different fish hosts formed a monophyletic clade with strong bootstrap support, again indicating their conspecific nature. These morphological/morphometric variations can be ascribed to differences in host species. Morphology and morphometrics in combination with PCA, proboscis profiling and molecular analysis suggest the present acanthocephalan parasite is different from other described species of Tenuiproboscis. Hence, it is considered as a new species and named T. keralensis n. sp. Prevalence, intensity and abundance of the parasite in different hosts are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aCaranx 3aEpinephelus malabaricus 3aGerres 3aLates calcarifer 3aLutjanus argentimaculatus 3aParascolopsis 3aScatophagus argus 3aSiganus 3abrackish water fish 3acoasts 3afemales 3ahindgut 3ahosts 3amales 3amonophyly 3amorphometry 3anew species 3aparasites 3aplasticity 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproboscis 3aIndia1 aShamal, P.1 aChandran, Archana1 aBinesh, C.

The objective of this research is to provide insight into the value of exergy analysis in sustainability assessment of cement industry. For that purpose, a detailed exergy evaluation of a complete cement plant located in Morocco was performed using both conventional and advanced exergetic analysis. The major internal exergy losses were identified during the calcination process and the two raw mill departments, which amounts to about 78.66%, 70.86%, and 72.12% respectively. Those irreversibilities are split into avoidable/unavoidable exergy destruction in the advanced exergy analysis. Findings show that 15%, 29.21% and 31.54% of the total exergy destruction in the calciner and the raw mills 1 and 2 respectively are avoidable. However, there is a need for optimization of comminution and combustion operating parameters in the cement production process currently in use.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3acombustion 3aexergy 3amanufacturing 3aMorocco 0aCement industry 0aExergy analysis 0aExergy efficiency 0aIrreversibility1 aBounahmidi, T.0 tEnergy.g2018 July 01, v. 154 p.190-200dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245012600165300001800291500002000309520047300329592002800802596011400830596009200944650001501036650002301051650000901074650001401083650001401097650001201111700002101123700001901144700001801163700002001181700001801201773012401219856007401343852000901417655001201426IND60786990220221120130931.0220807e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078699022DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.134082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, M.

Understanding the groundwater quality, aquifer processes, groundwater storage, and depletion trends in the IGB alluvial aquifer system— one of the world's most important freshwater resources has been the focus of many previous studies. However, understanding what governs uranium variability in the IGB alluvial aquifer system— for example, whether uranium is released from natural deposits or anthropogenic sources such as mill tailing, emissions from the nuclear industry, combustion of fossil fuels, and phosphate fertilizers— are under-explored but critically important for constraining the environmental fate of uranium. Here, we present surface and groundwater uranium concentration data in the central parts of the IGB alluvial aquifer system. We find a high concentration of groundwater uranium above the World Health Organization provisional guideline value of 30 μg/L in 17% (n = 29) of collected groundwater samples, whereas other heavy metals, namely Cr, Ni, Pb, and Cd were within the recommended range. Trace element systematic demonstrates that anomalous uranium enrichment is primarily derived from geogenic sources, while uranium mobility is predominantly controlled by the alkalinity (a proxy for bicarbonate), hence by soluble uranyl carbonate complexes. As in the year 2020, the Bureau of Indian Standard incorporated uranium as a possible drinking water contaminant, our dataset calls for additional assessments of groundwater uranium concentrations in Indian groundwater resources because uranium concentration data are scarce compared to other geogenic contaminants such as arsenic and fluoride. We conclude that uranium, like arsenic and fluoride, is also critical geogenic contaminant in the alluvial aquifers that needs to be better monitored as higher levels of uranium in drinking water have adverse health effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalkalinity 3aalluvial aquifer 3aarsenic 3abasins 3abicarbonates 3acarbonates 3acombustion 3adata collection 3aenvironmental fate 3afluorides 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3aindustry 3aphosphates 3auranium 3auranyl ions 3awater quality 3awater supply 0aHydrochemistry 0aTrace element 0aIndo-Gangetic Plain 0aGeogenic contamination1 aDutta, Subham1 aSen, Indra S.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 143 p.105374-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.1053743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02306naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008000164300001600244520098900260592002801249650002501277650001101302650000901313650001501322650001501337650001101352650002301363650001401386650001401400650001201414653002401426653002201450653002201472653001401494653003001508653002501538700005401563700001801617700001501635700001401650773009001664856008501754852000901839655001201848IND60629983720221117234730.0191220e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062998372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGui, Peng10aMicro linear generator for harvesting mechanical energy from the human gait  ap. 365-373.  aA type of multipolar linear permanent magnet generator (MLPMG) was developed in order to harvest human lower-limb motion energy to meet the increasing power supply needs of portable electronic devices. A large acceleration of the foot, particularly at the heel, was noted when analyzing human lower-limb motion during walking, so an energy harvester was placed on the heel. A series of MLPMGs were then designed and the static magnetic induction intensity vector diagram was obtained from each. A key parameter of MLMPG efficiency was found to be the gap between the stator and mover. Another important factor is the thickness of the mover spacers between magnet pieces. Finally, a number of experiments were conducted, which supported the conclusion that the output power of harvesters have negative relation with length of gap and thickness of spacers. It was found that a subject, walking at a speed of 5 km/h with a matched resistor load, can produce an output power of 20 mW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic equipment 3aenergy 3agait 3aharvesters 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3amagnetic materials 3amagnetism 3aresistors 3awalking 0aHuman gait analysis 0aAcceleration data 0aMechanical energy 0aHarvester 0aMagnetic induction vector 0aOutput power density1 aDeng, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1111-72851 aLiang, Zelang1 aCai, Yeyun1 aChen, Jie0 tEnergy.g2018 July 01, v. 154 p.365-373dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011400168520128400282592002801566650005201594650001701646650001601663650001101679650001301690650002101703650001401724650001601738653001601754653001301770653001401783653001601797653002301813653002201836700002101858700001701879700002001896700002501916773009801941856008202039852000902121655001202130IND60713060920221120111327.0220628e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071306092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1184692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelhassan, Assia10aAssessment of effective imidazole derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 main protease through computational approach  aBecause of the fast increase in deaths due to Corona Viral Infection in majority region in the world, the detection of drugs potent of this infection is a major need. With this idea, docking study was executed on eighteen imidazole derivatives based on 7-chloro-4-aminoquinoline against novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, we carried out a docking study of these molecules in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The result indicate that Molecules N° 3, 7 and 14 have more binding energy with SARS-CoV-2 main protease recently crystallized (pdb code 6LU7) in comparison with the other imidazole derivatives and the two drug; Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Because of the best energy of interaction, these three molecules could have the most potential antiviral treatment of COVID-19 than the other studied compounds. The structures with best affinity in the binding site of the protease have more than 3 cycles and electronegative atoms in the structure. This may increase the binding affinity of these molecules because of formation of π-bonds, halogen interactions and/or Hydrogen bond interactions between compounds and the enzyme. So, compounds with more cycles and electronegative atoms could have a potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aactive sites 3achloroquine 3aenergy 3ahalogens 3ahydrogen bonding 3aimidazole 3aproteinases 0aCoronavirus 0aCOVID-19 0aImidazole 0aChloroquine 0aHydroxychloroquine 0aMolecular docking1 aEn-nahli, Fatima1 aZaki, Hanane1 aLakhlifi, Tahar1 aBouachrine, Mohammed0 tLife sciences.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 262 p.118469-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1184693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009300168520090400261592002801165650001501193650001801208650002101226650002201247650003701269653002801306653001401334653002301348653002701371653001501398700002001413700002301433700006501456700005701521700002801578773009201606856008601698852000901784655001201793IND60782712020221117044135.0220929e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078271202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1237282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandar, Aude10aSpectroelectrochemistry as a new tool for the quantification of UV filters in sun creams  aThis study focuses on the spectroelectrochemical quantification of four UV filters, butylmethoxy dibenzoylmethane (BM), benzophenone-3 (BP3), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EM) and octocrylene (OC) used as sunscreens in cosmetics. Three of them exhibited electrochemical activity resulting in the modification of their absorption spectrum under the application of an oxidizing potential of +1.8 V vs. Ag. When working with a mixture containing both electroactive and nonelectroactive UV filters, UV–vis absorption spectra recorded before and after the application of the potential differed. The combination of spectral deconvolution of the spectra pair allowed a more accurate identification and quantification of UV filters than spectral deconvolution of the initial absorbance spectrum alone. This method was effective for the assessment of UV filters in model mixtures and commercial sun creams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abenzophenones 3aelectrochemistry 3aspectral analysis 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aSpectroelectrochemistry 0aUV filter 0aAbsorption spectra 0aSpectral deconvolution 0aSunscreens1 aNoguer, Thierry1 aMba Ekomo, Vitalys1 aRodrigues, Alice M.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7671-12611 aStien, Didier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9950-53611 aCalas-Blanchard, Carole0 tTalanta.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 250 p.123728-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1237283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245008800205300001600293520139700309592002801706650001601734650001101750650002501761651001001786653001801796653002601814653003801840653003101878653001701909773009001926856008502016852000902101655001202110IND60566475520221119165809.0180830e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056647552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlop, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6609-752810aChanges in energy output in a regional economy: A structural decomposition analysis  ap. 145-151.  aIn the input-output literature, structural decomposition analysis (SDA) has largely been used to disentangle changes in key variables over time. This paper uses the demand-driven input-output model and proposes a simple method to decompose the changes in energy gross output into different determinants. Specifically, the total changes in energy output are divided into two elements: technological changes, showing the effects of changing the technological coefficients of the input-output model, and structural changes, showing the effects of changing the final demand components. In addition, technological changes are divided into production effects, capturing the impacts of modifying the intermediate purchases of sectors, the substitution effects, capturing the impacts of modifying the selling structure, and the mixed effects, capturing the impacts of changes in total intermediate relations. The empirical application, which is for the Spanish region of Catalonia, uses two input-output tables that cover an entire decade (2001 and 2011). The results show a positive contribution of technology to increasing energy output, while the contribution of the final demand for energy is negative. In addition, the various energy activities exert a different repercussion on energy gross output changes. This highlights the importance of using detailed methods in the study of energy issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy flow 3amodels 3atechnological change 3aSpain 0aEnergy output 0aInput-output analysis 0aStructural decomposition analysis 0aTechnological coefficients 0aFinal demand0 tEnergy.g2017 June 01, v. 128 p.145-151dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010400165300001600269520158100285592002801866650001201894650002301906650001601929650001901945650001901964650001701983650002702000650001602027650001102043650001102054650001802065650001002083650003702093653002402130653002302154653002902177653002502206700001402231700001602245700001602261700001702277700001702294773011302311856008502424852000902509655001202518IND60568639920221120133421.0180830e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056863992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Boxin10aSynthesis of novel guanidinium-based anion-exchange membranes with controlled microblock structures  ap. 151-159.  aFour guanidinuium-functionalized model compounds containing different substituent groups were prepared, and the substituent effects on the overall alkaline stability of the guanidinium cations were investigated. Based on the good alkaline stability of the model compounds, novel guanidinium-based anion exchange membranes (AEMs), GPP-co-PAEK x, with controlled microblock structures were subsequently designed and synthesized in good yield via a three step reaction that included a fluorophenyl-amine reaction, methylation and nickel (0)-catalyzed coupling. Notably, the use of a hydrophilic, guanidinium cation-containing component as a raw material in the direct synthesis of AEMs via nickel(0)-catalyzed coupling avoided using hygroscopic Vilsmeier salts and is obviously different from the conventional method that involves bromomethylation or post-quaternization. The GPP-co-PAEK x membranes exhibited lower water uptake values (≤23.4% at 60°C) and hydroxide conductivities comparable to those of others reported randomly functionalized guanidinium-based AEMs with similar ion exchange capacity (IEC) values. This finding indicates that the GPP-co-PAEK x membranes with controlled microblock structures possess well-developed hydrophilic/hydrophobic nanophase separation, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, long-term alkaline stability tests demonstrated that the alkaline stability of both the hydrophilic guanidiniums groups and the copolymer backbone contributed to the good alkaline stabilities of the GPP-co-PAEK x membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3acomposite polymers 3aguanidinium 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aion exchange 3aion-exchange membranes 3amethylation 3amodels 3anickel 3araw materials 3asalts 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aGuanidinium cations 0aAlkaline resistant 0aAnion-exchange membranes 0aMicroblock structure1 aDong, Xue1 aLi, Yanchun1 aZheng, Jifu1 aLi, Shenghai1 aZhang, Suobo0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Sept. 01, v. 537 p.151-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002700156245008700183300001600270520077600286592002801062650001301090650003701103650001201140650001301152650001201165700001701177700001801194700001801212700002101230773010701251856005701358852000901415655001201424IND50068947920221122232800.0130831e197803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006894792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1978.tb02299.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidya Sagar Reddy, K.,10aEffect of spin chilling and freezing on bacteria on commercially processed turkeys  ap. 334-336.  aA study was made of the effect of spin chilling and later freezing on possible spread of salmonellae and other bacteria on commercially processed turkeys in a federally inspected plant. Sixty‐one turkeys were examined before and after spin chilling, after being “shell‐frozen” in brine, after blast freezing and after being held in a freezer storage room. After spin chilling, levels of all organisms tested were reduced, and no salmonellae were recovered. Coagulase positive staphylococci persisted on turkeys during processing and after freezing. As expected, freezing caused further decreases in bacterial populations, but the spin chilling operation itself was highly effective in reducing counts.

The gas turbine has to operate under demand-driven modes and its components consume their useful life faster than the engines of the base-load operation era. As a result the diagnostics and prognostics tools should be further developed to cope with the above operation modes and improve the condition based maintenance (CBM).In this study, we present a derivative-driven diagnostic pattern analysis method for estimating the performance of gas turbines under dynamic conditions. A real time model-based tuner is implemented through a dynamic engine model built in Matlab/Simulink for diagnostics. The nonlinear diagnostic pattern is then partitioned into data-windows. These are the outcome of a data analysis based on the second order derivative which corresponds to the acceleration of degradation. Linear regression is implemented to locally fit the detected deviations and predict the engine behavior. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed through comparison between the predicted and actual degradation by the remaining useful life (RUL) metric. The results demonstrate and illustrate an improved accuracy of our proposed methodology for prognostics of gas turbines under dynamic modes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adiagnostic techniques 3aenergy 3aenvironmental law 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3arenewable energy sources 3aturbines 0aDerivative-driven analysis 0aWindow-based regression 0aGas turbine prognostics 0aCondition based maintenance1 aMeskin, Nader0 tEnergy.g2017 June 01, v. 128 p.302-311dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245011400159300002000273500001900293520113900312592002801451650003401479650002201513650002301535650002301558650001201581650001301593700006001606700002701666700005401693700005701747700002501804700005901829700005701888773014901945856007602094852000902170655001202179IND60677426020210423000000.0191127e20191104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067742602DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b097102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVollmer, Ina10aActivity Descriptors Derived from Comparison of Mo and Fe as Active Metal for Methane Conversion to Aromatics  ap. 18814-18824.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aProducing aromatics directly from the smallest hydrocarbon building block, methane, is attractive because it could help satisfy increasing demand for aromatics while filling the gap created by decreased production from naphtha crackers. The system that catalyzes the direct methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) best so far is Mo supported on zeolite. Mo has shown to outperform other transition metals (TMs). Here we attempt to explain the superiority of Mo by directly comparing Fe and Mo supported on HZSM-5 zeolite. To determine the most important parameters responsible for the superior performance of Mo, detailed characterization using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques combined with catalytic testing and theoretical calculations are performed. The higher abundance of mono- and dimeric sites for the Mo system, their ease of carburization in methane, as well as intrinsically lower activation energy barriers of breaking the methane C–H bond over Mo explain the better catalytic performance. In addition, a pretreatment in CO is presented to more easily carburize Fe and thereby improve its catalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalytic activity 3amethane 3azeolites1 aOuld-Chikh, Samy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3486-09441 aAguilar-Tapia, Antonio1 aLi, Guanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3031-81191 aPidko, Evgeny1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9242-99011 aHazemann, Jean-Louis1 aKapteijn, Freek1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0575-79531 aGascon, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7558-71230 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Nov. 04, v. 141, no. 47 p.18814-18824dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b097103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01833naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010800178300001600286520091700302592002801219650001201247650002001259650002401279650000901303700002301312700002201335773009301357856008401450852000901534655001201543IND60097546620221119013622.0141104e20121012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009754662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, Gregório L.S.10aComparisons between predicted and observed behaviour of a geosynthetic reinforced abutment on soft soil  ap. 101-113.  aThe use of soil reinforcement for the construction of embankments on soft soils has become an increasing practice. This paper presents comparisons between predicted and observed behaviour of a geogrid reinforced abutment on soft soil using a finite element code. The problem is quite complex in terms of geometry and soil conditions. The results obtained in the numerical simulation were compared to the results obtained from instrumentation. The numerical analysis was able to provide good comparisons between calculated and measured vertical displacements and maximum excess pore pressures using back-calculated consolidation properties. However, significant deviations were observed for horizontal displacements and reinforcement forces. Despite some limitations of the numerical tool employed, the results obtained showed that the design could have been improved had such numerical analysis been carried out.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageology 3ainstrumentation 3amathematical models 3asoil1 aPalmeira, Ennio M.1 aMacêdo, Íris L.0 tEngineering geology.g2012 Oct. 12, v. 147-148 p.101-113dElsevier B.V.x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013300166300001400299520159900313592002801912650002201940650001301962650001401975650002301989650001002012650002002022650001002042650001402052650001402066650001402080650001002094651001702104651001802121700001202139700001802151700001802169700001402187773008302201856004802284852000902332655001202341IND4473986220221120144441.0120524e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447398622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-011-0476-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPretorius, Z. A.10aSeedling resistance to stem rust race Ug99 and marker analysis for Sr2, Sr24 and Sr31 in South African wheat cultivars and lines  ap. 15-23.  aThe appearance and spread of races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici with virulence for the Sr31 resistance gene has renewed interest in breeding for durable resistance to stem rust of wheat. Since the occurrence of stem rust has been low in South Africa until the detection of race TTKSF in 2000, breeding for resistance to this disease has not been a primary objective. The aim of this study was to test bread wheat cultivars and lines at the seedling stage for their infection response to stem rust, thus determining their level of resistance or vulnerability. A collection of 65 bread wheat entries was tested with one USA race, two Eastern African races, and three South African races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. The Eastern African and South African races all belong to the Ug99 lineage. The cultivars Duzi, Caledon, Elands, PAN 3364, PAN 3191, SST 047, SST 399, and Steenbras produced resistant infection types (ITÂ <Â 3) to all races. The molecular marker Sr24#50 indicated the presence of Sr24 in 12 entries. In cultivars resistant to TTTTF, TTKSF, and TTKSP but susceptible to TTKSK and PTKST, the iag95 DNA marker indicated the presence of Sr31 in five wheat lines. Using the cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker csSr2, Sr2 was detected in PAN 3377, Inia, and Steenbras. Few South African wheat cultivars appear to have a broad-based resistance to stem rust, as 88% of the entries were susceptible as seedlings to at least one of the races tested. Diversification of resistance sources and more directed breeding for stem rust resistance are needed in South Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia graminis 3abreeding 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3araces 3aseedlings 3astem rust 3avirulence 3awheat 3aSouth Africa 3aUnited States1 aJin, Y.1 aBender, C.

The origin of this IRES mechanism is not known. Previously, a partial fragment of a divergent dicistrovirus RNA genome, named ancient Northwest territories cripavirus (aNCV), was extracted from 700-year-old caribou feces trapped in a subarctic ice patch. The aNCV IGR sequence adopts a secondary structure similar to contemporary IGR IRES structures, however, there are subtle differences including 105 nucleotides upstream of the IRES of unknown function. Using filter binding assays, we showed that the aNCV IRES could bind to purified ribosomes, and toeprinting analysis pinpointed the start site at a GCU alanine codon adjacent to PKI. Using a bicistronic reporter RNA, the aNCV IGR can direct translation in vitro in a PKI-dependent manner. Lastly, a chimeric infectious clone swapping in the aNCV IRES supported translation and virus infection. The characterization and resurrection of a functional IGR IRES from a divergent 700-year-old virus provides a historical framework for the importance of this viral translational mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCripavirus 3aRNA 3aRangifer tarandus 3aalanine 3afeces 3agenome 3aice 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal ribosome entry sites 3anucleotides 3aribosomes 3aviruses1 aVlok, Marli 1 aFlibotte, Stephane 1 aJan, Eric 0 tViruses.g2021 Mar. 17, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130304933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01416naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005200173300001600225500001400241520057500255592002800830650002300858650001100881650001300892773015200905856008401057852000901141655001201150IND60730426720221119052253.0210310e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073042672DNAL7 a10.25226/bboc.v141i1.2021.a92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalley, Matthew R.10aNeotypification of Catharus ustulatus (Nuttall)  ap. 109-112.  aNAL-light  aIn a recent paper, I demonstrated that the original description of Turdus ustulatusNuttall, 1840, was likely based on a specimen of Catharus guttatus (Pallas, 1811).

The model includes parameters characterizing the climate, water and terrestrial systems of the sea and its watershed, the economics, fishery, agriculture, mineral resources, and the population. Cognitive modeling is used to study only qualitative changes taking place in the system at different complexes of conditions. The criterion of optimization is the level of living of the population. The scenario considered include various climate conditions, investments in production assets, industrial and domestic waste treatment, and the development of agriculture and fishery. The cognitive model was used to carry out 10 experiments with different scenarios. For each scenario, operation regimes were chosen to ensure the highest population living standard. The highest living standard will be ensured at the scenario that includes favorable climate conditions (warming above the climate norm for 1960–1990), sufficient mineral resources, and investments. The maximal level of agricultural development can cause damage to the environment. The cognitive model as a means for strategic planning has been developed at a qualitative level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3acase studies 3acognition 3aenvironmental degradation 3afisheries 3amodels 3awaste treatment 3awater 3awatersheds1 aFilatov, N.

We propose a conceptual framework based on multiple water use efficiencies (WUEs) that can be used to gain insight into high-level comparisons of the productivity and sustainability of alternative farming practices across temporal and spatial scales. The framework is intended as a data aggregation and presentation device. It treats flows of water, biomass and money in a mixed farming system; economic inefficiencies in these flows are tracked as they are associated with a range of NRM indicators. We illustrate the use of the framework, and its place in a larger research programme, by employing it to synthesise the results from a set of modelling analyses of the effect of land use choices on long-term productivity and a range of NRM indicators (frequency of low ground cover, deep drainage, N leaching rates and rate of change in surface soil organic carbon). The analyses span scales from single paddocks and years to whole farms and have been carried out with the APSIM and GRAZPLAN biophysical simulation models and the MIDAS whole-farm economic model. In single wheat crops in one study, different land uses in preceding years affect grain yield primarily by affecting the harvest index. When the scale changes to cropping rotations, the critical factor affecting overall water use efficiency is found to be the proportion of stored soil water that is transpired by crops. When ordinated in terms of their water use efficiencies, a set of 45 modelled rotation sequences at another location are differentiated mainly by the proportion of pasture in the rotation; when rotations are ordinated using key NRM indicators, the proportion of lucerne pasture is the main distinguishing factor. Finally, we show that for whole crop-livestock farms at three different locations across southern Australia, the pattern of water use efficiencies in the most profitable farming systems changes in similar ways as cropping proportion is altered. At this scale, land use choices affect multiple water use efficiency indices simultaneously and commodity prices determine the balance of the resulting economic tradeoffs. Limitations to the use of the WUE framework arising from its relative simplicity are discussed, as are other areas of farming systems research and development to which it can be applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3aalternative farming 3abiomass 3acommodity prices 3acrops 3adrainage 3afarmers 3afarms 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aland use 3aleaching 3apastures 3aresearch and development 3asimulation models 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water 3awater use efficiency 3awheat 3aAustralia1 aRobertson, M.J.1 aRoutley, R.0 tAgricultural systems.g2011 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.162-174dElsevier Ltdx0308-521X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2010.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008700170300001600257520190700273592002802180650002402208650002102232650001102253650002102264650001602285650002402301650001902325650000902344650001502353650001402368650001902382650002002401650002202421650002402443650001702467651001002484653001902494653001602513653001802529653001302547653001202560700001902572700002102591700001402612700001402626700001402640700001602654700001502670700001602685700001502701700001302716700001502729700001502744700001602759700001102775773012302786856008802909852000902997655001203006IND60581596120221120232925.0201111e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058159612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Tongjun14aThe association between ambient temperature and the risk of preterm birth in China  ap. 439-446.  aWith the gradual increase of global warming, the impact of extreme temperatures on health has become a focus of attention, however, its relationship with preterm birth remains unclear.To investigate the association between exposure to extreme temperatures and preterm birth.Temperature exposures and birth outcomes of 1,020,471 pregnant women from 132 cities in China were investigated. The pregnancy process was divided into different pregnancy periods. Study areas were divided into three categories (cold, medium, and hot areas) according to the local average temperature by cluster analysis. Average temperature data for each province used in the cluster analysis came from the China Statistical Yearbook 2013. Logistic regression was used to compare the effects of exposure to hot and cold conditions on the outcomes of pregnancy in different periods and regions.A total of 1,020,471 singleton births were included, of which 73,240(7.2%) were preterm births. Compared with moderate temperatures (5th to 95th percentile), heat exposure (>95th percentile) in different periods of pregnancy increased the risk of preterm birth in hot areas. The most obvious increase was during the 3 months before pregnancy (odds ratio (OR)=1.229, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.166–1.295). In contrast to heat exposure, cold exposure (<5th percentile) in hot areas reduced the risk of preterm birth; the protective effect was most pronounced in the 3 months before pregnancy (OR=0.784, 95% CI: 0.734–0.832). In medium and cold areas cold exposure also reduced the risk of preterm birth. The effect of exposure to extreme ambient temperatures throughout the entire pregnancy on preterm birth was similar to those of the periods above.Acute and chronic exposure to extreme temperatures may affect the risk of preterm birth. Extreme heat is a risk factor for preterm birth and extreme cold is a protective factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3achronic exposure 3acities 3acluster analysis 3acold stress 3aconfidence interval 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3apremature birth 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aTemperature 0aPreterm birth 0aHumidity 0aWeather1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aZhang, Hongguang1 aZhang, Ya1 aZhao, Jun1 aWang, Yan1 aXie, Xiaoxu1 aWang, Long1 aZhang, Qian1 aLiu, Dujia1 aHe, Yuan1 aYang, Ying1 aXu, Jihong1 aPeng, Zuoqi1 aMa, Xu0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 613-614 p.439-446dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245010100199300002000300520112200320592002801442650002201470650002001492650001401512650002101526650001301547650001201560650004401572650002201616650002201638650001301660700006001673700006001733700006401793700006101857773014901918856007602067852000902143655001202152IND60677426320200904000000.0191127e20191106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067742632DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b103042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0816-649710aSi–H Bond Activation with Bullock’s Cationic Tungsten(II) Catalyst: CO as Cooperating Ligand  ap. 18845-18850.  aAn in-depth investigation of the reaction of tertiary hydrosilanes with [CpW(CO)₂(IMes)]⁺[B(C₆F₅)₄]⁻ reveals a fundamentally new Si–H bond activation mode. Unlike the originally proposed oxidative addition of the Si–H bond to the tungsten(II) center, there is strong experimental and NMR spectroscopic evidence for the involvement of one of the CO ligands of the cationic complex in the Si–H bond breaking event. The Si–H bond is heterolytically cleaved to form a tungsten(II) hydride and a silylium ion, which is stabilized by one of the CO ligands. This reactive hydrosilane adduct was eventually isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Quantum-chemical calculations support a cooperative mechanism, but a stepwise process consisting of oxidative addition and subsequent tungsten-to-oxygen silyl migration in the tungsten(IV) silyl hydride is also energetically feasible. However, our combined spectroscopic and computational analysis favors the cooperative pathway. The newly identified hydrosilane adduct is the key intermediate of Bullock’s ionic carbonyl hydrosilylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3ahydrides 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantum mechanics 3aspectral analysis 3atungsten1 aIrran, Elisabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6098-19961 aHrobárik, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6444-85551 aKlare, Hendrik F.

We evaluate the infestation susceptibility of persimmons at different ripening stages (unripe, UN; early ripe, ER; orange ripe, OR, and overripe, OV) by D. suzukii and Z. indianus in the field and laboratory conditions. Additionally, we determined the influence of physicochemical characteristics (e.g., resistance to penetration force, fruit skin color, acidity (pH),TSS concentration, total titratable acidity [TTA]) and the type of damage that facilitates infestation by D. suzukii or Z. indianus. In the field, the natural infestation capacity and biological development of D. suzukii and Z. indianus were verified in whole fruits at the ripening stages ER, OR, and OV. The natural infestation was directly related to the physicochemical characteristics of the fruits (resistance to penetration force, pH, and total soluble solids). In the no-choice bioassay, the oviposition rate of D. suzukii did not differ between the ripening stages of the fruit. However, in the choice bioassay, there was a higher preference for oviposition in OV fruits. Regarding Z. indianus, the highest preference for oviposition was observed in OR and OV fruits in both bioassays. The presence of mechanical damage did not increase the susceptibility of the fruits to D. suzukii. However, it favored the oviposition of Z. indianus in OR and OV fruits.The damage caused by D. suzukii or mechanical damage favored the infestation by Z. indianus.This is the first report of the capacity of D. suzukii to infest whole persimmons in Brazil.

We used a vascular plant database constructed previously. The gradient was divided into 18 200-m elevation belts. To examine elevational patterns of richness, we used both observed and estimated (interpolated) species richness, as well as genus and family observed richness, for each belt. A generalised linear model (GLM) was used to assess the effect of altitude on area-corrected species richness (standard areaÂ =Â 100Â km2), and a numerical classification of the elevational belts based on species richness was performed. Overall, richness at the three taxonomic levels decreased with elevation, but some individual families departed from this pattern. A sharp drop in species richness was observed at 1,800Â m, and the dendrogram separated two elevational floristic groups at this elevation. The GLM revealed a significant negative effect of elevation on species richness. Despite this overall decreasing pattern for vascular plants along this extensive gradient, an examination of some family-specific patterns revealed the existence of other elevationâdiversity relationships, indicating taxon-specific responses to elevation. The most noticeable discontinuity in species richness, at ca. 1,800Â m, is likely related to a critical temperature isocline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3adatabases 3aflora 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3avascular plants 3aMexico1 aMeave, Jorge A.0 tPlant ecology.g2012 Aug., v. 213, no. 8 p.1209-1220dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-012-0077-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016100171506011700332506007600449520160900525592002802134506003702162650002102199650001602220650001002236650001802246650001402264650001002278650001302288653003402301653002202335653003102357700005702388700002002445700001902465700001802484700001602502773009302518856008602611852000902697655001202706IND60763166520221207080121.0220523e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076316652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e087412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsushita, Shu10aClinical and magnetic resonance imaging feature differences between solitary and multiple type Langerhans cell histiocytosis involving the craniofacial bone  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo investigate the clinical and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of craniofacial bone Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and discuss the differences between a solitary lesion group (SLG) and multiple lesions group (MLG). This study included 22 consecutive patients with pathologically proven LCH who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI. The clinical data and MRI features were retrospectively assessed. The mean patient age was 5 years, and 15 patients were male. The frontal bone was the most frequently affected bone. Ten and 12 patients were classified into the SLG and the MLG, respectively. The following MRI features were observed in >50% cases: T1WI hyperintensity in 15 (68%) cases, T2WI hyperintensity in 16 (73%) cases, bulging sign in 18 (82%) cases, concentric or eccentric soft tissue mass formation in 13 (59%) cases, soft tissue edema in 16 (73%) cases, any grade of bone marrow edema in 16 (73%) cases, surrounding bone enhancement in 17 (77%) cases, and surrounding soft tissue enhancement in 16 (73%) cases. Patient age was significantly higher in the SLG than that in the MLG (P = 0.0014). Perilesional bone marrow edema and enhancement were significantly more prominent in the SLG than in the MLG (P = 0.032, P = 0.040). Contrast-enhanced MRI showed additional significant findings of mainly the surrounding details. Older age, extensive bone marrow edema, and enhancement may indicate solitary-type LCH rather than multiple-type LCH. These differences may help distinguish between solitary- and multiple-type LCH, which have different treatment strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLangerhans cells 3abone marrow 3aedema 3ahistiocytosis 3amagnetism 3amales 3apatients 0aLangerhans cell histiocytosis 0aCraniofacial bone 0aMagnetic resonance imaging1 aShimono, Taro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5847-65871 aOkuma, Tomohisa1 aInoue, Takeshi1 aManabe, Takao1 aMiki, Yukio0 tHeliyon.g2022 Jan., v. 8, no. 1 p.e08741-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e087413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008900167300001400256520123100270592002801501650001901529650001601548650001601564650002701580650001501607650001101622650001701633650001301650650000901663651001601672700002001688700002501708773009101733856008401824852000901908655001201917IND60097547120221119013834.0141104e20121012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009754712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jaehong10aInstability of partially saturated soil slopes due to alteration of rainfall pattern  ap. 28-36.  aThe influence of climate change on rainfall patterns has the potential to alter stability of partially saturated soil slopes. Changes in rainfall patterns have a strong influence on stability of partially saturated soil slopes, which recently have resulted in shallow landslides. In this paper, slope stability is assessed using a monolithically-coupled finite element model for a deformable partially saturated soil subjected to surface infiltration of water. Numerical analysis solves for the matric suction distribution over a two-dimensional cross-section of a soil slope while varying permeability, and considering a surface layer of soil with different permeability. The formulation of hydraulic conductivity for a coupled analysis includes dependence on porosity and degree of saturation to illustrate the effects of water infiltration and deformation behavior in partially saturated soils. Numerical examples demonstrate that change in rainfall patterns may trigger slope instability earlier in the rainfall event than for rainfall events of the past. Assessment of these simulations can provide an indication of the potential influence of climate change on shallow landslides in many mountainous areas in South Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adeformation 3aengineering 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alandslides 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporosity 3arain 3aSouth Korea1 aJeong, Sangseom1 aRegueiro, Richard A.0 tEngineering geology.g2012 Oct. 12, v. 147-148 p.28-36dElsevier B.V.x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245008900210506011700299506007600416520097600492592002801468506003701496650002201533650002201555650001801577650002601595653001401621653001201635653001901647653002501666653001901691653001601710700006301726700006401789773009301853856008601946852000902032655001202041IND60763166720221207080027.0220523e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076316672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e087432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Md.

Highest band gap of 3.67 eV was found for 2 mol % AZO thin films. The average transmittance was found to be 84.19% in the visible spectra for the corresponding thin films. 2 mol% AZO also exhibited a minimum resistivity of 2.05 Ω-cm with a maximum value of figure of merit. Prolonged UV irradiation was applied to 2 mol % AZO thin films prior to annealing. It significantly modified the surface morphology of the film and provided shielding near UVA (315–378 nm) spectrum.

ERMR7:07  ap. 27-36.  aMucilaginibacter sp. is known as an exopolysaccharide (EPS) producer. In this study, a potentially novel species of genus Mucilaginibacter was used to extract EPS. Statistical optimisation by Response surface methodology produced 26.4 mg/mL EPS at 20℃, pH 7.4 using 47 mg carbon source/mL. The molecular weight of the extracted EPS was 3045.09 Da as determined by MADI-TOF/TOF-MS. Structural characterisation by monosaccharide composition, methylation, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that the EPS was a linear polysaccharide with the sugar backbone of α-D-Glcⁱᵛ(1→4)α-D-Glcⁱⁱⁱ(1→3)β-D-Glcⁱⁱ(1→6)α-D-Glcⁱ. The extracted EPS provided 97.91 % viability to mesophilic Escherichia coli under freezing conditions (-80℃) for up to 7 days. Additionally, extracted EPS showed metal ion biosorption ability for Cu²⁺ (8.36 mg/g), Fe²⁺ (4.47 mg/g), Mn²⁺ (0.12 mg/g), and Zn²⁺ (0.103 mg/g). Owing to these properties, the extracted EPS can be explored for its application as a cryoprotective agent and as a medium to remove toxic metal ions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the extraction and characterisation of EPS from the genus Mucilaginibacter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aMucilaginibacter 3abacteria 3abiosorption 3acarbon 3acryoprotectants 3aexopolysaccharides 3aglaciers 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3asugars 3atoxicity 3aviability 0aEast Rathong Glacier 0aPsychrotrophic bacteria 0aMetal ion biosorption 0aCryoprotective activity1 aMukhia, Srijana1 aKumar, Rakshak0 tProcess biochemistry.g2022 Feb., v. 113 p.27-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2021.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245012500208300001200333506007600345520153700421592002801958596008101986596008302067596006802150596009302218506003702311650001802348650001802366650000902384650001502393650001202408650002202420650002102442650000902463650001802472650001102490650001902501650001302520650002002533650001902553650002002572650001402592700001502606700001602621700001502637700001802652700001802670700001802688700001902706700001402725773010502739856008202844852000902926655001202935IND60674633520221207081224.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067463352DNAL7 a316512522pmid7 aPMC68140482pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-2023-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongying10aGenome-wide characterization of NtHD-ZIP IV: different roles in abiotic stress response and glandular Trichome induction  ap. 444.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The plant-specific homeodomain-leucine zipper class IV (HD-ZIP IV) gene family has been involved in the regulation of epidermal development. RESULTS: Fifteen genes coding for HD-ZIP IV proteins were identified (NtHD-ZIP-IV-1 to NtHD-ZIP-IV-15) based on the genome of N. tabacum. Four major domains (HD, ZIP, SAD and START) were present in these proteins. Tissue expression pattern analysis indicated that NtHD-ZIP-IV-1, − 2, − 3, − 10, and − 12 may be associated with trichome development; NtHD-ZIP-IV-8 was expressed only in cotyledons; NtHD-ZIP-IV-9 only in the leaf and stem epidermis; NtHD-ZIP-IV-11 only in leaves; and NtHD-ZIP-IV-15 only in the root and stem epidermis. We found that jasmonates may induce the generation of glandular trichomes, and that NtHD-ZIP-IV-1, − 2, − 5, and − 7 were response to MeJA treatment. Dynamic expression under abiotic stress and after application of phytohormones indicated that most NtHD-ZIP IV genes were induced by heat, cold, salt and drought. Furthermore, most of these genes were induced by gibberellic acid, 6-benzylaminopurine, and salicylic acid, but were inhibited by abscisic acid. NtHD-ZIP IV genes were sensitive to heat, but insensitive to osmotic stress. CONCLUSION: NtHD-ZIP IV genes are implicated in a complex regulatory gene network controlling epidermal development and abiotic stress responses. The present study provides evidence to elucidate the gene functions of NtHD-ZIP IVs during epidermal development and stress response.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 110201401003 (JY-03)cthe State Tobacco Monopoly Administration of China  aNo. ZW2014004cthe Technology Center, China Tobacco Henan Industrial Co., Ltd.  a182300410094cthe National Science Foundation of Henan province  a19A210003cthe Key Research Project of Institution of Higher Education of Henan Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabscisic acid 3abenzyladenine 3acold 3acotyledons 3adrought 3aepidermis (plant) 3agibberellic acid 3aheat 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3aosmotic stress 3aproteins 3aregulator genes 3asalicylic acid 3astress response 3atrichomes1 aMa, Xudong1 aLi, Wenjiao1 aNiu, Dexin1 aWang, Zhaojun1 aYan, Xiaoxiao1 aYang, Xinling1 aYang, Yongfeng1 aCui, Hong0 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.444-444dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-2023-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01864naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245006600157300002000223520083200243592002801075650001501103650001201118650002401130650001101154650002501165650001601190650000901206650001301215650001501228650002301243650001101266700001701277773012501294856007401419852000901493655001201502IND60642101020221118173015.0190506e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064210102DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07551k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu-xi10aNonlinear optical properties of metal nanoparticles: a review  ap. 45129-45144.  aMetal nanoparticles (MNPs) hold great technological promise because of the possibility of engineering their electronic and optical properties through material design.

Also, the discharge coefficient of broad-crested side weirs, whether slightly inclined towards the stream or lateral, still has yet to be clearly determined. Experimental research was carried out to describe the flow characteristics at low Froude numbers in the approach flow channel for various combinations of in- and overflow discharges. Three side weir types with different oblique angles were studied. Their flow characteristics and discharge coefficients were analyzed and assessed based on the results obtained from extensive measurements performed on a hydraulic model. The empirical relation between the angle of side weir obliqueness, Froude numbers in the up- and downstream channels, and the coefficient of obliqueness was derived.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3astreams 3aweirs 0aBroad-crested side weir 0aExperimental research 0aFlow characteristics 0aHydraulics1 aZachoval, Zbyněk0 tJournal of hydrology and hydromechanics.g2015 Apr. 7, v. 63, no. 2 p.164-171dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:21369x1338-43337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/johh-2015-00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245011100209300001200320506007600332520157200408592002801980596005902008506003702067650001102104650001802115650001702133650002802150650002302178650002302201650002802224650001202252650002002264650003102284650001002315650001602325650001502341650003302356650001102389650001702400650001902417650001402436650002202450650002402472650002902496700001702525700002802542700002002570700002002590700001302610773010502623856008202728852000902810655001202819IND60674633620221207081218.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067463362DNAL7 a316512402pmid7 aPMC68141102pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-2054-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Anam Qadir10aEriodictyol can modulate cellular auxin gradients to efficiently promote in vitro cotton fibre development  ap. 443.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Flavonoids have essential roles in flower pigmentation, fibre development and disease resistance in cotton. Previous studies show that accumulation of naringenin in developing cotton fibres significantly affects fibre growth. This study focused on determining the effects of the flavonoids naringenin, dihydrokaempferol, dihydroquerectin and eriodictyol on fibre development in an in vitro system. RESULTS: 20 μM eriodictyol treatment produced a maximum fibre growth, in terms of fibre length and total fibre units. To gain insight into the associated transcriptional regulatory networks, RNA-seq analysis was performed on eriodictyol-treated elongated fibres, and computational analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that carbohydrate metabolism and phytohormone signaling pathways were differentially modulated. Eriodictyol treatment also promoted the biosynthesis of quercetin and dihydroquerectin in ovules and elongating fibres through enhanced expression of genes encoding chalcone isomerase, chalcone synthase and flavanone 3-hydroxylase. In addition, auxin biosynthesis and signaling pathway genes were differentially expressed in eriodictyol-driven in vitro fibre elongation. In absence of auxin, eriodictyol predominantly enhanced fibre growth when the localized auxin gradient was disrupted by the auxin transport inhibitor, triiodobenzoic acid. CONCLUSION: Eriodictyol was found to significantly enhance fibre development through accumulating and maintaining the temporal auxin gradient in developing unicellular cotton fibres.  aPublisher supplied data  a31471540cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aauxins 3abenzoic acids 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3achalcone isomerase 3adisease resistance 3aflavanone 3-dioxygenase 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alint cotton 3anaringenin 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aovules 3apigmentation 3aplant hormones 3aquercetin 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLi, Zhonghua1 aAhmed, Muhammad Mahmood1 aWang, Pengcheng1 aZhang, Xianlong1 aTu, Lili0 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.443-443dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-2054-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245010900164300001800273520100700291592002801298650001701326650002001343650001901363650001001382650001801392650001901410650001101429650001801440650001801458650001301476653001801489653003201507653001001539653001801549700001701567700001701584773015601601856008001757852000901837655001201846IND60522798820221118163248.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052279882DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1989-11-12242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, R. A.10aSpecies and Genus Specificity of the Intergenic Spacer (IGS) in the Ribosomal RNA Genes of Cucurbitaceae  ap. 1029-1034.  aThe use of intergenic spacer (IGS) fragments of plant ribosomal DNA (rDNA) for the differ­ entiation between genera and species is tested by cross-hybridization experiments with different IGS probes of two Cucurbitaceae, Cucurbita pepo (zucchini) and Cucumis sativus (cucum ber). Hybridization with cloned fragments of different parts of the IGS of ribosomal DNA exhibit a different degree of conservation within and between the Cucurbitaceae genera. In general, Cucur­ bita species seem to be closer related to each other than the Cucumis species. A repetitive element of the external transcribed spacer (ETS) shows a more genus-specific pattern, reacting only with the respective genera; the region preceding the ETS is conserved between the Cucurbita species but also cross-hybridizes weakly with the Cucumis species. AGC-rich element of the Cucumis sativus IGS (“Cfo-cluster”) is present in small amounts in Cucumis melo (melon) and even less represented in other genera of the Cucurbitaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3aCucumis sativus 3aCucurbita pepo 3agenes 3ahybridization 3aintergenic DNA 3amelons 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3azucchini 0aCucurbitaceae 0aEvolution Intergenic Spacer 0aPlant 0aRibosomal DNA1 aZentgraf, U.1 aHemleben, V.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 44, no. 11-12 p.1029-1034dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1989-11-12243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245011400199300001600313500002000329520128200349592002801631596004701659596003001706596004401736650001601780650001301796650002601809650002401835650002001859650002001879650002201899650001801921650001301939650002601952650001501978650001701993650001402010650001402024650001302038650002102051650001202072651001102084700003202095700006102127700002402188700006302212700002202275700002602297773013502323856007302458852000902531655001202540IND60663198520221119220710.0190909e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066319852DNAL7 a10.1111/jeu.127242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Laura M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0837-722714aThe Response of Litter‐Associated Myxomycetes to Long‐Term Nutrient Addition in a Lowland Tropical Forest  ap. 757-770.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMyxomycetes (plasmodial slime molds) are abundant protist predators that feed on bacteria and other microorganisms, thereby playing important roles in terrestrial nutrient cycling. Despite their significance, little is known about myxomycete communities and the extent to which they are affected by nutrient availability. We studied the influence of long‐term addition of N, P, and K on the myxomycete community in a lowland forest in the Republic of Panama. In a previous study, microbial biomass increased with P but not N or K addition at this site. We hypothesized that myxomycetes would increase in abundance in response to P but that they would not respond to the sole addition of N or K. Moist chamber cultures of leaf litter and small woody debris were used to quantify myxomycete abundance. We generated the largest myxomycete dataset (3,381 records) for any single locality in the tropics comprised by 91 morphospecies. In line with our hypothesis, myxomycete abundance increased in response to P addition but did not respond to N or K. Community composition was unaffected by nutrient treatments. This work represents one of very few large‐scale and long‐term field studies to include a heterotrophic protist highlighting the feasibility and value in doing so.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1406667cNational Science Foundation  a429440cSimons Foundation  cSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute 3aMyxogastrea 3abacteria 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3alowland forests 3amicrobial biomass 3amorphospecies 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3aplant litter 3apotassium 3apredators 3aprotists 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aPanama1 aCedeño‐Sanchez, Marjorie1 aCarbonero, Franck1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3389-37251 aHerre, Edward Allen1 aTurner, Benjamin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6585-07221 aWright, S.

This study examined how multi-temporal airborne LiDAR data could estimate AGB changes in Borneo's tropical montane forest. Using airborne LiDAR data acquired in 2012 and 2017, we compared direct and indirect approaches to estimating the AGB changes. The direct method predicts the AGB change directly based on differences in LiDAR variables between the two time points whereas, the indirect method first constructs a model for predicting the AGB for each time point and then estimates the changes. The direct approach produced a model with an adjusted R² of 0.321 and a relatively high RMSE (6.37 Mg/ha/year; relative RMSE: 134.36%). On the other hand, annual AGB changes derived from the indirect approach had a low RMSE value (1.413 Mg/ha/year; relative RMSE: 29.80%) and were strongly correlated with the field AGB changes (R² = 0.988). We estimated the AGB changes using the indirect approach to be −7.49 Mg/ha/year for AGB loss and 8.91 Mg/ha/year for AGB gain. We identified land use conversion as the primary driver of AGB changes in the montane forest since the rate of AGB decrease in state-land was higher than in the managed forest. The LiDAR-based approach provides high-resolution estimates of AGB changes by enlarging field plots to more extensive area coverage, facilitating the adoption of incentive-based carbon conservation mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3aland use change 3alidar 3amodels 3amontane forests 0aCarbon stock changes 0aAirborne laser scanning 0aREDD 0aSabah1 aJames, Daniel1 aIoki, Keiko1 aWong, Wilson Vun Chiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7285-39081 aTsuyuki, Satoshi1 aPhua, Mui How,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-31050 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Nov., v. 28 p.100821-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1008213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01188naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010600163300001300269500001500282520016500297592002800462650001700490650001100507653003700518653006000555653001000615700001600625773015600641856008000797852000900877655001200886IND60522798920221118163309.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052279892DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1989-11-12252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTohá, J.

Because of their limited tissue penetration, the clinical use of NIR light-driven treatments is not widespread; this technology is inapplicable to infection sites in the deeper areas of internal tissues. In this study, we demonstrate a self-illuminative therapeutic cassette able to exert anticancer effects via a series of enzymatic, chemical, and optical cooperative cascade reactions. It consists of (1) NIR-illuminative nanocomplexes and (2) NIR-sensitive therapeutic cassettes, which demonstrate a 60% chemically-induced killing effect in a prostate cancer model without external NIR irradiation. This technology can also be actively exploited as an imaging agent due to adaptation of a self-illuminating nanocomplex. Consequently, these novel therapeutic cassettes, which work not only as a powerful internal NIR stimulant, but also as a biological imaging platform, provide a new rational design concept for biomedical use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3acolloids 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3amodels 3aprostatic neoplasms 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atissues 3awavelengths 0aCancer therapy 0aSelf-illuminative thermal cascade reaction 0aNanocomplex1 aShin, Seung Won1 aPark, Kyung Soo1 aJang, Min Su1 aChoi, Jin-Ha1 aOh, Byung-Keun1 aUm, Soong Ho0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 126 p.580-584dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245012800168300002000296520182000316592002802136650002102164650001002185650002502195650001402220650002202234650001102256650001202267650001202279650001402291650004302305650002502348650001502373650002302388650001202411773014702423856008302570852000902653655001202662IND4470559820221120204802.0120419e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447055982DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.110.0010652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadders-Algra, Mijna10aPrenatal and early postnatal supplementation with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids: neurodevelopmental considerations  ap. 1874S-1879S.  aIt takes >20 y before the human brain obtains its complex adult configuration. Most dramatic neurodevelopmental changes occur prenatally and early postnatally, including a major transformation in cortical organization 3–4 mo after term. The long-lasting changes have practical implications for studies evaluating the effect of prenatal and early postnatal supplementation with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs). Whether studies of the effect of supplementation will reveal an effect not only depends on the dosage and duration of supplementation but also on 1) the timing of supplementation, 2) the age at which the outcome is assessed, 3) the application of age-specific sensitive neurodevelopmental tools, and 4) the functional domain evaluated. Studies of the effects of prenatal supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or fish oil have provided inconsistent results. However, maternal and neonatal concentrations of DHA and arachidonic acid are associated with improved outcomes in early infancy, and concentrations of DHA are associated with favorable neurodevelopmental outcome beyond early infancy. Studies of LC-PUFA supplementation in preterm infants have not shown evidence of a positive effect on neurodevelopmental outcome. Similar studies in full-term infants have indicated that supplementation with 0.30% DHA (by wt) promotes neurodevelopmental outcome in early infancy, but positive effects on later outcome have not been shown. However, information on the effects on outcomes at school age or later is virtually absent. This article stresses the need for long-term longitudinal studies that apply age-specific, sensitive neurodevelopmental tools, which also take into account lifestyle habits, maternal prepregnancy nutritional status, and genetic variation in metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarachidonic acid 3abrain 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afish oils 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3ainfancy 3ainfants 3alifestyle 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3alongitudinal studies 3ametabolism 3anutritional status 3aschools0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2011 Dec., v. 94, no. 6_Suppl p.1874S-1879SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.110.0010653Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014400154300002000298520103800318592002801356650001601384650001101400650002301411650001201434650004401446650002401490650002101514650002201535700001701557700001701574700002001591700001301611700001901624700001701643773012501660856007401785852000901859655001201868IND60642101420221118173014.0190506e20170905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064210142DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07565k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Hui10aSynthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of rare-earth metal amides incorporating cyclohexyl bridged bis(β-diketiminato) ligands  ap. 42792-42799.  aA series of organo rare-earth metal amides incorporating chiral cyclohexyl bridged bis(β-diketiminato) ligands with general formula LREN(SiMe₃)₂ (L¹ = (1S,2S)-1,2-Cy[NC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr]₂, Ar = 2, 6-Et₂C₆H₃, RE = Nd (1a), Dy (1b), Yb (1c), Y (1d); L² = (1R,2R)-1,2-Cy[NC(Me)CHC(Me)NAr]₂, Ar = 2, 6-i-Pr₂C₆H₃, RE = Nd (2a), Gd (2b), Dy (2c), Er (2d), Y (2e)) were synthesized in good yields via reactions of [(Me₃Si)₂N]₃REᴵᴵᴵ(μ-Cl)Li(THF)₃ with H₂L¹ and H₂L².

In this work, to increase heterologous polyketide 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB, erythromycin precursor) production, tripartite multidrug efflux pumps MacAB-TolC, AcrAB-TolC, MdtEF-TolC, and MexAB-OprM were modulated in a 6dEB production strain. Compared with the control, overexpression of a single component of efflux pumps (except oprM) repressed 6dEB production, but modulation of two components MacA and MacB or the complete pumps MacAB-TolC and MdtEF-TolC significantly improved 6dEB titer by 100 ± 11, 118 ± 54, and 98 ± 12 %, respectively. In addition, to avoid the challenging fine-tuning components of pumps, the transcriptional regulators of efflux pumps were modulated to improve the 6dEB production.

The method exploits the mean-shift clustering algorithm that takes as input a preliminary hyperspectral superpixels segmentation together with the spectral pixel information. The proposed method does not require the number of segmentation classes as input parameter, and it does not exploit any a-priori knowledge about the type of land-cover or land-use to be segmented (e.g. water, vegetation, building etc.). Experiments on Salinas, SalinasA, Pavia Center and Pavia University datasets are carried out. Performance are measured in terms of normalized mutual information, adjusted Rand index and F1-score.

A very simple novel bioreactor, the micro-pressure swirl reactor (MPSR), can improve the dissolution and distribution of oxygen by the introduced micro-pressure swirl. Comparison with a conventional sequencing batch reactor (SBR) over 76 days of operation showed that this method can enhance simultaneous COD and nitrogen removal. By installing an aeration diffuser on one side of the two-dimensional MPSR, a swirl formed in the bioreactor that extended the retention time of the air bubbles. This unique flow regime, combined with the micro-pressure caused by the elevated water surface at the bubble outflow point, resulted in a higher level of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the MPSR. Aerobic and anaerobic zones that created appropriate conditions for simultaneous COD and nitrogen removal also formed in the MPSR. As the organic loading rate increased from 0.29 to 1.68 g COD/(L · day) over the test period, the COD removal efficiencies of the MPSR were generally 10–20 % greater than those of the SBR. In particular, the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies of the MPSR and SBR were 40–50 and 20–35 %, respectively, whereas the TN concentrations in the MPSR effluent were always around 10 mg/L lower than those of the SBR. Further, because of the unique DO distribution, the bacterial species in the MPSR were more diverse and contributed to enhanced TN removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3abioreactors 3abubbles 3achemical oxygen demand 3adissolved oxygen 3aeconomic costs 3aenvironmental law 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3asurface water 3awastewater1 aZhou, Dandan1 aHuo, Mingxin1 aRen, Qingkai1 aTian, Xi1 aWan, Liguo1 aZhu, Suiyi1 aAi, Shengshu0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 20 p.8741-8749dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6714-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245008500170300001600255520085300271592002801124650001501152650001001167650001701177650002101194650001201215650001101227650001201238650002101250653003201271653003001303653001701333653001701350653002101367700002101388700001601409700002201425773011001447856008201557852000901639655001201648IND60606678120221117235509.0180727e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060667812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2015.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomassetti, Mauro12aA survey on innovative dating methods in archaeometry with focus on fossil bones  ap. 371-379.  aRecently proposed innovative methods for dating archaeological finds reported in the literature are reviewed, together with the researches carried out in this field by our team, using several instrumental techniques (sensor, biosensor, electrochemical, thermal-analytical, and so on).

This study reports a facile electrospray-based method to generate compositionally homogeneous core–shell hydrogel microspheres. By manipulating different process parameters (e.g., electric field strength, flow rate, and gel-forming polymer concentration), the size of the microspheres can be tuned from microns to millimetres. Drug release studies demonstrate that coating the surface of the hydrogel microsphere with a hydrogel layer remarkably prolongs the drug release sustainability. In 3T3 and HEK293 cells, both the acute and delayed toxicity caused by the hydrogel microspheres are shown to be negligible. Together with the ease of operation of the production method, the compositionally homogeneous core–shell microspheres generated by our method may enhance the versatility and flexibility in future drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adrugs 3aelectric field 3ahydrogels 3amicroparticles 3apolymers 3atoxicity1 aSusha, Andrei S.1 aRogach, Andrey L.1 aWang, Guoan1 aHuang, Minjian1 aHu Weijie,1 aWong, Wing-Tak0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 7, no. 70 p.44482-44491dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07568e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011700167300001800284520179200302592002802094650002302122650002802145650001502173650002602188650002402214650001402238650001702252650001502269650001102284650002202295650001202317650001002329650001602339650002402355650001102379650002402390650001302414650001502427650002802442650002002470700002202490700001602512700002302528700002002551773012702571856008102698852000902779655001202788IND60438673120221122210454.0151023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043867312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6731-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, Josué10aImpact of the antifungal protein PgAFP from Penicillium chrysogenum on the protein profile in Aspergillus flavus  ap. 8701-8715.  aAntifungal proteins produced by molds are generally small, highly basic, and cysteine-rich. The best known effects of these proteins include morphological changes, metabolic inactivation, and membrane perturbation on sensitive fungi. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation leads to apoptosis, with G -protein playing a key role in transduction of cell death signals. The antifungal protein PgAFP from Penicillium chrysogenum inhibits growth of some toxigenic molds. Here we analyzed the effect of the antifungal protein PgAFP on the growth of Aspergillus flavus. For this, comparative proteomic analysis was used to identify the whole protein profile and protein change in abundance after PgAFP treatment. PgAFP provoked metabolic changes related to reduced energy metabolism, cell wall integrity alteration, and increased stress response due to higher levels of ROS. The observed changes in protein abundance, favoring a higher glutathione concentration as well as the increased abundance in heat shock proteins, do not seem to be enough to avoid necrosis. The decreased chitin deposition observed in PgAFP-treated A. flavus is attributed to a lower relative quantity of Rho1. The reduced relative abundance of a β subunit of G -protein seems to be the underlying reason for modulation of apoptosis in PgAFP-treated A. flavus hyphae. We propose Rho1 and G -protein subunit β CpcB to be the main factors in the mode of action of PgAFP in A. flavus. Additionally, enzymes essential for the biosynthesis of aflatoxin were no longer detectable in A. flavus hyphae at 24 h, following treatment with PgAFP. This presents a promising effect of PgAFP, which may prevent A. flavus from producing mycotoxins. However, the impact of PgAFP on actual aflatoxin production requires further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aaflatoxins 3aantifungal properties 3aantifungal proteins 3aapoptosis 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3achitin 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzymes 3afungi 3aglutathione 3aheat shock proteins 3ahyphae 3amechanism of action 3anecrosis 3aproteomics 3areactive oxygen species 3astress response1 aOwens, Rebecca A.1 aDoyle, Sean1 aAsensio, Miguel A.1 aNúñez, Félix0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 20 p.8701-8715dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6731-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014900163300001800312520160700330592002801937650001701965650001201982650001801994650001702012650001602029650001902045650002402064650002802088650002602116650001902142650001502161650000902176650001402185650003102199650001902230650001402249650001802263650001502281650001302296651001002309700001402319700001502333700001602348700001502364700001902379773012702398856008102525852000902606655001202615IND60438673220221122171520.0151023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043867322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6748-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Weimin10aProfiling microbial community structures across six large oilfields in China and the potential role of dominant microorganisms in bioremediation  ap. 8751-8764.  aSuccessful bioremediation of oil pollution is based on a comprehensive understanding of the in situ physicochemical conditions and indigenous microbial communities as well as the interaction between microorganisms and geochemical variables. Nineteen oil-contaminated soil samples and five uncontaminated controls were taken from six major oilfields across different geoclimatic regions in China to investigate the spatial distribution of the microbial ecosystem. Microbial community analysis revealed remarkable variation in microbial diversity between oil-contaminated soils taken from different oilfields. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) further demonstrated that a suite of in situ geochemical parameters, including soil moisture and sulfate concentrations, were among the factors that influenced the overall microbial community structure and composition. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the vast majority of sequences were related to the genera Arthrobacter, Dietzia, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Marinobacter, many of which contain known oil-degrading or oil-emulsifying species. Remarkably, a number of archaeal genera including Halalkalicoccus, Natronomonas, Haloterrigena, and Natrinema were found in relatively high abundance in some of the oil-contaminated soil samples, indicating that these Euryarchaeota may play an important ecological role in some oil-contaminated soils. This study offers a direct and reliable reference of the diversity of the microbial community in various oil-contaminated soils and may influence strategies for in situ bioremediation of oil pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobacter 3aDietzia 3aEuryarchaeota 3aMarinobacter 3aPseudomonas 3abioremediation 3acommunity structure 3acorrespondence analysis 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3aoil fields 3aoils 3aphylogeny 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asulfates 3aChina1 aLi, Jiwei1 aJiang, Lei1 aSun, Zhilei1 aFu, Meiyan1 aPeng, Xiaotong0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 20 p.8751-8764dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6748-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016200159300001800321500002000339520158700359592002801946650002501974650001401999650001402013650001402027650002802041650002002069650001302089650002202102650002402124650002702148700002202175700001702197700001702214700001802231700001702249700002002266773011802286856007402404852000902478655001202487IND60588238520221120185519.0180103e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058823852DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.140912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGentle, Ian E.10aTIR‐domain‐containing adapter‐inducing interferon‐β (TRIF) forms filamentous structures, whose pro‐apoptotic signalling is terminated by autophagy  ap. 1987-2003.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe formation of amyloid‐like protein structures has recently emerged as a feature in signal transduction, particularly in innate immunity. These structures appear to depend on defined domains for their formation but likely also require dedicated ways to terminate signalling. We, here, define the innate immunity protein/Toll‐like receptor adaptor TIR‐domain‐containing adapter‐inducing interferon‐β (TRIF) as a novel platform of fibril formation and probe signal initiation through TRIF as well as its termination in Toll‐like receptor 3 (TLR3)‐stimulated melanoma cells. A main signalling pathway triggered by TLR3 caused apoptosis, which was controlled by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins and was dependent on RIPK1 and independent of TNF. Using correlative electron/fluorescence microscopy, we visualised fibrillar structures formed through both Toll/interleukin‐1 receptor and RIP homotypic interacting motif regions of TRIF. We provide evidence that these fibrillary structures are active signalling platforms whose activity is terminated by autophagy. TRIF‐signalling enhanced autophagy, and fibrillary structures were partly contained within autophagosomes. Inhibition of autophagy increased levels of pro‐apoptotic TRIF complexes, leading to the accumulation of active caspase‐8 and enhanced apoptosis while stimulation of autophagy reduced TRIF‐dependent death. We conclude that pro‐death signals through TRIF are regulated by autophagy and propose that pro‐apoptotic signalling through TRIF/RIPK1/caspase‐8 occurs in fibrillary platforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 3 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acaspase-8 3afluorescence microscopy 3ainterferon-beta 3amelanoma 3aprotein structure 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factors1 aMcHenry, Kevin T.1 aWeber, Arnim1 aMetz, Arlena1 aKretz, Oliver1 aPorter, Dale1 aHäcker, Georg,0 tFEBS journal.g2017 July, v. 284, no. 13 p.1987-2003dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.140913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04023naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002900188245020200217300001200419506007600431520191700507592002802424596009802452596007602550506003702626650002102663650002502684650002502709650001402734650002702748650001602775650001402791650001302805650001302818650001802831650001602849650001002865650001902875650001902894650001002913650003702923650001202960650001902972650001302991650001303004650002003017650002503037650001303062700001803075700001703093700002003110700005703130773013103187856008203318852000903400655001203409IND60674634220221207081913.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067463422DNAL7 a316532142pmid7 aPMC68149892pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2700-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsokan, Shibu Marthandam10aProtein hydrolysate from potato confers hepatic-protection in hamsters against high fat diet induced apoptosis and fibrosis by suppressing Caspase-3 and MMP2/9 and by enhancing Akt-survival pathway  ap. 283.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A potato protein hydrolysate, APPH is a potential anti-obesity diet ingredient. Since, obesity leads to deterioration of liver function and associated liver diseases, in this study the effect of APPH on high fat diet (HFD) associated liver damages was investigated. METHODS: Six week old male hamsters were randomly separated to six groups (n = 8) as control, HFD (HFD fed obese), L-APPH (HFD + 15 mg/kg/day of APPH), M-APPH (HFD + 30 mg/kg/day), H-APPH (HFD + 75 mg/kg/day of APPH) and PB (HFD + 500 mg/kg/day of probucol). HFD fed hamsters were administered with APPH 50 days through oral gavage. The animals were euthanized and the number of apoptotic nuclei in liver tissue was determined by TUNEL staining and the extent of interstitial fibrosis was determined by Masson’s trichrome staining. Modulation in the molecular events associated with apoptosis and fibrosis were elucidated from the western blotting analysis of the total protein extracts. RESULTS: Hamsters fed with high fat diet showed symptoms of liver damage as measured from serum markers like alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. However a 50 day long supplementation of APPH effectively ameliorated the effects of HFD. HFD also modulated the expression of survival and apoptosis proteins in the hamster liver. Further the HFD groups showed elevated levels of fibrosis markers in liver. The increase in fibrosis and apoptosis was correlated with the increase in the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (pERK1/2) revealing a potential role of ERK in the HFD mediated liver damage. However APPH treatment reduced the effect of HFD on the apoptosis and fibrosis markers considerably and provided hepato-protection. CONCLUSION: APPH can therefore be considered as an efficient therapeutic agent to ameliorate high fat diet related liver damages.  aPublisher supplied data  aGREEnS 004-3cTunghai University for Global Research and Education on Environment and Society  aMOST 104-2410-H-029-033-MY2cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aalanine transaminase 3aalternative medicine 3aapoptosis 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3afibrosis 3ahamsters 3ahigh fat diet 3aingredients 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aliver function 3amales 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aobesity 3apotato protein 3apotatoes 3aprobucol 3aprotein content 3aprotein hydrolysates 3astaining1 aHung, Tsu-Han1 aLi, Zong-Yan1 aChiang, Wen-Dee1 aLin, Wan-Teng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7700-33980 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.283-283dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2700-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013800167300001600305520135300321592002801674650001501702650001101717650002501728650001601753650002101769650001401790650001701804650001701821650004901838650002001887650002801907650002801935650002301963650001701986650001702003650002302020650001902043650002102062650001102083650001302094650002202107650002802129650002002157650001802177650001002195650001202205653001702217653002402234653000802258653000902266700002502275773011202300856008202412852000902494655001202503IND60544132620221123003013.0190415e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054413262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudhakar, Sekar10aStructural characterization of an Indian squid antioxidant peptide and its protective effect against cellular reactive oxygen species  ap. 502-512.  aAntioxidant peptides were derived from the edible part of Indian squid, Loligo duvauceli, via the use of gastrointestinal enzymes for up to 12 hours. The active α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate exhibited the maximum activity compared to the trypsin and pepsin hydrolysates, as assessed by various radical scavenging and metal chelating assays. Moreover, essential and non-essential amino acids were present in the active hydrolysate. Furthermore, the hydrolysate was purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). The purified peptide exhibited strong free radical scavenging, metal chelation and reducing power abilities that were confirmed with a UV-visible and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer. The peptide also prevented DNA damage and inhibited lipid peroxidation due to its small size (682.5 Da) and content of the high redox potential amino acid sequence Trp-Cys-Thr-Ser-Val-Ser, which was confirmed by ESI-MS/MS. This peptide exhibited no cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells (MCF7) and scavenged reactive oxygen species at the cellular level under H2O2-induced stress. These results suggest that the peptide derived from squid mantle protein acts as a potent antioxidant against oxidative stress and could be used as an efficient and safer adjunct in food processing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aLoligo 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abreast neoplasms 3achelation 3achymotrypsin 3acytotoxicity 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afood processing 3afree radical scavengers 3agastrointestinal system 3agel chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3aion exchange 3alipid peroxidation 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3apepsin 3apeptides 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3aredox potential 3aspectrometers 3asquid 3atrypsin 0aIndian squid 0aAntioxidant peptide 0aROS 0aFPLC1 aNazeer, Rasool Abdul0 tJournal of functional foods.g2015 Apr., v. 14 p.502-512dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2015.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008700164500001900251520154400270592002801814650001501842650001601857650003001873650001401903650001601917650003001933650001401963650001501977650001401992650001902006650001202025650001402037650002202051650001502073650002002088700002102108700002602129773012202155856007402277852000902351655001202360IND60729400220221122005751.0210228e20210223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072940022DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130207062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, Matthew  D.10aEvidence for the Contribution of Gut Microbiota to Age-Related Anabolic Resistance  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobally, people 65 years of age and older are the fastest growing segment of the population. Physiological manifestations of the aging process include undesirable changes in body composition, declines in cardiorespiratory fitness, and reductions in skeletal muscle size and function (i.e., sarcopenia) that are independently associated with mortality. Decrements in muscle protein synthetic responses to anabolic stimuli (i.e., anabolic resistance), such as protein feeding or physical activity, are highly characteristic of the aging skeletal muscle phenotype and play a fundamental role in the development of sarcopenia. A more definitive understanding of the mechanisms underlying this age-associated reduction in anabolic responsiveness will help to guide promyogenic and function promoting therapies. Recent studies have provided evidence in support of a bidirectional gut-muscle axis with implications for aging muscle health. This review will examine how age-related changes in gut microbiota composition may impact anabolic response to protein feeding through adverse changes in protein digestion and amino acid absorption, circulating amino acid availability, anabolic hormone production and responsiveness, and intramuscular anabolic signaling. We conclude by reviewing literature describing lifestyle habits suspected to contribute to age-related changes in the microbiome with the goal of identifying evidence-informed strategies to preserve microbial homeostasis, anabolic sensitivity, and skeletal muscle with advancing age.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aamino acids 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3adigestion 3ahomeostasis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alifestyle 3amicrobiome 3amortality 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3aphenotype 3aphysical activity 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle1 aCross, Brett  L.1 aGrosicki, Gregory  J.0 tNutrients.g2021 Feb. 23, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130207063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245005200181300001400233520114500247592002801392650000801420650002201428650001501450650001001465650002101475650003001496650001801526650001501544650001101559650001801570650001501588650001301603653003401616653001601650653001701666653002501683653001201708653000901720653001401729653001401743653001701757653001401774700003101788700003001819773010801849856008201957852000902039655001202048IND60606678420221117235429.0180727e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060667842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiculescu, Victor Constantin10aApplications of a DNA-electrochemical biosensor  ap. 23-36.  aAs carrier of genetic information, DNA is one of the most important intracellular targets that undergo modification and damage upon interaction with endogenous and exogenous factors.

In contrast to the well‐established regulatory mechanisms controlling IGF1 expression, molecular mechanisms regulating its secretion are not fully understood. The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor, and cumulative evidence shows that it is an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of diabetes, cancer and aging. Here we found that deficiency of AMPK promoted IGF1 secretion in mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we found that AMPKα1 but not AMPKα2 was involved in regulation of IGF1 secretion in mouse primary hepatocytes. Knockout of AMPK caused activation of the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R)–protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt) pathway in hepatocytes, which was mediated by hypersecretion of IGF1. Upstream of AMPK, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) was responsible for AMPK‐dependent suppression of IGF1 secretion in hepatocytes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the energy‐sensing LKB1–AMPK pathway regulates IGF1 secretion in mouse primary hepatocytes, which in turn regulates activation of the IGF1R–PKB pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3adiabetes 3aenergy 3ahepatocytes 3ahypersecretion 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aliver 3amice 3aneoplasms1 aChen, Qiaoli1 aRong, Ping1 aWang, Hong Yu1 aChen, Shuai0 tFEBS journal.g2017 July, v. 284, no. 13 p.2096-2109dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.141063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245007800175300001600253520097600269592002801245650002001273650001001293650001901303650001601322650001701338650001701355650002201372650002901394650001801423650001501441650001301456653000801469653000801477653001101485653000801496653001301504653000801517653000801525653000801533653000901541653000901550653000801559653000801567653000801575653000801583653001701591653003201608653002801640653001301668653001701681653002501698653002401723653002901747653002001776653000901796653001401805700001601819700002901835773011001864856008201974852000902056655001202065IND60606678620221117235427.0180727e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060667862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2015.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreudenberger, Kathrin10aRecent advances in therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressive drugs  ap. 257-268.  aThe transplantation of a solid organ is always followed by a lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to guarantee the survival of the organ in the recipient. Immunosuppressive drugs have to be applied in order to preserve the graft and at last the patient's life. These drugs are strongly recommended for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in order to adjust the adequate dose for each patient to avoid rejection or adverse effects of the therapy. This finely tuned therapy would not be possible without the proper analytical tools and techniques. Either chromatography methods or immunoassays based on e.g. fluorescence or colorimetric detection principles are used in practice.All of them have to cope with the challenging, individually differing matrix whole blood.

Reendothelialization is largely determined by surface properties of implants. In this study, surfaces modified with various chemical functional groups (CH3, NH2, COOH, OH) prepared by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were used as model system. Expressions and distributions of critical proteins in the integrin-induced signaling pathway were examined to explore the mechanisms of surface chemistry regulating EC migration. The results showed that SAMs modulated cell migration were in the order CH3>NH2>OH>COOH, determined by differences in the expressions of focal adhesion components and Rho GTPases. Multiple integrin subunits showed difference in a surface chemistry-dependent manner, which induced a stepwise activation of signaling cascades associated with EC migration. This work provides a broad overview of surface chemistry regulated endothelial cell migration and establishes association among the surface chemistry, cell migration behavior and associated integrin signaling events. Understanding the relationship between these factors will help us to understand the surface/interface behavior between biomaterials and cells, reveal molecular mechanism of cells sensing surface characterization, and guide surface modification of cardiovascular implanted materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiocompatible materials 3acell movement 3acolloids 3aendothelial cells 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aintegrins 3asignal transduction 0aSurface chemistry 0aCell adhesion/migration 0aFocal adhesion 0aFAK 0aRho GTPases1 aGao, Min1 aMa, Yunlong1 aYu, Hongchi1 aCui, Fu-Zhai,1 aGregersen, Hans1 aYu, Qingsong1 aWang, Guixue1 aLiu, Xiaoheng0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 126 p.188-197dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245006800133300001600201520106700217592002801284650002501312650002001337650002001357650002701377650001201404650001501416650002201431650001201453650002001465650001001485650001201495650001101507650001101518650001001529650001301539653002201552700001601574700002101590773015001611852000901761655001201770IND60706525220221117234604.0210117e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070652522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathwa, Sagar D.10aInformation Needs of Tribal Tomato Growers of Vadodara District  ap. 686-689.  aTomato is one of the most important protective foods because of its special nutritive value. It is one of the most versatile vegetable with wide usage in Indian culinary tradition. Tomatoes are used for soup, pickles, ketchup, puree, sauces and in many other ways. It is also used as a salad vegetable. Tomato has very few competitors in the value addition chain of processing. Tomato cultivation requires enough care right from nursery raising to post harvesting operations. Necessary package of practices must be followed for the better yield. Looking to this, the present investigation was carried out to study the information needs of tribal tomato growers of Vadodara district. The result of this study revealed that information on fertilizer application rank first followed by pest and disease management. The Study also indicated that more than two-third of the tomato growers (70.00 per cent) were fell under medium group, while 19.16 and 10.84 per cent of the tomato growers were categorized under high and low groups of information needs, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acrop production 3adisease control 3afertilizer application 3agrowers 3aharvesting 3ainformation needs 3aketchup 3anutritive value 3apests 3apickles 3asalads 3asauces 3asoups 3atomatoes 0ainformation needs1 aJani, Sunny1 aPatel, Mahesh R.0 tTrends in Biosciences.g2015 Feb., v. 8, no. 3 p.686-689dSociety for Advancement of Science and Rural DevelopmentwJournal:2106x0976-24857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245012500151300001400276520170800290592002801998650002302026650001502049650002002064650001202084650002002096650000902116650001102125650001202136650001702148650001402165650001502179651001102194651001502205700001802220700001802238700002302256700002502279773010002304856003902404852000902443655001202452IND4475411520221122153203.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447541152DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.12352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoos, Mark10aEstimating local and regional population sizes for an endangered minnow, redside dace (Clinostomus elongatus), in Canada  ap. 47-57.  aThe Laurentian Great Lakes have undergone drastic declines in freshwater fishes, with 22 species having become extinct in the past century and many more currently at risk. One such species is the endangered minnow, the redside dace (Clinostomus elongatus), which is undergoing severe declines across its entire range. Depletion and mark–recapture surveys were used to quantify population estimates of redside dace at several spatial scales (pool, reach and catchment) across several Great Lakes tributaries in Canada. There was large variation in the local population estimates and the rate of occurrence of redside dace populations. In some cases, such as Gully Creek, a Lake Huron tributary, redside dace were widespread (9/10 of pools) but in low abundances (13.5 individuals per pool ± 5.09 ). In other cases, such as in the Don River, redside dace were highly localized (2/27 pools) but in relatively high abundance (99.2 individuals/pool ± 18.1). Extrapolated population estimates at the catchment scale showed that three of the five study populations were below conservative estimates needed for long‐term population viability. Differences in redside dace populations were driven by adjacent land‐use. Post‐hoc analyses revealed strong negative associations between population estimates and impervious land‐use (i.e. urbanization) at both the pool and sub‐catchment level. Immediate recovery actions that will focus on eliminating chronic and episodic impacts of adjacent land‐use and improve connectivity are needed to help ensure redside dace, like many freshwater species in the Laurentian Great Lakes, remain a species at risk of – rather than facing – extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3afreshwater fish 3aminnows 3apopulation size 3arisk 3arivers 3asurveys 3aurbanization 3aviability 3awatersheds 3aCanada 3aLake Huron1 aLawrie, David1 aTU, Christine1 aJackson, Donald A.1 aMandrak, Nicholas E.0 tAquatic conservation.g2012 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.47-57dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.1235  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012900171520158000300592002801880650001501908650000801923650001301931650001401944650001401958650001901972650001301991650002402004650001902028650002402047653002202071653002502093653001402118653001602132653003702148700001802185700002602203700002602229773009802255856008702353852000902440655001202449IND60634630320221122053052.0220502e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063463032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Moon Keun10aEvaluation of the humidity performance of a carbon dioxide (CO2) capture device as a novel ventilation strategy in buildings  aThis study examines the moisture performance of a carbon dioxide (CO₂) adsorption device and its utilization as a novel ventilation strategy in buildings. The device adsorbs CO₂ and a small amount of moisture in the CO₂ capture process. To activate a CO₂ capture device for air recirculation in a building or connect it to an air handling unit to minimize the ventilation rate, the air needs to be controlled to have a steady-state humidity ratio below 12 g/kg, which is the maximum humidity ratio allowed in a room according to international standards. This study exhibits the moisture performance of an implemented CO₂ capture device in the operation of an air ventilation system and its ability to recirculate indoor air via experimentation and numerical modeling for saving energy in buildings. Moreover, this research also evaluates the humidity performance using the strategy of connecting the CO₂ capture device with an air handling unit and recirculating the air in the breathing zone based on an occupancy diversity factor. Based on these results, the study indicates that the air recirculation achieved by either using the CO₂ capturing unit itself or connecting it to an air handling unit reduces not only the thermal energy load but also the energy load of dehumidifying the air in buildings. This work newly introduces the humidity performance of a CO₂ capture device for air ventilation in buildings, and the novel ventilation paradigm can adjust the supply outdoor airflow rates depending on the surrounding environment and occupant behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aair flow 3abreathing 3abuildings 3acarbon dioxide 3ahumidity 3amathematical models 3athermal energy 3aventilation systems 0aNovel ventilation 0aHumidity performance 0aBuildings 0aCO2 capture 0aOccupancy diversity: Energy save1 aBaldini, Luca1 aLeibundgut, Hansjürg1 aWurzbacher, Jan Andre0 tApplied energy.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 259 p.112869-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.03.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010400162300001800266520127200284592002801556650002801584650002101612650001801633650002001651650002701671650001401698650001601712650001801728650002001746650002901766650002701795700001601822700001801838700001401856700001201870700001801882700001701900700001401917773012701931856008102058852000902139655001202148IND60438673720221122171550.0151023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043867372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6734-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aFine-tuning of ecaA and pepc gene expression increases succinic acid production in Escherichia coli  ap. 8575-8586.  aFor making a complex synthetic gene network function as designed, the parameters in the network have to be extensively tuned. In this study, a simple and general approach to rapidly tune gene networks in Escherichia coli was developed, which uses the hypermutable simple sequence repeats embedded in the spacer region between the ribosome binding site and the initiation codon. It was found that the change of sequence length and compositions of the repeated base pairs in 5′UTR contributes together to the changeable expression levels of the target gene. The mechanism of this phenomenon is that the transcriptional process makes greater impact on the expression level when compared to the translational process, which is utilized to successfully predict sample gene expression levels over a 50-fold range. The utility of the approach to regulate heterologous ecaA and pepc gene expression in the engineered E. coli for improving succinic acid yield and production has also been demonstrated. When the expression level of ecaA gene was 3.53-fold of the control and the expression level of pepc gene was 1.06-fold of the control, the highest yield of succinic acid and productivity were achieved, which was 0.87 g g⁻¹ and 2.01 g L⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aEscherichia coli 3abinding sites 3agene expression 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aribosomes 3astart codon 3asuccinic acid 3asynthetic genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aQin, Dandan1 aZhang, Baoyun1 aLi, Qiang1 aLi, Sha1 aZhou, Xiaohua1 aDong, Lichun1 aWang, Dan0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2015 Oct., v. 99, no. 20 p.8575-8586dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-6734-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245006700174300001400241520082400255592002801079650001701107650001501124650002601139650002201165650001301187650001501200653001001215653002401225653002301249653001901272653001301291653002801304653003801332773010901370856008201479852000901561655001201570IND60606678920221117235408.0180727e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060667892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2016.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRentsch, Katharina M.10aKnowing the unknown – State of the art of LCMS in toxicology  ap. 88-93.  aLiquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is nowadays an indispensable tool in the clinical toxicology laboratory. It allows the identification of a very high number of compounds for confirmation of positive immunoassay results as well as the detection of yet unknown compounds present in an intoxicated patient. In clinical toxicological laboratories ion traps and triple stage quadrupole instruments are widely used, whereas high-resolution instruments are only used in specialized laboratories. As every analytical method also LC-MS has its limitations; the most important drawbacks are matrix effects which can lead to ionization enhancement or suppression. For the identification of a compound, 3 to 4 identification points are necessary, regardless if a high-resolution instrument is used or not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunoassays 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3atoxicology 0aLC-MS 0aClinical toxicology 0aSample preparation 0aDrugs of abuse 0aIon trap 0aTriple stage quadrupole 0aHigh-resolution mass spectrometry0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2016 Nov., v. 84 p.88-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2016.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009100171300001800262520071500280592002800995650002101023650001501044650002001059650001501079650001401094650001201108650002101120650001801141650001301159650001201172650001401184650001401198700002101212700002201233700002101255700001701276700002101293773012701314856008101441852000901522655001201531IND60438673820221122171556.0151023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043867382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-6747-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolovyev, Andrey I.10aPreconcentration and detection of mercury with bioluminescent bioreporter E. coli ARL1  ap. 8793-8802.  aCell wall envelopes treated with sodium hydroxide and spray-dried were used as mercury sorbents.

Strid (Lentibulariaceae)  ap. 730-740.  aThe development of habitat suitability models requires a large amount of data which are rarely available. In this case, researchers need to get information on the ecological features of the studied species, based on the opinion of experts or on the literature, to construct a qualitative model. However, such models cannot be rigorously evaluated, as in most cases absence points are not available. In this paper, we assess the habitat suitability for a vulnerable insectivorous plant, Pinguicula crystallina Sibth. et Smith subsp. hirtiflora (Ten.) Strid (Lentibulariaceae) in the Campania region. Our aim was to develop an expert-based, presence-only model in support of possible conservation actions. Topographic and geological features of this species suggested by the literature were used in our model. Both the Boyce index and field surveys were chosen to evaluate the model's reliability. During field surveys, 31 absence sites and 1 new presence site were identified, and differences between sites with regard to water chemistry and quality were investigated, water being an element in the species habitat. Factors that affect reliability of the model, such as the lack of a large amount of information on the species and the limited spatial resolution of geographical information system data, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinguicula 3acase studies 3aexperts 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3ahydrochemistry 3ainsectivores 3amodels 3arare species 3asurveys 3atopography 3aItaly 0aBoyce index 0ahabitat suitability models 0aItaly 0amodel evaluation 0aPinguicula crystallina subsp. hirtiflora 0awater chemistry1 aSibilio, G.1 aInnangi, M.1 aDi Febbraro, M.1 aTrifuoggi, M.1 aGuida, M.1 aDe Castro, O.0 tPlant biosystems.g2016 July 3, v. 150, no. 4 p.730-740dTaylor & Francisx1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2014.9909403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245018400165300001600349520142300365592002801788596007901816650004801895650004701943650003101990650001302021650002702034650004102061650002502102650001202127650001602139650002202155650002402177650001002201650003502211650003302246650001102279650002102290650000902311650001802320650001902338650001702357650001202374650001902386650001902405650001802424650001702442700002502459700002402484700001602508700002102524700002102545700002002566773013602586856008302722852000902805655001202814IND60754020920221121224059.0211021e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075402092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-021-02124-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Pooja10aSalt and drought stress tolerance with increased biomass in transgenic Pelargonium graveolens through heterologous expression of ACC deaminase gene from Achromobacter xylosoxidans  ap. 297-311.  aGeranium (Pelargonium graveolens) is a strongly aromatic medicinal plant with increasing market demand. The present study demonstrated that the transgenic P. graveolens exhibited a remarkable increase in plant height (~20–23%), total biomass (18–60%), leaf: stem ratio (12–21%) and quantity of oil, compared to its wild-type counterpart. Transgenic P. graveolens expressing ACC deaminase gene from Achromobacter xylosoxidans, encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylilate under the control of 35 S CaMV promoter showed immense tolerance to salinity and drought stress than the wild-type plant. Parameters examined were chlorophyll content, photosynthetic parameters, relative water content (RWC), ROS production, antioxidants, proline, ACC content and real time analysis of ACC synthase, ACC deaminase, and ACC oxidase genes. The ACC deaminase-expressing transgenic lines viz. L1, L5 and L7 demonstrate a decrease of ACC content under salt and drought stress, which could lead increased ethylene production, which in turn may affect salt and drought stress. Transgenic P. graveolens showed enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stress as reflected as a result of higher leaf RWC, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic parameter, accumulation of proline and more antioxidant activity. The reported transgenic P. graveolens lines are potentially valuable materials for cultivation in saline and drought-prone areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aCSIR (ChemBio-BSC 203)cCentral Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3aAchromobacter xylosoxidans 3aGeranium 3aPelargonium graveolens 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adrought tolerance 3aethylene production 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheterologous gene expression 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3aoils 3aorgan culture 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant height 3aproline 3asalt tolerance 3asupply balance 3awater content 3awater stress1 aPandey, Shiv Shanker1 aDubey, Basant Kumar1 aRaj, Rashmi1 aBarnawal, Deepti1 aChandran, Ashish1 aRahman, Laiq ur0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2021 Nov., v. 147, no. 2 p.297-311dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33513x0167-68577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-021-02124-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011000174300001600284520107800300592002801378650004401406650002201450650002801472650002101500650001301521650001601534650002601550650001701576650001001593650001301603650001901616650000701635650001501642650001301657650002101670650001901691653001401710653001801724653002301742653001301765653001201778653001301790700002301803773010801826856008601934852000902020655001202029IND60553071720221119095207.0161021e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055307172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayalekshmi, A.C.10aGold nanoparticle incorporated polymer/bioactive glass composite for controlled drug delivery application  ap. 280-287.  aThe present study discusses the development of a biodegradable polymer encapsulated-nanogold incorporated-bioactive glass composite (AuPBG) by a low-temperature method. The composite was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry (TG), fluorescence and dissolution analysis. The composite exhibited aggregation behaviour in solid and solution states and exhibited negative zeta potential (−13.3±1.4mV). The composite exhibited fast degradation starting from the 5th day onwards in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for a period of 14 days. The composite showed fluorescence quenching effect at pH 7 and the fluorescence recovered at pH 5. The composite has been found to be suitable for the release of doxorubicin at high rates at acidic pH (∼5) which is the intracellular pH of tumour cells. The drug loading ratio is also high and it exhibited a controlled release for a period of 8 days in PBS. The system serves as a promising material for targeted drug delivery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiodegradability 3acolloids 3adoxorubicin 3adrug delivery systems 3afluorescence 3aglass 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolymers 3athermogravimetry 3azeta potential 0aComposite 0aDrug delivery 0aGold nanoparticles 0aChitosan 0aGelatin 0aBioglass1 aSharma, Chandra P.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 126 p.280-287dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245012000208300001600328520106700344592002801411650001701439650001501456650000901471650001801480650002101498650002801519650001701547650001501564650003201579650002101611650001301632650002701645650001301672650005801685650001401743653002301757653001901780653001801799653001501817653002101832700003101853700002801884700002201912773011201934856008202046852000902128655001202137IND60544133520221120171345.0190415e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054413352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2015.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalampessy, Junus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8851-378810aFunctional and potential therapeutic ACE-inhibitory peptides derived from bromelain hydrolysis of trevally proteins  ap. 716-725.  aIn a view to produce physiologically active peptides, soluble and insoluble fish protein fractions from trevally (Pseudocaranx sp.) were hydrolysed with bromelain and the hydrolysates were used in a systematic screening for angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. The IC50 values of hydrolysates from soluble protein substrate ranged from 1.99 to 3.34 mg/mL, while the values for hydrolysates from insoluble protein substrate ranged from 2.45 to 4.74 mg/mL. Fractionation with RP-HPLC gave three most active peptide fractions labelled as TBS1, TBS2, and TBI2 which showed high potential as ACE-inhibitory agents. The primary structures of the three stable and active peptide fractions are AR, AV, and APER, with molecular weights of 245.28, 188.23, and 471.51 Da, respectively. Simulated gastrointestinal enzyme degradation of the three selected peptide fractions revealed their stability in the gut.

Characterization of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 was achieved using different various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron micrographs (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The structural parameters of Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 such as crystallite size, lattice constant, unit cell volume and theoretical density have been determined. XRD and IR measurements confirm formation of single spinel Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 phase. SEM technique was used to investigate the morphology characteristics of the investigated solid. It was found that the as synthesized ferrite was spongy, homogeneous and fragile. Also, EDX technique showed the concentrations of O, Ni, Fe and Zn species involved in Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 specimen from the uppermost surface to the bulk layers indicating to the elements gradient. The saturation magnetization (Ms), remanence magnetization (Mr) and coercivity (Hc) of the as synthesized composite were 57emu/g, 10emu/g and 58Oe, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystallites 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3airon 3anickel 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azinc 0aXRD 0aSEM 0aEDX 0aVSM 0aNi0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 0aCrystallite size1 aAbd-Elkader, Omar H.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 Mar., v. 106 p.171-176dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011100168300001600279520127000295592002801565650001501593650001101608650001001619650001501629650001301644650001201657650001101669650001601680650001201696653001601708653004101724653005201765653001801817700002801835700002001863700001501883700002001898773008901918856008502007852000902092655001202101IND60566473220221119170215.0180830e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056647322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yanjun13aAn adaptive model predictive controller for a novel battery-powered anti-idling system of service vehicles  ap. 318-327.  aThis paper presents an anti-idling regenerative auxiliary power system for service vehicles. The energy storage system in the regenerative auxiliary power system is able to electrify the auxiliary systems so as to achieve anti-idling. Service vehicles (e.g. delivery trucks or public buses) generally have predetermined routes, thus it is feasible and profitable to utilize a model predictive control strategy to improve the fuel economy of the new powertrain. However, the mass/load of such service vehicles is time-varying during a drive cycle. Therefore, an adaptive model predictive controller should be designed to account for this variation. Although the drive cycle is preset, it would experience uncertainties or disturbances caused by traffic or weather conditions in real situations. To deal with this problem, a large step size prediction method is used in the adaptive model predictive algorithm to enhance its robustness. The proposed algorithm is compared to a prescient model predictive controller in different scenarios to demonstrate its applicability and optimality (more than 7% fuel savings). The proposed approach is independent of the powertrain topology such that it is able to be directly extended to other types of hybrid electric vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3afuels 3aprediction 3atopology 3atraffic 3atrucks 3auncertainty 3aweather 0aAnti-idling 0aAdaptive model predictive controller 0aElectrification of automotive auxiliary systems 0aKalman filter1 aFard, Soheil Mohagheghi1 aKhazraee, Milad1 aWang, Hong1 aKhajepour, Amir0 tEnergy.g2017 May 15, v. 127 p.318-327dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010900165300001600274520163400290592002801924650002001952650002501972650001201997650001902009650002602028650001302054650001902067650001602086650002002102650002002122650002202142650001502164650001902179650001702198650001302215650001902228650001402247650000902261650001102270650002502281650001402306650001302320700002102333700001702354700002002371700005802391773012302449856008202572852000902654655001202663IND60696374320221121064113.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069637432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-019-10007-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaraz, Ahmad10aSupplementation of Salicylic Acid and Citric Acid for Alleviation of Cadmium Toxicity to Brassica juncea  ap. 641-655.  aThe reported study investigated the interaction between salicylic acid (SA) and citric acid (CA) in cadmium (Cd)-stressed Brassica juncea plants. Seedling received Cd (0.6 mM) stress through soil at 5-day stage of growth. SA (0.01 mM) and CA (0.6 mM) treatments were applied at 25 days after sowing. Growth, photosynthesis, oxidative burst, and antioxidant systems were examined at 30-day stage of growth. Growth and photosynthetic parameters reduced significantly in the presence of Cd, and elevated levels of H₂O₂ were indicative of oxidative burst which resulted in decline of cell viability. Foliar spray of SA and CA alone or in combination mitigated the toxic effects generated by Cd and enhanced plant growth parameters. The inhibitory effects of Cd toxicity on width of stomatal pore resulted in reduced internal CO₂ concentration and carbonic anhydrase activity which consequently limited the photosynthetic rate. SA and CA alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd on photosynthesis by stimulating the stomatal activity and pore size. The Cd-generated oxidative burst was reduced via enhanced antioxidant activity (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) upon follow-up treatment with SA and CA alone or in combination. A combined dose of SA and CA countered Cd-induced damage by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species and strengthening plant antioxidant defense systems, which resulted in membrane stabilization and recovery from stress. Combined dose of SA and CA proved more effective than their individual application towards Cd stress which suggests an effective synergism between the two acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aantioxidant activity 3acadmium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acatalase 3acell viability 3acitric acid 3aenzyme activity 3afoliar spraying 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aporosity 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asowing 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asynergism 3atoxicity1 aFaizan, Mohammad1 aSami, Fareen1 aSiddiqui, Husna1 aHayat, Shamsul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2476-54090 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2020 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.641-655dSpringer USwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-019-10007-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144242016500169245015900334300001200493520148400505592002801989650001902017650001002036650002202046650001802068650001202086650002002098650002502118651002802143651001202171651001202183651002802195700002202223700001702245700002002262773009902282856007802381852000902459655001202468IND60132728120221119012433.0150511e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013272812DNAL7 a10.1051/forest/20080832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShorohova, Ekaterina10aStructure des peuplements, régimes de perturbation et dynamiques de succession dans les forêts boréales eurasiennes : une revue basée sur des travaux russes10aNatural stand structures, disturbance regimes and successional dynamics in the Eurasian boreal forests: a review with special reference to Russian studies  ap. 201.  a• This review summarizes early stand-scale studies of pristine forest structures, disturbance regimes and successional patterns carried out in boreal Eurasia. We attempt to reveal, characterize and classify stand dynamic types that can be used as templates for nature-based forest management. • The studies reviewed demonstrate multiple successional pathways in stand development in all types of pristine forests. All-aged stands driven by small-scale disturbances are formed over successional development of several hundreds of years. This endogenous development can be interrupted by stand-replacing or partial disturbances leading to successions with even-aged or cohort-structured stands, respectively. In Western Europe, the most common disturbances are windthrows, surface fires and fluctuations in moisture regime; in Eastern Europe and Siberia, the most common disturbances are crown and surface fires and insect outbreaks. Type, return interval and severity of disturbances are strongly influenced by the site conditions and successional stage of a stand. • Based on characteristics of forest stands and disturbance regime, four main types of pristine boreal forest stand dynamics can be distinguished: (1) even-aged, compositional change dynamics, (2) even-aged, mono-dominant dynamics, (3) cohort dynamics and (4) fine-scale gap dynamics. These types can be mimicked in developing scenarios of ecological sustainable forest management in Eurasian boreal forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3afires 3aforest management 3aforest stands 3ainsects 3astand structure 3asustainable forestry 3aEastern European region 3aEurasia 3aSiberia 3aWestern European region1 aKuuluvainen, Timo1 aKangur, Ahto1 aJõgiste, Kalev0 tAnnals of forest science.g2009 Jan., v. 66, no. 2 p.201-201dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest/20080833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011500171300001600286520167600302592002801978650001102006650002802017650001102045650001302056650002002069650001402089650002002103650001102123650000802134650001702142650000902159650001002168650002502178650001102203650001402214650001002228651001502238653000802253653001002261653000702271653000902278653000702287653000702294653000802301653000802309653000902317653000802326653000802334653001002342653000702352653001002359653000902369653000702378653000902385653000702394653000802401653000802409653001302417653000902430653001902439653001902458653002702477653001102504653001802515700002102533700001802554700002202572700002202594700002002616773010402636856008502740852000902825655001202834IND60606005920221117044450.0181222e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060600592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, Colleen E.10aDifferential respiratory health effects from the 2008 northern California wildfires: A spatiotemporal approach  ap. 227-235.  aWe investigated health effects associated with fine particulate matter during a long-lived, large wildfire complex in northern California in the summer of 2008. We estimated exposure to PM2.5 for each day using an exposure prediction model created through data-adaptive machine learning methods from a large set of spatiotemporal data sets. We then used Poisson generalized estimating equations to calculate the effect of exposure to 24-hour average PM2.5 on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations and ED visits. We further assessed effect modification by sex, age, and area-level socioeconomic status (SES). We observed a linear increase in risk for asthma hospitalizations (RR=1.07, 95% CI=(1.05, 1.10) per 5µg/m3 increase) and asthma ED visits (RR=1.06, 95% CI=(1.05, 1.07) per 5µg/m3 increase) with increasing PM2.5 during the wildfires. ED visits for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with PM2.5 during the fires (RR=1.02 (95% CI=(1.01, 1.04) per 5µg/m3 increase) and this effect was significantly different from that found before the fires but not after. We did not find consistent effects of wildfire smoke on other health outcomes. The effect of PM2.5 during the wildfire period was more pronounced in women compared to men and in adults, ages 20–64, compared to children and adults 65 or older. We also found some effect modification by area-level median income for respiratory ED visits during the wildfires, with the highest effects observed in the ZIP codes with the lowest median income. Using a novel spatiotemporal exposure model, we found some evidence of differential susceptibility to exposure to wildfire smoke.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aartificial intelligence 3aasthma 3achildren 3adata collection 3aequations 3aexposure models 3aincome 3amen 3aparticulates 3arisk 3asmoke 3asocioeconomic status 3asummer 3awildfires 3awomen 3aCalifornia 0aAOD 0aBRFSS 0aCI 0aCOPD 0aCV 0aED 0aGBM 0aGEE 0aGOES 0aIHD 0aIQR 0aMODIS 0aPM 0aPM2.5 0aQICu 0aRH 0aRMSE 0aRR 0aRUC 0aSES 0aWRF-Chem 0aZCTA 0aWildland fires 0aClimate change 0aVulnerable populations 0aAsthma 0aAir pollution1 aJerrett, Michael1 aTager, Ira B.1 aPetersen, Maya L.1 aMann, Jennifer K.1 aBalmes, John R.0 tEnvironmental research.g2016 Oct., v. 150 p.227-235dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011100168300002100279520125900300592002801559650001401587650002601601650002001627650001001647650001901657650001901676650003001695700006001725700001201785700001501797700001601812700001401828700005901842700001701901700006401918700005801982700006302040700002002103700001902123700001402142700001502156773011102171856008502282852000902367655001202376IND60760323720221119134041.0220118e20211216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076032372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2021.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Juncheng10aHRD1-mediated METTL14 degradation regulates m6A mRNA modification to suppress ER proteotoxic liver disease  ap. 5052-5065.e6.  aAccumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) for stress adaptation, the failure of which induces cell apoptosis and tissue/organ damage. The molecular switches underlying how the UPR selects for stress adaptation over apoptosis remain unknown. Here, we discovered that accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins selectively induces N⁶-adenosine-methyltransferase-14 (METTL14) expression. METTL14 promotes C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) mRNA decay through its 3′ UTR N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) to inhibit its downstream pro-apoptotic target gene expression. UPR induces METTL14 expression by competing against the HRD1-ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery to block METTL14 ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, mice with liver-specific METTL14 deletion are highly susceptible to both acute pharmacological and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency-induced ER proteotoxic stress and liver injury. Further hepatic CHOP deletion protects METTL14 knockout mice from ER-stress-induced liver damage. Our study reveals a crosstalk between ER stress and mRNA m⁶A modification pathways, termed the ERm⁶A pathway, for ER stress adaptation to proteotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3agene expression 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aubiquitination 3aunfolded protein response1 aHarada, Bryan T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9683-782X1 aLu, Dan1 aMa, Ruihua1 aGao, Beixue1 aXu, Yanan1 aMontauti, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7760-28301 aMani, Nikita1 aChaudhuri, Shuvam M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4934-85561 aGregory, Shana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0743-22901 aWeinberg, Samuel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9532-70511 aZhang, Donna D.1 aGreen, Richard1 aHe, Chuan1 aFang, Deyu0 tMolecular cell.g2021 Dec. 16, v. 81, no. 24 p.5052-5065.e6dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009900169300001400268520107300282592002801355650004401383650001501427650001301442650001301455650002501468650001901493650003401512650001201546650004401558650001401602650001801616650003301634650001001667650001701677650001601694650002101710653002501731653001401756653001201770653000901782653002101791700002501812773012101837856008201958852000902040655001202049IND60599846320221120065007.0180702e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemiral, İlknur10aPyrolysis of apricot kernel shell in a fixed-bed reactor: Characterization of bio-oil and char  ap. 17-24.  aThe pyrolysis of apricot kernel shell was studied for determining the main characteristics and quantities of liquid and solid products. Experiments were carried out in a static atmosphere with heating rates of 10°C/min and 50°C/min, pyrolysis temperatures of 400, 450, 500 and 550°C and sweep gas flow rates of 50–200cm³/min. The maximum bio-oil and char yields were 26.3 (500°C) and 35.2% (400°C), respectively. The TG-DTG analyses were applied on the raw material to investigate the thermal degradation of apricot kernel shell. The elemental analysis and heating value of the bio-oils were determined, and then the chemical composition of the bio-oil was investigated using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques such as column chromatography, ¹H NMR, and FTIR. In addition, the char was characterized by elemental, BET and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. According to the experimental results the liquid products can be used as liquid fuels and the solid product seems to be suitable for adsorption purposes due to its high surface area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aapricots 3abiofuels 3achemical composition 3achromatography 3adifferential thermal analysis 3aliquids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aApricot kernel shell 0aPyrolysis 0aBio-oil 0aChar 0aCharacterization1 aKul, Şerife Çemrek0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 May, v. 107 p.17-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001500306520230700321592002802628650001602656650001602672650001402688650002802702650002402730650001102754650001502765650002402780773009202804856008402896852000902980655001202989IND60097543720221119013555.0141104e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009754372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüllü, Hamza10aPrediction of peak ground acceleration by genetic expression programming and regression: A comparison using likelihood-based measure  ap. 92-113.  aPeak ground acceleration (PGA) has still been considered one of the important factors that plays significant role on the earthquake-induced damage of structures. Thus, prediction of the PGA and selection of appropriate ground motion models often have become a valuable topic for seismic hazard assessments. This paper presents an application in order to predict the PGA by a relatively new prediction tool, genetic expression programming (GEP) and the conventional method of regression, and then aims to select the appropriate ground motion models derived by the GEP and regression methods. The selection was carried out by comparing the prediction performances through a ranking process using a new goodness-of-fit measure, likelihood estimation (LH), recently proposed by Scherbaum et al. (2004, on the use of response spectral reference data for the selection and ranking of ground-motion models for seismic hazard analysis in regions of moderate seismicity: the case of rock motion. Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America 94, 1–22). The Turkish earthquake data properly organized were used for deriving the candidate ground motion models of PGA attenuation equations. The validations of the LH method as well as the GEP and regression models were performed by the key attenuation characteristics, the attenuation equations for Turkey and the case records of Turkish strong ground motion data. The results indicate that majority of the PGA candidate models (GEP and regressions) that are ranked as good qualifications (class A and B) by the LH method generally pass the model validations, but the ones ranked as lower levels (class C) fail. This finding indicates that the LH method can be beneficial for the comparisons of the candidate ground motion models, and the selection of appropriate models for attenuation studies. Even though the GEP-based models that were found to be appropriate by the LH method need some improvements to obtain simple functional forms of PGA predictive relationships, their PGA predictions were reasonably consistent with the model validations. Thus, this study suggests that the GEP approach can be employed for predicting the PGAs in seismic hazard studies at least as a supplement to conventionally derived predictive relationships from the regressions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3aengineering 3aequations 3ahazard characterization 3aluteinizing hormone 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis0 tEngineering geology.g2012 July 19, v. 141-142 p.92-113dElsevier B.V.x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009100174300001000265500001900275520201900294592002802313596008302341650001302424650001502437650001502452650001202467650001802479650001402497650001402511650001202525650001702537650001402554650001302568650001602581651001102597651001402608700002202622700002802644700006002672773011502732856008302847852000902930655001202939IND60696374520221121064105.0201203e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069637452DNAL7 a10.1186/s10152-020-00539-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrito-Lolaia, Morgana10aMicro- and mesozooplankton at the edges of coastal tropical reefs (Tamandaré, Brazil)  ap. 7.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTropical reef ecosystems are generally considered to be sinks of marine zooplankton, mainly due to the predation by scleractinian corals and other planktivores. The present study aims to evaluate the zooplankton community of a coastal reef in two specific environments: the reef edge and open-water channels between patch reefs. Sampling was carried out at two patch reefs that border the Tamandaré coastal lagoon system (Pernambuco State, Brazil). Two passive stationary nets (64 μm mesh size) were used: the Reef Edge Net (REN) and the Channel Midwater Neuston Net (CMNN). Sampling was performed simultaneously at both reefs during eight nocturnal sampling campaigns, always at new moon ebb tides. Zooplankton was classified by “origin” (estuarine, reef, neritic and neritic/estuarine). During all campaigns and at both sites, a significant buildup of zooplankton at the reefs was observed. Reef edges showed significantly higher abundance (77,579 ± 73,985 ind. m⁻³) and biomass (48.9 ± 45.5 mg C m⁻³) of zooplankton compared to open-water channels (9982 ± 11,427 ind. m⁻³ and 11.4 ± 21.9 mg C m⁻³, respectively). A total of 65 taxonomic groups were identified. Copepods were the most abundant group with a contribution of 69% for total zooplankton abundance, followed by foraminiferans, gastropod veligers, appendicularians, cirripedians nauplii, and polychaete larvae. Copepods from neritic/estuarine environments dominated the reef edges in both relative abundance and relative biomass (91% and 88%, respectively). The unexpectedly high abundance of copepods and other holoplankton at the reef edges, when compared to Indo-Pacific and Caribbean reefs, is probably due to very low cover of corals and other zooplanktivorous sessile animals (< 0.2%) on these coastal reefs, which leads to a very low predation mortality for zooplankters. Also, we propose that the reduced water column above the reef top leads to a buildup of very high densities in these environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a471038/2012-1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aCopepoda 3aGastropoda 3aPolychaeta 3abiomass 3acoastal water 3aestuaries 3amortality 3anauplii 3aplanktivores 3apredation 3aresearch 3azooplankton 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean1 aSantos, Gleice S.1 aNeumann-Leitão, Sigrid1 aSchwamborn, Ralf1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9150-87200 tHelgoland marine research.g2020 Dec., v. 74, no. 1 p.7-7dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000000238x1438-387X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10152-020-00539-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245017200175300001800347500001900365520131100384536017601695592002801871596003001899650002401929650001101953650001101964650001001975650001001985650001501995653002502010653001802035653002602053653002302079653002502102700002202127700002602149700002302175700002302198700002002221773013702241856008602378852000902464655001202473IND60730424220221119053601.0210618e20210503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073042422DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2020.18624362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazezew, Muluken N.10aFactual approach for tropical forest parameters measurement and monitoring: future option with a focus on synergetic use of airborne and terrestrial LiDAR technologies  ap. 3219-3230.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aForest biomass and carbon are critical for ecological monitoring, and yet poorly modelled in complex ecosystems such as the tropical rainforests. To overcome this challenge incurred due to the complex biophysical properties of tropical forests, Airborne and Terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technologies have been used combinedly. Airborne LiDAR data ‘from above’ are largely restricted to analyses of lower canopy layer trees. Its combination with Terrestrial LiDAR allows the assessment of tree crowns under the upper canopy layer, thus opening up new possibilities for a more complete assessment of all the trees in a multi-layer stand. In this study, Airborne LiDAR was used for upper canopy tree measurements while Terrestrial LiDAR was complimented for lower canopy layer trees. The result showed that LiDAR-based tree measurements of DBH and height were highly accurate. We highly improved the accuracy of estimated above-ground biomass (AGB)/carbon from 87% of Terrestrial and 90% of Airborne LiDAR-based estimates to 97% through combining the use of the two technologies. This approach contributes to the development of efficient techniques for forest monitoring systems and bears the potential to extend the modelling options from remote sensing data to understory layer trees.  aThis work was supported by Nuffic, the Netherlands Fellowship Programmes (NFP), Funds for Higher Education, and International Researches Grant (No. 10.13039/501100009295).  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 10.13039/501100009295 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3acarbon 3alidar 3atrees 3aunderstory 0aAbove-ground biomass 0aCanopy layers 0aEcological monitoring 0aLaser technologies 0aTree crown detection1 aHussin, Yousif A.1 aKloosterman, Evert H.1 aM.

Due to weathering, the residual soil properties vary with depths, especially in tropical countries, such as: Singapore. Therefore, it is important to characterize the properties of residual soil with depth. Index properties, soil–water characteristic curve and saturated and unsaturated shear strength tests were carried out on residual soils from sedimentary Jurong Formation, Bukit Timah Granite and Old Alluvium in Singapore. The variations of residual soil properties in Singapore were determined from the laboratory test results and evaluated as a function of soil inherent variability. Typical, upper and lower bounds of soil properties for the residual soils in Singapore were described using confidence interval approach and coefficient of variation (COV) in this paper. The variations in residual soil properties can be incorporated in design based on risk or reliability approach. The COV of index and engineering properties of residual soils in Singapore indicate that residual soils from Bukit Timah Granite and Old Alluvium are coarser than residual soil from sedimentary Jurong Formation. The particle size distribution of residual soil from Old Alluvium is more uniform than that from Bukit Timah Granite.

One promising concept is power-to-gas, where electrical energy is transformed to gas that can be stored more easily. H2 produced by electrolysis powered by excess energy is combined with CO2 in a methanation to produce CH4. Possible CO2 sources are numerous, but biogas is special, as it is a renewable source itself and already contains CH4 concentrations of up to 60% v/v. Normally the CH4 needs to be removed prior to methanation, requiring two gas upgrading steps.The newly developed process described in this paper circumvents this by directly feeding biogas to the methanation. For evaluation of this concept two process chains were realized. The classic setup consisted of a catalytic methanation and membrane based gas upgrading being fed with H2 and CO2 from bottles. The alternative process was coupled with a two-stage fermentation to study effects of changing biogas compositions. Both process chains have been demonstrated on a scale of about 0.5 m3 (STP)/h. Results for both will be presented in this work and the positive implications regarding the future implementation of biogas into power-to-gas systems will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3abottles 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectric power 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3afermentation 3ahydrogen 3amethane 0aBiogas 0aUpgrading 0aMethanation 0aMembrane 0aPower-to-gas1 aBiegger, Philipp1 aMiltner, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3766-40921 aLehner, Markus1 aHarasek, Michael0 tEnergy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01468naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245007100165300001600236520069300252592002800945650001300973650002000986650001401006650002401020773009401044856005501138852000901193655001201202IND4501523520221123034713.0150416e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450152352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00120.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Wei10aAkaike's Information Criterion in Generalized Estimating Equations  ap. 120-125.  aCorrelated response data are common in biomedical studies. Regression analysis based on the generalized estimating equations (GEE) is an increasingly important method for such data. However, there seem to be few model‐selection criteria available in GEE. The well‐known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) cannot be directly applied since AIC is based on maximum likelihood estimation while GEE is nonlikelihood based. We propose a modification to AIC, where the likelihood is replaced by the quasi‐likelihood and a proper adjustment is made for the penalty term. Its performance is investigated through simulation studies. For illustration, the method is applied to a real data set.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiometry 3adata collection 3aequations 3aregression analysis0 tBiometrics.g2001 Mar., v. 57, no. 1 p.120-125dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00120.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012400158500001400282520171300296592002802009650002202037650002402059650002202083650001102105650001302116650002002129650002202149650001202171773012102183856007302304852000902377655001202386IND60732248320221118022252.0210326e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073224832DNAL7 a10.3390/v130304732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, Kei 10aNovel Genetic Rearrangements in Hepatitis B Virus: Complex Structural Variations and Structural Variation Polymorphisms  aNAL-light  aChronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes serious clinical problems, such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current antiviral treatments suppress HBV; however, the clinical cure rate remains low. Basic research on HBV is indispensable to eradicate and cure HBV. Genetic alterations are defined by nucleotide substitutions and canonical forms of structural variations (SVs), such as insertion, deletion and duplication. Additionally, genetic changes inconsistent with the canonical forms have been reported, and these have been termed complex SVs. Detailed analyses of HBV using bioinformatical applications have detected complex SVs in HBV genomes. Sequence gaps and low sequence similarity have been observed in the region containing complex SVs. Additionally, insertional motif sequences have been observed in HBV strains with complex SVs. Following the analyses of complex SVs in the HBV genome, the role of SVs in the genetic diversity of orthohepadnavirus has been investigated. SV polymorphisms have been detected in comparisons of several species of orthohepadnaviruses. As mentioned, complex SVs are composed of multiple SVs. On the contrary, SV polymorphisms are observed as insertions of different SVs. Up to a certain point, nucleotide substitutions cause genetic differences. However, at some point, the nucleotide sequences are split into several particular patterns. These SVs have been observed as polymorphic changes. Different species of orthohepadnaviruses possess SVs which are unique and specific to a certain host of the virus. Studies have shown that SVs play an important role in the HBV genome. Further studies are required to elucidate their virologic and clinical roles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3achronic hepatitis B 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ahepatoma 3aliver cirrhosis 3asequence homology 3aviruses0 tViruses.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 13, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130304733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010400171300001400275520122000289592002801509650002101537650001301558650001201571650001301583650001201596650000901608650001801617650001401635650001601649653000901665653001801674653001401692653001601706700006201722700006001784700001801844700002101862773012101883856008202004852000902086655001202095IND60599846620221120065126.0180702e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullen, Charles A.10aMild pyrolysis of P3HB/switchgrass blends for the production of bio-oil enriched with crotonic acid  ap. 40-45.  aThe mild pyrolysis of switchgrass/poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB) blends that mimic P3HB-producing switchgrass lines was studied in a pilot scale fluidized bed reactor with the goal of simultaneously producing crotonic acid, a switchgrass-based bio-oil, and bio-char. Factors such as pyrolysis temperature, reactor residence time, flow rate and particle size of the P3HB were studied to determine their effects on the recovery of crotonic acid as a component of the pyrolysis oil produced from the mixture. Crotonic acid yields were maximized at 45wt% of the input P3HB by using small P3HB particles and a pyrolysis temperature of 375°C. The remaining components of the liquid product were similar to those produced via fast pyrolysis of switchgrass alone. Fractional collection within the condensation system of the pyrolysis process development unit (PDU) did not significantly fractionate crotonic acid more than the total liquids collected. Concentrations of 6 to 10wt% crotonic acid in the liquids were found in all fractions and crotonic acid was effectively collected by both condensation and electrostatic precipitation suggesting that pyrolysis of P3HB produces crotonic acid in both gas and aerosol phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aaerosols 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3aliquids 3aoils 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 0aP3HB 0aCrotonic acid 0aPyrolysis 0aSwitchgrass1 aBoateng, Akwasi A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8496-22011 aSchweitzer, Dirk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2406-63921 aSparks, Kevin1 aSnell, Kristi D.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 May, v. 107 p.40-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012100163300002000284520143400304592002801738650001601766650001701782650001901799650002601818650001201844650001701856650001901873650001401892653002401906653001701930653004101947653002701988653002302015700006402038700002102102700002002123700002002143700001702163700007802180773014202258856007802400852000902478655001202487IND60677424220200331000000.0191127e20191105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067742422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b197742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThür, Raymond10aModulator-Mediated Functionalization of MOF-808 as a Platform Tool to Create High-Performance Mixed-Matrix Membranes  ap. 44792-44801.  aModulator-mediated functionalization (MoFu) is introduced as a new and versatile platform tool to improve the separation performance of metal–organic framework (MOF)-based membranes, exemplified here by the creation of mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) with enhanced CO₂ separation efficiency. The unique structure of MOF-808 allows incorporation of CO₂-philic modulators in the MOF framework during a one-pot synthesis procedure in water, thus creating a straightforward way to functionalize both MOF and corresponding MMM. As a proof of concept, a series of fluorinated carboxylic acids [trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), pentafluoropropionic acid (PFPA), and heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA)] and nonfluorinated alkyl carboxylic acids (acetic acid (AA), propionic acid (PA), and butyric acid (BA)) were used as a modulator during MOF-808 synthesis. Two of the best MMMs prepared with 30 wt % MOF-TFA (100% increase in CO₂/CH₄ separation factor, 350% increase in CO₂ permeability) and 10 wt % MOF-PFPA (140% increase in CO₂/CH₄ separation factor, 100% increase in CO₂ permeability) scored very close to or even crossed the 2008 and 2018 upper bound limits for CO₂/CH₄. Because of its facile functionalization (and its subsequent excellent performance), MOF-808 is proposed as an alternative for widely used UiO-66, which is, from a functionalization point-of-view and despite its widespread use, a rather limited MOF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abutyric acid 3acarbon dioxide 3acoordination polymers 3amethane 3apermeability 3apropionic acid 3asynthesis 0afluorinated MOF-808 0aplatform MOF 0amodulator-mediated functionalization 0amixed-matrix membranes 0aCO2/CH4 separation1 aVan Velthoven, Niels1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3224-02391 aLemmens, Vincent1 aBastin, Maarten1 aSmolders, Simon1 aDe Vos, Dirk1 aVankelecom, I.

It is thus not entirely clear how to monitor spatial variability and temporal trends of RF-EMF exposure levels in the environment in a representative and efficient manner. The aim of this study was to test a monitoring protocol for RF-EMF measurements in public areas using portable devices.Using the ExpoM-RF devices mounted on a backpack, we have conducted RF-EMF measurements by walking through 51 different outdoor microenvironments from 20 different municipalities in Switzerland: 5 different city centers, 5 central residential areas, 5 non-central residential areas, 15 rural residential areas, 15 rural centers and 6 industrial areas. Measurements in public transport (buses, trains, trams) were collected when traveling between the areas. Measurements were conducted between 25th March and 11th July 2014. In order to evaluate spatial representativity within one microenvironment, we measured two crossing paths of about 1km in length in each microenvironment. To evaluate repeatability, measurements in each microenvironment were repeated after two to four months on the same paths.Mean RF-EMF exposure (sum of 15 main frequency bands between 87.5 and 5,875MHz) was 0.53V/m in industrial zones, 0.47V/m in city centers, 0.32V/m in central residential areas, 0.25V/m non-central residential areas, 0.23V/m in rural centers and rural residential areas, 0.69V/m in trams, 0.46V/m in trains and 0.39V/m in buses. Major exposure contribution at outdoor locations was from mobile phone base stations (>80% for all outdoor areas with respect to the power density scale). Temporal correlation between first and second measurement of each area was high: 0.89 for total RF-EMF, 0.90 for all five mobile phone downlink bands combined, 0.51 for all five uplink bands combined and 0.79 for broadcasting. Spearman correlation between arithmetic mean values of the first path compared to arithmetic mean of the second path within the same microenvironment was 0.75 for total RF-EMF, 0.76 for all five mobile phone downlink bands combined, 0.55 for all five uplink bands combined and 0.85 for broadcasting (FM and DVB-T).This study demonstrates that microenvironmental surveys using a portable device yields highly repeatable measurements, which allows monitoring time trends of RF-EMF exposure over an extended time period of several years and to compare exposure levels between different types of microenvironments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3aelectromagnetic field 3amonitoring 3aportable equipment 3aprotocols 3aresidential areas 3asurveys 3awalking 3aSwitzerland 0aRadio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) 0aMicroenvironment 0aExposure assessment, mobile phone handset 0aMobile phone base station 0aMonitoring 0aPortable exposure meter (exposimeters)1 aStruchen, Benjamin1 aFinta, Viktoria1 aEeftens, Marloes1 aRöösli, Martin,0 tEnvironmental research.g2016 Oct., v. 150 p.289-298dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01322naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245014500155300001600300520024200316592002800558650001500586650001400601650002600615650001300641650001300654650001100667650001400678650001400692650002000706700002100726700001800747773012600765856007200891852000900963655001200972IND60657492820221122194222.0190816e20040219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065749282DNAL7 a10.1039/b316100p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanyong10aDirect epoxidation of propylene by molecular oxygen over a catalyst system containing palladium and a peroxo-heteropoly compound in methanol  ap. 582-583.  aA catalyst system consisting of palladium and a peroxo-heteropoly compound in methanol showed 81.6% selectivity for propylene oxide at 42.7% propylene conversion using molecular oxygen as oxidant in an autoclave reactor at 373 K for 6 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoclaves 3acatalysts 3aepoxidation reactions 3amethanol 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3apalladium 3apropylene 3apropylene oxide1 aMurata, Kazuhisa1 aInaba, Megumu0 tChemical communications.g2004 Feb. 19, , no. 5 p.582-583dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b316100p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245012700176300001600303520104800319592002801367650002601395650001601421650000901437650001301446650000901459650001901468650001301487650001501500650001301515650001301528650002001541650001101561651001901572653003101591653001001622653000901632653001301641653001301654653001701667700002601684700002201710700002101732773011601753856008801869852000901957655001201966IND60088591320221121053236.0190318e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008859132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBargar, Timothy A.10aContaminants assessment in the coral reefs of Virgin Islands National Park and Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument  ap. 281-288.  aCoral, fish, plankton, and detritus samples were collected from coral reefs in Virgin Islands National Park (VIIS) and Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (VICR) to assess existing contamination levels. Passive water sampling using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) and semi-permeable membrane devices found a few emerging pollutants of concern (DEET and galaxolide) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Very little persistent organic chemical contamination was detected in the tissue or detritus samples. Detected contaminants were at concentrations below those reported to be harmful to aquatic organisms. Extracts from the POCIS were subjected to the yeast estrogen screen (YES) to assess potential estrogenicity of the contaminant mixture. Results of the YES (estrogen equivalency of 0.17–0.31ng/L 17-β-estradiol) indicated a low estrogenicity likelihood for contaminants extracted from water. Findings point to low levels of polar and non-polar organic contaminants in the bays sampled within VICR and VIIS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acoral reefs 3adeet 3aextracts 3afish 3anational parks 3aplankton 3apollutants 3asamplers 3asampling 3awater pollution 3ayeasts 3aVirgin Islands 0aSt. John US Virgin Islands 0aCoral 0aFish 0aPlankton 0aDetritus 0aContaminants1 aGarrison, Virginia H.1 aAlvarez, David A.1 aEchols, Kathy R.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2013 May 15, v. 70, no. 1-2 p.281-288dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02561naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014000168300001400308520139200322592002801714650001901742650001301761650002101774650001901795650001901814650001401833650001001847650002601857650002501883650001701908651001801925700002401943773014001967856008302107852000902190655001202199IND60760324420220421000000.0220421e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076032442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.riam.2021.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChincha, Omayra10aEstado actual de la histoplasmosis diseminada progresiva en pacientes con infección por el VIH en un hospital de tercer nivel en Perú  ap. 25-27.  aProgressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) is an endemic disease in most of Latin America, especially among patients with HIV. There are few reports about this disease in Peru. To describe the clinical, epidemiological and mycological features of patients with PDH and HIV evaluated in a tertiary hospital. A retrospective study to find out the data of patients diagnosed with PDH and HIV in the period 2000–2019 was carried out. For the statistical analysis of quantitative variables, measures of central tendency and dispersion were used; for the qualitative variables, absolute and relative frequencies were used. Forty-three male patients with PDH were diagnosed in the study period, with a median age of 33 years (IQR: 29–38 years) and a median CD₄ lymphocytes count of 39cells/mm³ (IQR: 20–83 cells/mm³). Eighty six percent of the patients were born or had travelled to the jungle, 58.1% were alcohol users and 16.1% had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. When compared to histopathology, the culture had a better sensitivity to achieve a diagnosis (p<0.05). Peruvian patients with PDH and HIV infection were mainly young male adults that were born or had travelled to the jungle, with a CD₄ count below 100cells/mm³. In patients with the described characteristics it would be advisable to check for PDH. Implementing rapid diagnostic tests is also necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aalcohols 3aendemic diseases 3ahistopathology 3ahistoplasmosis 3ahospitals 3amales 3aretrospective studies 3astatistical analysis 3atuberculosis 3aLatin America1 aBustamante, Beatriz0 tRevista iberoamericana de micología.g2022 Jan.,  Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.25-27dElsevier España, S.L.U.wJournal:12421x1130-14067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riam.2021.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04199naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010400179520264300283592002802926650001302954650001602967650000902983650002802992650001403020650001603034650002703050650001903077650001503096650001103111650001803122650001103140650000703151650000903158650002803167650001603195651001103211653002203222653002803244653002303272653001403295700003403309700004503343700002103388700007403409773011903483856008203602852000903684655001203693IND60763164220221117014048.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076316422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1007242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunqueira, Tassiane Pereira10aHydrochemical and age constraints of the Chapada dos Veadeiros geothermal reservoir, central Brazil  aThis paper reports the first conceptual model of non-magmatic system in central Brazil, constrained by structural, hydrochemical and isotopic data. The study involved analyses of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes (¹⁴C,¹⁸O, ²H and ³H) in addition to the chemical signatures of water samples from natural springs and borehole. Samples were classified into three hydrochemical groups, based on their pH, electric conductivity (EC) and temperature. Group 1 shows the lowest temperature range and lowest pH and EC values (respectively averages of 27 °C, 5.0, and 15 μS/cm); Group 3 shows higher temperature, pH, EC (42 °C, 7.1, and 215 μS/cm); and Group 2 shows intermediate values (average of 38 °C, 6.2 and 80 μS/cm). The conceptual flow model indicates that the recharge area is located in the higher plateau areas and the only recharge source is rainwater. The groundwater flows towards the southwest for 15–25 km up to the São Joaquim fault system, where the hydraulic conductivity contrast, due to different rock types, induces upward flow to the hot springs area. Buoyancy due to heating through deep circulation can also influence the upward flow, however, it is not the main process. The flow path from NE to SW is controlled by secondary brittle structures, related to fractures represented by long lineaments. Environmental radioisotopes of water (³H and ¹⁴C) were used to determine the residence time of thermal waters. ³H data indicate that samples MV2 and TOC1 (respectively from groups 2 and 3), are related entirely to the deep thermal reservoir, with no mixing influence between reservoirs. Samples SJ1 and CH3 show ³H values from 0.9 to 0.64 TU, indicating mixture of water from recent cold waters and the deep thermal reservoir. Group 3 samples yielded a raw ¹⁴C age of 9270 years, and the most coherent correction model applied was the International Atomic Energy Agency, resulting in an age of 7877 years. Group 2 yielded age of 2280 years and the most consistent correction model applied was the Pearson equation, ensuing an age of 2281 years. Group 1 samples resulted in negative age, interpreted as contamination from external carbon sources likely related to algae. Sample SJ1 (from a deep well) yielded an age of 1,470, and the correction by the Pearson model resulted in age of 1352 years. The δ²H and δ¹⁸O data are plotted above the local meteoric water line, indicating enrichment of lighter isotopes. The values measured for the total dissolved solids; electric conductivity and pH are in agreement with the isotopic data interpretations, and with the aquifer mineralogy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abrittleness 3acold 3aelectrical conductivity 3aequations 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrochemistry 3amineralogy 3amodels 3anuclear power 3aoxygen 3apH 3arain 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3aBrazil 0aHeating mechanism 0aGroundwater flow system 0aGroundwater dating 0aAmagmatic1 aGuimarães Campos, José Eloi1 aMartins-Ferreira, Marco Antonio Caçador1 aGarnier, Jeremie1 aFreitas-Silva, Flavio Henrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6757-77070 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2022 May, v. 17 p.100724-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2022.1007243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009200166300001400258520094600272592002801218650001501246650001401261650001101275650002401286650002401310650001401334650001601348650001601364650001601380653002401396653002101420653001601441653002701457700001801484700001801502700001701520700001701537700001901554773012101573856008201694852000901776655001201785IND60599846920221120075651.0180702e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiqiang, Zhao10aTemperature rise and weight loss characteristics of wheat straw under microwave heating  ap. 59-66.  aThe temperature rise and weight loss characteristics of wheat straw and their mixture under microwave irradiation have been investigated in the laboratory with a fixed bed microwave reactor. The influences of both the microwave power and the additives on the temperature rise and weight loss characteristics of wheat straw are the focuses of this work, which aims to explore a new theoretical foundation for advanced pyrolysis methods. The temperature rise curves show that pure wheat straw had a weak capability to absorb microwave energy, while the mixture of wheat straw and pyrolytic residue had a very strong absorption capability. The ability to absorb microwave energy of the mixture increased with increasing amount of pyrolytic residue. These results are in good agreement with the results of the weight loss curves. Thus, it is feasible to pyrolyze wheat straw in microwave fields by addition of small amounts of pyrolytic residue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadditives 3aenergy 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3aweight loss 3awheat straw 0aMicrowave pyrolysis 0aTemperature rise 0aWeight loss 0aHeat and mass transfer1 aWenlong, Wang1 aHongzhen, Liu1 aYanpeng, Mao1 aChunyuan, Ma1 aZhanlong, Song0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 May, v. 107 p.59-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012200162300001600284500001900300520099900319592002801318596004501346596004401391650001601435650002301451650002801474650002601502650001701528650001801545650001301563650002801576650002101604650001101625650001301636650001301649700002001662700001701682700005701699773016201756856008201918852000902000655001202009IND60696375020221121064117.0200523e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069637502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-020-02277-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Suhui10aFine-tuning the regulation of Cas9 expression levels for efficient CRISPR-Cas9 mediated recombination in Streptomyces  ap. 413-423.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCRISPR-Cas9 has proven as a very powerful gene editing tool for Actinomyces, allowing scarless and precise genome editing in selected strains of these biotechnologically relevant microorganisms. However, its general application in actinomycetes has been limited due to its inefficacy when applying the system in an untested strain. Here, we provide evidence of how Cas9 levels are toxic for the model actinomycetes Streptomyces coelicolor M145 and Streptomyces lividans TK24, which show delayed or absence of growth. We overcame this toxicity by lowering Cas9 levels and have generated a set of plasmids in which Cas9 expression is either controlled by theophylline-inducible or constitutive promoters. We validated the targeting of these CRISPR-Cas9 system using the glycerol uptake operon and the actinorhodin biosynthesis gene cluster. Our results highlight the importance of adjusting Cas9 expression levels specifically in strains to gain optimum and efficient gene editing in Actinomyces.  aPublisher supplied data  a720793cHorizon 2020 Framework Programme  aAI144967cNational Institutes of Health 3aActinomyces 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aStreptomyces lividans 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3aglycerol 3aindustrial microbiology 3amultigene family 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3atoxicity1 aEnghiad, Behnam1 aZhao, Huimin1 aTakano, Eriko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6791-32560 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2020 May, v. 47, no. 4-5 p.413-423dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl54684x1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-020-02277-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012500164300001400289520133400303592002801637650002001665650001501685650003101700650002201731650001901753650002001772650002401792650001801816650001601834650001101850650000901861650002201870650000901892650001201901653003101913653004001944653003001984653001502014700002002029773010702049856008002156852000902236655001202245IND60598403320221121070936.0180629e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059840332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagai, Chiaki10aDirect chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for atrial natriuretic peptide in mammalian plasma using a PEGylated antibody  ap. 10-16.  aAtrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a peptide hormone that is synthesized and secreted by cardiac tissues and plays a pivotal role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Clinically, ANP is used as a marker of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure. Although multiple ANP assays are currently available, a more sensitive assay is required for the direct measurement of plasma ANP where there is limited plasma availability, especially in mouse experiments. In the current study, we developed a plate-based sandwich chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of plasma ANP in rats and mice without the need for prior extraction. To minimize nonspecific binding, we performed a single-step PEGylation procedure targeting the immobilized antibody, which markedly improved the assay’s sensitivity and linearity. The linear range was 0.1 to 250pM, and the minimum detection limit was 0.13pM, 5-fold lower than the lowest value of the commercially available kits. ANP was directly measured in plasma samples without detectable cross-reactivity with B- and C-type natriuretic peptides. The accuracy of the assay was confirmed by spike recovery tests and dilution tests and by comparison with a conventional radioimmunoassay. Based on the species cross-reactivity, this assay can be used to measure human ANP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical kits 3aantibodies 3aatrial natriuretic peptide 3achemiluminescence 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aheart failure 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3amice 3aradioimmunoassays 3arats 3atissues 0aAtrial natriuretic peptide 0aChemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay 0aDirect plasma measurement 0aPEGylation1 aMinamino, Naoto0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 461 p.10-16dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013600173300001600309520110100325592002801426650002001454650001401474650003501488650002501523650001301548650001101561650001901572650002301591650001601614650002201630650003401652650003001686650001201716650001301728650002001741650001601761651001401777653004101791653003001832653001601862653003101878653002301909653002201932700002801954700002101982700001802003773011602021856008802137852000902225655001202234IND60088591420221121064919.0190318e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008859142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenzies, Robert10aBaseline occurrence of organochlorine pesticides and other xenobiotics in the marine environment: Caribbean and Pacific collections  ap. 289-295.  aThis ongoing survey reports the levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in sea surface slicks collected on a global circumnavigation. Hydrophobic xenobiotic compounds such as POPs are known to accumulate on the sea surface in slicks at concentrations many fold greater than the underlying water column, raising concerns about the ecological impacts due to the high biological activity associated with this zone. Six different categories of POPs were reported: chlorobenzenes, hexachlorocyclohexanes, chlordane related compounds, organochlorine pesticides and other cyclodiene pesticides, DDTs and metabolites, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Concentrations ranged from <1ngL−1 to 18.45μgL−1. Ranking analysis indicates an independence of detected concentrations for each class of compounds and their geographical locations. Although concentrations observed were normally low and below commonly accepted toxic levels to animals and humans, they fall within the effective range of concentrations of many hormones and neurotransmitters, thus could potentially act as endocrine disrupters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3achlordane 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental impact 3ahormones 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amarine environment 3ametabolites 3aneurotransmitters 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3axenobiotics 3aCaribbean 0aPersistent organic pollutants (POPs) 0aOrganochlorine pesticides 0aXenobiotics 0aEndocrine disrupters (EDs) 0aMarine environment 0aSea surface slick1 aSoares Quinete, Natalia1 aGardinali, Piero1 aSeba, Douglas0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2013 May 15, v. 70, no. 1-2 p.289-295dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2013.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245004900207300001600256506007600272520057700348592002800925506003700953650001000990650002101000650002601021650002301047650003101070650002801101650001901129650001701148773009101165856004801256852000901304655001201313IND4480904820221207144916.0120323e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448090482DNAL7 a224344442pmid7 aPMC33577672pmcid7 a10.1007/s13280-012-0272-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagfeldt, Anders10aBrief Overview of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells  ap. 151-155.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) are based on molecular and nanometer-scale components.

We evaluated associations of lifetime lactation history with serum concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2006, and examined whether potentially diabetogenic POPs account for associations between lactation and diabetes.Among 4479 parous women, breastfeeding history was defined as the number of children breastfed ≥1 month. Diabetes was identified by self-report or hemoglobin A1c >6.5%. Twenty-four POPs were measured in serum among subsamples of 668 to 1073 participants.Compared with women without lactation history, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of having diabetes among those with 1–2 and ≥3 lactation periods were 0.83(0.61, 1.13) and 0.63(0.44, 0.91; P trend=0.03). Lifetime lactation history was inversely associated with serum concentrations of 17 out of the 24 organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs), and perfluoroalkyl substances (Ptrend<0.05). Comparing the ≥3 lactations group with women without a lactation history, the relative reduction of POPs ranged from 12% (PCB-196) to 30% (oxychlordane). The inverse association between lactation and diabetes was slightly attenuated after adjustment for POPs. Age-stratified analyses showed that the inverse association between lactation periods and serum POP concentrations was observed primarily among participants <60 years, whereas age did not significantly modify the association between lactation history and diabetes prevalence.Crudely-classified lifetime lactation history was inversely associated with concurrent serum POP concentrations and diabetes prevalence. Prospective studies are needed to clarify how lactation could complement diabetes prevention through decreasing the POP body burdens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3ablood serum 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3adiabetes 3aexcretion 3aglycohemoglobin 3alactation 3aodds ratio 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3aperfluorocarbons 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aprospective studies 3arisk 3awomen 0aPOP 0aOCP 0aPCDD 0aPCDF 0aPFAS 0aPCB 0aNHANES 0ap,p′-DDE 0aβ-HCH 0a1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD 0a1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD 0a1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-OCDD 0a1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF 0aPFOA 0aPFOS 0aPFHS 0aPFNA 0aHbA1c 0aLactation 0aPersistent organic pollutant 0aDiabetes1 aGrandjean, Philippe1 aWang, Xiaobin1 aSun, Qi0 tEnvironmental research.g2016 Oct., v. 150 p.282-288dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2016.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002100168245013400189300001600323520194400339592002802283650002402311650001302335650001502348650001602363650002302379650001202402650002602414650001202440650001602452650001102468650001502479650001502494650001302509650001202522650002002534650003102554650003702585650003902622650003402661650001702695650002802712650002302740650002402763650001302787650003502800650003002835650001402865700002502879773009502904856008502999852000903084655001203093IND4446544420221120164529.0141110e20110117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444654442DNAL7 a209800662pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Karina10aAssessing combined toxicity of estrogen receptor agonists in a primary culture of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes  ap. 186-195.  aThe presence of highly complex mixtures of chemicals in the environment challenges our ability to assess single chemical effects and the interaction that occurs with cellular receptor targets and regulation of endocrine processes. In this study concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) prediction models were used to assess the combined toxicity of mixtures of environmental relevant estrogen receptor (ER) agonists (hormones and anthropogenic pollutants) in a primary culture of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes using the ER-mediated production of vitellogenin (Vtg) as a biological marker (biomarker) for estrogenicity. Nine of the eleven tested chemicals induced the production of Vtg and the parameters from the fitted concentration–response curves were used to model four mixtures containing four (17β-estradiol, estrone, estriol and diethylstilbestrol), five (musk ketone, 4-tert-octylphenol, bisphenol A, o,p′-DDT and dibenzothiophene), seven (17β-estradiol, estrone, estriol, diethylstilbestrol, 4-tert-octylphenol, bisphenol A and o,p′-DDT) and nine compounds (17β-estradiol, estrone, estriol, diethylstilbestrol, musk ketone, 4-tert-octylphenol, bisphenol A, o,p′-DDT and dibenzothiophene). The CA and IA prediction model proved to be a good estimation for the combined effect of mixtures of ER agonists at low relative mixture concentration (e.g. relative to the maximum mixture concentrations used), but a deviation from the prediction models was observed when exposing hepatocytes to high relative mixture concentrations. The CA and IA prediction models’ ability to predict the combined estrogenic effect of complex mixtures, especially in the low concentration–response range, is of ecological relevance since organisms in the environment generally encounter low concentrations of chemicals from a wide array of chemical groups that may not elicit estrogenic effects on their own.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aagonists 3abiomarkers 3abisphenol A 3adiethylstilbestrol 3aestriol 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrone 3ahepatocytes 3amodels 3apollutants 3aprediction 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aComplex Mixturesxtoxicity 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aEstradiol Congenersxtoxicity 2aFluoresceins 2aHepatocytesxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aOncorhynchus mykiss 2aOxazines 2aReceptors, Estrogenxagonists. 2aVitellogeninsxmetabolism 2aXanthenes1 aTollefsen, Knut Erik0 tAquatic toxicology.g2011 Jan. 17, v. 101, no. 1 p.186-195dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144242011500164245009100279300001200370500001500382520128200397592002801679650001301707650002501720650001701745650003401762650001501796650001001811650002601821650002001847650002601867650001001893650001001903650001601913650002101929651001101950653001501961700002101976773009901997856007802096852000902174655001202183IND60132728920221119012721.0150511e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013272892DNAL7 a10.1051/forest/20080892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanton, Sharon10aCombustible et conditions stationnelles dans un paysage forestier isolé et non géré du centre de l’Oregon10aFuel and stand conditions in an isolated, unmanaged forest landscape in central Oregon  ap. 207.  a2019-12-04  a• Mature, unmanaged forests in western North America provide important reference conditions for managers, yet little is known about fuel composition and the factors that influence fuel accumulation in such stands. Our objectives were to characterize fuels in a passively managed landscape of dry forests in central Oregon and identify environmental factors influencing fuel accumulation. • Ordination techniques and analysis of variance revealed no statistical differences in total fuel loads across a wide range of environmental conditions. • Individual fuel size classes, however, did vary by stand location and composition. Interior stands had more 1- to 100-h fuels and snags than stands at or near the edge, stands dominated by ponderosa pine had fewer small-diameter fuels and snags, lodgepole pine stands had more 1-h fuels and snags, and white fir stands had more 10-h fuels, duff, and snag basal area. • Tree species, density and age, and years since last fire were the most important environmental variables, explaining 23% of the variation in fuels. • Our results present further evidence that fuel composition is highly variable at many spatial and temporal scales. They also provide useful baseline information for managers of fire-prone western forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanagers 3aanalysis of variance 3afuel loading 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3alandscapes 3asnags 3aordination techniques 3aPinus ponderosa 3aenvironmental factors 3afuels 3atrees 3adry forests 3astand basal area 3aOregon 0abasal area1 aArabas, Karen B.0 tAnnals of forest science.g2009 Jan., v. 66, no. 2 p.207-207dSpringer-Verlagx1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest/20080893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008600165520210300251592002802354650002502382650001502407650001802422650001602440650001902456650001702475650001102492650002502503650002202528650001302550650001002563650001202573650001602585653001802601653002602619653002302645653001302668653002102681653002102702700001602723700001802739700001802757700002602775700001602801773019302817856008203010852000903092655001203101IND60760324620221119134709.0220214e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076032462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apr.2021.1013012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, João,10aInfluence of indoor air quality on sleep quality of university students in Lisbon  aSleep is a crucial aspect of the human daily life since it allows us to recover from physical and psychological fatigue and its lack can bring several consequences to human health. People spend around one third of their life sleeping but, despite that, their exposure to pollutants during sleep is often neglected. Specifically, students typically change their habits after entering university, due to the freedom that they are allowed at this stage of their lives. These habits often include their sleep patterns, which not only affects their health, but their academic performance as well. This study aimed to assess the indoor air quality (IAQ) that university students are exposed to in their sleeping environment and how it affects their sleep quality. Firstly, an online survey, based in standardized questionnaires, was conducted to a sample of 1040 individuals to characterize sleep habits and, ultimately, to provide an overview of the sleep quality of the Portuguese population. Students were one of the population groups that showed worse results: only 31% had good sleep quality and only 62% showed good sleep health. Afterwards, a study to assess sleep quality (by actigraphy and standardized questionnaires) and IAQ (by a monitoring unit based in low-cost sensors) during the sleeping period of two consecutive nights of 13 students in Lisbon university dorms was conducted. Mean levels of CO₂ and VOCs above the established legislation were found during sleep, indicating that ventilation conditions were not sufficient to keep an acceptable IAQ. Temperature was also out of the acceptable comfort range during 44% of the sleeping time. The perceived sleep quality of students was found to be negatively associated with the number of awakenings and the mean levels of carbon dioxide and relative humidity during the sleeping period. These results confirm previous findings where some IAQ parameters may influence the sleep quality of the individuals, highlighting the importance to focus on the IAQ of sleeping environments as a strategy to improve sleep quality of individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3aactigraphy 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon dioxide 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alaws and regulations 3arelative humidity 3aresearch 3asleep 3asurveys 3atemperature 0aSleep quality 0aSleeping environments 0aIndoor air quality 0aStudents 0aLow-cost sensors 0aUniversity dorms1 aBelo, Joana1 aSilva, Dario,1 aDiogo, Carlos1 aAlmeida, Susana Marta1 aCanha, Nuno0 tAtmospheric pollution research journal.g2022 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.101301-dElsevier B.V.aTurkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and ControlwJournal:23231x1309-10427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2021.1013013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245014100198300001800339500002000357520138400377592002801761596013101789650001601920650002101936650002201957650001601979650001301995650000902008650001502017650000902032650002002041650001402061650001502075650001502090650001402105650000902119650001602128700006802144700006402212700007102276700007902347700006802426700006102494773015202555856007402707852000902781655001202790IND60756120420221121093055.0211111e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075612042DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.135352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasetta, Jaísa1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9994-077X10aExpression of the PEPT1, CAT, SOD2 and GPX1 genes in the zebrafish intestine supplemented with methionine dipeptide under predation risk  ap. 1214-1225.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study evaluated the effect of methionine supplementation, predation risk and their interaction on gut histology, whole‐body cortisol levels, and intestinal gene expression in zebrafish. A total of 360 one‐year‐old animals were maintained under two environmental conditions and fed diets containing different methionine sources. Fish were fed either a control diet (CTL, without methionine supplementation), a diet supplemented with dl‐methionine (DLM), or a diet supplemented with methionine dipeptide (MM) in the absence (AP) of a predator or in the presence of the predator (PP) for 48 h or 20 days. Predator‐induced stress for 20 days resulted in lower body weight. Zebrafish fed methionine‐supplemented diets had higher weight gain than control fish. We found no effect of predation stress or methionine supplementation on cortisol level. Predation risk and methionine supplementation showed no interaction effect on dipeptide transporter gene expression. After 48 h of predation pressure, zebrafish had higher mRNA expression of SOD2, CAT and GPX1 in the gut. After 20 days of exposure to the predator, zebrafish fed methionine‐supplemented diets had lower expression of GPX1, SOD2 and CAT than those diet CTL. Methionine dipeptide and free methionine supplementation improved growth, intestinal health and survivability of zebrafish both conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a422648 / 2018‐3cThis research was funded by the National Council of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq), Brazil 3aDanio rerio 3aanimal nutrition 3aanimal physiology 3abody weight 3acortisol 3adiet 3adipeptides 3afish 3agene expression 3ahistology 3aintestines 3amethionine 3apredation 3arisk 3aweight gain1 aRibeiro, Ricardo Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7752-36921 aLewandowski, Vanessa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4946-58051 aKhatlab, Angélica de Souza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4823-43271 ade Oliveira Neto, Adhemar Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4093-89521 aBoscolo, Wilson Rogério1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1808-05181 aGasparino, Eliane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2611-92590 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2021 Nov., v. 105, no. 6 p.1214-1225dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.135353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245009000178300001600268520129400284592002801578650002601606650001701632650001001649650002801659650002501687650004301712650001901755650002201774650001401796650000901810650002401819650001201843650001701855700003001872700003101902700002901933700002601962773009001988856008402078852000902162655001202171IND60083908620221120043449.0141101e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrepsky, Patricia Baier10aChemical composition and vasodilatation induced by Cuphea carthagenensis preparations  ap. 953-957.  aThe aerial parts of Cuphea carthagenensis (Jacq.) J.F. Macbride (Lythraceae) are traditionally employed in Brazil to treat cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to compare preparations of C. carthagenensis aerial parts (aqueous and ethanol extracts, together with derived fractions) with regard to their total phenolic contents and in vitro vasodilating activity. The main flavonoids found in the extracts were isolated and identified as quercetin derivatives. The extracts and fractions showed similar HPLC profiles with the presence of quercetin-5-O-β-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside and quercetin-3-sulfate in all of them, but marked differences in the contents of flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, tannis and total phenolics. Excepting the aqueous extract, all assayed preparations elicited vasodilatation on pre-contracted rat aortic rings in the range of pIC₅₀ 4.53±0.03 to 4.98±0.06. Polynomial regression analysis demonstrated the relationship between vasodilating activity and the contents of flavonoids (r²=0.5190), proanthocyanidins (r²=0.8016), tannins (r²=0.8041) and total phenolics (r²=0.6226), suggesting the participation of these compounds in the pharmacological effect and their potential use as chemical markers for the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuphea carthagenensis 3aaerial parts 3aaorta 3acardiovascular diseases 3achemical composition 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aplant extracts 3aproanthocyanidins 3aquercetin 3arats 3aregression analysis 3atannins 3avasodilation1 aIsidório, Raquel Geralda1 ade Souza Filho, José Dias1 aCôrtes, Steyner França1 aBraga, Fernão Castro0 tPhytomedicine.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 19, no. 11 p.953-957dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008400208300001400292520132800306592002801634650002101662650001301683650001401696650001201710650001201722650001101734650001601745650001801761650001601779650002101795650001001816650001301826650001201839650002201851650001801873650001401891650001301905650001401918650001001932650001601942650002101958653001201979653002301991653001402014653001502028653001202043700006202055700002302117773012102140856008202261852000902343655001202352IND60599847120221121011527.0180702e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059984712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2014.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinhal, Jonas O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7152-149310aAnalytical pyrolysis of the kernel and oil of babassu palm (Orbignya phalerata)  ap. 73-81.  aBabassu palm has a great economic importance. The kernel oil can be used as fuel in production of biodiesel, and in food and cosmetics industry. The kernel cake is used generally like food supplement for animals and organic fertilizer. Analytical pyrolysis (Py–GC/MS) was used in this work to characterize babassu palm oil and kernel. In first steep, the pyrolysis temperature was optimized and detailed descriptions of the pyrolysis compounds released after pyrolysis at 650°C is reported. The products identified from the oil pyrolyzed at 650°C included alkanes, alkenes, cyclic ketones, aldehydes, esters and carboxylic acids. These compounds were produced by the pyrolysis of free fatty acids and triglycerides. The products identified from the pyrolysis of the kernel included alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, esters, carboxylic acids and amides, which were derived from the fatty acids and triglycerides that were present in the oil, as well as the carbohydrates and proteins present in the kernel cake. Analytical pyrolysis has several advantages, such as speed and simplicity, for identification of organic compounds, like observed in this work. However, this technique proved effective to obtain a lipid profile by analysis of babassu oil and kernel together with other data previously reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAttalea speciosa 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalkanes 3aalkenes 3aamides 3ababassu oil 3acarbohydrates 3afatty acids 3afree fatty acids 3afuels 3aindustry 3aketones 3alipid composition 3aoilseed cakes 3apalm oils 3aproteins 3apyrolysis 3aseeds 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 0aBabassu 0aOrbygnia phalerata 0aPyrolysis 0aPy–GC/MS 0aBiomass1 aLima, Cláudio F.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4591-67871 aBarbosa, Luiz C.A.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2014 May, v. 107 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2014.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015600172300001600328520161400344592002801958650002501986650002502011650002902036650001602065650001302081650002702094650001402121650001602135650001402151650001302165650001002178650003002188650002102218650001202239650001202251650000902263650001302272650001302285650001602298650001902314650003102333650001202364700001602376700002302392700001602415773009002431856008402521852000902605655001202614IND60083908720221123043528.0141101e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatiroglu, Turkan14aThe efficacy of Pelargonium sidoides in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in children with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy  ap. 958-961.  aTransient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI), defined as prolongation of physiological hypogammaglobulinemia normally seen between the initial 3rd and 6th months of life, is one of the most common immune deficiencies of childhood. Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) are rather common in this group of patients, and generally, antibiotic treatment is the usual choice, although viruses involved in most cases. Pelargonium sidoides extract a herbal drug with known immunmodulator, antiviral and antibacterial effects. In this randomized, placebo controlled, prospective, monocentric pilot study, 14 of 28 patients with a diagnosed THI, were given Pelargonium sidoides, while 14 were given placebo during the period of URTI. Before and after the treatment period of one week, complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated prothromboplastin time, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, total and direct bilirubin levels were measured. Mothers were asked to fill in a questionnaire for the recovery of the clinical symptoms during the treatment. The results were evaluated and compared in both group to assess the effect of Pelargonium sidoides. As a conclusion, the Pelargonium sidoides group showed increased appetite. The Pelargonium sidoides were found to beneficial for the nasal congestion, recovery of daily and nocturnal cough but not found be significant.

The objective of this report was to perform preliminary serological survey of hospitalized population for LB. Methods: Sera were collected from 203 patients of a hospital located in Western Ukraine. Most patients showed clinical signs that were compatible with LB such as arthritis (n = 29), neurological signs (n = 35), and erythema migrans (EM)-like lesions (n = 60) or unrelated to LB (n = 79). The specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot for anti-Borrelia antibodies. Results: LB was confirmed in 8.6%, 34.5%, and 50% of the patients, who exhibited neurological signs, arthritis, or EM-like lesions, respectively. Anti-Borrelia antibodies were also detected in 6.3% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Conclusions: This study provides the first preliminary data on the seroprevalence of LB in Ukraine. Future studies are warranted to investigate more subsets of the Ukrainian population for this emerging tick-borne disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLyme disease 3aWestern blotting 3aarthritis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aerythema 3ahospitals 3amonitoring 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3atuberculosis 3aUkraine 0aBorrelia burgdorferi 0aserological assay 0aELISA 0aWestern blot 0asurvey1 aAndreychyn, Mykhailo1 aKorda, Mykhailo1 aPokryshko, Olena1 aHumenna, Roksolana1 aHuk, Mariana1 aLiu, Shuling1 aRogovskyy, Artem S.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 21, no. 4 p.301-303dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2020.27153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011500169300001400284520117900298592002801477650002501505650001601530650001901546650002801565650001101593650000901604650001501613650004301628650005201671650002601723653003001749653002801779653001901807653000901826653001101835700002601846700002401872700001701896700001801913700001901931700002301950700002801973700001902001700001702020700002302037700002202060700002202082700002002104773010702124856008002231852000902311655001202320IND60598403720221121110100.0180629e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059840372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2014.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheerlinck, Ellen10aDetailed method description for noninvasive monitoring of differentiation status of human embryonic stem cells  ap. 60-66.  aThe (non)differentiation status of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is usually analyzed by determination of key pluripotency defining markers (e.g., OCT4, Nanog, SOX2) by means of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR), flow cytometry (FC), and immunostaining. Despite proven usefulness of these techniques, their destructive nature makes it impossible to follow up on the same hESC colonies for several days, leading to a loss of information. In 2003, an OCT4–eGFP knock-in hESC line to monitor OCT4 expression was developed and commercialized. However, to the best of our knowledge, the use of fluorescence microscopy (FM) for monitoring the OCT4–eGFP expression of these cells without sacrificing them has not been described to date. Here, we describe such a method in detail, emphasizing both its resolving power and its complementary nature to FC as well as the potential pitfalls in standardizing the output of the FM measurements. The potential of the method is demonstrated by comparison of hESCs cultured in several conditions, both feeder free (vitronectin, VN) and grown on feeder cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aembryonic stem cells 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahumans 3amice 3amonitoring 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 0aOCT4–eGFP knock-in hESC 0aFluorescence microscopy 0aFlow cytometry 0aOCT4 0aMEF CM1 aVan Steendam, Katleen1 aVandewoestyne, Mado1 aLepez, Trees1 aGobin, Veerle1 aMeert, Paulien1 aVossaert, Liesbeth1 aVan Nieuwerburgh, Filip1 aSoom, Ann van,1 aPeelman, Luc1 aHeindryckx, Björn1 aSutter, Petra de,1 aDhaenens, Maarten1 aDeforce, Dieter0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 461 p.60-66dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2014.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245015100210300001600361520133200377592002801709650001101737650002101748650002401769653002001793653002901813653002101842653006001863700003101923773009001954856008502044852000902129655001202138IND60566474320221119165757.0180912e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056647432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenkuhn, Mathias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9973-310512aA decomposition method for the evaluation of component interactions in energy conversion systems for application to advanced exergy-based analyses  ap. 388-403.  aA new approach for the calculation of the interactions among the components of a thermal system for application to the concept of advanced exergy-based analysis is presented. The approach can be used to determine the thermodynamic interactions of system components, and to evaluate alternative designs. The new approach puts the calculation of endogenous and exogenous exergy destruction on a proper thermodynamic basis and introduces a straightforward and time-saving calculation procedure in contrast to various approaches used in the past. When employed to the analysis of the CGAM-problem, the new approach complies with qualitative reasoning, resolves the shortcomings and shows comparable results with previous approaches. The top-down hierarchical approach assists in achieving the best system design possible by identifying the effects of design decisions and by stimulating the engineer's creativity in terms of design alternatives and optimization options. Furthermore, the generalization of the approach allows for any level of aggregation, thus, making the determination of improvement potentials easier. By providing profound thermodynamic understanding for processes, the advanced exergy-based analysis is a promising tool for designing, analyzing and optimizing processes for higher efficiencies and lower costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexergy 3asystems analysis 3asystems engineering 0aExergy analysis 0aAdvanced exergy analysis 0aProcess analysis 0aThermodynamic interactions in energy conversion systems1 aTsatsaronis, G.q(George),0 tEnergy.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 133 p.388-403dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009300167300001800260520130400278592002801582650001901610650001801629650001601647650002001663650001501683650002401698650002201722650001501744650001901759650001301778650002101791650000901812650001401821650002501835700001601860700001801876700001701894700001601911773009301927856008402020852000902104655001202113IND60083908920221120043457.0141101e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008390892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2012.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMannucci, C.10aSerotonin involvement in Rhodiola rosea attenuation of nicotine withdrawal signs in rats  ap. 1117-1124.  aRhodiola rosea has been used for centuries in the traditional medicine to stimulate nervous system, to enhance physical and mental performance and to treat fatigue. It is known that administration of Rhodiola rosea extract elicits antidepressant activity, but the mechanism of action still remains unclear. Evidence from animal models and human studies show that nicotine reduces symptoms of depression and that nicotine cessation induces depressive-like symptoms. We investigated the effects of Rhodiola rosea on nicotine withdrawal signs. Nicotine dependence was induced by subcutaneous nicotine injection (2mg/kg, four times daily) for 14 days. Another group of animals treated with nicotine (for 14 days) and successively with Rhodiola rosea extract was co-administered with selective 5-HT receptorial antagonist WAY 100635 (1mg/kg). After nicotine withdrawal animals were evaluated for behavioural parameters (locomotor activity, abstinence signs, marble burying test), diencephalic serotonin metabolism and serotonin receptor-1A expression. Results show a significant increase of 5-HT content in N treated with R. rosea, with a significant increase of serotonin receptor 1A, suggesting an involvement of serotonin in beneficial effects of R. rosea on suffering produced by nicotine withdrawal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodiola rosea 3aanimal models 3aantagonists 3aantidepressants 3alocomotion 3amechanism of action 3amental depression 3ametabolism 3anervous system 3anicotine 3anitrogen content 3arats 3aserotonin 3atraditional medicine1 aNavarra, M.1 aCalzavara, E.1 aCaputi, A.P.1 aCalapai, G.0 tPhytomedicine.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 19, no. 12 p.1117-1124dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2012.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011300168300001600281500001900297520201600316592002802332596007902360596007902439596007802518650001602596650001902612650001702631650000902648650000902657650002002666650002502686650002802711650000902739650002102748650002102769650001902790650002402809650001702833650001202850650001202862650001902874650002102893650001002914700001902924700001502943700005502958700001703013773013303030856008203163852000903245655001203254IND60696375620221121064112.0200523e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069637562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-020-10063-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xianfeng10aPoor physical structural components restrict soil fertility and crop productivity for wheat–maize cropping  ap. 169-184.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aImproving poor physical structural components has been gaining increasing recognition for its role in enhancing soil fertility. This study was conducted to identify the key physical structural barriers for soil fertility and their effects on crop productivity in Aquic Inceptisol. Based on the strip sampling in Fengqiu County, arable soils from 0–0.40 m profile pits were collected to determine the physical structural components including plough layer thickness, textural composition, soil aggregation and bulk density, as well as stocks of soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The grain yields of wheat and maize and amounts of fertilizer applications were also investigated. The tested soil was dominated by a plough layer of 0.15–0.18 m and sandy loam texture, which constituted 50% and 59%, respectively, of the studied profile pits. Compared to the soil with < 0.15 m plough layer, the bulk density was 4–11% lower in the plough layer and 4–12% lower in subsoil with increasing the thickness of plough layer. The soil with ≥ 0.15 m plough layer had over 21-fold macroaggregation at the expense of microaggregation, whereas the high content of sand particle in soil restrained macroaggregation. Increasing the plough layer thickness averagely improved the stocks by 176% in SOM, 153% in TN and 59% in TP at the 0–0.40 m depth. Soil macroaggregation was also significantly positively correlated with these nutrient accumulations. The factor analysis revealed that soil fertility was significantly influenced by the plough layer thickness and soil texture. The soil with 0.20–0.25 m plough layer and loam clay texture displayed the highest integrated fertility index and consequently, was beneficial to increasing the grain yields of wheat and maize and nutrient use efficiency from applied N fertilizer in the study area. These results would be informative to improve soil fertility and then crop productivity during a long-term cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0200304cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2018YFD0200601cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  aBE2017343-1cthe Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu Province 3aInceptisols 3aagroecosystems 3abulk density 3aclay 3acorn 3afactor analysis 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient use efficiency 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3asoil aggregation 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3asoil texture 3asubsoil 3atexture 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awheat1 aYang, Wenliang1 aXin, Xiuli1 aZhu, Anning1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3405-90541 aDing, Shijie0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2020 June, v. 117, no. 2 p.169-184dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl55283x1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-020-10063-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001600292520168600308592002801994650001602022650001102038650001202049650001002061650001002071650001802081650001402099650001402113650001202127650001202139650000902151650001802160650001302178773011002191856004802301852000902349655001202358IND50073879420221119043545.0140313e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007387942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-013-1670-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas, Bibiana10aStrange parental decisions: fathers of the dyeing poison frog deposit their tadpoles in pools occupied by large cannibals  ap. 551-559.  aParents may increase the probability of offspring survival by choosing suitable rearing sites where risks are as low as possible. Predation and competition are major selective pressures influencing the evolution of rearing site selection. Poison frogs look after their clutches and deposit the newly hatched tadpoles in bodies of water where they remain until metamorphosis. In some species, cannibalism occurs, so parents deposit their tadpoles singly in very small pools. However, cannibalism also occurs in species that deposit tadpoles in larger pools already occupied by heterospecific or conspecific larvae that could be either potential predators or competitors. Here, I test the hypothesis that, given the choice, males of Dendrobates tinctorius would deposit their newly hatched tadpoles in low-risk sites for their offspring. I characterised the pools used by D. tinctorius for tadpole deposition, conducted experiments to determine the larval traits that predict the occurrence of and latency to cannibalism, and tested whether parents deposit their tadpoles in low-risk pools. I found that (1) neither pool capacity nor the presence of other larvae predict the presence/absence or number of tadpoles; (2) cannibalism occurs often, and how quickly it occurs depends on the difference in size between the tadpoles involved; and (3) the likelihood of males depositing their tadpoles in occupied pools increases with the size of the resident tadpole. I suggest that predation/cannibalism is not the only factor that parents assess when choosing deposition sites, and that the presence of larger conspecifics may instead provide information about pool quality and stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acannibalism 3adyeing 3afathers 3afrogs 3amales 3ametamorphosis 3apredation 3apredators 3aprogeny 3arearing 3arisk 3asurface water 3atadpoles0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2014 Apr., v. 68, no. 4 p.551-559dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-013-1670-y  aDNAL 7aarticle05057naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013600162300001600298520249900314592002802813650002902841650002202870650002102892650002502913650001702938650001402955650002702969650001602996650002503012650001403037650001303051650001903064650002003083650002103103650001803124650003803142650002003180650002703200650001403227650001603241650002803257650001903285650001903304650001703323650002203340650001803362650001803380650001003398650002003408650002103428650001803449650000903467650001103476650002103487650002003508650004303528650005203571650001403623650002503637650002503662650003603687650003803723650003203761653001903793653002903812653002803841653002503869653002303894700001603917700001703933700001703950700001403967700001503981773011603996856008204112852000904194655001204203IND60564194420221121062108.0180830e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Biyu10aProtective effect of a polysaccharide from Anoectochilus roxburghii against carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury in mice  ap. 124-135.  aAnoectochilus roxburghii (Wall.) Lindl. is traditionally used for the treatment of various types of chronic and acute hepatitis in China. Considering that Anoectochilus roxburghii polysaccharide (ARPT) is the main constituent of Anoectochilus roxburghii, the present study was designed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of ARPT and its possible mechanism in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced mice.The hepatoprotective activity of ARPT (150, 300 and 500mg/kg) were investigated on CCl4-induced acute liver damage in mice. The activities of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) were determined in serum. The hepatic levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in liver homogenates. The levels of cytochrome P450 sub family 2E1 (CYP2E1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), KC (Murine IL-8 ortholog), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1), Bcl-2 and Bax were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The expressions of CYP2E1, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and caspase-3 were evaluated by western blot assays. The hepatic levels of TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-2 and TGF-β1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, histopathological observation and terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling assay (TUNEL) were carried out on the separated livers of mice.ARPT significantly decreased serum ALT and AST activities, hepatic MDA level, and markedly enhanced antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px) activities and GSH level in hepatic tissue, in a dose-dependent manner, when compared to the model group. Histopathological observation revealed the hepatoprotective effect of ARPT against the damage. Furthermore, ARPT remarkably inhibited CYP2E1 mRNA expression, decreased NF-κB p65 expression and therefore to prevent the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-2 and KC), suppressed TGF-β1 expression and hepatocytes apoptosis. Moreover, ARPT could prevent DNA fragmentation based on TUNEL assay results.These findings suggested that ARPT possessed hepatoprotective effect against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity in mice and the action might in part be through reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnoectochilus roxburghii 3aDNA fragmentation 3aWestern blotting 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acaspase-3 3acatalase 3achemokine CCL2 3achemokine CXCL2 3acytochrome P-450 3adose response 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatitis 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoprotective effect 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3amedicinal plants 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apolysaccharides 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aPolysaccharide 0aAnoectochilus roxburghii 0aHepatoprotective effect 0aCarbon tetrachloride 0aAcute liver injury1 aSu, Minghua1 aChen, Qingxi1 aChang, Qiang1 aWang, Wei1 aLi, Huihua0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 200 p.124-135dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02039naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005500173300001800228520099100246592002801237650001101265650001101276650000901287650001801296650001501314650001801329653001601347653001701363653001801380653002601398653002101424700002301445773011601468856008401584852000901668655001201677IND60121972420221118192532.0150324e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012197242DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2014.9553872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnar, Sezi Çevik,10aRisk Analysis of Wind Energy Investments in Turkey  ap. 1230-1245.  aWind energy is a reliable source for fulfilling energy demand. However, the wind power usage remains limited due to the investmental risks. Governments’ support on renewable energy compensates these risks partially. Traditional investment evaluation techniques that do not consider the compensations and risks associated with the wind energy investments are one of the main reasons for the limited usage of wind power. In this study a real option and Monte Carlo simulation–based methodology, which considers both risks and compensations associated with these investments, is proposed to evaluate wind energy investments. The model is applied to a wind turbine investment in Turkey in order to show the applicability of the proposed model. The results indicate that the option value created through wind energy investments due to the governmental compensations is very high; therefore the traditional investment techniques are not appropriate for evaluating wind energy investments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk analysis 3awind power 3awind turbines 0awind energy 0areal options 0arisk analysis 0ainvestment evaluation 0arenewable energy1 aKılavuz, Tuba Nur0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2015 July 4, v. 21, no. 5 p.1230-1245dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2014.9553873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009600165300001800261520176800279592002802047650001302075650001502088650002802103650001302131650001402144650001202158650000902170650001302179650001202192700001602204700001302220700001102233700001702244700001502261700002302276700003002299700001702329773009802346856008602444852000902530655001202539IND60577697020221119154548.0170810e20170207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057769702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b042652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Zhen,10aSurface Interaction of Water-in-Oil Emulsion Droplets with Interfacially Active Asphaltenes  ap. 1265-1274.  aAdsorption of interfacially active components at the water/oil interface plays critical roles in determining the properties and behaviors of emulsion droplets. In this study, the droplet probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique was applied, for the first time, to quantitatively study the interaction mechanism between water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion droplets with interfacially adsorbed asphaltenes. The behaviors and stability of W/O emulsion droplets were demonstrated to be significantly influenced by the asphaltene concentration of organic solution where the emulsions were aged, aging time, force load, contact time, and solvent type. Bare water droplets could readily coalesce with each other in oil (i.e., toluene), while interfacially adsorbed asphaltenes could sterically inhibit droplet coalescence and induce interfacial adhesion during separation of the water droplets. For low asphaltene concentration cases, the adhesion increased with increasing asphaltene concentration (≤100 mg/L), but it significantly decreased at relatively high asphaltene concentration (e.g., 500 mg/L). Experiments in Heptol (i.e., mixture of toluene and heptane) showed that the addition of a poor solvent for asphaltenes (e.g., heptane) could enhance the interfacial adhesion between emulsion droplets at relatively low asphaltene concentration but could weaken the adhesion at relatively high asphaltene concentration. This work has quantified the interactions between W/O emulsion droplets with interfacially adsorbed asphaltenes, and the results provide useful implications into the stabilization mechanisms of W/O emulsions in oil production. The methodology in this work can be readily extended to other W/O emulsion systems with interfacially active components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aheptane 3aoils 3asolvents 3atoluene1 aZhang, Ling1 aXie, Lei1 aLu, Xi1 aLiu, Qingxia1 aHe, Jiajun1 aMantilla, Cesar A.1 aVan den berg, Frans G.

Brazil is the third-largest producer of grains, and public policies should restrict the firewood drying method as of the year 2020. To solve this problem, a startup developed a technology to dries grains based on oxyhydrogen combustion, using only green energy and water. This study contemplates the assessment of farmers concerning perceived value attributes and willingness-to-pay of a Sustainable Product-Service System. This solution is a mix of tangible products and intangible services offered simultaneously to solve post-harvest problems. A large survey comprising 354 small, medium, and large farmers in the South region of Brazil was conducted to evaluate the value attributes allocated by farmers for their acceptance of a new technology of grain drying and quality preservation. In this survey, to assess farmers’ perceptions were applied offers based on three types of Product-Service System: options of purchasing equipment with corrective maintenance services (product-oriented Product-Service System), renting equipment with corrective and preventive maintenance services (use-oriented Product-Service System), and complementing services for the management of quality, information, drying and storage of grains (result-oriented Product-Service System). The survey results allowed the establishment of the attributes deemed necessary by farmers, who revealed preference towards the purchase offer (56.5%) over the rental offer (43.5%), emphasizing the inclusion of the maintenance service. It is concluded that to implement complete service (maintenances types and process management) offers investments are still necessary to educate farmers in the use of management technologies. The best offer to delivered value to Brazilian farmers is acquired in purchase modality composed by drying machines, preventive maintenance, silo storage, and corrective maintenance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adrying 3aequipment 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3afuelwood 3agrains 3aleasing 3apollutants 3apublic policy 3apurchasing 3asilos 3astored grain 3asurveys 3atechnology 3awillingness to pay 3aBrazil 0aDrying and storage of grains 0aProduct-service system 0aSurvey 0aFarmer wish to invest 0aPerceived value 0aGreen energy1 aRibeiro, José Luis Duarte1 aEcheveste, Marcia Elisa1 aMilani Martins, Vera Lúcia1 aTinoco, Maria Auxiliadora Cannarozzo0 tJournal of stored products research.g2020 May, v. 87 p.101579-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2020.1015793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010500165300001800270520106800288592002801356650001901384650002001403650002001423650002201443650001201465650001101477650002201488650000901510650001601519651001001535653001901545653001801564653001801582653001601600653001001616700001901626700001801645700001901663700001901682700002301701700001701724773011601741856008401857852000901941655001201950IND60121972520221118192553.0150324e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012197252DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2014.9553922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Zhan10aAgriculture under Climate Change in China: Mitigate the Risks by Grasping the Emerging Opportunities  ap. 1259-1276.  aThere have been increasing concerns on risks and uncertainty posed by climate change to China's future crop production. The existing assessments using popular process-based and site-specific crop growing models highlight the significant extent of climate-induced yield reduction, and thus suggest a scary downward risk for China's future food production. Surprisingly, much less attention has been paid to exploring the potential gains that may also be brought by climate change. To address this imbalance, we develop an integrated agro-climatic and ecological assessment tool that is capable of detecting the shifts of multicropping opportunities under different climate change scenarios. The application of this tool to the context of China reveals significant extension of multicropping opportunities brought in by climate change. We argue for an active adaptation to such emerging opportunities through both market and policy incentives, because the aggregate gain of such adaptation is sufficient to outweigh the loss as revealed by the existing assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrop production 3afood production 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3amultiple cropping 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aChina 0aclimate change 0afood security 0amulticropping 0aagriculture 0aChina1 aLiang, Zhuoran1 aSun, Laixiang1 aZhong, Honglin1 aQiu, Huanguang1 aFischer, Günther,1 aZhao, Sijian0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2015 July 4, v. 21, no. 5 p.1259-1276dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2014.9553923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245010900128300001400237520194100251592002802192650002402220650001102244650002002255650001902275650002502294650003802319650001802357650001302375650001202388650001502400650001202415650001902427650002102446650000902467650001102476650002102487650001402508650002302522650002602545650001102571650001202582650001502594650001502609650000902624650001102633650001402644650001702658650002502675651001002700653002102710653002302731653002102754653002502775653002202800700001602822700001702838700001402855700001702869773018102886852000903067655001203076IND60128393620221119054649.0151124e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuoyan, Pan10aWater Consumption of Seven Forage Cultivars Under Different Climatic Conditions in the North China Plain  ap. 74-82.  aThe objectives of this study were to determine the characteristics of water consumption of seven forage cultivars, ryegrass (Secale cereale L.), triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack), sorghum hybrid sudangrass (Sorghum biolor × Sorghum Sudanense c.v.), ensilage corn (Zea mays L.), prince's feather (Amaranthus paniculatus L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.), in response to climate variability (especially precipitation). Field experiments were conducted at Yucheng Integrated Experiment Station from 2005 to 2009. Fifteen irrigated lysimeters were used to measure evapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficient (Kc) of these seven forage varieties under ample water supply. The mean Kc for alfalfa is 1.08, and the mean Kc for other forage varieties ranges from 0.79 to 0.94. Kc for hibernating forage is higher in wet years than that in dry years, followed by normal years, while for annual forage, Kc is higher in dry years than in normal years, and is the lowest in wet years. For perennial varieties the order is normal years, dry years, and wet years. Among the annual varieties, ensilage corn is the first choice due to its highest average forage N yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Sorghum hybrid sudangrass is another forage cultivar that grows well under all climatic conditions. It can achieve 1.08–2.31 t ha⁻¹ y_¹ N yield under all circumstances. Prince's feather is sensitive to climate change and its N yield dropped below half even when ample water was applied in dry and normal years. Ryegrass and triticale have the advantage of growing in the fallow phase after cotton is harvested in the North China Plain (NCP) and the latter performed better. For perennial varieties, alfalfa performed better than cup plant in dry years. With ample irrigation, alfalfa can achieve higher biomass and WUE under arid climate condition, but excessive rain caused reduction in production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus cruentus 3aLolium 3aMedicago sativa 3aSecale cereale 3aSilphium perfoliatum 3aSorghum bicolor subsp. drummondii 3aTriticosecale 3aZea mays 3aalfalfa 3aarid zones 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acorn 3acotton 3acrop coefficient 3acultivars 3aevapotranspiration 3afield experimentation 3aforage 3ahybrids 3airrigation 3alysimeters 3arain 3asilage 3atriticale 3awater supply 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 0aforage cultivars 0aevapotranspiration 0acrop coefficient 0awater use efficiency 0aclimatic patterns1 aOuyang, Zhu1 aQunying, Luo1 aQiang, Yu1 aJishun, Wang0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2011 Mar., v. 2, no. 1 p.74-82dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013300163300001800296520098600314536010401300592002801404596001301432650002501445650003401470650002101504650001201525650001601537650001801553650001401571650001301585650001801598653002501616653001801641653002601659653001801685653001801703653001401721700001501735700001701750700001601767700001501783773012601798856008601924852000902010655001202019IND60759191320221116151454.0220304e20211217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075919132DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.18056032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJu, Yan10aIsolation of triterpenoids and phytosterones from Achyranthes bidentata Bl. to treat breast cancer based on network pharmacology  ap. 5939-5942.  aBreast cancer (BC) is a cancer with a high incidence and mortality of female, threatening women's physical and mental health. Achyranthes bidentata Blume, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been popular in folk due to its effective pharmacology activities including anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour effects. In order to identify the active ingredients from the roots of A. bidentata for treating breast cancer, the separation guided by network pharmacology analysis was employed which led to the isolation of 7 triterpenoids and 10 phytosterones. According to the in vitro experiments, the isolated compounds showed significant inhibitory activities on MCF-7 cells as well as anti-inflammatory activities by attenuating the production of NO and TNF-α in LPS-induced macrophage cells. In conclusion, this study successfully predicted and confirmed the positive impact of triterpenoids and phytosterones on breast cancer, which provided a foundation for further in vivo studies.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (81573694).  aPublisher supplied data  a81573694 3aAchyranthes japonica 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abreast neoplasms 3afemales 3amacrophages 3amental health 3amortality 3aresearch 3atriterpenoids 0aNetwork pharmacology 0abreast cancer 0aAchyranthes bidentata 0atriterpenoids 0aphytosterones 0ain vitro1 aLiang, Hui1 aDu, Kaicheng1 aGuo, Zifeng1 aMeng, Dali0 tNatural product research.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 35, no. 24 p.5939-5942dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2020.18056033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245046200153300001600615520137700631592002802008650002302036650001702059650002202076650002002098650001702118650001202135650001902147650001502166650002102181650001502202650001302217650001502230650001102245650000902256650001702265650001302282650002402295651001102319700001902330700001902349700001702368773012302385856007102508852000902579655001202588IND60517328120221121221244.0160329e20110427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051732812DNAL7 a10.1139/z11-0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeacock, E.10aConservation and management of Canada’s polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in a changing Arctic11This review is part of the virtual symposium “Flagship Species – Flagship Problems” that deals with ecology, biodiversity and management issues, and climate impacts on species at risk and of Canadian importance, including the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus), and caribou (Rangifer tarandus).  ap. 371-385.  aCanada has an important responsibility for the research, conservation, and management of polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774) because the majority of polar bears in the world occur within the nation’s borders. Two fundamental and recent changes for polar bears and their conservation have arisen: (1) the ongoing and projected further decline of sea-ice habitat as a result of climate change and (2) the implementation of aboriginal land claims and treaties in Canada’s North. Science has documented empirical links between productivity of polar bear population and sea-ice change. Predictive modeling based on these data has forecast significant declines in polar bear abundance and distribution of polar bears. With the signing of northern land claims and treaties, polar bear management in Canada has integrated local aboriginal participation, values, and knowledge. The interaction of scientific and local perspectives on polar bears as they relate to harvest, climate change, and declining habitat has recently caused controversy. Some conservation, management, and research decisions have been contentious because of gaps in scientific knowledge and the polarization and politicization of the roles of the various stakeholders. With these ecological and governance transitions, there is a need to re-focus and re-direct polar bear conservation in Canada.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharadrius melodus 3aGadus morhua 3aRangifer tarandus 3aUrsus maritimus 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acod (fish) 3aflagship species 3agovernance 3ahabitats 3aharvesting 3amodels 3arisk 3astakeholders 3atreaties 3awildlife management 3aCanada1 aDerocher, A.E.1 aThiemann, G.W.1 aStirling, I.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2011 Apr. 27, v. 89, no. 5 p.371-385dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x0008-43017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z11-0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03825naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002700132024001000159040001800169100002800187245016100215300001600376506017300392520169500565650000802260650002302268650002402291650001102315650001202326650002702338650001702365650001002382650001202392650002502404650002002429650001202449650001202461650001602473650001002489650001302499650001202512650001402524650001002538650002602548650001202574650003002586650002502616650001202641700002302653773010302676856011202779856004002891956028602931961000903217852000903226655001203235IND50060141920221214231746.0130201s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006014192DNAL7 a2159382aris7 a10113/555392hdl7 a10.1577/A07-076.12doi8 ans717  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldbieser, Geoffrey C.10aUtilization of a Rapid DNA-Based Assay for Molecular Verification of Channel Catfish, Blue Catfish, F1 Hybrid, and F2 Backcross Offspring at all Life Stages  ap. 388-395.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe F1 hybrid offspring of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, females mated with blue catfish, I. furcatus, males contain many desirable traits for commercial production such as enhanced growth and increased survivability. Although at a low efficiency, hybrids can be produced by pond spawning, but hybrid catfish cannot always be readily distinguished from channel catfish, especially at early life stages. The present research was designed to produce a rapid DNA-based test for the identification of hybrid catfish. Channel and blue catfish genomic regions were PCR-amplified using common primers for the follistatin (Fst) and hepcidin antimicrobial protein (Hamp) genes, and fragment length polymorphisms between the two species caused by ancestral insertions/deletions were resolved by agarose electrophoresis. The Fst amplicons were 399 and 348 bp while the Hamp amplicons were 262 and 222 bp from blue and channel catfish, respectively. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene (Mtco1) was also differentially amplified from each species using species-specific primers, thus the maternal parent species could be determined. The DNA preparation technique provided sufficient genomic DNA to test all life stages. The PCR products were successfully amplified from genomic DNA isolated from embryos at one, two, or five days after fertilization, from fry two days after hatching, from blood and barbels of juveniles and adults, and from fresh, frozen, and cooked fillet samples. The results from this assay were available as soon as 24 h after receipt of sample. This assay will be useful for management of hybrid populations and post-harvest detection of hybrid catfish products. 3aDNA 3aIctalurus furcatus 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aadults 3aagarose 3aantimicrobial proteins 3abackcrossing 3ablood 3acatfish 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aelectrophoresis 3afemales 3afillets 3afollistatin 3agenes 3ahatching 3ahybrids 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amolecular systematics 3aparents 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproduct authenticity 3aprogeny1 aBosworth, Brian S.0 tNorth American Journal of Aquaculture.g2008, v. 70 p.388-395wJournal:jnl4207184x1522-20557nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/555393Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1577/A07-076.1  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Utilization%20of%20a%20rapid%20DNA-based%20assay%20for%20molecular%20verification%20of%20channel%20catfish%2C%20blue%20catfish%2C%20F1%20hybrid%2C%20and%20backcross%20offspring%20at%20serveral%20life%20stages.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245017400199506007600373520151800449592002801967506003701995650002502032650002202057650001502079650002302094650001602117650002402133650002102157650001102178650002202189650002002211650001602231650002102247650002302268650004102291650002102332650003002353650001802383650001802401650001802419650001002437650001402447650001102461700001702472700001602489700001202505700001902517700002002536773012002556856007402676852000902750655001202759IND60670019720221207134039.0190925e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067001972DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90906922doi7 aPMC67707922pmcid7 a315332532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahfuz, Shad 10aDietary Inclusion of Mushroom (<i>Flammulina velutipes</i>) Stem Waste on Growth Performance, Antibody Response, Immune Status, and Serum Cholesterol in Broiler Chickens  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study was carried out to investigate the effects of mushroom (Flammulina velutipes) stem waste (MW) on growth performance, antibody response, immune status, and serum cholesterol in broiler chickens. A total of 252 1 day old Arbor Acres (AA) male broiler chicks were randomly assigned into four treatments with seven replications of nine chicks each. The duration of experimental period was total 42 days. Dietary treatments includes a standard basal diet as negative control (NC) group; control diet with antibiotics (Chlortetracycline) considered as positive control (PC) group; 1% mushroom stem waste (MW) fed group; and 2% MW fed group. No significant differences (p > 0.05) was observed on average daily feed intake, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio among experimental groups. Antibody titers against Newcastle disease (ND) and infectious bursal disease (IBD) were higher (p < 0.05) in 2% MW fed group than NC and PC fed groups. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) was higher (p < 0.05) in both levels of MW fed groups than in the NC and PC. Serum interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL-6), were higher (p < 0.05) in 2% MW fed groups than in the NC and PC fed groups. Total cholesterol concentration was lower (p < 0.05) in both levels MW fed groups than in the NC. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) was lower (p < 0.05) in both levels of MW fed groups than that of NC and PC fed groups. MW at 2% level can be used as potential phytogenic feed supplement in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFlammulina velutipes 3aNewcastle disease 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3achlortetracycline 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3agrowth performance 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfectious bursal disease 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3amales 3amushrooms 3awastes1 aHe, Tengfei 1 aLiu, Sujie 1 aWu, Di 1 aLong, Shenfei 1 aPiao, Xiangshu 0 tAnimals.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90906923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011000165300001600275520136500291592002801656650002201684650001201706650001801718650001001736650001401746650001401760650002301774650001101797650001301808650000901821650001701830650002401847650002201871650001501893653001701908653002601925653001401951653001101965653002101976700001601997700001802013700001902031700001902050700001802069773011102087856008202198852000902280655001202289IND60086526520221118230601.0190319e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008652652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Ji Yeon10aTartary buckwheat improves cognition and memory function in an in vivo amyloid-β-induced Alzheimer model  ap. 105-111.  aProtective effects of Tartary buckwheat (TB) and common buckwheat (CB) on amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced impairment of cognition and memory function were investigated in vivo in order to identify potential therapeutic agents against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its associated progressive memory deficits, cognitive impairment, and personality changes. An in vivo mouse model of AD was created by injecting the brains of ICR mice with Aβ25–35, a fragment of the full-length Aβ protein. Damage of mice recognition ability through following Aβ25–35 brain injections was confirmed using the T-maze test, the object recognition test, and the Morris water maze test. Results of behavior tests in AD model showed that oral administration of the methanol (MeOH) extracts of TB and CB improved cognition and memory function following Aβ25–35 injections. Furthermore, in groups receiving the MeOH extracts of TB and CB, lipid peroxidation was significantly inhibited, and nitric oxide levels in tissue, which are elevated by injection of Aβ25–35, were also decrease. In particular, the MeOH extract of TB exerted a stronger protective activity than CB against Aβ25–35-induced memory and cognition impairment. The results indicate that TB may play a promising role in preventing or reversing memory and cognition loss associated with Aβ25–35-induced AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3abrain 3abuckwheat 3acognition 3alipid peroxidation 3amemory 3amethanol 3amice 3anitric oxide 3aoral administration 3aprotective effect 3atoxicology 0aAmyloid beta 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aBuckwheat 0aMemory 0aOxidative stress1 aCho, Eun Ju1 aLee, Hae Song1 aLee, Jeong Min1 aYoon, Young-Ho1 aLee, Sanghyun0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Mar., v. 53 p.105-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011700170520128900287592002801576650001401604650001101618650001401629650001401643650000901657650001101666650002401677650001201701650001601713650001101729650002701740650002401767650001401791650001401805650001101819653001401830653002801844653001901872653001801891700002001909700001901929773011701948856008302065852000902148655001202157IND60684048620221120062311.0200614e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068404862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2020.1015832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwamy, SVS.Gopala10aSusceptibility of stored chickpeas to bruchid infestation as influenced by physico-chemical traits of the grains  aA total of nine promising varieties including five desi type and four kabuli type of chickpeas were screened against pulse bruchid under free-choice conditions at Post Harvest Technology Centre, Bapatla. The chickpeas were studied for their physical characters and biochemical constituents, and the extent of influence on insect preference and development was established through correlation and regression analyses. The varieties; NBeG 511, JAKI 9218 and JG 11 which had less numbers of eggs and adult emergence, with low per cent grain damage were found to be desi type and possessed less test weight with higher seed coat thickness. Similarly the varieties; NBeG 458, NBeG 471 and KAK 2 which recorded higher oviposition, adult emergence and grain damage were found to have thin seed coat and larger seed size. Thus, test weight of the grains showed significant positive correlation to adult emergence and grain damage while seed coat thickness showed the negative correlation. Chickpea grains with higher sugar and lower phenol contents were found to be more susceptible to bruchids. Though there were significant differences in the contents of biochemical constituents of chickpeas of these cultivated varieties, they could not exert significant influence on bruchid development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBruchidae 3aadults 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3aeggs 3agrains 3ainsect infestations 3ainsects 3aoviposition 3aphenol 3apostharvest technology 3aregression analysis 3aseed coat 3aseed size 3asugars 0aChickpeas 0aPhysico-chemical traits 0aSusceptibility 0aPulse bruchid1 aRaja, D.Sandeep1 aWesley, B.John0 tJournal of stored products research.g2020 May, v. 87 p.101583-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2020.1015833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245018400172300001400356520132400370592002801694650001601722650001001738650001301748650003901761650001001800650001701810650002101827650002201848650002301870650001101893653002201904653002601926653001101952653002101963653002501984653001902009700002702028700002202055700005702077700002102134773010902155856008802264852000902352655001202361IND60564194820221121112127.0180830e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapasso, Luigi10aBone natural autofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy: Preliminary results of a novel useful tool to distinguish between forensic and ancient human skeletal remains  ap. 87-96.  aThe fast, high-throughput distinction between palaeoanthropological/archaeological remains and recent forensic/clinical bone samples is of vital importance in the field of medico-legal science. In this paper, a novel dating method was developed using the autofluorescence of human bones and the confocal laser scanning microscope as the means to distinguish between archaeological and forensic anthropological skeletal findings.Human bones exhibit fluorescence, typically induced by natural antibiotics that are absorbed by collagen, and provide secondary, exogenous fluorophores. However, primary natural fluorescence (or autofluorescence) caused by enigmatic endogenous fluorophores is also present as a micro-phenomenon, whose nature is still obscure. Here, we show that the endogenous fluorophores are mucopolysaccharides of the Rouget–Neumann sheath and, more relevant, that the intensity of the natural fluorescence in human bone decreases in a relationship to the antiquity of the samples. These results suggest that the autofluorescence of bone is a promising technique for the assessment of skeletal remains that may be potentially of medico-legal interest. A larger study is proposed to confirm these findings and to create a predictive model between the autofluorescence intensity and the time since death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abones 3acollagen 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adeath 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aforensic sciences 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahumans 0aForensic sciences 0aForensic anthropology 0aDating 0aTime since death 0aPrimary fluorescence 0aBone histology1 aD’Anastasio, Ruggero1 aGuarnieri, Simone1 aViciano, Joan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7575-557X1 aMariggiò, Maria0 tForensic science international.g2017 Mar., v. 272 p.87-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245007700129300001500206520128300221592002801504650001301532650002601545650001701571650003101588650001401619650002101633650001901654650001601673650001601689650001701705650002701722650001001749653003401759653001601793653002101809653002201830653001101852700001501863700001901878700001601897773018201913852000902095655001202104IND60128393920221119054556.0151124e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQixing, Zhou10aEcological Remediation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Soils with Weed Plant  ap. 97-105.  aConsiderable efforts have been undertaken to accelerate the breakdown of existing anthropogenic petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) by appropriate in situ remediation technologies. In situ phytoremediation, using higher plants to remove, stabilize, degrade, and/or metabolize hazardous contaminants, has emerged as a promising green technology for cleaning up environments contaminated with PHCs. Weed plants are generally considered to have great potential for use in phytoremediation due to their extensive fibrous root systems and relatively robust characteristics, thus helping establish a strong rhizosphere through contaminated soils. In this review, some important mechanisms involved in phytoremedation of PHC contaminated soils, including phytoaccumulation, phytostabilization, phytodegradation, phytovolatilization, and rhizodegradation, were summarized and discussed. In recent years, a large number of laboratory approaches have been developed to further enhance the phytoremediation efficiency of PHC contaminated soils. The success of these laboratory studies has encouraged researchers to attempt phytoremediation of PHC contaminated soils in the field. However, many limitations still exist in order to successfully apply laboratory experiments to trials in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3afield experimentation 3ahydrocarbons 3alaboratory experimentation 3apetroleum 3aphytoremediation 3apolluted soils 3aresearchers 3arhizosphere 3aroot systems 3asustainable technology 3aweeds 0aPetroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) 0aweed plants 0aphytoremediation 0acontaminated soil 0areview1 aZhang, Cai1 aZhineng, Zhang1 aWeitao, Liu0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2011 June, v. 2, no. 2 p.97-105dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245012200202506007600324520147000400592002801870506003701898650001901935650002701954650001201981650002701993650001502020650001402035650002202049650002002071650002302091700002402114773012002138856007402258852000902332655001202341IND60670019920221207134037.0190925e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067001992DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90906942doi7 aPMC67703102pmcid7 a315333282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVigors, Belinda 10aWhat Are the Positives? Exploring Positive Welfare Indicators in a Qualitative Interview Study with Livestock Farmers  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo support the furtherance of positive animal welfare, there is a need to develop meaningful and practical positive welfare indicators for on-farm welfare assessment. Considering the perspectives of farmers is arguably critical in this regard. Doing so helps ensure positive welfare indicators reflect farmers&rsquo; existing welfare norms and attitudes and, are thus, of practical relevance to them. However, a key issue for such development is the dearth of knowledge on farmers&rsquo; perspectives of positive welfare. To address this, this study uses qualitative interviews to directly examine livestock farmers&rsquo; perspectives of positive welfare. Findings reveal that farmers describe elements of positive welfare which are broadly in line with indicators suggested in the positive welfare literature. These elements include animal autonomy, play, positive affect, positive human-animal relationships, social interaction, and appropriate genetic selection. Additionally, this study finds that farmers construct the reduction of negative aspects of welfare as their primary management concern and mostly construct positive welfare as arising indirectly from this. Insights into the importance that farmers of different sectors and systems give to different aspects of positive welfare indicators are also explored. The implications of these findings and the similitudes between farmers&rsquo; perspectives and the positive welfare literature are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3afarmers 3ahuman-animal relations 3ainterviews 3alivestock 3anatural selection 3asocial behavior 3awelfare assessment1 aLawrence, Alistair 0 tAnimals.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90906943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01911naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009400172300001600266520080500282592002801087650001001115650002201125650001001147650001201157650001601169650001001185650002801195651001001223700002601233700002001259700003201279700003101311700002401342773008101366856008101447852000901528655001201537IND60485940520221122051410.0160218e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048594052DNAL7 a10.1007/s13237-016-0157-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamurailatpam, Anju10aFurther observations on chromosome diversity analysis in wild species of Vigna from India  ap. 225-230.  aTen wild species of Vigna from the Indian gene centre have been karyo-morphologically analysed. All the studied taxa had somatic chromosome number of 2n = 22 except V. glabrescens which had 2n = 44. The chromosomes were found to be either metacentric, submetacentric and subtelocentric in type with their respective chromosome complements, and the complete absence of telocentric chromosomes in all of the taxa studied. The karyotypes of the species were mostly symmetrical. The significance of karyotypic variation among wild species in comparison with the cultivated ones of the genus Vigna has been discussed in detail.

However, the molecular components responsible for the transport of these molecules in rice remain largely unknown. RESULTS: Here we identified OsProT1 and OsProT3 as functional transporters for Pro and GABA. Transient expression of eGFP-OsProTs in plant protoplasts revealed that both OsProT1 and OsProT3 are localized to the plasma membrane. Ectopic expression in a yeast mutant demonstrated that both OsProT1 and OsProT3 specifically mediate transport of Pro and GABA with affinity for Pro in the low affinity range. qRT-PCR analyses suggested that OsProT1 was preferentially expressed in leaf sheathes during vegetative growth, while OsProT3 exhibited relatively high expression levels in several tissues, including nodes, panicles and roots. Interestingly, both OsProT1 and OsProT3 were induced by cadmium stress in rice shoots. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that plasma membrane-localized OsProT1 and OsProT3 efficiently transport Pro and GABA when ectopically expressed in yeast and appear to be involved in various physiological processes, including adaption to cadmium stress in rice plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0301502cNational key Research and Development Program of China  a2018JJ3230cHunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018JJ3235cHunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018JJ2173cHunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a31700212cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aYXQN2018-5cFund for Excellent Talents in Crop Discipline of Hunan Agricultural University0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3acadmium 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agene expression regulation 3aleaves 3amutants 3apanicles 3aplasma membrane 3aprotoplasts 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aroots 3ashoots 3astress tolerance 3atissues 3atransporters 3avegetative growth 3ayeasts1 aXu, Zhi-Jun1 aPeng, Jia-Shi1 aZhao, Jing1 aZhang, Guo-Bin1 aXie, Jun1 aYi, Zhen-Xie1 aZhang, Jian-Hua1 aGong, Ji-Ming1 aYe, Neng-Hui1 aMeng, Shuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6942-31380 tRice.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.79-79dSpringer USwJournal:J000001787x1939-84257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-019-0341-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03644naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011800170300001100288500001100299520207000310592002802380650002002408650001902428650001902447650001902466650002102485650002202506650001202528650001002540650002302550650001602573650001202589650001802601650002402619650001302643650002402656650001902680650001502699650001302714650001502727650001802742650000902760650001902769650001602788650001202804651001102816651001802827700002802845773012602873856008202999852000903081655001203090IND60485940620221122051603.0180619e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048594062DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-015-0336-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonitto, Christina10aNutrient management in African sorghum cropping systems: applying meta-analysis to assess yield and profitability  ap. 10.  aReview  aDeclining soil fertility and limited farmer access to inorganic fertilizer frequently cause sub-optimal grain yields throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Farm productivity is also at risk from extreme weather and future climate change. Significant uncertainty remains in predicting climate in Africa, increasing the challenge of planning for climate change adaptation. Sorghum is adapted to African climate patterns and is predicted to maintain widespread suitability across different African climatic zones under climate change. Sorghum’s drought tolerance and ability to withstand water logging make it an important crop for maintaining productive agroecosystems under a changing climate. Due to its status as a staple grain, improved sorghum management can provide smallholder farmers with stability in their household nutritional needs. We reviewed sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) yield trends across nutrient management scenarios using meta-analysis. We compared yield across eight nutrient management practices: (i) N-only, (ii) P-only, (iii) N and P, (iv) N and P microdose, (v) legume management, (vi) manure addition, (vii) organic matter (OM) amendment, and (viii) mixed amendment. Our review demonstrated (1) yield improvement considering all scenarios averaged 66 % relative to no nutrient inputs, (2) yield under chemical fertilizer amendment increased by 47–98 % of control yield, (3) yield under organic nutrient amendment increased by 43–87 % of control yield, and (4) the profitability of a management scenario was not solely determined by the magnitude of yield increase. For example, due to the high cost of fertilizer, addition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) generated the largest yield increase, but the lowest profit, in two of three countries analyzed. In contrast, an edible legume in rotation averaged 43 % yield improvement relative to no nutrient inputs and a net profit of US $146 to $263 per hectare. Facilitating access to both fertilizer inputs and diversified rotations has the greatest potential to increase grain yield in Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aagroecosystems 3aclimate change 3aclimatic zones 3acropping systems 3adrought tolerance 3afarmers 3afarms 3aflooded conditions 3agrain yield 3alegumes 3ameta-analysis 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aplanning 3aprediction 3aprofitability 3arisk 3asoil fertility 3auncertainty 3aweather 3aAfrica 3aUnited States1 aRicker-Gilbert, JacobE.0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2016 Mar., v. 36, no. 1 p.10-10dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl33129x1774-07467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-015-0336-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01839naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010000168300001800268520072700286592002801013650001601041650001501057650002201072650001601094653002901110653002001139653002801159700001501187700001501202700001701217700001701234700001701251773011601268856008401384852000901468655001201477IND60121973120221118192143.0150324e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012197312DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2014.9579452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xiankui10aUncertainty Evaluation of a Groundwater Conceptual Model by Using a Multimodel Averaging Method  ap. 1246-1258.  aA groundwater field is a complex and open system. Groundwater simulation and prediction often deviated from true values, which is attributed to the uncertainty of groundwater modeling. The conceptual model (model struture) is one of the main sources of groundwater modeling uncertianty. In this study, the mean Euclidean distance (MED) between model simulations and observations is proposed to assess the integrated likelihood value of a conceptual model in Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Moreover, this proposed BMA method is compared with the traditional generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) BMA method by a synthetical groundwater model, and the characteristics of these two BMA methods are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 0aBayesian model averaging 0amodel structure 0amean Euclidean distance1 aWang, Dong1 aWu, Jichun1 aZhu, Xiaobin1 aWang, Lachun1 aZou, Xinqing0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2015 July 4, v. 21, no. 5 p.1246-1258dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2014.9579453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012600170300001100296500001100307520140900318592002801727596004501755650002701800650001501827650002301842650002301865650000901888650001801897650001801915650002901933650002201962650000901984650001501993650001802008650001102026650003102037650001902068650002002087650001402107650002202121700006002143700005702203700001702260773013302277856008202410852000902492655001202501IND60675897920221119234618.0200405e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067589792DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-019-0266-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBundschuh, Rebecca10aFood-related exposure to systemic pesticides and pesticides from transgenic plants: evaluation of aquatic test strategies  ap. 87.  aReview  aThe aquatic Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for pesticides relies on standardized experimental protocols focusing on exposure via the water phase or the sediment. Systemic pesticides (e.g., neonicotinoids) or pesticides produced in transgenic plants (e.g., Bt proteins) can be introduced into aquatic ecosystems as part of plant residues. Consequently, they may be taken up by organisms as part of their diet. Here, we analyzed (i) whether standardized aquatic ecotoxicological test guidelines consider an exposure route via food and (ii) whether these tests can be easily modified to take this exposure route into account. From the 156 existing test guidelines, only those for fish and amphibians partly consider a potential route of uptake via food. From the remaining invertebrate guidelines, those focussing on chronic endpoints may be most suitable to cover this exposure path. We suggest assessing the food-related effects of systemic pesticides in a dose-dependent manner using standardized guidelines or methods developed from peer-reviewed literature. For transgenic plants, spiking uncontaminated leaf material with increasing concentrations of the test substances would allow to test for dose responses. After adaption to oral uptake, standard test guidelines currently available for the ERA appear, in principle, suitable for testing effects of systemic pesticides and transgenic plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a3512 89 0100cBundesamt für Naturschutz 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aamphibians 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abacterial proteins 3adiet 3adose response 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental assessment 3aexposure pathways 3afish 3aguidelines 3ainvertebrates 3aleaves 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3aplant residues 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3atransgenic plants1 aBundschuh, Mirco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4876-220X1 aOtto, Mathias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3161-56251 aSchulz, Ralf0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2019 Dec., v. 31, no. 1 p.87-87dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-019-0266-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169300001800304520177400322592002802096650002202124650002202146650001402168650002502182650001202207650001902219650001902238650002202257650001402279650001202293650002002305650001202325650003302337650001602370650002502386653002002411653002302431653001702454653001202471653003202483653001902515700002302534773011502557856008602672852000902758655001202767IND60555400520221116162339.0180831e20161120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055540052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, A.A.14aThe environmental sustainability of calcined calcium phosphates production from the milling of eggshell wastes and phosphoric acid  ap. 1432-1438.  aIndustrial waste shells of egg cause environmental and health issues. Diversion of eggshells from landfill to a useful product or used in a better way towards the fabrication of marketable/valuable products is of high economic and ecologic interest. Different structures of calcium phosphates were prepared by milling eggshells with different amounts of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in the presence of gelatin. The amounts of H3PO4 were varied over wide ranges (2.90 ml–8.73 ml), and the impact of such variations on calcined samples was investigated through the characterization of their morphologies by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Long milling time is associated with size reduction of the eggshell powders. It was demonstrated that addition of 8.73 ml H3PO4 reduced the d50 eggshell particles from ∼ 1 μm to 0.96 μm after being milled for 8 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been used to identify the crystalline phases present after milling and also after heat treatment for various times of up to 5 h at temperatures in the range 700–1200 °C. Monetite (CaHPO4) is the characteristic phase of ball-milled samples over the whole ranges of phosphoric acid. The thermal treatment applied to the ball-milled samples led to the interaction between the constituents, causing a modification in the proportion of calcium phosphate structures. At 2.90 and 3.88 ml of H3PO4, both tri-calcium phosphate Ca3(PO4)2 and hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH phases are the major crystalline structures developed at 1000 and 1200 °C, while Ca2P2O7 and Ca3(PO4)2 were mainly the observed phases at lower sintering temperatures. The present work is establishing a treatment strategy to produce tailor-made calcium phosphate structures for bio-applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrystal structure 3aegg shell 3aenvironmental health 3agelatin 3aheat treatment 3ahydroxyapatite 3aindustrial wastes 3alandfills 3amilling 3aphosphoric acid 3apowders 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atricalcium phosphate 0aEggshell wastes 0aCalcium phosphates 0aMorphologies 0aMilling 0aParticle size distributions 0aSustainability1 aAbdel Rahman, M.K.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 20, v. 137 p.1432-1438dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245006600213300001600279520137400295592002801669650002201697650001601719650001901735650002201754650001901776650001101795650001901806650001601825650001001841653002801851653001001879653002001889653001601909653001901925700002001944700002201964700002401986700002202010700002302032773011102055856008802166852000902254655001202263IND60564195220221121145342.0180830e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantoro, Valeria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1612-815110aPhotogrammetric 3D skull/photo superimposition: A pilot study  ap. 168-174.  aThe identification of bodies through the examination of skeletal remains holds a prominent place in the field of forensic investigations. Technological advancements in 3D facial acquisition techniques have led to the proposal of a new body identification technique that involves a combination of craniofacial superimposition and photogrammetry. The aim of this study was to test the method by superimposing various computerized 3D images of skulls onto various photographs of missing people taken while they were still alive in cases when there was a suspicion that the skulls in question belonged to them. The technique is divided into four phases: preparatory phase, 3d acquisition phase, superimposition phase, and metric image analysis 3d.The actual superimposition of the images was carried out in the fourth step. and was done so by comparing the skull images with the selected photos.Using a specific software, the two images (i.e. the 3D avatar and the photo of the missing person) were superimposed. Cross-comparisons of 5 skulls discovered in a mass grave, and of 2 skulls retrieved in the crawlspace of a house were performed. The morphologyc phase reveals a full overlap between skulls and photos of disappeared persons. Metric phase reveals that correlation coefficients of this values, higher than 0.998–0,997 allow to confirm identification hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acorrelation 3adigital images 3aforensic sciences 3aimage analysis 3apeople 3aphotogrammetry 3aphotographs 3askull 0aPersonal identification 0aSkull 0aSuperimposition 0a3D Scanning 0aPhotogrammetry1 aLubelli, Sergio1 aDe Donno, Antonio1 aInchingolo, Alessio1 aLavecchia, Fulvio1 aIntrona, Francesco0 tForensic science international.g2017 Apr., v. 273 p.168-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3523x0379-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2017.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245017000210300001100380500001100391520244400402592002802846596006502874650001602939650002002955650002002975650001702995650001303012650002103025650002003046650002203066650002403088650002803112650001303140650002103153700002003174700001903194700002303213773013303236856008203369852000903451655001203460IND60675898020221119234632.0200405e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067589802DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-019-0270-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgungbemi, Afolarin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8420-576410aHypo- or hyperactivity of zebrafish embryos provoked by neuroactive substances: a review on how experimental parameters impact the predictability of behavior changes  ap. 88.  aReview  aTests with zebrafish embryos have gained wide acceptance as an alternative test model for drug development and toxicity testing. In particular, the behavioral response of the zebrafish embryo is currently seen as a useful endpoint to diagnose neuroactive substances. Consequently, several behavioral test methods have been developed addressing various behavioral endpoints such as spontaneous tail coiling (STC), photomotor response (PMR), locomotor response (LMR) and alternating light/dark-induced locomotor response (LMR-L/D). Although these methods are distinct in their application, most of their protocols differ quite strongly in the use of experimental parameters and this is usually driven by different research questions. However, if a single mode of action is to be diagnosed, then varying experimental parameters may cause incoherent behavioral responses (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish during toxicity assessment. This could lead to inconclusiveness of behavioral test results for use within a prospective and diagnostic risk assessment framework. To investigate the influence of these parameters, we conducted a review of existing behavioral assays to address the following two questions: (1) To what extent do varying experimental parameters influence observed effects in published behavioral test methods? (2) Is the observed behavior change (hypo- or hyperactivity) of zebrafish embryos consistent with the expected mode of action of a chemical? We compiled a set of 18 substances which are anticipated to be neuroactive. We found that behavioral changes are not only affected by chemicals but also variation in the use of experimental parameters across studies seems to have a high impact on the outcome and thus comparability between studies. Four parameters, i.e., exposure concentration, exposure duration, endpoint parameter and developmental stage were the most influential parameters. Varying combinations of these parameters caused a non-reproducible outcome for the hyperactivity expected for the organophosphates; chlorpyrifos and diazinon. We highlighted that the STC test shows a higher capacity to predict the hyperactivity of organophosphates, while PMR and LMR-L/D were more suitable to predict the hypoactivity expected for anticonvulsants. We provide a list of recommendations which, when implemented, may help to exclude the risk of bias due to experimental parameters if similar goals are desired.  aPublisher supplied data  aFKZ 02WRS1419FcBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3aDanio rerio 3aanticonvulsants 3abehavior change 3achlorpyrifos 3adiazinon 3adrug development 3aembryo (animal) 3aexposure duration 3amechanism of action 3arisk assessment process 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing1 aLeuthold, David1 aScholz, Stefan1 aKüster, Eberhard,0 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2019 Dec., v. 31, no. 1 p.88-88dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-019-0270-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015500165300001200320520148900332592002801821650001601849650001301865650001901878650001901897650001001916650001401926650002901940650001801969650004301987650001802030650001502048651002102063653001802084653000902102653002802111653002502139700001702164700002102181700001702202700001802219773011102237856008302348852000902431655001202440IND60603527220221117201831.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060352722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2015.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Seri10aEvaluation of peptide nucleic acid-mediated multiplex real-time PCR kits for rapid detection of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative clinical isolates  ap. 4-9.  aThe emergence of clinical isolates of carbapenemase-producing microbes confers multidrug-resistance to these bacteria and renders them difficult to treat. This study was performed to evaluate peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe-based multiplex real-time PCR kits used to detect carbapenemase genes. In total, 324 carbapenemase genes, collected from 318 gram-negative clinical isolates in 36 different hospital laboratories, were assayed to evaluate multiplex real-time PCR kits (PANAGENE; Daejeon, Korea). The nine most prevalent carbapenemase genes (KPC, OXA-48, GES, IMP, VIM, NDM, ISAba1-OXA-51, OXA-23, and OXA-58) were included in this study. The sensitivity and specificity of the multiplex real-time PCR assay to all of the carbapenemase genes were above 99.0%, except for ISAba1-OXA-51. The detection limit of the assay was 100 target copies per 25μL of reaction volume for all of the nine genetic types of carbapenemases, and the genes were all detected in a single three-hour PCR. The assay also showed considerable efficiency (above 80.0%), stable reproducibility (coefficient of variation, below 5.0%) and a long shelf-life (more than eight months) with no cross reactivity. The developed PNA-mediated multiplex real-time PCR assay was useful for the rapid, accurate and simultaneous identification of nine carbapenemase genes in gram-negative clinical isolates, suggesting its potential to help choose the appropriate antibiotics and aid the control of carbapenemase genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abeta-lactamase 3across reaction 3agenes 3ahospitals 3amultiple drug resistance 3anucleic acids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3ashelf life 3aKorean Peninsula 0aCarbapenemase 0aGene 0aMultiplex real-time PCR 0aPeptide nucleic acid1 aKim, Jung Ok1 aJeong, Seok Hoon1 aBae, Il Kwon1 aSong, Wonkeun0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2015 June, v. 113 p.4-9dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2015.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04808naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245010600157300001600263520283100279592002803110650002003138650002603158650001203184650001003196650001303206650001203219650002003231650000903251650002303260650001503283650001003298650002603308650002403334650001203358650002503370650001303395650000903408650001803417651001003435651001103445653001603456653001703472653002403489653000903513653001303522700001703535700001903552700002003571700001603591700001503607700001703622700001803639700001403657700001803671700001603689700001603705700001703721700001603738700001603754700001603770700001403786700001703800700006103817773011503878856007203993852000904065655001204074IND60656010020221119055959.0190812e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065601002DNAL7 a10.1071/WR180812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Vittorio, M.10aLong-term changes in the breeding period diet of Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata) in Sicily, Italy  ap. 409-414.  aContext. Dietary analyses are essential to achieve a better understanding of animal ecology. In the case of endangered species, assessing dietary requirements is crucial to improve their management and conservation. The Bonelli’s eagle (Aquila fasciata) has experienced a severe decline throughout its breeding range in Europe and, in Italy, fewer than 50 pairs remain, and only in Sicily. This species is subject to major threats, including changes in landscape composition and, consequently, prey availability, which is further aggravated by the occurrence of viral diseases in the case of rabbits. Aims. To provide current data on the diet of the Bonelli’s eagle in Sicily during the breeding period and to examine dietary shifts with regard to previous studies conducted in the same study area. To discuss possible implications for conservation of the Italian population of this endangered species. Methods. We used a combination of three methods, including pellet analysis, collection of prey remains, and imagery from camera-traps installed at nests, to examine the diet of 12 breeding pairs of Bonelli’s eagle from 2011 to 2017. We compared this information with data collected between 1993 and 1998 in the same study area. Key results. In number, birds were the most frequently predated items (61.6%), followed by mammals (36.88%) and reptiles (1.52%). However, in terms of biomass, mammals were the main prey (65.71%), followed by birds (34.12%) and reptiles (0.17%). There was a decrease over the course of the current decade in the consumption of European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), which was compensated for with an increase in both dietary diversity and breadth in bird consumption, a trend not observed in the earlier study in the same region. Conclusions. Here, we provide an updated assessment of diet composition of Bonelli’s eagle during the breeding period. Interestingly, we found significant differences within the study period (2011–2017) in terms of frequency of occurrence, percentage of biomass, dietary diversity and dietary breadth in a species at risk. Furthermore, we found significant differences between the two study periods in both frequency and percentage of biomass, with significant changes in the consumption of lagomorphs and birds. Implications. Our results indicated that shifts in the diet are linked to changes in prey abundance, which may be contributing to population declines in the Bonelli’s eagle population in Sicily. Overall, measures aimed at increasing main dietary prey should be promoted to favour occupation of new territories and enhance vital demographic parameters (i.e. breeding success and survival rate) of Bonelli’s eagle across the species range. This would be particularly important for small isolated populations such as the Sicilian one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAquila fasciata 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3abiomass 3abirds 3abreeding 3acameras 3adata collection 3adiet 3aendangered species 3alandscapes 3anests 3anutrient requirements 3apopulation dynamics 3arabbits 3areproductive success 3areptiles 3arisk 3asurvival rate 3aItaly 3aSicily 0acamera-trap 0aconservation 0adietary composition 0afood 0apellets.1 aLo Valvo, M.1 aDi Trapani, E.1 aSanguinetti, A.1 aCiaccio, A.1 aGrenci, S.1 aZafarana, M.1 aGiacalone, G.1 aPatti, N.1 aCacopardi, S.1 aRannisi, P.1 aScuderi, A.1 aLuiselli, L.1 aLa Grua, G.1 aCortone, G.1 aMerlino, S.1 aFalci, A.1 aSpinella, G.1 aLópez-López, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5269-652X0 tWildlife research.g2019 Aug. 1, v. 46, no. 5 p.409-414dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1448-54947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR180813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010600167300001600273520136200289592002801651650001801679650002201697650001801719650001101737650001201748650001701760650001001777650002001787650001801807650001001825650001901835650001801854650002101872650003401893650003301927650001401960650002101974650001401995651001802009651001602027651001102043653001402054653001802068653002002086653000902106653000902115700002002124700002002144700001502164700002602179700001802205700001902223700002402242700002302266700002202289700002102311773010702332856008502439852000902524655001202533IND60625165620221119120253.0211003e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062516562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoutti, Heli10aContaminants in Atlantic walruses in Svalbard Part 2: Relationships with endocrine and immune systems  ap. 658-667.  aMarine mammals in the Barents Sea region have among the highest levels of contaminants recorded in the Arctic and the Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) is one of the most contaminated species within this region. We therefore investigated the relationships bewteen blubber concentrations of lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and plasma concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and markers of endocrine and immune functions in adult male Atlantic walruses (n = 38) from Svalbard, Norway. To do so, we assessed plasma concentrations of five forms of thyroid hormones and transcript levels of genes related to the endocrine and immune systems as endpoints; transcript levels of seven genes in blubber and 23 genes in blood cells were studied. Results indicated that plasma total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations and ratio of TT4 and reverse triiodothyronine decreased with increasing blubber concentrations of lipophilic POPs. Blood cell transcript levels of genes involved in the function of T and B cells (FC like receptors 2 and 5, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 and protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22) were increased with plasma PFAS concentrations. These results suggest that changes in thyroid and immune systems in adult male walruses are linked to current levels of contaminant exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aOdobenus rosmarus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadults 3ablubber 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3aimmune response 3alipophilicity 3amales 3amarine mammals 3amessenger RNA 3aperfluorocarbons 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3areceptors 3athyroid hormones 3athyroxine 3aArctic region 3aBarents Sea 3aNorway 0aPollutant 0aMarine mammal 0aThyroid hormone 0aqPCR 0amRNA1 aDiot, Béatrice1 aPanti, Cristina1 aDuale, Nur1 aFossi, Maria Cristina1 aHarju, Mikael1 aKovacs, Kit M.1 aLydersen, Christian1 aScotter, Sophie E.1 aVillanger, Gro D.1 aBourgeon, Sophie0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 Mar., v. 246 p.658-667dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.11.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245010800203300001400311506007600325520054900401592002800950506003700978650002201015650001901037650001701056650001101073650001201084650001801096650002101114650001101135650003201146650002201178650001901200650004401219650002201263650001701285650001001302650002101312650002601333650000901359651001501368700002101383700001401404700002101418700002601439700002401465700002601489700002601515773010601541856008101647852000901728655001201737IND60485940920221207114408.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048594092DNAL7 a10.1007/s13659-015-0083-12doi7 aPMC47495212pmcid7 a267462162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Qingxi10aAntiproliferative Triterpenoid Saponins from Leptaulus citroides Baill. from the Madagascar Rain Forest  ap. 31-39.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBioassay-guided fractionation of EtOH extracts obtained from the roots and wood of the Madagascan plant Leptaulus citroides Baill.

Recently switchgrass rust caused by P. emaculata (now confirmed to be Puccinia novopanici) has received most of the attention by the research community because this pathogen is responsible for reducing the biomass production and biofuel feedstock quality of switchgrass. Microsatellite markers found in the literature were either not informative (no allele frequency) or showed few polymorphisms in the target populations, therefore additional markers are needed for future studies of the genetic variation and population structure of P. novopanici. This study reports the development and characterization of novel simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from a Puccinia emaculata s.l. microsatellite-enriched library and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Microsatellites were evaluated for polymorphisms on P. emaculata s.l. urediniospores collected in Iowa (IA), Mississippi (MS), Oklahoma (OK), South Dakota (SD) and Virginia (VA). Puccinia novopanici single spore whole genome amplifications were used as templates to validate the SSR reactions protocol and to assess a preliminary population genetics statistics of the pathogen. Eighteen microsatellite markers were polymorphic (average PIC=0.72) on individual urediniospores, with an average of 8.3 alleles per locus (range 3 to 17). Of the 49 SSRs loci initially identified in P. emaculata s.l., 18 were transferable to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, 23 to P. triticina, 20 to P. sorghi and 31 to P. andropogonis. Thus, these markers could be useful for DNA fingerprinting and population structure analysis for population genetics, epidemiology and ecological studies of P. novopanici and potentially other related Puccinia species.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cOffice of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000057140 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aPanicum virgatum 3aPuccinia 3aalleles 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3aepidemiology 3aexpressed sequence tags 3afeedstocks 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3apopulation structure 3arust diseases 3astatistics 3aurediniospores 3aIowa 3aMississippi 3aOklahoma 3aSouth Dakota 3aVirginia 0aSimple sequences repeats (SSRs) 0aPuccinia 0aExpressed sequence tags (ESTs) 0aSwitchgrass1 aGarrido, Patricia1 aKronmiller, Brent1 aHunger, Robert1 aTyler, Brett M.1 aGarzon, Carla D.1 aMarek, Stephen M.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2017 Aug., v. 139 p.113-122dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2017.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03970naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245012600160300001600286520232600302592002802628650002602656650001202682650002002694650001602714650001202730650001302742650001302755650001502768650001002783650001402793650002302807650001502830650001702845650001602862650001302878651002202891653001302913653002702926653001902953653002102972653001602993700005703009700002103066700003003087700006203117700006403179773011603243856007203359852000903431655001203440IND60656010120221119062028.0190812e20190730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065601012DNAL7 a10.1071/WR181052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPage, Kimberley D.10aInfluences of behaviour and physiology on body mass gain in the woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) post-translocation  ap. 429-443.  aContext. Temperament can affect an individual’s fitness and survival if it also influences behaviours associated with predator avoidance, interactions with conspecifics, refuge selection and/or foraging. Furthermore, temperament can determine an individual’s response to novel stimuli and environmental challenges, such as those experienced through translocation. Increasing our understanding of the effect of temperament on post-translocation fitness is thus necessary for improving translocation outcomes. Aims. The aim was to test whether differences in an individual’s behaviour or physiology could help predict body mass changes post-translocation in the woylie (brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi). In the absence of predation (due to release into a predator-free exclosure), body mass was used as a proxy for an individual’s success in securing resources in the new habitat, and therefore fitness. Methods. Forty woylies were translocated from two predator-free exclosures to a larger exclosure, all in Western Australia. Behavioural and physiological measures were recorded during trapping, processing, holding, and release, and again at re-capture ∼100 days post-release. Key results. Translocated woylies generally increased in body mass post-translocation. This suggests that, in the absence of predation, the selected candidates were able to cope with the stress of translocation and possessed the behavioural plasticity to successfully find resources and adapt to a novel environment. The strongest predictors of body mass gain were sex, heart rate lability and escape behaviour when released (a convoluted escape path). Conclusions. There was no significant difference in body mass between males and females pre-translocation but females showed greater mass gain post-translocation than did males, which could reflect greater investment in reproduction (all females had pouch young). Heart rate lability and escape behaviour are likely to reflect reactivity or fearfulness, a significant temperament trait in the context of translocation success. Implications. Behavioural measures that can be easily incorporated into the translocation process – without increasing stress or affecting welfare of individuals – may hold promise for predicting the fate of translocated animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBettongia penicillata 3aanimals 3aescape behavior 3afearfulness 3afemales 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aheart rate 3amales 3apredation 3apredator avoidance 3aprediction 3areproduction 3atemperament 3atrapping 3aWestern Australia 0aactivity 0aanti-predator response 0acorticosterone 0aescape behaviour 0aheart rate.1 aRuykys, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1597-32491 aMiller, David W.1 aAdams, P.

The content of phytochemicals decreased in the order fresh>dried>dried frying processes. HPLC analysis was applied to quantify five flavonoids from peppers. Apigenin was identified as main constituent. Its content was affected by drying and dried frying processes. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH, ABTS, β-carotene bleaching test and Fe-chelating activity assay. A comparable radical scavenging activity was observed for both cultivars. Interestingly, frying process did not influenced this property. Roggiano peppers exhibited the highest antioxidant activity using β-carotene bleaching test with IC50 values of 38.1 and 24.9μg/mL for total extract and n-hexane fraction, respectively.

Gut microbes play an important role in human and animal health, and gut microbiome analysis holds great potential for evaluating health in wildlife, as microbiota can be assessed from non-invasively collected fecal samples. However, many common fecal preservation protocols (e.g. freezing at −80°C) are not suitable for field conditions, or have not been tested for long-term (greater than 2weeks) storage. In this study, we collected fresh fecal samples from captive spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) at the Columbian Park Zoo (Lafayette, IN, USA). The samples were pooled, homogenized, and preserved for up to 8weeks prior to DNA extraction and sequencing. Preservation methods included: freezing at −20°C, freezing at −80°C, immersion in 100% ethanol, application to FTA cards, and immersion in RNAlater. At 0 (fresh), 1, 2, 4, and 8weeks from fecal collection, DNA was extracted and microbial DNA was amplified and sequenced. DNA concentration, purity, microbial diversity, and microbial composition were compared across all methods and time points. DNA concentration and purity did not correlate with microbial diversity or composition. Microbial composition of frozen and ethanol samples were most similar to fresh samples. FTA card and RNAlater-preserved samples had the least similar microbial composition and abundance compared to fresh samples. Microbial composition and diversity were relatively stable over time within each preservation method. Based on these results, if freezers are not available, we recommend preserving fecal samples in ethanol (for up to 8weeks) prior to microbial extraction and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAteles geoffroyi 3aDNA 3aanimal and human health 3aethanol 3afeces 3afreezers 3afreezing 3aintestinal microorganisms 3awildlife 3azoos 3aIndiana 0aGI 0aOTU 0aQIIME 0aFTA 0aPCoA 0aFDR 0aGut microbiota 0aPrimate 0aFecal preservation method 0aFecal microbial community 0aAteles geoffroyi1 aTan, Chia L.1 aKnight, Rob1 aAmato, Katherine R.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2015 June, v. 113 p.16-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2015.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245019900177520135800376592002801734650002801762650002501790650001801815650001901833650001701852650001001869650001701879650001401896650002301910650001601933650001501949650001501964650001701979650001101996650002402007650001702031650001902048650002502067653002402092653000802116653000802124653000802132653000802140653000702148653000802155653000802163653000802171653001202179700003102191700003102222700001802253700002302271700003102294773012202325856008102447852000902528655001202537IND60684049220221123023014.0200405e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068404922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Barrueta, Tana10aEncapsulation of probiotics in whey protein isolate and modified huauzontle's starch: An approach to avoid fermentation and stabilize polyphenol compounds in a ready-to-drink probiotic green tea  aA major challenge for the development of a ready-to-drink probiotic green tea beverage (RTD-PGT) is the undesired fermentation of the product by the probiotics and loss of polyphenolic compounds during shelf-life. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the stability, cell survival and sensorial acceptability of a RTD-PGT formulated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG microencapsulated by spray drying in a matrix of whey protein isolate and modified huauzontle's starch, after refrigerated storage. Microcapsules contained 9.02 ± 0.3 log CFU/g, and for them to be incorporated to a RTD-PGT, ascorbic acid needed to be supplemented to prevent cellular loss. After 5 weeks of storage at 4 °C, the RTD-PGT showed a decrease of merely 0.44 log CFU/mL displaying final cell counts higher than the recommended 7 log CFU/mL, and no evidence of fermentation. Furthermore, 38.52 ± 0.72% of green tea polyphenols formed an insoluble complex most likely with at least one component of the microcapsules. No significant changes on the concentration of polyphenolic compounds or their antioxidant capacity were detected, and a minor change in color was quantified. The sensory shelf-life of the RTD-PGT was of at least 23 days at a 50% of consumer's rejection. In conclusion, a multipurpose encapsulation system was developed, generating a stable RTD-PGT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acell viability 3acold storage 3acolor 3afermentation 3agreen tea 3amicroencapsulation 3apolyphenols 3aprobiotics 3ashelf life 3aspray drying 3astarch 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atea (beverage) 3awhey protein isolate 0aHuauzontle's starch 0aLGG 0aNHS 0aMHS 0aWPI 0aGT 0aGTP 0aTPC 0aGAE 0aRTD-PGT1 aMartínez-Bustos, Fernando1 aCastaño Tostado, Eduardo,1 aLee, Youngsoo1 aMiller, Michael J.1 aAmaya-Llano, Silvia Lorena0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2020 Apr., v. 124 p.109131-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245010300201506007600304520156900380592002801949506003701977650001802014650002502032650002402057650001202081650001602093650002102109650001302130650002702143650001502170650000902185650002002194650002002214650003102234650001502265650002702280650001802307650001002325650004002335650003802375650001002413650002002423650001802443650002102461700001702482700001802499700001402517700001702531700001602548700001702564773012002581856007402701852000902775655001202784IND60670020520221207122713.0190925e20190918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067002052DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90906992doi7 aPMC67707902pmcid7 a315404672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Mingming 10aEffect of Bamboo Leaf Extract on Antioxidant Status and Cholesterol Metabolism in Broiler Chickens  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary bamboo leaf extract (BLE) on antioxidant status and cholesterol metabolism in broilers. One-day-old male Arbor Acres (576) broilers were randomly divided into six groups. A control group was fed a basal diet, while five experimental groups were supplemented with 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0g BLE per kg feed in their basal diets. The result indicated that BLE supplementation linearly improved eviscerated yield and decreased abdominal fat (p < 0.05). A significant decrease of serum triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) content was observed with BLE supplementation (p < 0.05). BLE supplementation linearly improved the total antioxidant capacity and catalase activity in both serum and liver (p < 0.05). Glutathione peroxidase was quadratically increased in serum and linearly increased in the liver with BLE supplementation (p < 0.05). The malonaldehyde content in liver showed a linear and quadratic decrease with BLE supplementation (p < 0.05). BLE supplementation up-regulated the mRNA expression of cholesterol 7- alpha hydroxylase and low-density lipoprotein receptor and downregulated 3-hydroxy3-methyl glutamates coenzyme A reductase mRNA expression in the liver. The antioxidant enzyme mRNA expressions were all up-regulated by BLE supplementation in the liver. In conclusion, supplemental BLE improved antioxidant status and cholesterol metabolism in broilers, which eventually led to a decrease of serum TG, LDL-c content, and abdominal fat deposition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabdominal fat 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abamboos 3ablood serum 3abroiler chickens 3acatalase 3acholesterol metabolism 3acoenzyme A 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglutamates 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aleaf extracts 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein receptors 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3atriacylglycerols1 aXie, Zechen 1 aJia, Minghui 1 aLi, Anqi 1 aHan, Hongli 1 aWang, Tian 1 aZhang, Lili 0 tAnimals.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90906993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245011500201300001400316506007600330520041000406592002800816506003700844650002200881650001600903650002700919650002600946650001500972650001000987650001700997650001601014650002201030700001701052700001901069700001901088700001601107700001401123700001801137700001601155700002001171700001801191773010601209856008101315852000901396655001201405IND60485941020221207114353.0160218e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048594102DNAL7 a10.1007/s13659-015-0085-z2doi7 aPMC47495242pmcid7 a267539202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kai10aKoninginins N-Q, Polyketides from the Endophytic Fungus Trichoderma koningiopsis Harbored in Panax notoginseng  ap. 49-55.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFour new fungal polyketides named koninginins N-Q (1–4), together with four known analogues (5–8), were isolated from the endophytic fungus Trichoderma koningiopsis YIM PH30002 harbored in Panax notoginseng.

However, dermal exposure and toxicity are often unknown for avifauna. The US EPA's Terrestrial Investigation Model (TIM) uses a method to estimate avian dermal LD50 values (and ultimately dermal exposure) that frequently results in unusually high dermal exposure and low dermal LD50 estimates. This is primarily a result of using organophosphate and carbamate toxicity data to develop the oral-dermal relationship. An estimated dermal LD50 is necessary to generate a dermal route equivalency factor that normalizes potency relative to oral toxicity within the dermal pathway dose equation. In this study, atrazine dermal absorption experiments were conducted with mallard, northern bobwhite, and rat skin. These data were used to derive an avian-mammal dermal route equivalency factor for atrazine and introduce a new approach for estimating dermal LD50 values and ultimately predicting exposure via the TIM dermal pathway. Compared to the default TIM method, this new approach yielded TIM output with lower mean total dose, lower dermal fraction of total dose, greater oral fraction of total dose, and reduced model predicted mortality for atrazine. In addition, the new approach was compared with other methods for estimating avian dermal LD50 values such as those proposed for use with mammalian data and physico-chemical properties and a triazine-specific oral-dermal equation using mammalian LD50 data. The three alternative approaches resulted in output similar to one another and different from the default TIM methods. These results indicate that a dermal route equivalency factor derived from empirical data provides a higher avian dermal LD50 estimate that is consistent with other methods. In addition, the use of this dermal route equivalency factor results in greatly reduced modeled atrazine risk to birds than previously reported in US EPA risk assessments using TIM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aabsorption 3aatrazine 3aavifauna 3abirds 3acarbon 3adermal exposure 3aenvironmental assessment 3aequations 3aexposure models 3alethal dose 50 3amortality 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3arats 3arisk 0aAtrazine 0aAvian dermal absorption 0aAvian risk assessment 0aDermal exposure modeling 0aTerrestrial investigation model1 aBlackstock, Craig1 aBrain, Richard A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 July 15, v. 630 p.517-525dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245010300128300001600231520155800247592002801805650002001833650001901853650001901872650001101891650002401902650001201926651001001938653003001948653001301978653001201991653001902003653002202022700002002044700002002064773018302084852000902267655001202276IND60128394820221119054614.0151124e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiaojia, Li10aModeling the Effects of Climate Change and Elevated CO2 on Soil Organic Carbon in an Alpine Steppe  ap. 168-174.  aThe objective of this study was to analyze the effects of climate change and doubled atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, as well as the combined effects of climate change and doubling atmospheric CO₂ concentrations on soil organic carbon (SOC) in the alpine steppe of the northern Tibetan Plateau using the CENTURY model. The results indicate that SOC loss in climate change scenarios varied from 49.77–52.36% in the top 20 cm. The simulation results obtained for a P1T0 scenario (increased precipitation and unchanged temperature), P0T1 scenario (unchanged precipitation and increased temperature), and P1T1 scenario (increased precipitation and increased temperature) were similar. The alpine steppe in the P1T1 scenarios lost the greatest amount of SOC (844.40 g C m-², representing the least amount of SOC) by the end of the simulation. The simulation for P0T1 scenarios resulted in a 49.77% loss of SOC. However, SOC increased 12.87% under the CO₂ doubling scenario, compared with the unchanged CO₂ scenario. CO₂ enhancement effects on SOC were greater than the climate change effects on SOC alone. The simulation of combined climate change and doubling atmospheric CO₂ led to a decrease in SOC. This result indicated a decrease of 52.39% in SOC for the P1T1 + 2 × CO₂ scenario, 49.81% for the P0T1 + 2 × CO₂ scenario. and 52.30% for the P1T0 + 2 × CO₂ scenario over the next 50 years. Therefore, SOC content in the alpine steppe will change because of changes in precipitation, temperature and atmospheric CO₂ concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3amodels 3asoil organic carbon 3asteppes 3aChina 0asoil organic carbon (SOC) 0amodeling 0aCENTURY 0aclimate change 0aCO2 concentration1 aXianzhou, Zhang1 aYangjian, Zhang0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2011 June, v. 2, no. 2 p.168-174dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010500174300001800279520111600297592002801413650001901441650001101460650000901471651001101480653002901491653002801520653001301548653001501561700002601576700001901602773011601621856008401737852000901821655001201830IND60121973620221118192551.0150324e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012197362DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2014.9579562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos-Reyes, Jaime10aModeling Critical Infrastructure Interdependency: The Case of the Mexico City Metro Transport System  ap. 1428-1444.  a“Critical infrastructures” are exceedingly complex and highly interconnected. In order to gain a full understanding and comprehensive awareness of the risks associated with critical infrastructures it becomes essential to consider in a coherent way all the aspects that may cause a failure of such systems. That is, there is a need for a systemic approach to interdependencies among critical infrastructures. The article presents the application of a systemic safety management system (SSMS) model to interdependency modeling for the case of the Mexico City Metro transport network. The model has highlighted that interdependencies occur vertically and horizontally. Horizontal interdependency occurs at every level of recursion and can be: operational, managerial, and environmental. Vertical interdependency, on the other hand, occurs between two levels of recursion only. The SSMS model has shown the potential to be used to model interdependencies among critical infrastructures. It is hoped that the approach presented may help to gain a better understanding of critical infrastructure interdependency.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3arisk 3aMexico 0acritical infrastructures 0ametro transport network 0asystemic 0aSSMS model1 aPadilla-Pérez, Diego1 aBeard, Alan N.0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2015 July 4, v. 21, no. 5 p.1428-1444dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2014.9579563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007400161520121800235592002801453650004301481650002801524650002001552650001601572650002701588650002901615650002301644650002301667650002001690650001901710650002501729650002301754650002001777650001501797650001001812650001601822650001501838650002401853653002401877653002301901700001501924700001501939700001401954700001701968700001201985700001501997700001802012773012202030856008102152852000902233655001202242IND60684049320221123022928.0200405e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068404932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xi10aStudy on intestinal survival and cholesterol metabolism of probiotics  aHypercholesterolemia drives the development of cardiovascular disease, Supplementation with probiotics that interfere with cholesterol metabolism provide a contribution to disease prevention. 54 strains with good hydrophobicity were measured bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity and cholesterol removal ability.

The gold nanoparticles are deposited onto a transparent conductive substrate, and an electrical bias applied on the conductive substrate can cause shift of resonance plasmon response, where the direction of peak shift is related to the polarity of applied bias. The peak shift observed at 2.4 V is approximately ten times larger than those reported in previous work. It is postulated that significant peak shift is the result of reorientation of adsorbed water on electrode, which can change local dielectric environment of nanoparticles. An energy barrier is identified when adsorbed water molecules are turned from oxygen-down to oxygen-up. Frequency-dependent peak shifts on surface-modified gold nanoparticles show that reorientation is a fast reversible process with rich dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aspectroscopy1 aXu, Shandong1 aWang, Chaoming1 aWang, Haining1 aZou, Shengli1 aSu, Ming0 tLangmuir.g2017 Feb. 14, v. 33, no. 6 p.1437-1441dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b035373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245009500127300001600222520157500238592002801813650001801841650001201859650002101871650002601892650001001918650001001928650002201938650003001960650001501990650000902005650001102014650001402025651001002039653002302049653002002072653002402092653001402116653002802130700001502158700001302173700001602186700001602202700001702218700001702235773018302252852000902435655001202444IND60128395020221119054519.0151124e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012839502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJinbin, Li10aGeographic Distribution of Avirulence Genes in Rice Blast Fungus in Yunnan Province, China  ap. 181-185.  aKnowledge of the geographic distribution and frequency of avirulence genes will contribute to the development of strategies to effectively use rice varieties that carry various resistances genes, including combinations of varieties in mixture cropping systems. Here, we analyzed the geographic distribution and frequencies of avirulence genes in rice blast fungus using samples collected from 11 prefectures across Yunnan province, China. A total of 467 single spore isolates were assayed for pathotypes based on their reaction to 20 rice blast resistance monogenic lines. The results revealed that frequencies of avirulence genes among 10 prefectures showed insignificant difference, but frequencies of avirulence genes in Xishuangbanna showed significant differences compared to the remaining 10 prefectures. The avirulence genes Avr-Pi9, Avr-Piz and Avr-Pizt were observed at the highest frequency in blast isolates from the 11 prefectures; their average frequency was greater than 80%. Our results imply that the composition and distribution of rice genetic diversity are more important than climate and other environment conditions for formation and maintenance of rice blast fungus genetic diversity. Using average frequencies, the avirulence genes can be categorized into 4 groups. There were significant differences of frequencies of avirulence genes among different groups, while insignificant differences observed within any group. These results will provide useful information for evaluation of resistance genes and effective management of rice blast disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablast disease 3aclimate 3acropping systems 3aenvironmental factors 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3apathotypes 3arice 3aspores 3avarieties 3aChina 0aMagnaporthe grisea 0aavirulence gene 0arice monogenic line 0afrequency 0ageographic distribution1 aJing, Yang1 aLin, Liu1 aHanming, He1 aXiahong, He1 aYouyong, Zhu1 aChengyun, Li0 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2011 June, v. 2, no. 2 p.181-185dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1674-764X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04227naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245020900207506007600416520211300492592002802605506003702633650002002670650001302690650002502703650001702728650001402745650001402759650001502773650001302788650001102801650000902812650002102821650001802842650001002860650002102870650001502891650001802906650001002924650002002934650001002954650002302964650001002987650001202997650001803009650002103027650004303048650005203091650002403143650001303167650001003180650002003190700001903210700001803229700002303247700001803270700003003288700002003318773012003338856007403458852000903532655001203541IND60670020720221207134845.0190925e20190919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067002072DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90907012doi7 aPMC67707732pmcid7 a315468222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamdard, Enayatullah 10aDenatonium Benzoate-Induces Oxidative Stress in the Heart and Kidney of Chinese Fast Yellow Chickens by Regulating Apoptosis, Autophagy, Antioxidative Activities and Bitter Taste Receptor Gene Expressions  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe sense of taste which tells us which prospective foods are nutritious, poisonous and harmful is essential for the life of the organisms. Denatonium benzoate (DB) is a bitter taste agonist known for its activation of bitter taste receptors in different cells. The aim of the current study was to investigate the mRNA expressions of bitter taste, downstream signaling effectors, apoptosis-, autophagy- and antioxidant-related genes and effector signaling pathways in the heart/kidney of chickens after DB dietary exposure. We randomly assigned 240, 1-day-old Chinese Fast Yellow chicks into four groups with five replicates of 12 chicks and studied them for 28 consecutive days. The dietary treatments consisted of basal diet and feed containing DB (5, 20 and 100 mg/kg). The results revealed that dietary DB impaired (p < 0.05) the growth performance of the chickens. Haemotoxylin and eosin staining and TUNEL assays confirmed that medium and high doses of DB damaged the epithelial cells of heart/kidney and induced apoptosis and autophagy. Remarkably, the results of RT-PCR and qRT-PCR indicated that different doses of DB gradually increased (p < 0.05) mRNA expressions of bitter taste, signaling effectors, apoptosis-, autophagy- and antioxidant- related genes on day 7 in a dose-response manner, while, these expressions were decreased (p < 0.05) subsequently by day-28 but exceptional higher (P < 0.05) expressions were observed in the high-dose DB groups of chickens. In conclusion, DB exerts adverse effects on the heart/kidney of chickens in a dose-response manner via damaging the epithelium of the heart/kidney by inducing apoptosis, autophagy associated with bitter taste and effector gene expressions. Correlation analyses for apoptosis/autophagy showed agonistic relationships. Our data provide a novel perspective for understanding the interaction of bitter taste, apoptosis, autophagy and antioxidative genes with bitter taste strong activators in the heart/kidney of chicken. These insights might help the feed industries and pave the way toward innovative directions in chicken husbandry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3aagonists 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abitterness 3achickens 3achicks 3adiet 3adietary exposure 3adose response 3aeosin 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afeed industry 3afoods 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth performance 3aheart 3akidneys 3amessenger RNA 3aoxidative stress 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3ataste 3ataste receptors1 aShi, Zhicheng 1 aLv, Zengpeng 1 aZahir, Ahmadullah 1 aWei, Quanwei 1 aRahmani, Mohammad  Malyar1 aShi, Fangxiong 0 tAnimals.g2019 Sept. 19, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90907013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009000167300001800257520131100275592002801586650001901614650002501633650002401658650001101682650001701693650002101710650001901731653002601750653000901776653003701785653001501822653001801837773011601855856008401971852000902055655001202064IND60121973820221118192619.0150324e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012197382DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2014.9583722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanık, Seda10aReverse Logistics Network Design under the Risk of Hazardous Materials Transportation  ap. 1277-1298.  aAn effective reverse logistics network design (RLND) has several implications, such as decrease in logistics costs and environmental damage. Some products in the RL may contain hazardous substances. In such cases, the environmental aspects of RLND should be identified considering the risks of hazardous materials transportation. In this study, a holistic approach is employed involving the forecasting of return amount of products, risk modeling of hazardous materials transportation, and capacitated plant location modeling under risk. An application for the reverse logistics of large household appliances in Turkey, which is aiming to implement the European Union directive for waste electric and electronic equipment, is presented. First, the decisions of suitable places for treatment facilities and the assignments of the returned products to these facilities are made without considering the risk factor. In this case, the objective is to minimize the total logistics costs. In the second case, risk factors are incorporated in the model and the objective is defined as the minimization of the costs and hazmat transportation risks. It is seen that different locations and allocation decisions are obtained for the case without considering the risk and the case under risk of hazmat transportation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aelectronic equipment 3ahousehold equipment 3amodels 3arisk factors 3atoxic substances 3atransportation 0ahazmat transportation 0aMILP 0areverse logistics network design 0aregression 0arisk modeling0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2015 July 4, v. 21, no. 5 p.1277-1298dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2014.9583723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012100169520101200290592002801302650002101330650001201351650002501363650002401388650002001412650001501432650001201447650001001459650002801469650001501497650004301512650002301555650002201578650002001600650000901620650001001629650001901639650001601658650002001674650001001694650001001704653002401714653002301738653001201761653001401773700002301787700002501810700002001835700001901855700002201874700002501896773012201921856008102043852000902124655001202133IND60684049520221123023037.0200405e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068404952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1091342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPigni, Natalia B.10aChemical profile and bioaccessibility of polyphenols from wheat pasta supplemented with partially-deoiled chia flour  aThe by-product obtained after the oil extraction from chia seeds has been used to produce supplemented wheat pasta, generating a food product with improved nutritional quality. In a previous work, we have demonstrated its technological feasibility, as well as its good acceptance by semi-trained judges. One of the enhanced nutritional properties of the supplemented pasta was the antioxidant capacity. In the present work, we characterize the phenolic composition of partially-deoiled chia flour and the supplemented pasta by HPLC-MS/MS. Fourteen polyphenols, mostly phenolic acids, have been identified in the acetone/water (4:1) extract. The two major components were rosmarinic acid and its glycoside (salviaflaside). The study of the effects of cooking on the phenolic profile showed that many bioactive components of chia seeds remain stable at the moment of intake. Finally, the bioaccessibility of the polyphenols has been assessed through an in vitro simulation of human gastrointestinal digestion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvia hispanica 3aacetone 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3abyproducts 3acooking 3aflour 3agastrointestinal system 3aglycosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro digestion 3amass spectrometry 3anutritive value 3aoils 3apasta 3aphenolic acids 3apolyphenols 3arosmarinic acid 3aseeds 3awheat 0aSalvia hispanica L. 0aPhenolic compounds 0aHPLC-MS 0aDigestion1 aAranibar, Carolina1 aLucini Mas, Agustín1 aAguirre, Alicia1 aBorneo, Rafael1 aWunderlin, Daniel1 aBaroni, M.

To further understand the potential impact caused by PWN in Yunnan pine populations, a transcriptional profiling analysis was performed over different time points (0 hours (h), 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days) after PWN inoculation. A total of 9961 differentially expressed genes were identified after inoculation, which suggested a dynamic response against the pathogen, with a more intense pattern at 48 h after inoculation. The results also highlighted a set of biological mechanisms triggered after inoculation that provide valuable information regarding the response of Yunnan pine to PWN infection. When compared with maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), the Yunnan pine response was less complex and involved a smaller number of differentially expressed genes, which may be associated with the increased degree of resistance to PWN displayed by Yunnan pine. These results revealed different strategies to cope with PWN infection by these two pine species, which display contrasting degrees of susceptibility, especially in the timely perception of the infection and response magnitude.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aPinus pinaster 3aPinus yunnanensis 3aconifers 3aforests 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3apathogens 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3atrees 3avascular wilt1 aTrindade, Cândida 1 aUsié, Ana 1 aMeireles, Brigida 1 aFortes, Ana Margarida 1 aGuimarães, Joana Bagoin 1 aSimões, Fernanda 1 aCosta, Rita Lourenço 1 aRamos, António Marcos 0 tForests.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110202043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007700164300001400241520119900255592002801454650002201482650001901504650001101523650002201534650003501556650001201591650001001603650002001613650003101633650001001664650002001674650001801694650002501712650001401737650005201751650002001803650002101823650004201844650001101886650002901897653001601926653002301942653003001965653001101995653002202006653004802028700001302076700001702089773010302106856008402209852000902293655001202302IND60524617320221121100427.0160711e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052461732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xinyi10aOctylphenol induced gene expression in testes of Frog, Rana chensinensis  ap. 75-82.  aOctylphenol (OP) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), which can disrupt the reproductive system. To understand the effect of OP, a subtractive cDNA library was constructed using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) to identify alterations of gene transcription in the testes of the frog Rana chensinensis after OP exposure. Two hundred positive clones were selected and 134 sequences of gene fragments were produced from the subtractive library randomly. These genes were identified to be involved in metabolic process, cellular process, biological regulation, stimulus, immune system and female pregnancy process. In order to verify the efficiency of the subtractive cDNA library, PSG9 and PAPP-A were analyzed further as two representatives of differentially expressed transcription genes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Our result was the first successful construction of the subtractive cDNA library in frog testes after OP treatment. Based on this cDNA library, OP was shown to affect multiple physiological processes including inducing immune response, disrupting the steroid hormone synthesis and influencing spermatogenesis in the testis by up-regulation of specific genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana chensinensis 3acDNA libraries 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3afemales 3afrogs 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3anucleotide sequences 3apregnancy 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspermatogenesis 3asteroid hormones 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3atestes 3atranscription (genetics) 0aOctylphenol 0aGene transcription 0aDifferent gene expression 0aTestis 0aRana chensinensis 0aSuppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH)1 aLiu, Jia1 aZhang, Yuhui0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2016 June, v. 128 p.75-82dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle08977naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245007800158300001600236500000900252500001500261520770100276592002807977650001308005650001208018650001608030650001808046650002108064650002008085651001408105653001808119653001508137700001708152700002008169700001608189700001808205700002108223773020208244852000908446856007708455990002308532655001208555IND2060551820221121001744.0191122e199704  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206055182DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1997.02932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, P.

The impact of corn hybrid and plant population on grain yield may be influenced by row width. This study was designed to investigate the relationships between row width, plant population, and hybrid at three Minnesota locations from 1992 through 1994. At Lamberton and Waseca, row widths were 10, 20, and 30 in.; target populations were 25 000, 30 000, 35 000, and 40 000 plants/acre; and hybrids were Ciba ‘G4372,’ DeKalb ‘DK512,’ and Pioneer Brand ‘P3563’. At Morris, the same row widths were evaluated but the target populations were 22 000, 27 000, and 32 000 plants/acre and the hybrids were Northrup King ‘N3624,’ DeKalb ‘DK421,’ and Pioneer Brand ‘P3751’. At Lamberton and Waseca, the yield advantage for both 10- and 20-in. rows compared with 30-in. rows was 7.2% when averaged over all hybrids and all plant populations, whereas at Morris the yield advantage was 8.5%. Choice of hybrid influenced grain yield, and all hybrids responded similarly to change in row width and change in plant population at the three locations. Grain yields increased at Lamberton and Waseca with higher plant populations in 1992 and 1994, but not in 1993 when yields were limited by climatic conditions. Regression analysis of yield vs. harvest plant population showed yields were highest at populations at or above 35 000 plants/acre in 1992 at Lamberton and 1994 at Waseca and Lamberton, but were unaffected by plant populations in 1992 at Waseca and in 1993 at both locations. At Morris, regression analysis of yield vs. harvest plant population in 1993 and 1994 showed yields were highest at plant populations of 32 000 plants/acre, the highest plant population studied at that location. Choice of hybrid and the growing season climatic conditions had a greater effect on grain moisture content at harvest, test weight, and ear length than row width or plant population. These data show a yield advantage for narrowing row widths from 30 to 20 or 10 in., and that in some years maximum yields were obtained at harvest plant populations substantially higher than the current Minnesota population of 26 400 plants/acre. Research QuestionMost corn in the northern Corn Belt is grown in 30-in. or wider row widths at populations ranging from 24 000 to 28 000 plantdacre. The trend has been toward narrower row widths and increasing plant populations. Some Minnesota producers want to match row width of corn and soybean with that of sugarbeet, which is typically grown in 22-in. rows. This desire, coupled with improved genetics that have resulted in better standability and greater tolerance to higher plant populations in corn, necessitates a reevaluation of the relationship between row width, plant population, and corn hybrid. The objectives of this study were to: (i) determine whether current corn hybrids respond similarly to row width, and (ii) determine whether the response is affected by plant population. Literature SummaryWhile there have been numerous studies of the effect of plant population on corn yield, there have been relatively few that have evaluated plant population and row width with the current high yielding hybrids grown in the northern Corn Belt. Study DescriptionA 3-yr field study (1992–1994) was conducted at three Minnesota locations to examine the relationship between row width, plant population, and hybrid. Locations: Lamberton, Waseca, and Morris Row widths: 30, 20, and 10 in. Target plant populations: 25 000, 30 000, 35 000, and 40 000 plant/acre at Lamberton and Waseca; 22 000, 27 000, and 32 000 plantdacre at Morris Corn hybrids: Ciba ‘G4372,’ DeKalb ‘DK512,’ and Pioneer Brand ‘P3563’ at Lamberton and Waseca; Northrup King ‘3624,’ DeKalb ‘DK421,’ and Pioneer Brand ‘P3751’ at Morris Planting date was timely at all location all years. In 1993, rainfall was much above normal and early-season temperatures were below normal.

Each year of the study and at all locations corn planted on 20- and 10-in. rows yielded more than corn planted on 30-in. rows. At Lamberton and Waseca, the yield advantage for 10- and 20-in. rows compared with 30-in. rows was 7.2% when averaged over all hybrids and all plant populations, whereas at Moms the yield advantage was 8.5%. There was no yield advantage for 10-in. rows compared with 20-in. rows. Yields averaged over 3 yr (1992–1994) and several hybrids are listed below: YieldRow widthLambertonWasecaMorris------------- bushels/acre -------------30-in.12714610620-in.13615711510-in.137155116Should plant population be changed if corn is planted in rows narrower than 30 in.? At Lamberton and Waseca, there was no interaction between row width and plant population, suggesting that plant population should not be changed when planting in row widths narrower than 30 in. At Moms, the yields were unaffected by plant population for the narrower rows evaluated, but declined at the intermediate plant population for the 30-in. row width. At Lamberton and Waseca grain yields increased with greater plant populations in 1992 and 1994, but not in 1993 when yields were low due to climatic conditions. Regression analysis of yield vs. harvest plant population showed yields were highest at populations at or above 35 000 plan/acre in 1992 at Lamberton and 1994 at Waseca and Lamberton, but were unaffected by plant populations in 1992 at Waseca and in 1993 at both locations. At Moms, regression analysis of yield vs. harvest plant population in 1993 and 1994 showed yields were highest at populations of 32 000 plantdacre, the highest plant population studied at that location. Do hybrids differ in response to row width and plant population? Choice of hybrid influenced grain yield, but had no interactive effect with row width or plant population at the three locations. It is important to note that the hybrids evaluated were planted in a timely fashion and were considered to be adapted high yielding hybrids for the locations where they were grown. Choice of hybrid and existing climatic conditions had a greater effect on grain moisture content at harvest, test weight, and ear length than row width or plant population. RecommendationThere was a yield advantage for narrowing row widths from 30 to 20 or 10 in., and in some years maximum yields were obtained at plant populations substantially higher than the current average population in Minnesota of 26 400 plant/acre. In contemplating a switch to narrower row corn, many factors have to be considered: planter, cultivator, and combine capabilities; tractor tire width; and the impact on other crops in the cropping system. Whether it is economically advantageous to switch to row widths narrower than 30-in. will depend on the cost involved to convert current equipment. Growers who are producing one or more crops in 20- or 22-in. rows should seriously consider growing corn in these row widths. Currently, it appears impractical to grow corn on a large scale in 10-in. rows because of equipment limitations and the inability to cultivate for weed control if necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3ahybrids 3arow spacing 3aplant density 3ayield components 3acrop management 3aMinnesota 0aprecipitation 0acrop yield1 aHicks, D.

Intrinsic growth potential decreases with age, and thus one strategy to identify molecular pathways controlling intrinsic growth potential is by studying developing young neurons. The programmed and stereotypic remodeling of Drosophila mushroom body (MB) neurons during metamorphosis offers a unique opportunity to uncover such mechanisms. Despite emerging insights into MB γ-neuron axon pruning, nothing is known about the ensuing axon re-extension. RESULTS: Using mosaic loss of function, we found that the nuclear receptor UNF (Nr2e3) is cell autonomously required for the re-extension of MB γ-axons following pruning, but not for the initial growth or guidance of any MB neuron type. We found that UNF promotes this process of developmental axon regrowth via the TOR pathway as well as a late axon guidance program via an unknown mechanism. We have thus uncovered a novel developmental program of axon regrowth that is cell autonomously regulated by the UNF nuclear receptor and the TOR pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that UNF activates neuronal re-extension during development. Taken together, we show that axon growth during developmental remodeling is mechanistically distinct from initial axon outgrowth. Due to the involvement of the TOR pathway in axon regeneration following injury, our results also suggests that developmental regrowth shares common molecular mechanisms with regeneration following injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3ametamorphosis 3amushroom bodies 3aneurons 3apruning 3aregrowth 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aAxonsxphysiology 2aDrosophilaxphysiology 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetamorphosis, Biologicalxphysiology 2aMonomeric GTP-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMushroom Bodiesxphysiology 2aNerve Regenerationxphysiology 2aNeuropeptidesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclearxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTOR Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aIssman-Zecharya, Noa1 aOren-Suissa, Meital1 aPodbilewicz, Benjamin1 aSchuldiner, Oren0 tCurrent biology.g2012 Oct. 9, v. 22, no. 19 p.1774-1782dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245011800181500001900299520104200318592002801360650002801388650002201416650001701438650001601455650001601471650001601487650002001503650002101523650001501544650001901559650001701578650002101595650001601616653001201632653005401644653003201698700002101730700001801751700002601769700002601795773012001821856008501941852000902026655001202035IND60705672620221119061453.0201025e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070567262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1587672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScodelaro Bilbao, Paola G.10aCrosstalk between sterol and neutral lipid metabolism in the alga Haematococcus pluvialis exposed to light stress  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe presence, biosynthesis and functional role of sterols in the green microalga Haematococcus pluvialis remain poorly understood. In this work we studied the effect of high-light (HL) stress on sterol synthesis in H. pluvialis UTEX 2505 cells. HL stress induced the synthesis of sterols in parallel with that of triacylglycerides (TAG), giving rise to the synthesis of cholesterol over that of phytosterols. Blockage of the carotenogenic 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (MEP) pathway is shown to be involved in HL-induced sterol synthesis. In addition, high irradiance exposure induced MEP- and fatty acid (FA)-biosynthetic transcripts. The pharmacological inhibition of these pathways suggests a possible feedback regulation of sterol and FA homeostasis. Finally, both lipid classes proved crucial to the adequate photosynthetic performance of H. pluvialis grown under HL intensity stress.

Two-year-old date palm plants were subjected for five months at different Cd stress levels (0, 10 and 30mg CdCl2kg−1 soil) whether supplied or not with exogenous proline (20mM) added through the irrigation water. Different levels of Cd stress altered plant growth, gas exchanges and chlorophyll content as well as water status, but at different extent among them. In contrast, an increase of antioxidant enzymes activities of Cd-treated plants in association with high amounts of proline content, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and electrolyte leakage (EL) were observed. Interestingly, exogenous proline mitigated the adverse effects of Cd on young date palm. Indeed, it alleviated the oxidative damage induced by Cd accumulation and established better levels of plant growth, water status and photosynthetic activity. Moreover, proline-treated plants showed high antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxydase) in roots and leaves as compared to Cd-treated plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3aadverse effects 3acadmium 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airrigation water 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aproline 3aroots 3asoil 3asolutes 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aExogenous proline 0aDate palm 0aCadmium 0aPhotosynthesis 0aOxidative stress 0aAntioxidant enzymes1 aBen Ahmed, Ch.1 aZorrig, W.1 aElloumi, N.1 aRabhi, M.1 aDelmail, D.1 aBen Rouina, B.1 aLabrousse, P.1 aBen Abdallah, F.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2016 June, v. 128 p.100-108dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001700176245013700193300001500330520124100345592002801586650001801614650001301632650001901645650002601664650001501690650001301705650003301718650002301751650001201774650001501786700001801801700001801819700001601837700001501853700001601868773015201884856006902036856010602105990002302211852000902234655001202243IND60643199820221118045903.0190510e20181003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064319982DNAL7 a10.3791/580402doi7 aPMC62354062pmcid7 a303463872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wanwen10aNondestructive monitoring of degradable scaffold-based tissue-engineered blood vessel development using optical coherence tomography  ap. e58040.  aEngineered vascular grafts with structural and mechanical properties similar to natural blood vessels are expected to meet the growing demand for arterial bypass. Characterization of the growth dynamics and remodeling process of degradable polymer scaffold-based tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) with pulsatile stimulation is crucial for vascular tissue engineering. Optical imaging techniques stand out as powerful tools for monitoring vascularization of engineered tissue enabling high-resolution imaging in real-time culture. This paper demonstrates a nondestructive and fast real-time imaging strategy to monitor the growth and remodeling of TEBVs in long-term culture by using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Geometric morphology is evaluated, including vascular remodeling process, wall thickness, and comparison of TEBV thickness in different culture time points and presence of pulsatile stimulation. Finally, OCT provides practical possibilities for real-time observation of the degradation of polymer in the reconstructing tissues under pulsatile stimulation or not and in each vessel segment, by compared with the assessment of polymer degradation using scanning electron microscopic(SEM) and polarized microscope.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood vessels 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3amechanical properties 3amonitoring 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atissue engineering 3atissues 3atomography1 aLiu, Shangmin1 aYang, Junqing1 aWu, Yueheng1 aMa, Wentao1 aLin, Zhanyi0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Oct. 03, , no. 140 p.e58040-e58040dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/580403Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58040/nondestructive-monitoring-degradable-scaffold-based-tissue-engineered  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003200166245009300198300001600291520158100307592002801888650001301916650001101929650002101940650001301961650001501974650001101989650002802000650001302028650001502041650001602056650002302072650001702095650001502112651001102127653001702138653002102155653002202176700003102198700002802229700004102257700003502298700002502333773012902358856008102487852000902568655001202577IND60650537020221120120643.0190710e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065053702DNAL7 a301324212pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299180007292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Fernando César10aChanges occurring in stabilized ultra-high-temperature-treated whole milk during storage  ap. 449-452.  aThis Research Communication describes the relationship between casein, free fatty acids (FFAs) and the storage period of ultra-high temperature-treated (UHT) whole milk observed for a period of 120 d of labelled shelf-life. Moreover, we aim to estimate the daily rate of casein degradation in UHT whole milk, and the total length of time estimated for its full degradation. With this aim, ten sets of samples were evaluated from batches of UHT milk manufactured by a dairy processing plant in Parana State, Brazil on 10 different days. Each set was comprised of one liter of raw milk and 12 units of 1 litre cartons of UHT milk, and represented one batch of production. Total mesophilic (TMC), psychrotrophic (TPC), and somatic cell counts (SCC) of raw milk were assessed. UHT milk was assessed for fat (%), sialic acid (mg/l), casein (%), and FFA contents. TMC ranged from 3·5 × 10⁶ to 3·1 × 10⁷ CFU/ml; TPC, from 10⁶ UFC/ml and higher; and SCC, from 18 × 10⁴ SC/ml to 4·83 × 10⁵ CS/ml. Casein (r = −0·991; R² = 0·9822) and FFA (r = 0·962; R² = 0·9245) contents, and storage time of UHT milk were correlated (P < 0·05). The rate of casein hydrolysis was estimated as 0·021 g/100 g UHT whole milk/day. A complete breakdown of casein was estimated to occur by the 560ᵗʰ day post-manufacture. Although age gelation was not observed in our study, the report herein corroborates the understanding that the microbiological quality and SCC of raw milk are important components involving the integrity of casein and lipids of UHT milk during shelf-life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT milk 3acasein 3afree fatty acids 3agelation 3ahydrolysis 3alipids 3amicrobiological quality 3araw milk 3ashelf life 3asialic acid 3asomatic cell count 3astorage time 3awhole milk 3aBrazil 0aAge gelation 0araw milk quality 0aheat treated milk1 ada Cunha, Fabiano Érisson1 ade Pádua Alves, Érika1 ade Almeida Bergonse Pereira, Flávia1 ade Santana, Elsa Helena Walter1 aBotaro, Bruno Garcia0 tJournal of dairy research.g2018 Nov., v. 85, no. 4 p.449-452dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299180007293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013100165500001900296520144200315592002801757650001401785650002001799650001601819650002101835650002201856650001001878650001801888650001701906650001801923650002801941650002101969650002101990650001102011650001702022650002902039653000802068653000802076653001002084653001402094700001202108700001602120700001802136700001802154700001402172700002002186700001602206700001802222700001502240700001502255773012002270856008502390852000902475655001202484IND60705672920221119061823.0201025e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070567292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1587792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ying10aSalvianolic acid B ameliorates atherosclerosis via inhibiting YAP/TAZ/JNK signaling pathway in endothelial cells and pericytes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic disease of the arterial wall where both innate and adaptive immunoinflammatory mechanisms are involved. Inflammation plays an important role in the pathological process of atherosclerosis at various stages. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also known as WWTR1) behave as a novel drug target against atherosclerosis. Therefore, the mechanism relationship of YAP/TAZ, inflammation and AS was explored in this study. Experiments demonstrated that serine dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of YAP was increased in ECs and pericytes induced by oxidative low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), while the inhibition of YAP degraded the expression of downstream inflammatory factors. The expression of YAP/TAZ and inflammation proteins (JNK, NF-κB and TNF-α) in ECs and pericytes was suppressed through the application of Sal-B. Besides, Sal-B protects ECs and pericytes from oxidative stress and apoptosis. In vivo, Sal-B reduced en face and aortic root sinus lesions size, and decreased the expression of inflammation related factors (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and ox-LDL in serum sample of ApoE⁻/⁻ mice fed a high fat diet. Therefore, our work provides a potential therapeutic strategy of using Sal-B to attenuate the development of atherosclerosis, the anti-atherosclerosis effects of Sal-B is related to regulate YAP/TAZ/JNK signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3achronic diseases 3adephosphorylation 3adrugs 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoxidative stress 3asalvianolic acid 3aserine 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 0aYAP 0aTAZ 0aSal-B 0aPericytes1 aPei, Ke1 aZhang, Qian1 aWang, Danyang1 aFeng, Huichao1 aDu, Ziwei1 aZhang, Chunxiao1 aGao, Zichen1 aYang, Wenqing1 aWu, Jibiao1 aLi, Yunlun0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2020 Oct., v. 1865, no. 10 p.158779-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.1587793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245009500191300001600286520114900302592002801451650002101479650001101500650002901511650002701540650002301567650001301590650000901603650001501612650001501627650001501642653002701657653001901684653002001703653002501723700002401748700001601772700002301788700001701811700002601828700002601854700002201880700001901902773012901921856008102050852000902131655001202140IND60650537120221120120747.0190710e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065053712DNAL7 a301366382pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299180007302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheikh, Ishfaq Ahmad10aLactoperoxidase immobilization on silver nanoparticles enhances its antimicrobial activity  ap. 460-464.  aLactoperoxidase (LPO) is an antimicrobial protein present in milk that plays an important role in natural defence mechanisms during neonatal and adult life. The antimicrobial activity of LPO has been commercially adapted for increasing the shelf life of dairy products. Immobilization of LPO on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is a promising way to enhance the antimicrobial activity of LPO. In the current study, LPO was immobilized on AgNPs to form LPO/AgNP conjugate. The immobilized LPO/AgNP conjugate was characterized by various biophysical techniques. The enhanced antibacterial activity of the conjugate was tested against E. coli in culture at 2 h intervals for 10 h. The results showed successful synthesis of spherical AgNPs. LPO was immobilized on AgNPs with agglomerate sizes averaging approximately 50 nm. The immobilized conjugate exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against E. coli in comparison to free LPO. This study may help in increasing the efficiency of lactoperoxidase system and will assist in identifying novel avenues to enhance the stability and antimicrobial function of LPO system in dairy and other industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadults 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial proteins 3adefense mechanisms 3aindustry 3amilk 3ananosilver 3aperoxidase 3ashelf life 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aimmobilization 0alactoperoxidase 0asilver nanoparticles1 aYāsir, Muḥammad,1 aKhan, Imran1 aKhan, Sher Bahadur1 aAzum, Naveed1 aJiffri, Essam Hussain1 aKamal, Mohammad Amjad1 aAshraf, Ghulam Md1 aBeg, Mohd Amin0 tJournal of dairy research.g2018 Nov., v. 85, no. 4 p.460-464dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299180007303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012900158300002000287520186900307592002802176650002102204650001702225650001502242650001402257650001102271650001502282650001002297650002402307650001502331650001502346650001102361650002202372650001702394650001602411650001902427653004002446653003002486653002502516653002102541653003002562700001602592700001702608700001802625700005502643700005502698700005602753773014202809856007802951852000903029655001203038IND60626756220221122125525.0181226e20181203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062675622DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b169622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bin10aOstwald Ripening Driven Exfoliation to Ultrathin Layered Double Hydroxides Nanosheets for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction  ap. 44518-44526.  aAs a key half-reaction in water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process is kinetically sluggish. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are regarded as the highly promising electrocatalysts to promote the OER kinetics. However, the closely stacking layered structure of pristine bulk LDHs restricts the exposure of electrocatalytically active sites, and it remains a great challenge to find an efficient strategy to exfoliate the bulk LDHs into ultrathin and stable nanosheets with increased surface area and exposed active sites. Herein, a novel Ostwald ripening driven exfoliation (ORDE) of NiFe LDHs has been achieved in situ on the electrodes by spontaneously self-etching and redepositing via a simple hydrothermal treatment without the assistance of any exfoliating reagent or surfactant. The thermodynamically driven Ostwald ripening has been expanded to the exfoliation of two-dimensional layered materials for the first time. Compared with conventional exfoliation methods, this ORDE is a time-saving and green strategy that avoids the serious adsorption of surfactant molecules. The ORDE of NiFe LDHs is accomplished in situ on a Cu mesh electrode, which not only exhibits excellent electrical contact between LDHs catalyst and electrodes but also prevents the restacking of the exfoliated LDHs. As a result, the exfoliated ultrathin, clean, and vertically aligned NiFe nanosheets with much higher surface area and numerous exposed active edges and sites demonstrated significantly enhanced OER performances with low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm–² and long-term stability for more than 60 h, as well as remarkable flexibility. Additionally, bulk Ni(OH)₂ nanosheets on Ni foams have also been exfoliated by a similar mechanism, indicating this ORDE strategy can be widely extended to other 2D layered materials for novel applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstwald ripening 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acopper 3aelectrodes 3afoams 3ahot water treatment 3ahydroxides 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3asurface area 3asurfactants 3athermodynamics 0aOstwald ripening driven exfoliation 0alayered double hydroxides 0aultrathin nanosheets 0aelectrocatalysis 0aoxygen evolution reaction1 aZhang, Zhuo1 aKim, Sangkuk1 aLee, Seonggyu1 aLee, Jinwoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6347-04461 aKim, Wooyul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8130-54411 aYong, Kijung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1458-05310 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Dec. 03, v. 10, no. 51 p.44518-44526dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b169623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245015100207300001800358520168900376592002802065650002202093650001202115650004302127650001902170650001402189650001502203650002002218650002602238650002202264650001302286650001802299700002102317700002502338700001902363773012902382856008402511852000902595655001202604IND60604648520221118015844.0180717e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060464852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b007142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, Keita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5266-069810aSimultaneous Analysis of Sulfated and Phosphorylated Glycans by Serotonin-Immobilized Column Enrichment and Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography  ap. 8387-8395.  aChanges in the structures and quantities of sulfated glycans play important roles in inflammatory and neurological diseases and cancer. Therefore, sulfated glycans are expected to become diagnostic markers for a variety of diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. On the other hand, structural abnormalities in the phosphorylated glycans on lysosomal enzymes cause a number of lysosomal diseases, while novel phosphorylated glycans have been found in other proteins. As with sulfated glycans, structural and quantitative changes in these phosphorylated glycans and their associations with disease are also of interest. In this article, we introduce a new method for the simultaneous analysis of sulfated and phosphorylated glycans. We first employ a serotonin-immobilized column to enrich these glycans. Glycans obtained in this manner were sequentially subjected to other analytical techniques without desalting. We employed hydrophilic interaction chromatography to distinguish the sulfate and phosphate groups of the glycans and were able to analyze sulfated and phosphorylated N-glycans expressed on thyroglobulin, ovalbumin, and myozyme. We showed that our method not only analyzes sulfated and phosphorylated glycans, but also glycans containing the GlcNAc-HPO₃ residue. We comparatively analyzed sulfated glycans, phosphorylated glycans, and GlcNAc-HPO₃-residue-containing glycans expressed on MKN7 cells (well-differentiated gastric cancer cells) and MKN45 cells (poorly differentiated gastric cancer cells). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a method for the simultaneous and quantitative analysis of sulfated and phosphorylated glycans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aenzymes 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3aneoplasm cells 3aovalbumin 3aphosphates 3apolysaccharides 3aquantitative analysis 3astomach neoplasms 3asulfates 3athyroglobulin1 aKayahara, Haruna1 aKinoshita, Mitsuhiro1 aSuzuki, Shigeo0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 June 10, v. 90, no. 14 p.8387-8395dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b007143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013400211300001600345500001900361520120800380592002801588650001601616650002301632650002501655650001701680650002201697650001601719650001701735650000901752650001201761650001001773650000901783653002701792653001201819653001701831653000801848653001301856700006101869700001801930700001901948700001801967700001701985773017202002856008502174852000902259655001202268IND60705673020221119061523.0201025e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070567302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2020.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKataoka, Ryousuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3151-351710aAwamori fermentation test and 1-octen-3-ol productivity analysis using fatty acid oxygenase disruptants of Aspergillus luchuensis  ap. 489-495.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a1-Octen-3-ol is a major aroma component of awamori, a traditional distilled liquor produced in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. As 1-octen-3-ol is thought to affect the sensory properties of awamori, it is important to fully characterize the compound's biosynthetic pathway and control mechanism. We previously reported that the fatty acid oxygenase ppoC (ppo: psi-produced oxygenase) of Aspergillus luchuensis is directly involved in the production of 1-octen-3-ol in rice koji (Kataoka et al., J. Biosci. Bioeng., 129, 192–198, 2020). In the present study, we constructed A. luchuensis ppoD disruptants to characterize the role of ppo genes in 1-octen-3-ol biosynthesis. A small-scale awamori fermentation test was performed using ppoA, ppoC, and ppoD single disruptants (ΔppoA, ΔppoC, and ΔppoD, respectively), along with the parent strain, ΔligD. 1-Octen-3-ol was not detected in the distillate prepared using the ΔppoC strain. We conclude that A. luchuensis ppoC is the only 1-octen-3-ol–producing factor in the awamori brewing process. Because ΔppoA and ΔppoD slightly enhanced 1-octen-3-ol productivity, these two genes may play a role in negatively controlling 1-octen-3-ol biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aRyukyu Archipelago 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3adistilled spirits 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3akoji 3aoctenol 3aodors 3arice 0aAspergillus luchuensis 0aAwamori 0a1-Octen-3-ol 0appo 0aVolatile1 aWatanabe, Taisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0470-36621 aHayashi, Risa1 aIsogai, Atsuko1 aYamada, Osamu1 aOgihara, Jun0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2020 Nov., v. 130, no. 5 p.489-495dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2020.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008100165300001600246520130600262592002801568650002501596650003501621650000901656650001401665650001501679650002101694650001301715650001401728650003701742650001801779653001701797653002901814700002001843700001501863700005501878700005801933700001801991773012502009856008302134852000902217655001202226IND60697727320221122130757.0200913e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069772732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoyang12aA new approach to construct and modulate G-quadruplex by cationic surfactant  ap. 338-345.  aG-quadruplex structure has raised increasing attention in supramolecular chemistry as an effective template for ordered functional materials. Thus, it is of practical significance to advance our understanding regarding G-quadruplex structures. Typically, G-quadruplex structures are formed in the presence of suitable metal ions. New methods to construct such structures need to be explored.The supramolecular assembly between CTAB and a guanosine derivative at different molar ratios was systematically studied, including assembly mechanisms, morphology, and macroscopic properties. Cationic surfactants with different alkyl chains were studied as control experiments.A novel strategy to construct G-quadruplex with the promotion of the cationic surfactant CTAB is presented in this work. The structure-property relationships of G-quadruplex gels are characterized by rheology and shrinkage ratio experiments. MacKintosh’s theory was used to rationalize the relationship between gel elasticity and water content. The transition of G-quadruplex structures could be easily enabled by modulating CTAB concentration, which promotes the phase transition from gel/sol biphase to homogeneous sol phase. This work will provide a new viewpoint for the construction and modulation of G-quadruplex structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3agels 3aguanosine 3ametal ions 3aphase transition 3arheology 3ashrinkage 3astructure-activity relationships 3awater content 0aG-quadruplex 0aNanostructure transition1 aWong, Shiu-Fai,1 aLi, Shuman1 aSong, Aixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9766-17421 aHao, Jingcheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9760-96771 aLiu, Hong-Guo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 578 p.338-345dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03393naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012700175300001600302520138900318592002801707650001201735650000901747650000901756650001301765650003101778650001401809650001401823650001801837650001601855653000701871653000801878653000801886653000901894653000901903653000801912653000601920653001001926653001201936653001001948653000601958653000801964653000801972653000701980653000701987653000801994653000802002653000802010653001502018653001002033653000802043653000802051653000802059653002702067653002302094653001802117653001702135653001702152700001802169700002702187700002302214700005902237700002102296700002202317700002302339700005602362773012502418856008302543852000902626655001202635IND60697727420221122162935.0200913e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069772742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Soriano, David14aThe influence of cation incorporation and leaching in the properties of Mn-doped nanoparticles for biomedical applications  ap. 510-521.  aSuperparamagnetic MnₓFe₃₋ₓO₄ nanoparticles are promising materials for applications in biomedicine and other fields. Small variations in the Mn/Fe ratio have a strong impact on the properties of the nanoparticles. Those variations may be caused by the synthesis itself and by common post-synthesis manipulations like surface modification.Mn-ferrite nanoparticles have been prepared changing systematically the Mn/Fe ratio of the metal precursors and repeating each reaction three times. Nanoparticles were subjected to surface modification with two different and typical molecules to stabilize them in aqueous media. The discrepancy in the Mn/Fe ratios of the precursors with the ones measured after the synthesis and the surface modification have been studied, as well as its impact on the saturation magnetization, blocking temperature, contrast enhancement for magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic heating, and on the cytotoxicity.Mn is incorporated in the nanoparticles in a relatively lower amount than Fe and, as this report shows for the first time, both Mn and Fe ions leach out from the nanoparticles during the surface modification step. The blocking temperature decreases exponentially as the Mn/Fe ratio increases. The transverse and longitudinal relaxation times and the magnetic heating ability change appreciably even with small variations in the composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3aheat 3airon 3aleaching 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amagnetism 3amanganese 3ananoparticles 3atemperature 0aAC 0aAMF 0aDLS 0aDMSA 0aDOPA 0aEDX 0aH 0aHRTEM 0aICP-OES 0aIONPs 0aM 0aMAR 0aMRI 0aMS 0aTB 0aTEM 0aTGA 0aSAR 0aSTEM-HAADF 0aSQUID 0aVSM 0aXPS 0aXRD 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aColloidal ferrites 0aCation doping 0aMRI contrast 0aHyperthermia1 aAmaro, Rebeca1 aLafuente-Gómez, Nuria1 aMilán-Rois, Paula1 aSomoza, Álvaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9873-435X1 aNavío, Cristina1 aHerranz, Fernando1 aGutiérrez, Lucía1 aSalas, Gorka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1196-88130 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 578 p.510-521dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011100173500002000284500000900304520167300313592002801986596005802014596004602072596004502118650000802163650002702171650002502198650002202223650001902245650001602264650002502280650002302305650001102328650001302339650001502352650001902367650001202386650001902398650001302417650002802430650003502458650001302493700001902506700002102525773012802546856008802674852000902762655001202771IND60669749820221121073931.0220517e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066974982DNAL7 a10.3835/plantgenome2018.01.00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhlson, Erik W.10aIdentification and Mapping of Late Blight Resistance Quantitative Trait Loci in Tomato Accession PI 163245  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aLate blight (LB), caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, is one of the most devastating diseases of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and potato (S. tuberosum L.) worldwide. The importance of LB on tomato has increased due to the occurrence of aggressive and fungicide‐resistant clonal lineages of P. infestans. Consequently, identification and characterization of new sources of genetic resistance to LB has become a priority in tomato breeding. Previously, we reported accession PI 163245 as a promising source of highly heritable LB resistance for tomato breeding. The purpose of this study was to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with LB resistance in this accession using a trait‐based marker analysis (a.k.a. selective genotyping). An F₂ mapping population (n = 560) derived from a cross between a LB‐susceptible tomato breeding line (Fla. 8059) and PI 163245 was screened for LB resistance, and the most resistant (n = 39) and susceptible (n = 35) individuals were selected for genotyping. Sequencing and comparison of the reduced representation libraries (RRLs) derived from genomic DNA of the two parents resulted in the identification of 33,541 putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, of which, 233 genome‐wide markers were used to genotype the 74 selected F₂ individuals. The marker analysis resulted in the identification of four LB resistance QTLs conferred by PI 163245, located on chromosomes 2, 3, 10, and 11. Research is underway to develop near‐isogenic lines (NILs) for fine mapping the QTLs and develop tomato breeding lines with LB resistance introduced from PI 163245.  aPublisher supplied data  cPennsylvania Vegetable Marketing and Research Program  cMid‐America Food Processors Association  cCollege of Agrial lines for GBS analysis 3aDNA 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abreeding lines 3achromosomes 3afungicide resistance 3agenetic resistance 3agenome 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aisogenic lines 3aparents 3aplant breeding 3apotatoes 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atomatoes1 aAshrafi, Hamid1 aFoolad, Majid R.0 tThe plant genome.g2018 Nov., v. 11, no. 3 p.e180007-dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4288766x1940-33727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3835/plantgenome2018.01.00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle07415naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001700140245010400157300001600261500000900277500001500286520570500301592002806006650001106034650002006045650003006065650001706095650001306112650002106125650001406146650001006160650001806170650002006188650001506208650001706223650002606240650001706266650002106283650001006304650003606314650002106350651001706371653003306388653001506421653002506436700001806461700002106479700001906500700001906519773020206538852000906740856007706749990002306826655001206849IND2060552820221121025043.0191122e199704  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206055282DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1997.03202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zongzhe,10aEffects of the Fungicide Propiconazole on Agronomic and Quality Traits of Hulled and Hulless Barley  ap. 320-322.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe hypocholesterolemic effect of hulless waxy barley (Hordeum vulgure L.) has increased its use in food products. Hulless cultivars currently grown in the Upper Midwest U.S. barley growing region are susceptible to a foliar disease, spot blotch, that can severely reduce yield. Spot blotch and kernel blight generally occur in the eastern area of the region; thus, hulless barley production is limited to the western area. Research on chemical control of spot blotch and kernel disease in hulless barley genotypes grown in the Upper Midwest has not been conducted. The objectives of this study were to determine whether natural field infections of the pathogen responsible for causing spot blotch and partly responsible for causing kernel blight similarly affect kernel and flour brightness of hulled and hulless barley genotypes, and to determine whether disease control with the fungicide propiconazole {1[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole} similarly affect agronomic and quality traits of hulled and hulless barley genotypes. Propiconazole reduced spot blotch severity. This resulted in increased yield and yield-related traits in hulled and hulless genotypes. Responses to propiconazole by the hulled and hulless genotypes were generally similar for spot blotch control, and similar for grain yield and 1000-kernel weight. The reduction in spot blotch severity did not result in brighter kernels or flour, nor did it affect mean total or soluble β-glucan content of hulled and hulless genotypes. Thus, hulless barley cultivars susceptible to spot blotch can be produced in the eastern area of the Upper Midwest barley growing region if they are protected with propiconazole. Research QuestionIn the Upper Midwest barley growing region of the USA, hulless waxy barley genotypes generally are grown only in western North Dakota, where environmental conditions often are not favorable for development of foliar and spike diseases. A concern with producing hulless waxy barley in the eastern area of the region is that the hulless character of the kernel may predispose it to more unsightly kernel diseases and discoloration than hulled barley. Also, hulless cultivars currently grown in the Upper Midwest are susceptible to a foliar disease, spot blotch, that can severely reduce yield. Cochliobolus sativus is the pathogen responsible for causing spot blotch and a major causal organism of kernel blight. Research on control of spot blotch and kernel blight with a foliar fungicide on hulless barley genotypes grown in the Upper Midwest has not been conducted. The objectives of this study were to determine whether natural field infections of the pathogen responsible for causing spot blotch and partly responsible for causing kernel blight similarly affect kernel and flour brightness of hulled and hulless barley genotypes, and to determine whether disease control with the fungicide propiconazole similarly affects agronomic and quality traits of hulled and hulless barley genotypes. Literature SummaryThe pathogen C. sativus can incite common root rot, spot blotch, and kernel blight in barley. In the Upper Midwest, spot blotch and kernel blight are the two most damaging diseases incited by C. sativus. The best control against C. sativus is sowing of resistant cultivars or use of fungicides. The fungicide propiconazole (Tilt®) has been labeled for use in barley for control of foliar and kernel diseases. Reports on use of propiconazole to control diseases incited by C. sativus are limited. Also, research comparing prevalence of spot blotch and kernel blight in hulled and hulless barley genotypes grown in the upper Midwest U.S. has not been conducted. Study DescriptionField experiments were conducted using a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement at Minot and Prosper, ND, in 1991 and 1992. Whole plots were propiconazole treatments (0 and 1.8 oz ai/acre) and subplots were genotypes. Ten hulled and eight hulless barley genotypes were evaluated. All but two of the genotypes were susceptible to spot blotch. Spot blotch severity was rated prior to maturity. Data collected on clean grain were yield, test weight, 1000-kernel weight, kernel plumpness, and kernel brightness. Flour brightness and total and soluble β-glucan content were determined on barley flour. Kernel and flour brightness were used to measure the level of kernel blight and discoloration. Applied QuestionsCan propiconazole be used to control spot blotch? Propiconazole reduced spot blotch severity in hulled and hulless genotypes. Mean reduction in spot blotch severity tended to be slightly better in the hulled genotypes than hulless genotypes. Did control of spot blotch by propiconazole result in increases in yield and yield-related traits? Control of spot blotch by propiconazole increased grain yield, 1000-kernel weight, and kernel plumpness in hulled and hulless genotypes. Improvements in grain yield and 1000-kernel weight were similar in hulled and hulless genotypes. Propiconazole significantly improved test weight in the hulled genotypes, but not the hulless genotypes. Improvements in kernel plumpness were generally greater in the hulless than the hulled genotypes. Did control of spot blotch by propiconazole result in improvements of quality related traits? Environmental conditions were not conducive for development of kernel blight. The reduction in foliar infection of spot blotch did not correspond to brighter kernels or flour. In fact, propiconazole slightly decreased kernel brightness. Spot blotch control by propiconazole had no affect on mean total or soluble β-glucan content of hulled and hulless genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablight 3aHordeum vulgare 3afungal diseases of plants 3afood quality 3agenotype 3ayield components 3acultivars 3aseeds 3apropiconazole 3adisease control 3asolubility 3abeta-glucans 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3acrop quality 3aagronomic traits 3acolor 3achemical constituents of plants 3achemical control 3aNorth Dakota 0aplant diseases and disorders 0acrop yield 0aCochliobolus sativus1 aManthey, F.A.1 aEllefsoin, R.

We evidence that this phase prevails in films grown at low temperatures and prevents the photoluminescence and photocatalytic activity of ZnO films. We also point out that high temperature ALD processes promote the preferential growth of ZnO films in the (002) orientation, leading to a significant increase of the film wettability and so their photocatalytic degradation performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallites 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3awettability 3azinc oxide1 aBahlawane, N.1 aLamblin, G.1 aFechete, I.1 aGarin, F.1 aDinia, A.1 aLenoble, D.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 May 19, v. 3, no. 21 p.11453-11461dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01637a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014200172300001800314520124200332592002801574650001301602650001101615650001101626650001801637650001201655650001101667650001401678650002301692650001501715650000901730650001001739650001601749650001601765651001301781700005301794700002301847700001801870700002301888700002401911700001701935700001801952700002501970773016101995856008202156852000902238655001202247IND60712290620221120204004.0201009e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071229062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-020-01818-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aḤammād, Aḥmad,10aSpatial modeling of Dengue prevalence and kriging prediction of Dengue outbreak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Pakistan) using presence only data  ap. 1023-1036.  aDuring the span of August–October, 2017 a major outbreak of Dengue fever happened in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Cases were reported from all the major cities and rural areas, but Peshawar was more severely hit with more than half of the total cases belonging to central Peshawar city. The epidemic patterns reveal that dengue fever cases were mostly reported for plain areas and also low altitude mountainous regions. We employed the principle of maximum entropy to establish the underlying distribution of dengue presences and background data. A geostatistical analysis was conducted by modelling the spatial structure of the dengue fever risk and estimating the prediction maps with corresponding uncertainty taking into account some of the most significant covariates. The prediction maps were created using binomial kriging with a binary logistic drift. The analysis was carried out for the whole province as well as subregions to have a closer look of the spatial distribution at local level. Our results show that our methodology performed well. Vector distribution, population density, and distance to roads were found to significantly affecting the spatial distribution of risk and gives very informative pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acities 3adengue 3ageostatistics 3akriging 3amodels 3amountains 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3arisk 3aroads 3arural areas 3auncertainty 3aPakistan1 aAli, Asad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5164-79421 aFatima, Syeda Hira1 aZaidi, Farrah1 aKhisroon, Muhammad1 aRasheed, Syed Basit1 aUllah, Ihsan1 aUllah, Saleem1 aShākir, Muḥammad,0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2020 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.1023-1036dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01818-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002500176245013700201300001500338520159000353592002801943650001401971650001501985650002102000650001402021650002202035650000902057650001902066650001102085650001302096650001802109650002802127650001702155650002002172773015202192856006902344856010502413990002302518852000902541655001202550IND60643200120221122060145.0190510e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064320012DNAL7 a10.3791/580452doi7 aPMC62354182pmcid7 a303463942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLaughlan, James R.10aControllable nucleation of cavitation from plasmonic gold nanoparticles for enhancing high intensity focused ultrasound applications  ap. e58045.  aIn this study, plasmonic gold nanoparticles were simultaneously exposed to pulsed near-infrared laser light and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the controllable nucleation of cavitation in tissue-mimicking gel phantoms. This in vitro protocol was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, for both enhancement of imaging and therapeutic applications for cancer. The same apparatus can be used for both imaging and therapeutic applications by varying the exposure duration of the HIFU system. For short duration exposures (10 µs), broadband acoustic emissions were generated through the controlled nucleation of inertial cavitation around the gold nanoparticles. These emissions provide direct localization of nanoparticles. For future applications, these particles may be functionalized with molecular-targeting antibodies (e.g. anti-HER2 for breast cancer) and can provide precise localization of cancerous regions, complementing routine diagnostic ultrasound imaging. For continuous wave (CW) exposures, the cavitation activity was used to increase the localized heating from the HIFU exposures resulting in larger thermal damage in the gel phantoms. The acoustic emissions generated from inertial cavitation activity during these CW exposures was monitored using a passive cavitation detection (PCD) system to provide feedback of cavitation activity. Increased localized heating was only achieved through the unique combination of nanoparticles, laser light and HIFU. Further validation of this technique in pre-clinical models of cancer is necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aantibodies 3abreast neoplasms 3aemissions 3aexposure duration 3agels 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anear infrared radiation 3atherapeutics 3aultrasonography0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Oct. 05, , no. 140 p.e58045-e58045dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/580453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58045/controllable-nucleation-cavitation-from-plasmonic-gold-nanoparticles  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle05541naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001900140245006000159300001400219500000900233520436700242592002804609650002004637650002404657650001804681650001304699650001604712650002104728650001504749650001704764650001604781651001204797700001804809700001904827773020004846852000905046856007705055990002305132655001205155IND2060552720221121024906.0191122e199701  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206055272DNAL7 a10.2134/jpa1997.00702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuertal, E. A.10aCrop Rotation Effects on Sweet Potato Yield and Quality  ap. 70-73.  aepub  aAs the suite of fungicides, pesticides, and fumigants available to vegetable producers continues to shrink, growers may begin to reexamine crop rotations as an alternative method of disease, weed, and pest control. Although many studies have examined field crop rotations, relatively few have examined a vegetable crop as a part of that rotation. In 1985 a study was initiated to evaluate the effect of various crop rotations on sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) yield and quality. Specific rotations were: (i) continuous sweet potato, (ii) sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa) and sweet potato, (ii) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and sweet potato, (iv) 2 yr sweet corn and one yr sweet potato, (v) 2 yr bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge.) and 1 yr sweet potato, and, (vi) soybean, sweet corn and sweet potato. Two complete cycles (1988–1990 and 1991–1993) of the rotations were analyzed. The crop rotation producing the largest annual yield (4.70 tons/acre) and one of the largest cumulative (11.35 tons/acre) sweet potato yields was 2 yr of bahiagrass followed by sweet potato. Continuous sweet potatoes produced the lowest annual (2.12 tons/acre) and one of the highest total marketable cumulative yields (11.39 tons/acre) during the 6 yr. In general, a rotation containing a grass (bahiagrass, sweet corn) produced higher annual sweet potato yields than those without. ProblemSustainable methods of crop production have long included the use of rotations. Many rotations are field-crop based, and the use of vegetables in the rotation is not common. Sweet potatoes may fit well into field-crop rotations because they are usually managed like a field crop. The objective of this study was to examine annual and cumulative sweet potato yields as affected by rotation with sweet corn, soybean, and bahiagrass. BackgroundThere is ample long-term research which examines the effect of rotations on crop yield and quality, yet the majority of this work uses field crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. The effect of crop rotations on soil characteristics such as pH, organic matter, organic N and extractable P and K has been studied in many field crop rotations. Rotations have also been shown to alter populations of weeds, insects, and nematodes, and to affect disease severity. Study DescriptionThe experiment was initiated in 1985 in central Alabama on a Ruston fine sandy loam. The experiment consisted of 6 replications of 6 different rotations: (i) continuous sweet potatoes; (ii) 2 yr rotation of sweet potatoes and sweet corn; (iii) 3 yr rotation of 1 yr sweet potato and 2 yr sweet corn, (iv) 2 yr rotation of sweet potato and soybean, (v) 3 yr rotation of sweet potato, soybean, and sweet corn, and, (vi) 3 yr rotation of 1 yr sweet potato and 2 yr bahiagrass. Every cropping sequence (ex., sweet corn first year, sweet potato second, and sweet potato first, sweet corn second year) of each rotation was considered, so that each replication of the experiment contained 14 treatments. Both annual and cumulative sweet potato yields from 1988 to 1993 were analyzed. Applied QuestionsWhat rotation produced the largest annual sweet potato yields? The rotation consisting of 2 yr of bahiagrass and 1 yr of sweet potatoes produced a higher annual yield than any other rotation. This rotation had a sweet potato yield of 4.79 tons/acre,, just above the 5-yr state average of 4.5 tons/acre. Continuous sweet potatoes produced the lowest annual yield (2.12 tons/acre). What rotation produced the highest cumulative sweet potato yields? Over the 6 yr, the rotation of 2 yr of bahiagrass and 1 yr of sweet potatoes produced as high a cumulative yield as when sweet potatoes were grown continuously. The lowest cumulative yields occurred when soybeans were included in the rotation. The rotation of continuous sweet potatoes had more diseased or damaged sweet potatoes (cull) than any other rotation, when cumulative yield was considered. RecommendationsA rotation of sweet potatoes and bahiagrass is an effective alternative to continuous sweet potatoes, as it produces annual yields well in excess of continuous cropping. This study suggests that rotation with a grass crop will produce greater annual sweet potato yields and cumulative yields comparable to continuous sweet potato production, without the increased incidence of cull sweet potatoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIpomoea batatas 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop rotation 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aPaspalum notatum 3acrop yield 3acrop quality 3afood grades 3aAlabama1 aBauske, E.

However, sucrose metabolism in Escherichia coli is not well understood because the two most common strains, E. coli K-12 and B, do not grow on sucrose. Here, using a sucrose utilizing strain, E. coli W, we undertake an in-depth comparison of sucrose and glucose metabolism including growth kinetics, metabolite profiling, microarray-based transcriptome analysis, labelling-based proteomic analysis and ¹³C-fluxomics. While E. coli W grew comparably well on sucrose and glucose integration of the omics, datasets showed that during growth on each carbon source, metabolism was distinct. The metabolism was generally derepressed on sucrose, and significant flux rearrangements were observed in central carbon metabolism. These included a reduction in the flux of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway branch, an increase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux and a reduction in the glyoxylate shunt flux due to the dephosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase. But unlike growth on other sugars that induce cAMP-dependent Crp regulation, the phosphoenol-pyruvate-glyoxylate cycle was not active on sucrose. Lower acetate accumulation was also observed in sucrose compared to glucose cultures. This was linked to induction of the acetate catabolic genes actP and acs and independent of the glyoxylic shunt. Overall, the cells stayed highly oxidative. In summary, sucrose metabolism was fast, efficient and led to low acetate accumulation making it an ideal carbon source for industrial fermentation with E. coli W.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetates 3acarbon 3adata collection 3adephosphorylation 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3agenes 3aglucose 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3ametabolites 3amicroarray technology 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aproteomics 3asucrose 3asugarcane 3atranscriptomics 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aArcher, Colin1 aLim, SooA1 aQuek, Lake-Ee1 aSugiarto, Haryadi1 aMarcellin, Esteban1 aVickers, Claudia E.1 aKrömer, Jens O.,1 aNielsen, Lars K.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Nov., v. 98, no. 21 p.9033-9044dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-014-5956-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013600156520185500292592002802147650001602175650002302191650002002214650002202234650002102256650001102277650005002288650001502338650004302353650001902396650001502415650002302430650002102453650002102474650001702495650002402512651001002536700001602546700001302562700001802575700002002593773012002613856007402733852000902807655001202816IND60702908220221121043358.0200719e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070290822DNAL7 a10.3390/f110201312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Junxia 10aMODIS-Derived Estimation of Soil Respiration within Five Cold Temperate Coniferous Forest Sites in the Eastern Loess Plateau, China  aSoil respiration (Rₛ) is seldom analyzed using remotely sensed data because satellite technology has difficulty monitoring various respiratory processes in the soil. We investigated the potential of remote sensing data products to estimate Rₛ, including land surface temperature (LST) and spectral vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), using a nine-year (2007–2015) field measurement dataset of Rₛ and soil temperature (Tₛ) at five forest sites at the eastern Loess Plateau, China. The results indicate that soil temperature is the primary factor influencing the seasonal variation of Rₛ at the five sites. The accuracy of the model based on the observed data is not significantly different from the model based on MODIS-derived nighttime LST values. There was a significant difference with the model based on MODIS-derived daytime LST values. Therefore, nighttime LST was the optimum LST for estimation of Rₛ. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) consistently exhibited a stronger correlation with Rₛ when compared to the green edge chlorophyll index and enhanced vegetation index. Further analysis showed that adding the NDVI into the model considering only Tₛ or nighttime LST could significantly improve the simulation accuracy of Rₛ. The models depending on nighttime LST and NDVI showed comparable accuracy with the models based on the in situ Tₛ and NDVI. These results suggest that models based entirely on remote sensing data from MODIS have the potential to estimate Rₛ at the cold temperate coniferous forest sites. The performance of the model in other vegetation types or regions has also been proved. Our conclusions further confirmed that it is feasible for large-scale estimates of Rₛ by means of MODIS data in temperate coniferous forest ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aconiferous forests 3adata collection 3aforest ecosystems 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asoil respiration 3asoil temperature 3aspatial data 3asurface temperature 3aChina1 aZhang, Xue 1 aLiu, Ju 1 aLi, Hongjian 1 aDing, Guangwei 0 tForests.g2020 Jan. 22, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110201313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012400158300002000282520151800302592002801820650002301848650001501871650001501886650002401901650002301925650001101948650003101959650001701990650000902007650001202016650001502028650002802043650001502071650002202086650001302108650001702121650001702138650001302155700001702168700001902185700001602204700002102220700001902241700001502260773014402275856007402419852000902493655001202502IND60671094620221118191013.0191002e20150616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067109462DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta01652e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lingzhi10aCarbon dots modified mesoporous organosilica as an adsorbent for the removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol and heavy metal ions  ap. 13357-13364.  aPeriodic mesoporous organosilica embedded with carbon dots are adopted as the adsorbent for removal of the toxic organic pollutant 2,4-dichlorophenol and inorganic metal ions Hg(ii), Cu(ii), and Pb(ii). The composite possesses an ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure with a space group of p6mm, high specific surface area (∼468.46 m² g⁻¹), and uniform pore size (∼5.50 nm). The surface is covered by about 1–2 layers of carbon dot nanoparticles. The maximum adsorption capacity for 2,4-dichlorophenol is 99.70 mg g⁻¹, and the distribution coefficient of metal ions between adsorbent and solution phases is in the range of 2.60–7.41, following the order of Hg(ii) > Cu(ii) > Pb(ii). The Cu(ii) and Pb(ii) adsorption stays nearly fixed while Hg(ii) adsorption is depressed by ∼45% in a mixed solution of metal ions. The Cu(ii) and Hg(ii) adsorption shows unapparent variation but Pb(ii) adsorption is improved by ∼55% in a mixed solution of metal ion and 2,4-dichlorophenol. In contrast, all metal ions lead to the depression of 2,4-dichlorophenol adsorption by 37% (Pb(ii)), 45% (Cu(ii)), and 48% (Hg(ii)). Finally, the n–π electron donor–acceptor interaction between O- and N-containing groups in mesoporous organosilica and the benzene ring in 2,4-dichlorophenol is revealed to be responsible for the enhanced adsorption of 2,4-dichlorophenol, while the electrostatic force and complex formation between metal ions and amide groups co-contribute to the improvement of metal ions adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon quantum dots 3achemical structure 3acopper 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3ametal ions 3aorganosilicon compounds 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asurface area 3atoxicity1 aZheng, Zhen,1 aSena, Tāpasa,1 aLei, Juying1 aMatsuoka, Masaya1 aZhang, Jinlong1 aZhang, Fan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 June 16, v. 3, no. 25 p.13357-13364dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta01652e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024001900121040001800140100002400158245011000182300001600292520137600308592002801684650001401712650001501726650002001741650002701761650002301788650001001811650000901821650001201830650000901842650001501851650001401866650001501880650001201895650001401907650001001921700002301931700002001954773013901974856007302113852000902186655001202195IND60597698520221120113538.0180625e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059769852DNAL7 a10.1643/CE-16-5672doi4 acope-106-01-12  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalski, Krzysztof10aDo Bufonids Employ Different Anti-Predator Behaviors Than Ranids? Comparison among Three European Anurans  ap. 120-129.  aEuropean anurans are prey for a variety of predators, against which they have evolved a range of defense behaviors. We investigated defensive behaviors of three European anurans: the Common Toad (Bufo bufo), the Common Frog (Rana temporaria), and the Edible Frog (Pelophylax esculentus) during interactions with a predator (hedgehog) and a control stimulus (rabbit). We hypothesized that (H1) due to small capacity to flee quickly from a predator, B. bufo has evolved a more diverse repertoire of behavioral defenses than the ranids, R. temporaria and P. esculentus. We also hypothesized that (H2) B. bufo can minimize the secretion of metabolically costly poison through behavioral control. According to our predictions, the repertoire of defensive behaviors was more complex in B. bufo than in the ranids. Also, the number of threatening behaviors was higher in toads than in both frog species. Fleeing was the most common response employed by all tested anurans. We report a new anti-predator behavior in the Common Toad: head hitting. As B. bufo released the poison only after squeezing of parotoid macroglands by the predator, we conclude that the Common Toad can minimize poison release through behavioral control. Our data suggest that length of hind-legs and, related to this, mode of locomotion (jumping vs. hopping) can affect anti-predator behavior in anurans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBufo bufo 3aPelophylax 3aRana temporaria 3aantipredatory behavior 3adefensive behavior 3afrogs 3ahead 3ajumping 3alegs 3alocomotion 3apredators 3aprediction 3arabbits 3asecretion 3atoads1 aSawościanik, Olga1 aRychlik, Leszek0 tCopeia.g2018 Mar., v. 106, no. 1 p.120-129dThe American Society of Ichthyologists and HerpetologistswJournal:19631x0045-85117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1643/CE-16-5673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245012700199300001800326506007600344520200600420592002802426596008102454506003702535650003102572650001402603650002802617650001402645650001102659650001802670650001702688650001302705650001702718651001002735653002302745653003902768653002502807653001402832653002802846653002402874653002602898653002502924700002002949773012302969856007403092852000903166655001203175IND60624549720221207142135.0181204e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062454972DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcw1842doi7 aPMC51556012pmcid7 a276042802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFajardo, Alex10aTemperate rain forest species partition fine-scale gradients in light availability based on their leaf mass per area (LMA)  ap. 1307-1315.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Ecologists are increasingly using plant functional traits to predict community assembly, but few studies have linked functional traits to species’ responses to fine-scale resource gradients. In this study, it was tested whether saplings of woody species partition fine-scale gradients in light availability based on their leaf mass per area (LMA) in three temperate rain forests and one Mediterranean forest in southern Chile. Methods LMA was measured under field conditions of all woody species contained in approx. 60 plots of 2 m² in each site, and light availability, computed as the gap light index (GLI), was determined. For each site, species’ pairwise differences in mean LMA (Δ LMA) and abundance-weighted mean GLI (Δ light response) of 2 m² plots were calculated and it was tested whether they were positively related using Mantel tests, i.e. if species with different LMA values differed in their response to light availability. Additionally linear models were fitted to the relationship between plot-level mean LMA and GLI across plots for each site. Key Results A positive and significant relationship was found between species’ pairwise differences in mean LMA and differences in light response across species for all temperate rain forests, but not for the Mediterranean forest. The results also indicated a significant positive interspecific link between LMA and light availability for all forests. This is in contrast to what is traditionally reported and to expectations from the leaf economics spectrum. Conclusions In environments subjected to light limitation, interspecific differences in a leaf trait (LMA) can explain the fine-scale partitioning of light availability gradients by woody plant species. This niche partitioning potentially facilitates species coexistence at the within-community level.

Further extra modification is required to gain superhydrophobicity, which might probably block the fluorescence. Short side organic chains are very thermostable at high temperature. Therefore, it might be possible to produce superhydrophobic and fluorescent hybrid silica spheres through the co-condensation of organosilanes with short side organic chains and calcination at high temperature.Experiments:Methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) and vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) were co-condensed to prepare polysilsesquioxane (PSQ) spheres, which were subsequently calcinated at high temperature. The impact of MTMS/VTMS ratio on the chemical structures, fluorescence and wettability was investigated, and the applications of PSQ spheres were expanded.Findings:The PSQ spheres with the ratio of MTMS/VTMS as 3/1 and 2/2 exhibited strong fluorescence, and the calcination did not destroy the superhydrophobicity for the remaining of abundant methyl, vinyl, or ethyl groups. Our study provides an extremely green, simple and effective approach to prepare thermostable, fluorescent and superhydrophobic monodisperse silica spheres without using rare earth element, gold, conjugated polymer, phorsphore, fluoride chemical or organic solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3afluorides 3agold 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3apolymers 3arare earth elements 3asilica 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3awettability 0aFluorescent 0aSuperhydrophobic 0aThermostable 0aPolysilsesquioxane sphere 0aGreen approach 0aHybrid silica1 aYi, Jiemin1 aZhong, Bangchao1 aMa, Wenshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7783-31991 aPeng, Xiaohong1 aYang, Dongjie0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 578 p.484-490dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100002600175245013800201300001400339520129700353592002801650650001101678650002301689650001101712650002501723650001601748650001401764650000901778650002001787650002001807650001601827650001601843650000901859650002001868650003901888650001101927650001401938650001801952650000901970650001701979653002201996653001902018653001302037700002602050700002702076700002602103700002502129700002302154700003002177773012702207856008102334852000902415655001202424IND60650537820221120120601.0190710e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065053782DNAL7 a30520392 305203922pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299180008082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaimondo, Raquel F.S.14aThe dynamics of individual whey protein concentrations in cows’ mammary secretions during the colostral and early lactation periods  ap. 88-93.  aThe bovine whey consists of more than 200 different types of proteins, of which β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, serum albumin, immunoglobulins and lactoferrin predominate. However, their concentrations are not stable due to the existence of protein dynamics during a transition from colostrum secretion to mature milk. To evaluate the dynamics of whey proteins of Jersey cows during a colostral phase and first month of lactation and an influence of the number of lactations, 268 milk samples from 135 Jersey cows were selected through a clinical evaluation. Whey was obtained by rennet coagulation of the mammary secretion. The concentration of total proteins was determined by the biuret method and their fractions were identified by 12% dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% SDS-PAGE). Maximum concentrations of all protein fractions were observed in the first 12 h of lactation, reducing over the course of the study. Modification of the protein predominance was also observed. The transition from colostrum secretion to milk occurred between 24 and 72 h postpartum. There was an influence of the number of lactations on the dynamics of whey proteins, indicating that multiparous cows had better immunological and nutritional quality when compared to primiparous cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJersey 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abiuret 3aclinical examination 3acoagulation 3acolostrum 3acows 3aearly lactation 3aimmunoglobulins 3alactalbumin 3alactoferrin 3amilk 3anutritive value 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arennet 3asecretion 3aserum albumin 3awhey 3awhey protein 0aAlpha-lactalbumin 0aimmunoglobulin 0aSDS-PAGE1 aFerrão, Juliana S.P.1 aMiyashiro, Samantha I.1 aFerreira, Priscila T.1 aSaut, João Paulo E.1 aBirgel, Daniela B.1 aBirgel Junior, Eduardo H.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2019 Feb., v. 86, no. 1 p.88-93dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299180008083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148242008900167245008000256300001600336500001900352520135500371592002801726650001501754650002301769650002001792650002601812650001401838650001801852650001401870700001601884700002601900700002001926700002301946773014301969856008202112852000902194655001202203IND60712291720210420000000.0201009e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6071229172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00506-020-00697-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpacek, Stefan10aEine neue Methode für die Bestimmung des Mikroplastik-Massenanteils in Umweltproben10aA new method for determining microplastic content in environmental samples  ap. 403-409.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe increasing pollution of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems with microplastics is a severe problem for the environment. Especially the high resistance of plastics to degradation processes causes a constant accumulation of microplastics in the environment. The development of suitable methods for the accurate and simple determination of microplastics is a vital factor to evaluate existing microplastic accumulations in the environment. The method presented here describes a thermoanalytical method for mass-based microplastic determination. The EA-OEM (Elemental Analysis Overdetermined Equation Method) was developed at TU Wien and makes use of the distinct differences in the elemental composition of plastic, biogenic and inorganic materials to quantitatively measure the content of microplastics in environmental samples. The EA-OEM has been optimized in past years using polymer spiked samples and additionally evaluated in an inter-laboratory round robin test. The aim of this paper is to summarize recent investigations. The results demonstrate good recovery rates for microplastics in polymer spiked samples (in the range of 93 to 110%). Furthermore, the limit of detection was estimated with 1 wt% microplastics. The EA-OEM poses a comparatively simple and cost-effective method to determine microplastics in environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aelemental composition 3aequations 3amicroplastics 3apollution1 aMallow, Ole1 aSchwarzböck, Therese1 aFellner, Johann1 aRechberger, Helmut0 tÖsterreichische Wasser- und Abfallwirtschaft.g2020 Oct., v. 72, no. 9-10 p.403-409dSpringer ViennawJournal:J000000413x0945-358X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00506-020-00697-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002400176245006100200300001500261520114500276592002801421650000901449650002101458650001101479650000901490650001501499650002201514700002001536700001801556700001801574700002001592700002001612773015201632856006901784856009301853990002301946852000901969655001201978IND60643200320221122060009.0190510e20180810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064320032DNAL7 a10.3791/580482doi7 aPMC61267072pmcid7 a301484902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagayama, Hiromichi10aMeasuring active and passive tameness separately in mice  ap. e58048.  aDomesticated animals such as dogs and laboratory mice show a high level of tameness, which is important for humans to handle them easily. Tameness has two behavioral components: a reluctance to avoid humans (passive tameness) and a motivation to approach humans (active tameness). To quantify these components in mice, we previously developed behavioral tests for active tameness, passive tameness, and the willingness to stay on a human hand, each designed to be completed within 3 min. The data obtained were used for selective breeding, with a large number of mice analyzed per generation. The active tameness test measures the movement of the mouse toward a human hand and the contact it engages in. The passive tameness test measures the duration of time that a mouse tolerates human touch. In the stay-on-hand test, a mouse is placed on a human hand and touched slowly using the thumb of that hand; the duration of time that the animal remains on the hand is measured. Here, we describe the test set-up and apparatus, explain the procedures, and discuss the appropriate data analysis. Finally, we explain how to interpret the results.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3adomestic animals 3ahumans 3amice 3amotivation 3aselection methods1 aMatsumoto, Yuki1 aTanave, Akira1 aNihei, Motoko1 aGoto, Tatsuhiko1 aKoide, Tsuyoshi0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Aug. 10, , no. 138 p.e58048-e58048dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/580483Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58048/measuring-active-and-passive-tameness-separately-in-mice  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009600174300001800270520176000288592002802048650002802076650003502104650001902139650001702158650002002175650000902195700002502204700002102229700005702250773012902307856008402436852000902520655001202529IND60604649220180911000000.0180717e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060464922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b010102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPallmann, Sebastian10aDirect Hadamard Transform Capillary Zone Electrophoresis without Instrumental Modifications  ap. 8445-8453.  aWe report the first successful implementation of a multiplexing method on a standard capillary electrophoresis system with UV detection that is independent of additional hardware. This was achieved using the Hadamard transform approach and employing vial exchange and voltage suspensions for translation of pseudorandom binary sequence elements into sample and background electrolyte injections of a capillary zone electrophoresis separation. Sequences exceeding peak capacity of the capillary were subdivided into shorter subsequences measured successively and realigned afterward based on EOF marker or analyte peaks. This way, we realized and deconvoluted modulation sequences as long as 8-bit (255 injections) for two systems containing either AMP or a mixture of the nucleotides (A,C,G,U)MP resulting in electropherograms of considerably improved signal-to-noise ratio. We achieved factors of intensity enhancement of around 6.9 and 5.2, respectively (theoretical maximum 8.0). This contribution, further, presents experimental and simulation studies on the effects on zones during injection and separation when experiencing voltage suspensions. Besides analysis of EOF behavior and influence of diffusion dispersion, we also provide data on the significance of specific electrophoretic errors such as peak position shift, inconsistent sample injection, and peak broadening on the quality of the inverse Hadamard transform. Moreover, the application of our approach to the practical analysis of a milk sample is described. The results demonstrate the applicability of multiplexing on unmodified standard CE instrumentation and establish a new suitable methodology to enhance the low sensitivity of on-column UV detection in capillary electrophoresis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine monophosphate 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3aelectric power 3aelectrolytes 3ainstrumentation 3amilk1 aSiegle, Alexander F.1 aŠteflová, Jana1 aTrapp, Oliver1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3594-51810 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 June 10, v. 90, no. 14 p.8445-8453dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b010103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245016900173300001400342520116200356592002801518650001501546650002201561650001101583650002101594650001001615650002201625651001101647653001501658653001501673653002301688653001601711653001401727653002001741700003101761700002801792700003701820773019701857856008202054852000902136655001202145IND60527322720221116235233.0190415e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052732272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rmb.2016.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrado-Navarro, Andrea10aComposición y estructura de las comunidades de poliquetos (Annelida) asociadas a fondos blandos de la costa occidental de la península de Baja California, México  ap. 74-85.  aPolychaetes are one of the most important groups of the benthos from any point of view.

We compared the number of families and species collected both bathymetricaly and latitudinally, we also performed a diversity analysis using several indexes such as alpha diversity, Pielou evenness, Simpson dominance and specific dominance. A total of 60stations were revised, 30 of these were positive, finding 3,709specimens grouped in 11orders, 27families, 62genera and 99species. Spionidae has the highest richness with 4genera and 12species (12.2% of global diversity and 42.7% of the relative abundance) for a total of 1,583 specimens. Paraprionospio pinnata was the most abundant, frequent and dominant species (24.2% of all specimens).

This study evaluated the effects of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents on the freshwater pale chub Zacco platypus by using multi-level biomarker responses at molecular [mRNA expression of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and metallothionein (MT)], biochemical (enzyme activities of CAT, SOD, GST, and concentration of MT), and physiological [condition factor (CF) and liver somatic index (LSI)] levels. The mRNA expression levels of GST and MT in Z. platypus from a site downstream of a WWTP significantly increased by 2.2- and 4.5-fold (p<0.05) when compared with those from an upstream site. However, the enzyme activities of CAT, SOD, and GST in fish from the downstream site significantly decreased by 43%, 98%, and 13%, respectively (p<0.05), except for an increase in MT concentration (41%). In addition, a significant increase in LSI (46%) was observed in Z. platypus from the downstream site (p<0.05). Concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in the liver of Z. platypus were higher (530%, 353%, 800%, and 2,200%, respectively) in fish from a downstream site than in fish from an upstream location, and several multi-level biomarker responses were significantly correlated with the accumulated metals in Z. platypus (p<0.05). Integrated biomarker responses at molecular, biochemical, and physiological levels (multi-level IBR) were much higher (about 4-fold) at the downstream site than at the upstream site. This study suggests that the multi-level IBR approach is very useful for quantifying in situ adverse effects of WWTP effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZacco platypus 3aadverse effects 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3acatalase 3acondition factor 3acopper 3aeffluents 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3agene expression 3aglutathione transferase 3alead 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametallothionein 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3azinc 0aBioaccumulation 0aEffluent 0aHeavy metal 0aIntegrated biomarker response 0aWastewater1 aJung, Jinho0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2016 June, v. 128 p.246-251dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04150naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245010900202300001400311506007600325520211900401592002802520596004902548596006302597596006002660506003702720650001902757650002202776650001802798650002202816650002002838650001302858650001402871650001302885650001402898650003902912650002002951650001002971650002202981650001303003650004203016650001903058650002703077650001903104650000903123650001803132653001903150653000903169653002503178700002103203700002103224700002003245700002403265700002103289773011903310856007403429852000903503655001203512IND60624550020221207105302.0181204e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062455002DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcw1872doi7 aPMC52183742pmcid7 a277077472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSochorová, Jana10aGene conversion events and variable degree of homogenization of rDNA loci in cultivars of Brassica napus  ap. 13-26.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and aims Brassica napus (AACC, 2n = 38, oilseed rape) is a relatively recent allotetraploid species derived from the putative progenitor diploid species Brassica rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and Brassica oleracea (CC, 2n = 18). To determine the influence of intensive breeding conditions on the evolution of its genome, we analysed structure and copy number of rDNA in 21 cultivars of B. napus, representative of genetic diversity. Methods We used next-generation sequencing genomic approaches, Southern blot hybridization, expression analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Subgenome-specific sequences derived from rDNA intergenic spacers (IGS) were used as probes for identification of loci composition on chromosomes. Key Results Most B. napus cultivars (18/21, 86 %) had more A-genome than C-genome rDNA copies. Three cultivars analysed by FISH (‘Darmor’, ‘Yudal’ and ‘Asparagus kale’) harboured the same number (12 per diploid set) of loci. In B. napus ‘Darmor’, the A-genome-specific rDNA probe hybridized to all 12 rDNA loci (eight on the A-genome and four on the C-genome) while the C-genome-specific probe showed weak signals on the C-genome loci only. Deep sequencing revealed high homogeneity of arrays suggesting that the C-genome genes were largely overwritten by the A-genome variants in B. napus ‘Darmor’. In contrast, B. napus ‘Yudal’ showed a lack of gene conversion evidenced by additive inheritance of progenitor rDNA variants and highly localized hybridization signals of subgenome-specific probes on chromosomes. Brassica napus ‘Asparagus kale’ showed an intermediate pattern to ‘Darmor’ and ‘Yudal’. At the expression level, most cultivars (95 %) exhibited stable A-genome nucleolar dominance while one cultivar (‘Norin 9’) showed co-dominance. Conclusions The B. napus cultivars differ in the degree and direction of rDNA homogenization. The prevalent direction of gene conversion (towards the A-genome) correlates with the direction of expression dominance indicating that gene activity may be needed for interlocus gene conversion.  aPublisher supplied data  aP501/13/10057Scthe Czech Science Foundation  cthe French National Research Institute for Agronomy (INRA)  cthe Czech-French scientific exchange Barrande programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassica oleracea 3aBrassica rapa 3aSouthern blotting 3aallotetraploidy 3abreeding 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agene conversion 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahomogenization 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aintergenic DNA 3aloci 3aribosomal DNA 0aallopolyploidy 0arDNA 0achromosome evolution1 aCoriton, Olivier1 aKuderová, Alena1 aLunerová, Jana1 aChèvre, Anne-Marie1 aKovařík, Aleš0 tAnnals of botany.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 119, no. 1 p.13-26dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44715x1095-82907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw1873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009300172300001600265520123400281592002801515650002101543650001501564650001401579650001801593650001601611650002301627650002501650650001601675650002101691650001301712650000901725650001101734650001301745650002201758650002401780650001601804651001101820653002001831653001101851653001901862653001501881653001701896653002101913653001601934653000901950653001901959653001401978653001601992653001902008700003002027773019902057856008202256852000902338655001202347IND60527322920221116235816.0190415e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052732292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rmb.2016.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOcaña-Luna, Alberto10aEstructura de la comunidad ictioplanctónica en la laguna de Tamiahua, Veracruz, México  ap. 123-132.  aTamiahua Lagoon is the third largest lagoon in Mexico. In the last decade their 2 inlets have been dredged and their jetties re-built to maintain constant communication with the sea, allowing the free flow of species. Zooplankton samplings were performed in 22 stations during the months of February, May, August and November of 2011, with a standard net of 500 microns. Simultaneously, salinity and surface temperature were measured. Forty species belonging to 37 genera and 19 families of fish were determined. Lutjanus campechanus, Chasmodes bosquianus, Ctenogobius shufeldti, Microgobius thalassinus and Citharichthys arctifrons are new records for this lagoon. The dominant species were Anchoa mitchilli, Lagodon rhomboides, Membras martinica, Lupinoblennius nicholsi, Ctenogobius boleosoma and Brevoortia gunteri. In February the species richness (26) was the highest one due to the entry of marine species, while diversity was low (2.13) due to the abundance of L. rhomboides, A. mitchilli and B. gunteri, of the group iv in the dendrogram of association of larvae. The larval composition from the Tamiahua lagoon presented a similarity of 61% when compared to previous years, before the dredging of the Tampachichi inlet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnchoa mitchilli 3aBrevoortia 3aChasmodes 3aCitharichthys 3aCtenogobius 3aLagodon rhomboides 3aLutjanus campechanus 3aMicrogobius 3adominant species 3adredging 3afish 3alarvae 3asalinity 3aspecies diversity 3asurface temperature 3azooplankton 3aMexico 0aLarvas de peces 0aHuevos 0aLaguna costera 0aDiversidad 0aAsociaciones 0aGolfo de México 0aFish larvae 0aEggs 0aCoastal lagoon 0aDiversity 0aAssemblages 0aGulf of Mexico1 aSánchez-Ramírez, Marina0 tRevista mexicana de biodiversidad.g2016 Mar., v. 87, no. 1 p.123-132dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de BiologíawJournal:23226x1870-34537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rmb.2016.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245009100187300001600278520192000294592002802214650001302242650001902255650002002274650001402294650001902308650001802327650001702345650003002362650001502392650002802407650001502435651001102450653001002461653002502471700003202496700001902528700002402547773012902571856008102700852000902781655001202790IND60650538120221120120711.0190710e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065053812DNAL7 a304442092pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299180008452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColombo, Monique14aThe potential use of probiotic and beneficial bacteria in the Brazilian dairy industry  ap. 487-496.  aScientific studies demonstrate the importance of intestinal microbiota to human health and how probiotic microorganisms can positively affect health when administered regularly and in adequate amounts. Probiotic bacteria can be part of fermented products and their functional importance is associated mainly with their metabolism. They are thought to benefit individuals to maintain their health and also to strengthen resistance against various types of diseases. The acceptance of probiotic cultures and products by consumers increased when these bacteria were marketed as natural cultures that help in digestion and health. Considering this, the food industry has an increasing demand for new candidates as probiotic cultures, and the dairy industry has a particular interest for fermented milks and other dairy products, since these are the most common food vehicles for probiotic cultures. Therefore, the dairy industries are increasingly seeking to improve their products with these beneficial bacteria. However, the legal peculiarities and excess of control agencies in Brazil makes the registration of these products and the collection of data very complex. Prospective analysis suggests that probiotic foods have the potential to effect a considerable expansion of the dairy industry, allowing the dairy sector to grow and for these products to be increasingly sought by consumers globally. For this, not only actions on research and innovation are necessary, but also official clarifications on the claims for considerations of microbiological security and functionality of these products. This review aims to elucidate important probiotic research regarding the isolation and characterization of beneficial cultures in Brazil, and to demonstrate the relevance of the dairy chain as a potential source of novel cultures for the development of new probiotic products to expand the Brazilian dairy industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3adairy industry 3adata collection 3adigestion 3afermented milk 3afood industry 3ahuman health 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3amicrobiological quality 3aprobiotics 3aBrazil 0adairy 0alactic acid bacteria1 aTodorov, Svetoslav Dimitrov1 aEller, Monique1 aNero, Luis Augusto,0 tJournal of dairy research.g2018 Nov., v. 85, no. 4 p.487-496dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299180008453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011800167300001800285520164500303592002801948650002101976650002901997650003502026650001502061650002602076650001602102650001102118650001602129650001502145651002502160651001302185700002202198700002002220700001902240700002202259700002002281773016502301856008202466852000902548655001202557IND60480523020221121065520.0160128e20031201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048052302DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.69.12.13992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWade, Timothy G.12aA Comparison of Vector and Raster GIS Methods for Calculating Landscape Metrics Used in Environmental Assessments  ap. 1399-1405.  a<p><i>GIS-based measurements that combine native raster and native vector data are commonly used in environmental assessments. Most of these measurements can be calculated using either raster or vector data formats and processing methods. Raster processes are more commonly used because they can be significantly faster computationally than vector, but error is introduced in converting vector data to raster. This conversion error has been widely studied and quantified, but the impact on environmental assessment results has not been investigated. We examined four GIS-based measurements commonly used in environmental assessments for approximately 1000 watersheds in the state of Maryland and Washington, D.C. Each metric was calculated using vector and raster methods, and estimated values were compared using a paired t-test, Spearman rank correlation, and cluster analyses. Paired t-tests were used to determine the statistical significance of quantitative differences between methods, and Spearman rank correlation and cluster analyses were used to evaluate the impact of the differences on environmental assessments. Paired t-test results indicated significant quantitative differences between methods for three of the four metrics. However, Spearman ranks and cluster analyses indicated that the quantitative differences would not affect environmental assessment results. Spearman rank correlations between vector and raster values were greater than 0.98 for all comparisons. Cluster analyses resulted in identical assignment for 88 percent to over 98 percent of watersheds analyzed among vector and various raster methods.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3acluster analysis 3aenvironmental assessment 3ageographic information systems 3alandscapes 3aprocessing technology 3araster data 3at-test 3avector data 3awatersheds 3aDistrict of Columbia 3aMaryland1 aWickham, James D.1 aNash, Maliha S.1 aNeale, Anne C.1 aRiitters, Kurt H.1 aJones, K.

Serious erosion of moving parts, high solid flow rate requirement, and high operating temperature preclude the use of mechanical solid feeders. A nonmechanical solid feeding system was designed and developed in the Chemical Engineering Division of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for continuous solid addition to the fluidized bed. The controlled continuous solid addition fulfills various purposes – maintain proper particle size distribution inside fluidized bed, provide make up for entrained solids, and supply solid reactant where solids are consumed in reaction. A solid circulation vessel which works on the principle of compartmented fluidized bed was the heart of this solid feeding system. It consists of two compartments (main and riser), and the compartments were connected through an orifice. Solid discharge rate from solid circulation vessel was regulated by adjusting the fluidizing air flow rates to main and riser compartments and solid level in the main compartment. Theoretical and experimental investigations were carried out to evaluate performance characteristics of solid circulation vessel. Experimental results showed that a wide range of solid discharge rate (6–80 kg/h) could be achieved by changing aeration rates of two compartments and fluidized solid level in the main compartment. The experimental data were used to develop a correlation between solid mass flow rate through an orifice and pressure drop across an orifice. A mathematical model was also developed to predict the solid discharge rate from solid circulation vessel for a range of operating parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair flow 3achemical engineering 3achemistry 3afeeding methods 3afluidized beds 3amass flow 3amathematical models 3aparticle size distribution 3atemperature1 aBaveja, Neetu A.1 aVarshney, Gaurav1 aThomas, Deepa1 aShringi, C.

Soil samples were collected by systematic random sampling around the flow stations in Kokori and Kolo Creek, Niger Delta Nigeria. The concentrations of Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd in the soil were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry after wet-digestion in acid mixture of HNO₃ + HCl + H₂O₂. Mean concentration values of Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, and Cd in the soil of both Kokori and Kolo Creek were higher in some cases by several orders of magnitude than the Control values except for Ni in Kokori and Pb in Kolo Creek. The levels of Index of geo-accumulation (I-geo) were no pollution to low pollution except Cr in Kolo Creek that indicates strong pollution. Nemerow integrated pollution index (NIPI) also indicates the soil of Kokori and Kolo Creek to be of moderate and high levels of pollution respectively with Zn majorly contributing to the pollution status in Kokori while Cr, Zn and Ni are the major pollutants in Kolo Creek. However, a different pollution pattern was observed in the single potential ecological risk assessment of metals in the soil. Cd and Cr in Kokori and Cr, Cd and Ni in Kolo Creek portend ecological risk with the following patterns; Cd = Cr > Zn = Pb = Ni and Cr > Cd = Ni > Zn = Pb respectively. Comprehensive potential ecological risk (RI) assessment indicated low potential ecological risk for Kokori and Kolo Creek; and the major contributors are Cd, Ni and Cr. Therefore, there is urgent need to remediate these metals that could pose ecological risk so that further buildup would be prevented, and avert any potential harm to ecological functioning of the areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3aecological function 3aenvironmental assessment 3ageochemistry 3aheavy metals 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustry 3alead 3anickel 3anitric acid 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3astreams 3azinc 3aNigeria1 aOgunkunle, C.

The most prevalent antimicrobial resistance identified was to streptomycin (100%), followed by tetracycline (99%), sulfonamides (98%), ampicillin (82%), and neomycin (62%). Resistance was mediated predominantly by strA-strB (92%), tetA (67%), sul2 (90%), blaTEM (79%), and aphA1 (63%) gene markers, respectively. Twenty-seven isolates harbored a class 1 integrase (intI1), while qacEΔ1 and sul1 markers were identified in 25 and 26 isolates, respectively. The variable regions of these integrons contained aminoglycoside, trimethoprim, and β-lactam resistance determinants (aadA12, aadB-aadA1, blaOXA-30-aadA1, dfrA1-aadA1, dfrA7). Class 2 integrons were identified less frequently (4%) and contained the gene cassette array dfrA1-sat1-aadA1. Resistance to ampicillin, neomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamide, and tetracycline was associated with transferable high-molecular-weight plasmids, as demonstrated by conjugation assays. A panel of virulence markers was screened for by PCR, and genes identified included vt1, K5 in 2 isolates, papC in 10 isolates, and PAI IV536 in 37 isolates. MDR commensal E. coli isolates from Irish cattle displayed considerable diversity with respect to the genes identified. Our findings highlight the importance of the commensal microflora of food-producing animals as a reservoir of transferable MDR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acattle 3afarms 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3amicroorganisms 3aneomycin 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astreptomycin 3asulfonamides 3atetracycline 3atrimethoprim 3avirulence 3aIreland1 aWalsh, Ciara1 aSlowey, Rosemarie1 aLeonard, Nola1 aFanning, Séamus0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 77, no. 20 p.7121-7127dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00601-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01395naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011600165300001600281520032900297592002800626650004300654650001000697650003000707650003500737650001400772700001800786700001600804700002300820700001900843773011500862856008300977852000901060655001201069IND60603524620221117201753.0180716e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060352462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2015.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Insook10aIdentification of five Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli genes by Luminex microbead-based suspension array  ap. 108-110.  aTo rapidly identify the presence of potentially virulent O157:H7 and non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), a PCR-based Luminex suspension assay was developed to detect the genes coding for four virulence factors (stx1, stx2, eae, and ehxA) plus the O157:H7-specific +93 uidA single nucleotide polymorphism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avirulence1 aBinet, Rachel1 aLin, Andrew1 aHammack, Thomas S.1 aKase, Julie A.0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2015 Apr., v. 111 p.108-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2015.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245011600177300001600293520100000309592002801309650001101337650001201348650001001360650001401370650001601384650003101400650002001431650001201451650001801463650001101481650001001492650001101502650002801513650001901541650000901560650002601569650001701595650002501612650001001637653002301647653001501670653001901685653002101704700002701725700003001752700003001782700002801812700003101840700002801871700003001899773011601929856008202045852000902127655001202136IND60564193020221120183949.0180830e20170406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056419302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira Galdino, Pablinny10aNephroprotective effect of Rudgea viburnoides (Cham.)

Also blood and kidney samples were collected for further laboratory and histological analyses.R. viburnoides leaves extract improved renal function. It also improved the renal function impairments caused by gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity, as revealed by glomerular filtration rate, urine output and proteinuria.R. viburnoides exert renoprotective effect, which may support its popular use for renal diseases treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abladder 3ablood 3adiuretics 3afood intake 3aglomerular filtration rate 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amales 3amodels 3anephroprotective effect 3anephrotoxicity 3arats 3arenoprotective effect 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aurine 0aRudgea viburnoides 0aGentamicin 0aNephrotoxicity 0aMedicinal plants1 aNunes Alexandre, Layse1 aFernanda Pacheco, Lílian1 ade Souza Lino Junior, Ruy1 ade Paula, José Realino1 aRodrigues Pedrino, Gustavo1 aHenrique Xavier, Carlos1 aMaria Ferreira, Patrícia0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2017 Apr. 06, v. 201 p.100-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011700170300001600287520104400303592002801347650001901375650001801394650003101412650003001443650002601473650001701499650002501516650001201541650000901553650001201562650001201574650001701586650001001603650000901613650001901622650001501641650002501656653000701681653000801688653000801696653001001704653001001714653000801724653000801732653001001740653000901750653000701759653000701766653000801773653000901781653000901790653000901799653000801808653001701816653001701833653002701850653001501877653001701892653001801909700002301927700001701950700001801967700001601985700002002001700002602021773011102047856008202158852000902240655001202249IND60086524620221118230551.0190319e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008652462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Shannon M.12aA polyacetylene-rich extract from Gymnaster koraiensis strongly inhibits colitis-associated colon cancer in mice  ap. 235-239.  aGymnaster koraiensis (GK) is a Korean herb used in folk medicine and recently found to positively impact liver health. Because GK contains polyacetylenes and because other polyacetylenes have been found to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, we hypothesized that the polyacetylene gymnasterkoreayne B (GKB), known to increase hepatic detoxification enzymes, may also exert anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. We fed male C57BL/6 mice purified AIN93G diets containing no additions, GKB or the GKB-rich fraction of an ethanol extract (GE) from GK to determine if these diets would slow or prevent either inflammation or inflammation-enhanced colon cancer, using the dextran sulfate sodium/azoxymethane mouse model. The GKB (500μmol/kgdiet daily) showed some anti-inflammatory activity, but GE, containing an equal dose of GKB, protected strongly against both inflammation and colon cancer, decreasing adenocarcinomas by 90%. These data support further research into GK as a promising potential anti-cancer agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aazoxymethane 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adextran 3adiet 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3ainflammation 3aliver 3amice 3apolyacetylenes 3atoxicology 3atraditional medicine 0aAD 0aADC 0aAOM 0aCOX-2 0aCYP1A 0aDAI 0aDSS 0aELISA 0aEROD 0aGE 0aGK 0aGKB 0aIL-6 0aNQO1 0aPCNA 0aPSN 0aAzoxymethane 0aColon cancer 0aDextran sulfate sodium 0aPrevention 0aInflammation 0aPolyacetylene1 aWallig, Matthew A.1 aNho, Chu Won1 aPan, Cheol-Ho1 aLee, Eun-Ha1 aJung, Sang Hoon1 aJeffery, Elizabeth H.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Mar., v. 53 p.235-239dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245013900179300001800318520101100336536027201347592002801619596003301647596005701680596002501737650002001762650001501782650001901797650002201816650002401838650001001862650001601872650001801888650002001906650001301926653001801939653001501957653002101972653001801993700003602011700002202047773012602069856008602195852000902281655001202290IND60759189820221117002520.0220304e20211217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075918982DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2020.17986642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViana, Rodrigo da Silva10aEffect of trans-cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid on fibroblast motility: a pilot comparative study of in silico lipophilicity measure  ap. 5872-5878.  aCinnamic acids and their derivatives are found in abundance in fruits, vegetables, and other food products of plant origin. The trans-cinnamic and p-coumaric acids in particular have been a subject of research for the treatment of a diverse range of pathological conditions. However, it is unclear whether these derivatives exert a direct beneficial effect on the cells that play a role in regulating skin wound healing, such as fibroblasts. In this study, using in vitro scratch-wound healing assay, it was observed that treatment with trans-cinnamic acid resulted in increased migration of fibroblasts when compared with that of p-coumaric acid-treated cells, without any adverse effect on cell viability. Studies on the lipophilicity of these acids using the XLOGP3 algorithm showed that trans-cinnamic acid was more lipophilic than p-coumaric. Thus, the findings of this study indicated that the lipophilic characteristic of trans-cinnamic acid rendered it more suitable as a potential drug candidate.  aThe authors thank Ms. Juliane Pereira da Silva for technical support.

To shed light on the mechanism of their activities, the interaction of an imidazolium-based IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrfluoroborate ([BMIM][BF₄]) with E. coli bacteria and cell-membrane-mimicking lipid mono- and bilayers has been studied. The survival of the bacteria and corresponding growth inhibition are observed to be functions of the concentration of the IL. The IL alters the pressure–area isotherm of the monolayer formed at an air–water interface by the 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) lipid. The in-plane elasticity of the lipid layer is reduced as a consequence of the insertion of this IL. The X-ray reflectivity study from a polymer-supported lipid bilayer shows strong perturbation in the self-assembled structure of the bilayer due to the interaction. As a consequence, there is a considerable decrease in bilayer thickness and a corresponding increase in electron density. These results, however, depend on the chain configurations of the lipid molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aX-radiation 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3agrowth retardation 3aionic liquids 3alipid bilayers 3alipids 3atoxicity1 aGiri, R.

This paper reports the findings of an investigation undertaken on concretes made using scale and steel chips waste from the iron and steel industries as a substitute for sand. The percentage of natural sand replaced with scale and steel chips waste varied from 25% to 100% in terms of weight of sand. The concrete was classified according to the concentration of scale and steel chips waste – ScC-25, ScC-50, ScC-75, ScC-100, SchC-25, SchC-50, SchC-75, and SchC-100. The aim of this study is to investigate the compressive strength properties of mixed concrete shields and to compare the thickness of mixed concrete shields with the thickness of ordinary concrete shields (OC-0) to protect against X-ray radiation.For comparison between the thicknesses of mixed concretes and ordinary concrete, we first determined the thickness of OC-0 corresponding to the thickness of concretes with a scale and steel chips waste admixture using lead equivalent (LE). The experimental results were at once rewarding and promising. The results obtained demonstrate a tendency for the thicknesses of mixed concretes to decrease as the mixing ratio of scale and steel chips waste aggregate increases. The data shows that concrete mixed with steel chips waste have better strength than ordinary concrete, while in the case of concrete mixed with scale waste, an addition of over 25% brought about a reduction in compressive strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aconcrete 3airon 3alead 3amanufacturing 3amixing 3asand 3asteel 3awastes 0aConcrete 0aScale waste 0aSteel chips waste 0aCompressive strength 0aConcrete thickness 0aX-ray radiation 0aLead equivalent0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Nov. 20, v. 137 p.1038-1044dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.2113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245012900177300001800306520140100324592002801725650001601753650002301769650002101792650002001813650002401833650001701857650001801874650004401892650001401936650001301950650002101963650003701984700002402021773009802045856008602143852000902229655001202238IND60577695520171221000000.0170810e20170207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057769552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b032692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnakumar, Sreedevi10aCovalent Functionalization of Organic Nanoparticles Using Aryl Diazonium Chemistry and Their Solvent-Dependent Self-Assembly  ap. 1162-1170.  aA simple method for covalent functionalization of Fréchet-type dendron nanoparticles (FDNs) using tris-bipyridylruthenium(II) is described. Covalent functionalization is achieved by chemically reducing the diazo derivative of a ruthenium(II)bipyridine complex in the presence of FDNs wherein the radical species generated gets covalently linked to the nanoparticle surface. Simplicity, rapidity, and robustness are the advantages offered by the present approach. The nanoparticles, post functionalization, were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared, energy-dispersive X-ray, UV–visible, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. Depending on the solvent, the ruthenium complex-linked FDN displays a range of morphologies, including nanoparticles, fiber-networks, and nanocapsules. In the nanocapsules and fiber-networks observed in organic solvents, the ruthenium complex is confined within the interior domain of the aggregate, whereas in the nanoparticles observed in water, it is present on the periphery. The formation of predictable morphologies in different solvents plays a key role in using such self-assembled structures for various applications such as sensing, catalysis, and light harvesting. Characterization of these nanoaggregates using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques is also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3adiazo compounds 3adiazonium compounds 3ananocapsules 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aruthenium 3asolvents 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGopidas, Karical R.0 tLangmuir.g2017 Feb. 07, v. 33, no. 5 p.1162-1170dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b032693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016400167300001600331500001500347520132500362592002801687650000901715650001701724650000901741650001001750650001301760650000901773650001201782650000901794650001201803650000901815650001501824650001101839650001101850650001101861650000901872650000901881650001301890650001901903650001301922650001601935650000901951650001101960650001301971651001001984653002701994653002002021653002202041653002102063653002002084653002202104653001002126700001902136700002202155773011402177856008402291852000902375655001202384IND60121970820221118192323.0150324e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012197082DNAL7 a10.1080/10807039.2014.9463372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRai, Sarojni10aDietary Intakes and Health Risk of Toxic and Essential Heavy Metals through the Food Chain in Agricultural, Industrial, and Coal Mining Areas of Northern India  ap. 913-933.  a2019-12-04  aMinerals can enter the food chain through industrial and mining activities. Soil-to-vegetable transfer is higher than soil-to-cereal, but human consumption of metals is attributable to balanced diets containing both vegetables and cereals and drinking water. However, the impact of location on intakes of metals from predominantly cereal-based Indian diets is not clear. Hence, the present study was undertaken in selected Agricultural, Industrial, and Coal Mining Areas (AA, IA, CMA) around the Allahabad District in Northern India to compare transfer of toxic metals, Pb, Cd, Cr and essential metals, Fe, Zn, Cu, Co in soil and water to common crops: cereals (rice, wheat, maize) and vegetables (spinach, potato), and to assess Daily Intake of Metal (DIM) and consequent Health Risk Index (HRI). The overall content of all metals, except Cu, in water, soils, and crops followed the pattern CMA > IA > AA. Transfer factors (TFs) followed the sequence spinach > potato > cereals. Quantitatively, however, cereals contribute maximally to a balanced diet, so DIM and HRI were higher from cereals than vegetables. Even though spinach had the highest TFs, cereals contributed maximally to HRI. CMA had the highest metal content so locally grown cereals contributed significantly to intake of both toxic and essential metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3aheavy metals 3alead 3awheat 3apotatoes 3arisk 3aspinach 3airon 3acadmium 3acoal 3afood chain 3acobalt 3ahumans 3acopper 3acorn 3asoil 3atoxicity 3adrinking water 3achromium 3afood intake 3azinc 3amining 3aminerals 3aIndia 0adaily intake of metals 0aindustrial area 0aagricultural area 0acoal mining area 0atransfer factor 0ahealth risk index 0acrops1 aGupta, Supriya1 aMittal, Poonam C.0 tHuman and ecological risk assessment.g2015 May 19, v. 21, no. 4 p.913-933dTaylor & Francisx1549-78607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2014.9463373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245007500176300001300251520110800264592002801372650002501400650001901425650001501444650001301459650001501472650001401487650003101501650001701532653001701549653001301566653001301579653001101592653003201603653001901635653001701654700002401671773009301695856008201788852000901870655001201879IND60568019720221122212758.0170709e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056801972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2017.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVempatapu, Bhanu Prasad10aMonitoring petroleum fuel adulteration: A review of analytical methods  ap. 1-11.  aDetection of adulteration in the petroleum fuels (gasoline and diesel) is challenging because the adulterants usually include those compounds which are already present in these fuels. Measurements of various physico-chemical properties are employed in addition to chromatography and spectroscopy for determining the compositional variations of these fuels. It is required to ensure their compliance with the regulatory specifications. The inclusion of statistical design and data treatments certainly provide enough sensitivity to discriminate adulterated and unadulterated samples in the case of gasoline. On the contrary, discrimination of diesel from its adulterants is difficult which demands rigorous analytical strategies and unequivocal data interpretation. Through this review, we have attempted to organize the literature information on this subject with an emphasis to identify and optimize methods suitable for monitoring adulteration. Detailed discussions on the role of physico-chemical, chromatographic and spectroscopic methods in gasoline and diesel characterization have been presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3achromatography 3acompliance 3agasoline 3amonitoring 3apetroleum 3aphysicochemical properties 3aspectroscopy 0aAdulteration 0aGasoline 0aKerosene 0aDiesel 0aPhysico-chemical properties 0aChromatography 0aSpectroscopy1 aKanaujia, Pankaj K.0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2017 July, v. 92 p.1-11dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2017.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001300137245013800150300001800288520131100306592002801617650001501645650002401660650001601684650002601700650001501726650000901741650001101750650001801761650002501779650001601804700001401820700001801834773011801852856007101970852000902041655001202050IND60517326420221122034000.0160329e20091126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051732642DNAL7 a10.1139/Z09-1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodd, J.10aFactors influencing the emergence of a northern population of Eastern Ribbon Snakes (Thamnophis sauritus) from artificial hibernacula  ap. 1221-1226.  aWe investigated whether Eastern Ribbon Snakes (Thamnophis sauritus (L., 1766)) use a rise in water level as a cue for emergence from hibernation. We also examined the hypotheses that snakes use temperature gradients or endogenous signals as emergence cues. Twelve artificial hibernacula were used to house 15 Ribbon Snakes. Water level and temperature were regulated. Four Ribbon Snakes emerged from hibernation without any manipulation of water level or temperature. Eight snakes emerged after thermal conditions in their hibernacula changed. Of these, one emerged after the hibernaculum was made warmer on the surface than at depth, four emerged after the room temperature was increased to 9 °C, and three emerged after incandescent lights were shone on the surface of each hibernaculum. Three snakes died during hibernation. Eight snakes chose to hibernate fully submerged in water. Although the sample size is too small to draw conclusions that are statistically significant at αα = 0.05, our observations collectively suggest that Ribbon Snakes do not use a rise in water level as a cue to emerge. While water-level rise does not appear to be an emergence cue, hibernation below the water table may lead to increased survivorship by decreased metabolism and elimination of the risk of desiccation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThamnophis 3aambient temperature 3ahibernation 3aincandescent lighting 3ametabolism 3arisk 3asnakes 3asurvival rate 3atemperature profiles 3awater table1 aAmiel, J.1 aWassersug, R.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2009 Nov. 26, v. 87, no. 12 p.1221-1226dNational Research Councilx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z09-1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011700170300001400287520173400301592002802035650000802063650001302071650004402084650001002128650000902138650000902147650002502156653000902181653001802190653002602208653002502234653001102259653001802270700002002288700001802308700001602326700002002342700001502362700002302377700002002400773011202420856008302532852000902615655001202624IND60603524920221117201526.0180716e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060352492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2015.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsushita, Yuko10aAnalysis of variations in band positions for normalization in across-gel denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  ap. 11-20.  aVariation in band position between gels is a well-known problem in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). However, few reports have evaluated the degree of variation in detail. In this study, we investigated the variation in band positions of DNA samples extracted from soil, normalized using reference positions within marker lanes for DGGE in three organismal (bacterial, fungal, and nematode) conditions. For sample lanes, marker DNA (as a control) and sample DNA were used. The test for normality of distribution showed that the position data of a large percentage of bands were normally distributed but not for certain bands. For the normally-distributed data, their variations [standard deviation of marker bands (SDM) and standard deviation of sample bands (SDS), respectively] were assessed. For all organismal conditions, the degree of within-gel variation were similar between SDMs and SDSs, while between-gel variations in SDSs were larger than those in SDMs. Due to the large effect of between-gel variations, the total variations in SDSs were more varied between sample bands, and the mean variations of all sample bands were higher than those in the markers. We found that the total variation in the fungal and nematode SDSs decreased when the intervals between marker bands were narrowed, suggesting that band interval is important for reducing total variation in normalized band positions. For the non-normally distributed data, the distribution was examined in detail. This study provided detailed information on the variation of band positions, which could help to optimize markers for reducing band position variation, and could aid in the accurate identification of bands in across-gel DGGE analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNematoda 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afungi 3agels 3asoil 3astatistical analysis 0aDGGE 0aBand position 0aBetween-gel variation 0aWithin-gel variation 0aMarker 0aNormalization1 aYamamura, Kohji1 aMorimoto, Sho1 aBao, Zhihua1 aKurose, Daisuke1 aSato, Ikuo1 aYoshida, Shigenobu1 aTsushima, Seiya0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2015 May, v. 112 p.11-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6372x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2015.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009500164300001600259520084800275592002801123650001201151650001201163650002001175650001101195650001001206650001701216650001001233650000901243650001201252650000901264650002001273650001501293650000901308651001001317653001601327653001001343653002701353653002001380700001601400700001601416773011101432856008201543852000901625655001201634IND60086524920221118230947.0190319e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008652492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2012.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRu, Qiao-Mei10aRisk assessment of heavy metals in honey consumed in Zhejiang province, southeastern China  ap. 256-262.  aThe levels of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) in eight types of honey collected in China were determined. The average concentrations of the six heavy metals in the honey samples were 46.18, 1329.5, 1.34, 33.98, 13.44, and 1.65μgkg−1, respectively. All these values were below the maximum allowable contaminant levels in foods (GB2762-2005) and honey (GB14963-2011) in China. The hazard quotients of individual heavy metals and the hazard index of all six heavy metals were far below one, indicating no chronic-toxic risk from these metals for the inhabitants of Zhejiang under the current consumption rates of honey. However, the carcinogenic risk of As for the female inhabitants in Zhejiang exceeded the acceptable level of 10−4. Therefore, As is the most concerning heavy metal in honey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acarcinogenicity 3acopper 3afoods 3aheavy metals 3ahoney 3alead 3amercury 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atoxicology 3azinc 3aChina 0aHeavy metal 0aHoney 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aRisk assessment1 aFeng, Qiang1 aHe, Jin-Zhe0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2013 Mar., v. 53 p.256-262dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2012.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245010800177300001600285520189900301592002802200650001702228650002802245650001502273650002502288650001502313650001402328650001102342650002402353650001202377650001002389651001402399700002202413700001902435773010702454856005502561852000902616655001202625IND4470542720221119065017.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447054272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1747-0080.2011.01537.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMORRISON, Melinda K.10aDietetic practice in the management of gestational diabetes mellitus: A survey of Australian dietitians  ap. 189-194.  aAim: To examine current Australian dietetic practice in the management of gestational diabetes, to identify models of dietetic care and to determine the need for national evidence‐based dietetic practice guidelines for gestational diabetes. Methods: A 55‐item cross‐sectional survey of Australian dietitians practicing in the area of gestational diabetes was undertaken. Participants were recruited via Dietitians Association of Australia interest group membership, public and private hospital maternity and diabetes services across Australia. The survey examined dietetic service provision, interventions, management recommendations, postnatal care, current guideline use and the perceived need for Australian evidence‐based dietetic management guidelines. Results: A total of 220 eligible dietitians participated in the survey. The majority (77%) reported that all women with gestational diabetes attending their service were referred to a dietitian. Group (33%) and individual consults (93%) were provided and 67% provided one to two dietetic consults per client. Fifty‐four per cent (54%) believed that their service currently offered adequate antenatal dietetic interventions and 8% adequate postnatal follow up for women with gestational diabetes. There were differences in the implementation of medical nutrition therapy by Australian dietitians in regards to nutrient recommendations. However, consistency was seen in key components of nutrition education. Dietitians perceived that there was a need for evidence‐based gestational diabetes dietetic practice guidelines (86%) and nutrition recommendations (87%). Conclusion: The survey results strongly indicate there is a need for evidence‐based gestational diabetes practice guidelines and nutritional recommendations and provide baseline data for future practice of Australian dietitians working in gestational diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet therapy 3adietary recommendations 3adietitians 3agestational diabetes 3aguidelines 3ahospitals 3amodels 3anutrition education 3asurveys 3awomen 3aAustralia1 aCOLLINS, Clare E.1 aLOWE, Julia M.0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2011 Sept., v. 68, no. 3 p.189-194dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2011.01537.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245013100210300001800341506007600359520169600435592002802131506003702159650002802196650001102224650001302235650000902248650002502257650001302282650001502295650001902310650001102329700002202340700001802362700002002380773009802400856008602498852000902584655001202593IND60577695720221207092212.0170810e20170207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057769572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b035252doi7 aPMC54974622pmcid7 a280813632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Xianglin10aDistance-Dependent Measurements of the Conductance of Porphyrin Nanorods Studied with Conductive Probe Atomic Force Microscopy  ap. 1132-1138.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtocols for nanopatterning porphyrins on Au(111) were developed based on immersion particle lithography. Porphyrins with and without a central metal ion, 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphyrin (TPP) and 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphyrin cobalt(II) (CoTPP), were selected for study, which spontaneously formed nanorod geometries depending on concentration parameters. The elongated shapes of the nanorods offers an opportunity for successive distance-dependent conductive probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) measurements along the length of the nanorods. To prepare patterns of TPP and CoTPP nanorods, a mask of silica mesospheres was placed on gold substrates to generate nanoholes within an alkanethiol matrix film. The nanoholes prepared by particle lithography with an immersion step were backfilled with porphyrins by a second immersion step. By controlling the concentration and immersion interval, nanorods of porphyrins were generated with one end of the nanostructure attached to gold within a nanohole. The porphyrin nanorods exhibited slight differences in dimensions at the nanoscale to enable size-dependent measurements of conductive properties. The conductivity along the horizontal direction of the nanorods was evaluated with CP-AFM studies. Changes in conductivity were measured along the long axis of TPP and CoTPP nanorods. The TPP nanorods exhibited conductive profiles of an insulating material, and the CoTPP nanorods exhibited profiles of a semiconductor. The experiments demonstrate the applicability of particle lithography for preparing unique and functional surface platforms of porphyrins to measure distance-dependent conductive properties on gold.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatomic force microscopy 3acobalt 3ageometry 3agold 3ainsulating materials 3ananorods 3aporphyrins 3asemiconductors 3asilica1 aAlexander, Denzel1 aDerosa, Pedro1 aGarno, Jayne C.0 tLangmuir.g2017 Feb. 07, v. 33, no. 5 p.1132-1138dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b035253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245008000208300001100288506007600299520177600375592002802151506003702179650001702216650002802233650001402261650001202275650002002287650003002307650001402337650001502351650001202366650001102378650001402389650003302403700001702436700002202453700001802475700002002493773009202513856007902605852000902684655001202693IND60440657420221207083025.0160903e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044065742DNAL7 a10.1186/1742-9994-11-162doi7 aPMC39752492pmcid7 a246252692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanke, Alexander10aHead morphology of Tricholepidion gertschi indicates monophyletic Zygentoma  ap. 16.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe relic silverfish Tricholepidion gertschi is the sole extant representative of the family Lepidotrichidae. Its phylogenetic position is of special interest, since it may provide crucial insights into the early phenotypic evolution of the dicondylian insects. However, the phylogenetic position of T. gertschi is unclear. Originally, it was classified among silverfish (Zygentoma), but various alternative relationships within Zygentoma as well as a sistergroup relationship to all remaining Zygentoma + Pterygota are discussed, the latter implying a paraphyly of Zygentoma with respect to Pterygota. Since characters of the head anatomy play a major role in this discussion, we here present the so far most detailed description of the head of T. gertschi based on anatomical studies by synchrotron micro-computer tomography and scanning electron microscopy. A strong focus is put on the documentation of mouthparts and the anatomy of the endoskeleton as well as the muscle equipment. In contrast to former studies we could confirm the presence of a Musculus hypopharyngomandibularis (0md4). The ligamentous connection between the mandibles composed of Musculus tentoriomandibularis inferior (0md6) is also in contact with the anterior tentorium. Phylogenetic analysis of cephalic data results in monophyletic Zygentoma including T. gertschi. Zygentoma are supported by the presence of a set of labial muscles originating at the postocciput, presence of an additional intralabral muscle, and four labial palpomeres. Character systems like the genitalic system, the mating behaviour, the segmentation of the tarsi, the overall body form, and the presence of ocelli which were proposed in other studies as potentially useful for phylogenetic reconstruction are evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLepismatidae 3aTricholepidion gertschi 3aequipment 3ainsects 3amating behavior 3amicro-computed tomography 3amonophyly 3amouthparts 3amuscles 3aocelli 3aparaphyly 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aKoch, Markus1 aWipfler, Benjamin1 aWilde, Fabian1 aMisof, Bernhard0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.16-16dBioMed Centralx1742-99947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-11-163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010000207300001100307520203900318592002802357650001302385650001802398650001302416650001202429650001202441650002802453650001502481650001502496651001702511700002102528700002902549773012602578856008302704852000902787655001202796IND60729927820221117224937.0210731e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072992782DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-021-00667-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakker, Teatske1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9608-161210aAssessing the effects of Farmer Field Schools on farmers’ trajectories of change in practices  ap. 18.  aIn West Africa, farmers face challenges to innovate and change their practices toward more sustainable cropping systems. Farmer Field Schools (FFS), an advisory service based on participatory principles, aim to support farmers’ innovation. This study investigates farmers’ innovation by characterizing their trajectories of change in agricultural practices after they participated in FFS. Two contrasting types of FFS for family farmers in the cotton-growing area of West Africa were selected. The FFS differed in how they were implemented; farmer participation was either consultative (farmers participated little in developing the FFS curricula and structure) or collaborative (farmers participated actively in developing the FFS curricula and structure). Former FFS participants were interviewed on their successive changes in cropping practices over a 4 to 8-year time span. The sample included seven FFS on rainy season cropping (17 interviews in Burkina Faso, 22 in Togo), and four vegetable gardening FFS (21 interviews in Togo). The Efficiency-Substitution-Redesign framework was applied to pest management, organic and mineral fertilization and legume cropping practices. Our results show that the way FFS were implemented influenced farmers’ trajectories of change in practices. After consultative FFS, changes in practices were limited. After collaborative FFS, we found a variety of changes in the production and use of compost, biopesticides, and inclusion of legumes in the cropping system through intercropping or pure cropping. Redesign of cropping systems included increasing on-farm compost production, collective pest management, and crop rotations. Collaborative FFS can be seen as step-by-step design processes for locally adapted cropping systems. This is the first time that farmers’ trajectories of change in practices are used to assess the effects of FFS. This approach is valuable for understanding farmers’ decision making and the role of participatory innovation support initiatives such as FFS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abiopesticides 3acomposts 3afarmers 3alegumes 3asustainable development 3avegetables 3awet season 3aBurkina Faso1 aDugué, Patrick,1 ade Tourdonnet, Stéphane0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2021 Apr., v. 41, no. 2 p.18-18dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl33129x1774-07467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-021-00667-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245008900164300001600253520082000269592002801089650001201117650002001129650001501149650001001164650001201174650000901186650001301195650000901208650001001217651001301227651002601240700002101266700002001287773012501307856008301432852000901515655001201524IND6019653120221121141848.0170525e20111014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601965312DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12104652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaver, A.

However, the global extent of fire-driven discontinuities in tree cover is unknown, especially accounting for seasonality and soils. We use tree cover, climate, fire, and soils data sets to show that tree cover is globally discontinuous. Climate influences tree cover globally but, at intermediate rainfall (1000 to 2500 millimeters) with mild seasonality (less than 7 months), tree cover is bimodal, and only fire differentiates between savanna and forest. These may be alternative states over large areas, including parts of Amazonia and the Congo. Changes in biome distributions, whether at the cost of savanna (due to fragmentation) or forest (due to climate), will be neither smooth nor easily reversible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afires 3aforests 3arain 3asavannas 3asoil 3atrees 3aAmazonia 3aRepublic of the Congo1 aArchibald, Sally1 aLevin, Simon A.0 tScience.g2011 Oct. 14, v. 334, no. 6053 p.230-232dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12104653Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245012200162300001600284500000900300520140800309592002801717650001201745650002001757650001001777650001201787650001001799650001401809650002101823650001501844650001401859650001201873650000901885650001001894650001601904650001901920650001001939650001201949700001701961700001901978700001701997700001802014700001102032773019202043856007702235852000902312655001202321IND60666507220221118072103.0191028e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066650722DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2004.51302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchroder, J.

Bioaccessible Pb determined by the IVG method was compared with relative bioavailable Pb measured from dosing trials using juvenile swine for 18 contaminated soils ranging from 1270 to 14200 mg Pb kg⁻¹ Bioaccessible Pb was measured in the IVG gastric extraction (GE) and intestinal extraction (IE) solutions. Mean bioaccessible Pb values were 32.2% for GE without dough, 23.0% for GE with dough, 1.06% for IE without dough, and 0.56% for IE with dough. It is possible that phytic acid associated with the dough addition decreased bioaccessible Pb. In vivo relative bioavailable Pb ranges for different swine tissues were 1 to 87% for blood, 0 to 110% for liver, 1 to 124% for kidney, and 0.04 to 94% for bone. Strong linear relationships between IVG GE Pb with dough (r > 0.76, P < 0.0002), IVG IE Pb with dough (r > 0.56, P < 0.015), and IVG GE Pb without dough (r > 0.81, P < 0.0001) and in vivo bioavailable Pb as estimated with blood, kidney, liver, and bone were found. Inexpensive in vitro methods may be useful in providing an estimate of the variability in relative bioavailable Pb at a single study site. The IVG method can be used to estimate relative bioavailable Pb, As, and Cd in contaminated soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3ablood 3acadmium 3adough 3ageophagia 3ain vitro studies 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3aphytic acid 3apolluted soils 3aswine 3atissues1 aBasta, N.

In this study, portable near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate analyses were used for rapid determination of FmD, FI, pH, and Mc of cocoa beans. The samples were scanned in 900‐ to 1,700‐nm wavelength, and the spectral data were pretreated independently with first derivatives (FD) and second derivatives (SD), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), mean centering (MC), and standard normal variate (SNV), while linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and partial least squares regression (PLS‐R) were used to build the prediction models for FmD, FI, pH, and Mc. MSC plus SVM gave an accurate classification of 100%. For predicting FI, pH, and Mc, the PLS‐R model gave coefficient of correlation of 0.87, 0.82, and 0.89, respectively. The results showed that portable NIRS could be employed for cocoa bean examination. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Fermentation is the single most essential postharvest operation that influences cocoa beans quality parameters including moisture content, fermentation index (FI) and pH. Unlike stationary laboratory based wet chemistry technique or table top NIR spectroscopy, this study revealed that the relatively inexpensive portable NIR spectroscopy could provide very fast (within 30 s) results in the routine onsite evaluation of cocoa beans moisture content, fermentation index and pH on farmers field in Sub‐Saharan Africa. In particular, the study outcome highlights the potential application of portable NIR spectroscopy based on machine learning for efficient classification of fermentation duration and quantification of moisture content & pH of cocoa beans in real‐time usage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acocoa beans 3adiscriminant analysis 3afermentation 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apH 3aprediction 3aspectral analysis 3asupport vector machines 3awater content 3awavelengths 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aTeye, Ernest1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3502-673X1 aAgbemafle, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3716-56371 aAmuah, Charles L.

U.10aDesign of a system for genotyping of Gallus gallus based on the rSNP (Regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism) alleles affecting the egg shell thickness  ap. 216-220.  aPCR amplification of the six fragments of regulatory and coding regions of chicken ChEST985k21 gene (accession no. CR523443), substantially affecting the egg shell thickness quantitative trait, was carried out. Sequencing of these fragments in six chickens from a native Polish breed, Green-legged Partridgenous, with different manifestation of the trait of interest enabled identification of six single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites within the ChEST985k21 sequence. Five of these sites were located in the regulatory region, and one site, in the coding region. For all SNPs identified, the existence of transcription factor binding sites, present in only one allelic variant, was demonstrated. This finding enables considering these sites as regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, rSNP. The effect of rSNP discovered on the chicken egg shell thickness was tested using PCR amplification with allele-specific primers. In the groups of chicken of Rhode Island Red breed with thick (389.9 Â± 13.09 Î¼m) and thin (315.7 Â± 21.38 Î¼m) egg shells statistically significant differences in the allele frequencies of the ST2_1, ST3_1, ST3_2, and ST3_3 polymorphic sites. In the same groups of birds, statistically significant differences in the shell thickness were observed in the rSNP allele genotypic classes ST2_1, ST3_1, ST3_2, ST3_3, and ST6_1. Based on these data, it was concluded that rSNPs influenced manifestation of the quantitative trait examined, and the genotyping system for marker assisted selection was constructed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallus gallus 3aRhode Island Red 3aalleles 3abinding sites 3achicken eggs 3achickens 3aegg shell 3aegg shell thickness 3agene frequency 3agenotyping 3amarker-assisted selection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative traits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factors1 aSazanova, A.

The SiO₂ nanoparticles with different sizes were prepared by thermal oxidation of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) with different number of layers which were assembled on Si substrates. It was found that the size of SiO₂ nanoparticles increased with the number of assembled APTES layers. Using these SiO₂ nanoparticles as nucleation centers, the diameter distribution of as-grown SWCNTs were correlated with the size of SiO₂ particles. In addition, both the classical longitudinal optical or transverse optical bands of SiC in in situ Raman spectra during the whole growth process and the Si 2p peak of SiC in the X-ray photoelectron spectra were not observed, suggesting that the carbon sources did not react with the SiO₂ nanoparticles during the growth. Comparing to vapor–liquid–solid mechanism for metallic catalysts, vapor–solid mechanism is proposed which results in a lower growth rate when using SiO₂ nanoparticles as nucleation centers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3asilica 3asilicon 3avapors1 aZhang, Jin0 tCarbon.g2011 Aug., v. 49, no. 10 p.3316-3324dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012400153300001600277520183800293592002802131650002002159650002002179650002102199650000902220650001702229650003402246650001102280650002702291650002002318650002402338650002202362650001702384650001302401650001502414650001002429650000902439700001402448700001502462700001502477773013502492856007302627852000902700655001202709IND50074295120221121031420.0150206e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007429512DNAL7 a10.1111/jhn.120922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFayet, F.10aAvoidance of meat and poultry decreases intakes of omega‐3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, selenium and zinc in young women  ap. 135-142.  aBACKGROUND: Inadequate nutrient intake and physical inactivity may have adverse health consequences. The present study aimed to describe young female students' dietary intake, food choices and physical activity (PA) patterns, and also to determine the influence of dietary avoidance of meat and poultry on nutrient intake. METHODS: A cross‐sectional study of female university students was conducted. Questionnaires were used to measure dietary intakes, food habits and PA. Anthropometric measurements of participants included height, weight and calculated body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: There were 308 participants with a mean (SD) age of 22.9 (3.9) years and a BMI of 21.5 (2.8) kg m–²; 78% were in the BMI range 18.5–24.9 kg m–². Of those who responded to the PA questionnaire (n = 218), 53% reported activity ≥150 min per week, with walking being the largest contributor. Completed food frequency questionnaires were returned by 256 participants. National recommendations for servings of cereals, vegetables, meat, fish and energy‐dense ‘extra foods’ were not met by the majority of participants. Avoidance of animal foods was reported in 23% of women, and resulted in lower intakes of omega‐3 fatty acids, vitamin B₁₂, selenium and zinc (P < 0.05) compared to non‐avoidance. Iron intake from animal sources decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with the increase in meat and poultry avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: Female students had a healthy weight and reported adequate physical activity. However, in comparison to meat and poultry consumers, the avoidance of these foods was associated with a lower intake of some micronutrients. A sustained low intake of micronutrients may lead to adverse health effects in the longer‐term, such as compromised immune function and iron deficiency anaemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abody mass index 3acollege students 3afish 3afood choices 3afood frequency questionnaires 3agrains 3airon deficiency anemia 3anutrient intake 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphysical activity 3apoultry meat 3aselenium 3avegetables 3awomen 3azinc1 aFlood, V.1 aPetocz, P.1 aSamman, S.0 tJournal of human nutrition and dietetics.g2014 Apr., v. 27 Suppl s2 p.135-142dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0952-38717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jhn.120923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002000170245008500190300001800275520099000293592002801283650002501311650001001336650001701346650001501363650002001378650001401398650005001412650004801462650001501510650002001525700002201545700001701567700002001584700002001604773008901624856008701713852000901800655001201809IND4459912020221116160330.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445991202DNAL7 a209520392pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKryvych, Sergiy10aProteomics – The key to understanding systems biology of Arabidopsis trichomes  ap. 1061-1070.  aEvery multicellular organism consists of numerous organs, tissues and specific cell types. To gain detailed knowledge about the morphogenesis of these complex structures, it is inevitable to advance biochemical analyses to ultimate spatial and temporal resolution since individual cell types contribute differently to the overall performance of living objects. Single cell sampling combined with systems biological approaches was recently applied to investigations of Arabidopsis thaliana trichomes (leaf hairs). These are single celled structures that provide ideal model systems to address various aspects of plant cell development and differentiation at the level of individual cells. A previously suggested function of trichomes in plant stress responses could thus be confirmed. Furthermore, trichome-specific “omics” data collected in several laboratories are mutually conclusive which demonstrates the applicability of systems biological approaches at the single cell level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acells 3aplant stress 3aproteomics 3astress response 3atrichomes 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aProteomics 2aSystems Biology1 aKleessen, Sabrina1 aEbert, Berit1 aKersten, Birgit1 aFisahn, Joachim0 tPhytochemistry.g2011 July, v. 72, no. 10 p.1061-1070dElsevier Ltdx0031-94227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2010.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01366naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245011400162300001600276520035800292592002800650650002100678650002300699650002600722650000900748650001600757650002200773650002600795700002300821773012600844856007300970852000901043655001201052IND60657615220221119052350.0190816e20050125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065761522DNAL7 a10.1039/b414951c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoloukhtine, Andrei10aPhotoswitchable enediynes: use of cyclopropenone as photocleavable masking group for the enediyne triple bond  ap. 617-619.  aCyclopropenone 1, 2,3-benzobicyclo[8.1.0]undec-1(10)-en-4-yn-11-one, is a thermally stable compound showing no signs of decomposition after heating at 84 °C for 7 d, UV irradiation of which results in an efficient (Φ₃₀₀ = 0.45) and quantitative formation of benzannelated enediyne 2, which undergoes Bergman cyclization at the above temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemical compounds 3acyclization reactions 3aheat 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aultraviolet radiation1 aPopik, Vladimir V.0 tChemical communications.g2005 Jan. 25, , no. 5 p.617-619dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b414951c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015800177500001900335520154500354592002801899650000801927650002001935650002601955650001901981650001602000650001902016650001402035650001902049650002102068650001102089650006602100650002002166650001302186650001502199650001402214650001802228650001102246651001102257700002402268700002402292700002302316700003002339700002602369773012602395856008502521852000902606655001202615IND60738822820221118105431.0210524e20210507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073882282DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90510072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanellas, Anna  L.

This study evaluated the cultivable Vibrio community in the Guanabara Bay (GB), a recreational, yet heavily polluted estuary in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Over one year, 66 water samples from three locations along a pollution gradient were investigated. Isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, revealing 20 Vibrio species, including several potential pathogens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing confirmed resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams (including carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins), fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines. Four strains were producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), all of which carried beta-lactam and heavy metal resistance genes. The toxR gene was detected in all V. parahaemolyticus strains, although none carried the tdh or trh genes. Higher bacterial isolation rates occurred in months marked by higher water temperatures, lower salinities, and lower phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. The presence of non-susceptible Vibrio spp. was related to indicators of eutrophication and sewage inflow. DNA fingerprinting analyses revealed that V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus strains non-susceptible to antimicrobials might persist in these waters throughout the year. Our findings indicate the presence of antimicrobial-resistant and potentially pathogenic Vibrio spp. in a recreational environment, raising concerns about the possible risks of human exposure to these waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaminoglycosides 3aantibiotic resistance 3abeta-lactamase 3acarbapenems 3acephalosporins 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afluoroquinolones 3ahumans 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ametal tolerance 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apublic health 3asewage 3aBrazil1 aLopes, Isabelle  R.1 aMello, Marianne  P.1 aParanhos, Rodolfo 1 ade Oliveira, Bruno  F.

The purpose of this study was to estimate wellfield capacity and provide a preliminary design for two radial collector wells to be constructed in the outwash aquifer along the Des Moines River near Saylorville, Iowa. After a field investigation to characterize the aquifer, regional two‐dimensional and local three‐dimensional, steady‐state groundwater flow modeling was performed to locate and design the wells. This modeling was the foundation for design recommendations based on the relative performance of 12 collector well designs with varying lateral numbers, elevations, screen lengths, and orientations. For each site, alternate designs were evaluated based on model estimates of the capacity, the percent of surface water captured, and the production per unit length of screen. Many of our results are consistent with current design practices based on experience and intuition, but our methods allow for a quantitative approach for comparing alternate designs. Although the results are site‐specific, the framework for evaluating the hydraulic design of the Saylorville radial collector wells is broadly applicable and could be used at other riverbank filtration sites. In addition, many of the conclusions from this design study may apply at other sites where construction of radial collector wells is being considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acollectors 3aexperimental design 3afiltration 3ahydrologic models 3aquantitative analysis 3arivers 3asurface water 3awater utilities 3awells 2aGroundwater 2aModels, Theoretical 3aIowa1 aKelson, Vic1 aWittman, Jack1 aRash, Vern0 tGround water.g2012 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.355-366dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2011.00850.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009800152300001600250520113400266592002801400650002501428650002101453650002801474650001601502650001901518650002001537650001801557650000901575650002601584650002501610650000901635700001701644700001701661700001501678700001801693700001701711700001601728700001701744773011901761856007401880852000901954655001201963IND60626955020221122180918.0190128e20190107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062695502DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra08453j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Lu10aFe/Zn-modified tricalcium phosphate (TCP) biomaterials: preparation and biological properties  ap. 781-789.  aBone repairing materials play an essential role in the repair treatment of bone defects. The presence of calcium phosphate invertebrates is of significance for bone repairing processes. However, the mechanical properties and osteogenic activities of many current calcium phosphate materials are not ideal, which limit their biological applications. Therefore, it is an effective alternative strategy to study the modification of calcium phosphate biomaterials to address these limitations. In this research, in order to enhance the biological performance of tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), metal species (Fe and Zn) modified β-TCP materials through the co-precipitation method were successfully developed. The physical, chemical and biological properties of the binary composites were carefully studied for the first time. The bioactivities of the Fe-TCP and Zn-TCP were evaluated by simulating body fluid (SBF) immersion experiments, blood compatibility, and cytotoxicity tests. The findings demonstrated that the metal-TCP with excellent cytocompatibility and osteogenic properties shows good potential in medical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abody fluids 3abone formation 3acoprecipitation 3ainvertebrates 3airon 3amechanical properties 3atricalcium phosphate 3azinc1 aYang, Yuanyi1 aFu, Zhiqiang1 aLi, Yunfei1 aShi, Jiacheng1 aMa, Daichuan1 aLiu, Suilin1 aLuo, Daibing0 tRSC advances.g2019 Jan. 07, v. 9, no. 2 p.781-789dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08453j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010800190300001800298520135200316592002801668650001701696650001001713650001201723650001001735650002301745650001301768650002501781650001401806650001201820650001701832650004601849650002501895650002301920650004501943650001401988651001702002651001302019651001302032700001802045773010402063856005502167852000902222655001202231IND4468324820221116160402.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446832482DNAL7 a219811122pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05294.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWEIR, JASON T.10aAndean uplift promotes lowland speciation through vicariance and dispersal in Dendrocincla woodcreepers  ap. 4550-4563.  aAndean uplift contributed importantly to the build‐up of high Neotropical diversity. Final uplift of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia separated once‐contiguous lowland faunas east and west of the Andes between 5 and 3.5 million years ago (Ma hereafter). We used DNA sequences from several moderate‐ to fast‐evolving mitochondrial and two slow‐evolving nuclear genes to generate a well‐supported phylogeny of Dendrocincla woodcreepers, a genus with multiple species endemic to lowland regions both east and west of the Andes. A time‐calibrated phylogeny and dispersal–vicariance analysis indicated that uplift of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia resulted in the initial vicariant separation of a widespread lowland form east and west of the Andes at c. 3.6 Ma. This was followed by two separate east‐to‐west dispersal events over or around the completed Andes, each producing a genetically distinct lineage. Our analysis suggests that Andean uplift promoted the build‐up of biodiversity in lowland Neotropical faunas both through vicariance‐based speciation during uplift and through dispersal‐based speciation following uplift. In contrast to the multiple colonizations of the trans‐Andean region by Dendrocincla, the Atlantic Forest was colonized from the Amazon only once, followed by in situ diversification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3afauna 3aforests 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3alowlands 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Speciation 2aPasseriformesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 3aAndes region 3aColombia 0aColombia1 aPRICE, MOMOKO0 tMolecular ecology.g2011 Nov., v. 20, no. 21 p.4550-4563dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05294.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012800172520105200300592002801352650002501380650002401405650001301429650002001442650001001462650001001472650001401482650001901496650001901515650002001534650001701554650001501571650001401586650004301600650005201643650001101695650001201706650003101718650001401749653001901763653003101782653002101813700001301834700001601847700001301863700001401876700001801890700001301908700001901921773009901940856009002039852000902129655001202138IND60679927520221119172925.0200210e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067992752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7344992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaodan10aCitrobacter freundii infection in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and host immune-related gene expression profiles  aCitrobacter freundii is widely distributed in nature as a typical conditional pathogen. In this study, the pathogenicity and histopathology of crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) infected with C. freundii were investigated, and immune-related gene expression profiling was performed. Challenge experiments confirmed that the isolated LJ1 strain of C. freundii had high virulence, leading to significant deaths of otherwise healthy shrimp. Histopathological analysis revealed that the hepatopancreas, intestines, and gills of diseased crayfish exhibited obvious inflammatory responses to C. freundii infection. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was also performed to investigate the expression pattern of twelve immune-related genes in gill, intestine, hepatopancreas, and hemocyte samples. The results showed various expression profiles and clear transcriptional activation of these immune related genes in the tested tissues. These results will contribute to further study of C. freundii infection and help to understand P. clarkii immune function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aProcambarus clarkii 3acrayfish 3agene expression 3agenes 3agills 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ashrimp 3atissues 3atranscriptional activation 3avirulence 0aSusceptibility 0aHistopathological analysis 0aImmune responses1 aHe, Xiao1 aAn, Zhenhua1 aSun, Wei1 aChen, Nan1 aGao, Xiaojian1 aLi, Xixi1 aZhang, Xiaojun0 tAquaculture.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 515 p.734499-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7344993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013500159520126000294592002801554650001101582650002501593650001201618650002201630650002601652650002001678650001801698650003101716650001601747650001101763650002201774650002001796650001001816651001201826700001901838700001701857700002201874700001901896773012001915856007302035852000902108655001202117IND60742568920221120203903.0210624e20210602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074256892DNAL7 a10.3390/f120607262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoltmann, Anne 10aCarbon Sequestration in Mixed Deciduous Forests: The Influence of Tree Size and Species Composition Derived from Model Experiments  aForests play an important role in climate regulation due to carbon sequestration. However, a deeper understanding of forest carbon flux dynamics is often missing due to a lack of information about forest structure and species composition, especially for non-even-aged and species-mixed forests. In this study, we integrated field inventory data of a species-mixed deciduous forest in Germany into an individual-based forest model to investigate daily carbon fluxes and to examine the role of tree size and species composition for stand productivity. This approach enables to reproduce daily carbon fluxes derived from eddy covariance measurements (R² of 0.82 for gross primary productivity and 0.77 for ecosystem respiration). While medium-sized trees (stem diameter 30–60 cm) account for the largest share (66%) of total productivity at the study site, small (0–30 cm) and large trees (>60 cm) contribute less with 8.3% and 25.5% respectively. Simulation experiments indicate that vertical stand structure and shading influence forest productivity more than species composition. Hence, it is important to incorporate small-scale information about forest stand structure into modelling studies to decrease uncertainties of carbon dynamic predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystem respiration 3aeddy covariance 3aforest stands 3agross primary productivity 3ainventories 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3astand structure 3atrees 3aGermany1 aHuth, Andreas 1 aPohl, Felix 1 aRebmann, Corinna 1 aFischer, Rico 0 tForests.g2021 June 02, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120607263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002600180245013300206300001800339500002000357506007600377520128300453592002801736506003701764650002101801650002001822650002601842650002101868650002101889650001001910650001001920650002301930650002801953650001601981650001301997650001102010650003302021650001802054650001502072650001902087650001402106650001202120700002402132700002502156700002402181700002402205700002002229700001802249700001802267773010902285856007302394852000902467655001202476IND60585680820221207134758.0171112e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058568082DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.124882doi7 aPMC66382882pmcid7 a275888922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez‐Muñoz, Neus14aThe resistance of sour orange to Citrus tristeza virus is mediated by both the salicylic acid and RNA silencing defence pathways  ap. 1253-1266.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCitrus tristeza virus (CTV) induces in the field the decline and death of citrus varieties grafted on sour orange (SO) rootstock, which has forced the use of alternative decline‐tolerant rootstocks in affected countries, despite the highly desirable agronomic features of the SO rootstock. Declining citrus plants display phloem necrosis below the bud union. In addition, SO is minimally susceptible to CTV compared with other citrus varieties, suggesting partial resistance of SO to CTV. Here, by silencing different citrus genes with a Citrus leaf blotch virus‐based vector, we have examined the implication of the RNA silencing and salicylic acid (SA) defence pathways in the resistance of SO to CTV. Silencing of the genes RDR1, NPR1 and DCL2/DCL4, associated with these defence pathways, enhanced virus spread and accumulation in SO plants in comparison with non‐silenced controls, whereas silencing of the genes NPR3/NPR4, associated with the hypersensitive response, produced a slight decrease in CTV accumulation and reduced stunting of SO grafted on CTV‐infected rough lemon plants. We also found that the CTV RNA silencing suppressors p20 and p23 also suppress the SA signalling defence, with the suppressor activity being higher in the most virulent isolates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus jambhiri 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aRNA interference 3aagronomic traits 3adeath 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaf blotch 3anecrosis 3aphloem 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3arootstocks 3asalicylic acid 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aVelázquez, Karelia1 aVives, María Carmen1 aRuiz‐Ruiz, Susana1 aPina, José Antonio1 aFlores, Ricardo1 aMoreno, Pedro1 aGuerri, José0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2017 Dec., v. 18, no. 9 p.1253-1266dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.124883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011800164520125600282592002801538650001901566650001201585650001101597650001901608651001101627700002601638700002101664773012001685856007301805852000901878655001201887IND60742569120221120193547.0210624e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074256912DNAL7 a10.3390/f120607282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolanek, Aleksandra 10aHuman Activity Affects Forest Fires: The Impact of Anthropogenic Factors on the Density of Forest Fires in Poland  aForest fires, due to climate change, are a growing threat to human life, health, and property, especially in temperate climates. Unfortunately, the impact of individual factors on forest fires varies, depending on the geographical region and its natural and socio-economic conditions. The latter are rarely introduced into fire warning systems, which significantly reduces their effectiveness. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to quantify the impact of a wide range of anthropogenic factors on forest fires, using Poland as a representative example of a Central European country. Data were analyzed in relation to districts for the period 2007–2017, using correlation analysis and regression modeling applying global and local/mixed regression methods. It was found that almost all of the 28 variables taken for analysis significantly determined the density of forest fires, but the greatest role was played by the length of the border between forests and built-up areas, and road density. In addition, the impact of most of the analyzed variables on forest fires varied over the study area, so implementing non-stationarity in geographically weighted regression models significantly improved the goodness-of-fit compared to global models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aforests 3ahumans 3asocioeconomics 3aPoland1 aSzymanowski, Mariusz 1 aRaczyk, Andrzej 0 tForests.g2021 June 03, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120607283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01459naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245009000155300001600245520032600261592002800587650002100615650001800636650002100654650002300675650001200698650001400710700001600724700001900740700001600759700001200775700001700787700002500804700002000829700001700849773012500866856007300991852000901064655001201073IND60657615620221119052420.0190816e20050208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065761562DNAL7 a10.1039/b415015e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Lingrong10aSingle-walled carbon nanotubes displaying multivalent ligands for capturing pathogens  ap. 874-876.  aA single-walled carbon nanotube was exploited for its semi-flexible pseudo-one-dimensional nanostructure as a unique scaffold to display multivalent carbohydrate ligands, with a specific demonstration showing that galactosylated carbon nanotubes were effective in the capturing of pathogenic Escherichia coli in solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical reactions 3aligands 3apathogens1 aElkin, Tara1 aJiang, Xiuping1 aLi, Huaping1 aLin, Yi1 aQu, Liangwei1 aTzeng, Tzuen-Rong J.1 aJoseph, Ronalda1 aSun, Ya-Ping0 tChemical communications.g2005 Feb. 8, , no. 7 p.874-876dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b415015e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100003100135245016900166300001600335520090100351592002801252650001501280650001001295650001601305650001801321650000901339651001001348700002701358700001901385700001901404773009501423856003801518852000901556655001201565IND4478912520221118223407.0120316s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447891252DNAL7 a10.1071/IS110232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaticchi, Maria Illuminata10aPlumatella trasimenica and Plumatella timwoodi, two new species belonging to the ârepens groupâ from central Italy (Bryozoa:Phylactolaemata:Plumatellidae)  ap. 444-453.  aTwo new species â Plumatella trasimenica, from Lake Trasimeno and from an external sedimentation pond of a tropical fish farm, and Plumatella timwoodi, from Lake Piediluco â are described.

Keratinocytes as the main cell type of the epidermis express a differentiation-specific set of type I and type II keratins forming a stable network and are major contributors of keratinocyte mechanical properties. However, owing to compensatory keratin expression, the overall contribution of keratins to cell mechanics was difficult to examine in vivo on deletion of single keratin genes. To overcome this problem, we used keratinocytes lacking all keratins. The mechanical properties of these cells were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and magnetic tweezers experiments. We found a strong and highly significant softening of keratin-deficient keratinocytes when analyzed by AFM on the cell body and above the nucleus. Magnetic tweezers experiments fully confirmed these results showing, in addition, high viscous contributions to magnetic bead displacement in keratin-lacking cells. Keratin loss neither affected actin or microtubule networks nor their overall protein concentration. Furthermore, depolymerization of actin preserves cell softening in the absence of keratin. On reexpression of the sole basal epidermal keratin pair K5/14, the keratin filament network was reestablished, and mechanical properties were restored almost to WT levels in both experimental setups. The data presented here demonstrate the importance of keratin filaments for mechanical resilience of keratinocytes and indicate that expression of a single keratin pair is sufficient for almost complete reconstitution of their mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactin 3aatomic force microscopy 3adepolymerization 3agenes 3akeratin 3akeratinocytes 3amechanical properties 3amicrotubules 3apreserves1 aFabris, Gloria1 aWindoffer, Reinhard1 aSchwarz, Nicole1 aSpringer, Ronald1 aZhou, Chen1 aLazar, Jaroslav1 aStiefel, Simone1 aHersch, Nils1 aSchnakenberg, Uwe1 aMagin, Thomas M.1 aLeube, Rudolf E.1 aMerkel, Rudolf1 aHoffmann, Bernd0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Nov. 12, v. 110, no. 46 p.18513-18518dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13134911103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245012500199300001800324500002000342506007600362520147600438592002801914506003701942650002501979650002502004650001702029650003202046650002002078650001902098650001202117650001002129650001802139650001102157650001302168650002602181650001202207650001802219650002002237650001402257650001002271700001602281700001702297700002902314773010902343856007302452852000902525655001202534IND60585681020221207132551.0171112e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058568102DNAL7 a10.1111/mpp.125642doi7 aPMC56976682pmcid7 a284665092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Neil A.12aA spatial temporal analysis of the Fusarium graminearum transcriptome during symptomless and symptomatic wheat infection  ap. 1295-1312.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFusarium head blight of wheat is one of the most serious and hazardous crop diseases worldwide. Here, a transcriptomic investigation of Fusarium graminearum reveals a new model for symptomless and symptomatic wheat infection. The predicted metabolic state and secretome of F. graminearum were distinct within symptomless and symptomatic wheat tissues. Transcripts for genes involved in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol, plus other characterized and putative secondary metabolite clusters increased in abundance in symptomless tissue. Transcripts encoding for genes of distinct groups of putative secreted effectors increased within either symptomless or symptomatic tissue. Numerous pathogenicity‐associated gene transcripts and transcripts representing PHI‐base mutations that impacted on virulence increased in symptomless tissue. In contrast, hydrolytic carbohydrate‐active enzyme (CAZyme) and lipase gene transcripts exhibited a different pattern of expression, resulting in elevated transcript abundance during the development of disease symptoms. Genome‐wide comparisons with existing datasets confirmed that, within the wheat floral tissue, at a single time point, different phases of infection co‐exist, which are spatially separated and reminiscent of both early and late infection. This study provides novel insights into the combined spatial temporal coordination of functionally characterized and hypothesized virulence strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3abiosynthesis 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adata collection 3adeoxynivalenol 3aflowers 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3amutation 3asecondary metabolites 3atissues 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3avirulence 3awheat1 aEvans, Jess1 aMead, Andrew1 aHammond‐Kosack, Kim E.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2017 Dec., v. 18, no. 9 p.1295-1312dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.125643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010900161506010400270506007600374520136800450592002801818506003701846650002001883650001901903650001101922650001701933653003401950653001801984653002402002653002702026653002602053700001402079700001302093700001302106700001502119700001502134700001802149773015002167856008202317852000902399655001202408IND60777432320221207135047.0220706e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077743232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tang10aMulti-scale attention integrated hierarchical networks for high-resolution building footprint extraction  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConvolutional neural networks show excellent performance in image segmentation. However, compared with natural images, remote sensing images are characterized by large coverage, multi-scale nesting, and complex geographic context. Therefore, it has been a challenging task to extract the building footprint from high-resolution remote sensing images. In this study, an end-to-end Multi-Scale Geoscience Network (MS-GeoNet) is proposed for building footprint extraction. The proposed architecture focuses on multi-scale nested characteristics and the spatial correlation between buildings and surroundings. The performance of a number of embedding modules and loss functions in extracting various types of buildings are explored in detail. Our proposed method outperforms the baseline model Fully Convolutional DenseNets (FC- DenseNet) by 7.10% for the intersection over union (IoU) and by 3.09% for F1-score. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of large area interpretation, an overlap splicing and voting mechanism is proposed. It is also an effective means to solve the edge processing task. The proposed method demonstrates approximately 1.19% IoU improvement and 0.83% F1-score improvement on our dataset, compared with the traditional splicing method. MS-GeoNet is a promising approach for automatic generation of building footprint in practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aspatial data 0aBuilding footprint extraction 0aDeep learning 0aAttention mechanism 0aRemote sensing imagery 0aSemantic segmentation1 aYao, Ling1 aQin, Jun1 aLu, Ning1 aJiang, Hou1 aZhang, Fan1 aZhou, Chenghu0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 May, v. 109 p.102768-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245011000193300001800303500001500321520152400336592002801860650002701888650001701915650001201932650001601944650001001960650002101970650001201991650001102003650003402014650003602048650005302084650002702137650002402164650001202188650002302200650001702223653001302240700002002253700002202273700002102295700002502316700002202341700002202363700002502385700003102410700002402441773009902465856004802564852000902612655001202621IND50063418220221116160536.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006341822DNAL7 a233151892pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-012-3258-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZambriski, Jennifer A.10aDescription of fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in experimentally challenged dairy calves  ap. 1247-1254.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective was to describe the probability of Cryptosporidium parvum fecal oocyst shedding at different magnitudes of exposure, the pattern of fecal shedding over time, and factors affecting fecal shedding in dairy calves. Within the first 24 h of life, 36 calves were experimentally challenged with C. parvum oocysts at one of four possible magnitudes of oral exposure (1 × 10³, 1 × 10⁴, 1 × 10⁵, and 1 × 10⁶ oocysts), and 7 control calves were sham dosed. Fecal shedding occurred in 33 (91.7 %) experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves. There was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups; calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure (1 × 10³ oocysts) shed less than the other three groups. At higher magnitudes of exposure, there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding. There was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf, i.e., the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding, the fewer oocysts that were shed. The pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear; the number of oocysts increased with time, reached a peak, and declined. Therefore, the dynamics of oocyst shedding can be influenced in part by limiting exposure among calves and delaying the onset of fecal oocyst shedding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3adairy calves 3aoocysts 3aprobability 3afeces 3adietary exposure 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxparasitology 2aCryptosporidiosisxparasitology 2aCryptosporidium parvumxisolation & purification 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFecesxparasitology 2aOocysts 2aParasite Egg Count 2aTime Factors 0ashedding1 aNydam, Daryl V.1 aBowman, Dwight D.1 aBellosa, Mary L.1 aBurton, Alexandra J.1 aLinden, Thomas C.1 aLiotta, Janice L.1 aOllivett, Theresa L.1 aTondello-Martins, Leonardo1 aMohammed, Hussni O.0 tParasitology research.g2013 Mar., v. 112, no. 3 p.1247-1254dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-3258-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013200156520166600288592002801954650002001982650002102002650001402023650001002037650001202047650001802059650003502077650002502112650001602137650001002153651001002163700001902173700001702192700001602209773012102225856007402346852000902420655001202429IND60760668020221120121413.0211223e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076066802DNAL7 a10.3390/f121217782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Wancai 10aModelling the Tree Height, Crown Base Height, and Effective Crown Height of Pinus koraiensis Plantations Based on Knot Analysis  aTaking 1735 Pinus koraiensis knots in Mengjiagang Forest Farm plantations in Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province as the research object, a dynamic tree height, effective crown height, and crown base height growth model was developed using 349 screened knots. The Richards equation was selected as the basic model to develop a crown base height and effective crown height nonlinear mixed-effects model considering random tree-level effects. Model parameters were estimated with the non-liner mixed effect model (NLMIXED) Statistical Analysis System (SAS) module. The akaike information criterion (AIC), bayesian information criterion (BIC), −2 Log likelihood (−2LL), adjusted coefficient (Rₐ²), root mean square error (RMSE), and residual squared sum (RSS) values were used for the optimal model selection and performance evaluation. When tested with independent sample data, the mixed-effects model tree effects-considering outperformed the traditional model regarding their goodness of fit and validation; the two-parameter mixed-effects model outperformed the one-parameter model. Pinus koraiensis pruning times and intensities were calculated using the developed model. The difference between the effective crown and crown base heights was 1.01 m at the 15th year; thus, artificial pruning could occur. Initial pruning was performed with a 1.01 m intensity in the 15th year. Five pruning were required throughout the young forest period; the average pruning intensity was 1.46 m. The pruning interval did not differ extensively in the half-mature forest period, while the intensity decreased significantly. The final pruning intensity was only 0.34 m.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPinus koraiensis 3aequations 3afarms 3aforests 3agrowth models 3anonlinear mixed effects models 3astatistical analysis 3atree height 3atrees 3aChina1 aLiu, Zhaogang 1 aJia, Weiwei 1 aLi, Dandan 0 tForests.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121217783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015100153300001800304520096800322592002801290650001301318650001201331650002101343650001501364650001601379650001701395650000901412650002201421650001201443650001401455700001501469700001601484700001801500700001901518700001801537773012901555856007401684852000901758655001201767IND60660299620221121171043.0190823e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066029962DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay01235d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Miao10aAlizarin Red–Tb³⁺ complex as a ratiometric colorimetric and fluorescent dual probe for the smartphone-based detection of an anthrax biomarker  ap. 4267-4273.  aIn this work, a novel dual-sensing probe was developed for detecting an anthrax biomarker (dipicolinic acid, DPA) based on the competitive coordination of Tb³⁺ between DPA and Alizarin Red (AR). UV-vis titration experiments demonstrated that AR and Tb³⁺ ions formed a 3 : 1 coordination pair in a boric acid–borate buffer solution. However, the subsequent addition of DPA to the complex solution destroyed the coordination of AR–Tb³⁺ completely, resulting in the formation of DPA–Tb³⁺. This constructed a new mechanism of ratiometric colorimetric and fluorescence dual-mode sensing for DPA. By integrating a smartphone with an easy-to-access color-scanning APP, this dual-sensing method could be further applied as a reliable scanometric assay for the rapid and on-site visible detection of DPA directly. With the method established by us, the sensitive and selective detection of DPA released from bacterial spores could be realized easily.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3aanthrax 3abacterial spores 3abiomarkers 3acolorimetry 3afluorescence 3aions 3amobile telephones 3aterbium 3atitration1 aHuang, Wei1 aLu, Dingkun1 aHuang, Chunyu1 aDeng, Jingjing1 aZhou, Tianshu0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Aug. 22, v. 11, no. 33 p.4267-4273dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay01235d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010100164300001600265520144600281592002801727650002401755650001301779650002201792650002301814650000901837650002901846650001201875650001001887650001201897650001201909650001301921650001401934650001201948650003301960653002301993653002902016653001302045653001502058653003302073700001802106700001502124700001502139773010202154856005102256852000902307655001202316IND50087136320221119201221.0140412e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008713632DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2012.6838202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasas, N.10aLaccase production by Trametes versicolor under limited-growth conditions using dyes as inducers  ap. 113-119.  aLaccase production by pre-growth pellets of Trametes versicolor using two types of textile dyes as inducers was studied. By decoupling the enzyme production phase from the growth phase, it is possible to reduce the time and nutrients required for laccase production. At the glucose maintenance level, the effect of the nitrogen source and textile dye was analysed using response surface methodology. Ammonium chloride was used as the inorganic nitrogen source. Two types of dyes were tested: Grey Lanaset G (GLG), a metal complex dye mixture containing nitrogen; and Alizarin Red (AR), an anthraquinonic dye with no nitrogen in its chemical structure. GLG induces laccase production at a higher extent than AR. Despite the limiting conditions required for the production of laccase, enzyme production increases with increasing ammonium chloride. When AR, the N-free dye, was used as an inducer, the optimal supply of N for laccase production was 1.2 mg/(g dry cell weight·d) as ammonium chloride. The reuse of fungal pellets in the repeated-batch mode under maintenance conditions was found to be a good strategy for improving laccase production, as enzyme production increased to up to seven times the production of the first cycle. It was demonstrated that GLG can be used as an inducer and as an N source and, thus, it is possible to decolorize the dye and to induce laccase production at the same time without adding an extra N source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aalizarin 3aammonium chloride 3achemical structure 3adyes 3aenvironmental technology 3afabrics 3afungi 3aglucose 3alaccase 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3apellets 3aresponse surface methodology 0apre-growth pellets 0asequential batch reactor 0ainducers 0abioreactor 0aresponse surface methodology1 aBlánquez, P.1 aVicent, T.1 aSarrà, M.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2013 Jan. 1, v. 34, no. 1 p.113-119dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2012.683820  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010400171300001600275520199400291592002802285650001302313650001802326650001202344650002502356650001602381650001302397650001502410650001802425650001902443650001602462650001302478650002502491650001102516650001602527650001002543650002202553650001502575650001802590650001802608650001002626650001302636651001802649700001802667700002502685773009302710856004802803852000902851655001202860IND50063589420221118223025.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006358942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-012-9731-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeballos, Darío S.10aSoil volume and carbon storage shifts in drained and afforested wetlands of the Paraná River Delta  ap. 359-372.  aWetland ecosystems have a high carbon storage potential as a result of high primary productivity and low decomposition rates dictated by water saturation. In the herbaceous wetlands of the Paraná River Delta, drainage and afforestation with poplars represents one of the dominant land uses. We explored the effects of these interventions on the volume and carbon storage of the young sedimentary soils of the region. At three sites we identified paired stands occupying similar landscape positions and soil types but subject to natural flooding and covered by natural herbaceous communities or drainage and flood control by dikes and covered by poplar plantations established 12, 17 and 19 years ago. Soil sampling at these sites revealed a reduction of the litter compartment (−86 %) and decreasing volume and porosity of its underlying mineral layer (0–10 cm in the wetland reduced to 0–4 cm in the plantation). Our comparisons of carbon storage accounted for these volumetric shifts by using accumulated mineral mass rather than depth as a reference, showing that tree plantations gained in the mineral soil (22 Mg C ha⁻¹) almost as much as what they lost in the litter. These gains were particularly large at intermediate depths (4–43 cm in the plantations) were soil porosity remained unaffected and C was raised by 64 % explained by (1) the pulse of inputs from overlaying litter and organic layers subject to rapid decomposition and mobilization after drainage and (2) root colonization, since tree plantations had 75 % of their fine root biomass at these intermediate soil depths, whereas roots in the wetlands did not explore the mineral soil profile and were completely confined to the organic layer. A neutral C balance following wetland drainage and afforestation resulted from the opposing effects of aeration, favoring decomposition in the organic layer, root colonization and organic matter stabilization, favoring its accumulation in the mineral soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aafforestation 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3adegradation 3adrainage 3aecosystems 3amineral soils 3aorganic matter 3aplantations 3aporosity 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asedimentary soils 3asoil depth 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3atrees 3awetlands 3aSouth America1 aFrangi, Jorge1 aJobbágy, Esteban G.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2013 Mar., v. 112, no. 1-3 p.359-372dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-012-9731-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100003100186245006800217300002000285506007600305520132200381592002801703506003701731650001001768650002101778650001001799650001101809650001101820650001501831653002101846653001701867653000901884700002501893700001701918700002201935700001801957700002501975700002002000700002302020700001502043700001902058700001702077700001802094700002002112700002002132700001802152700002602170700002002196700002102216700001802237700002202255700001802277700002002295700003302315773017602348856007902524852000902603655001202612IND60178439420221207123927.0150604e20131112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017843942DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13144781102doi7 aPMC38319942pmcid7 a241454232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapassotiropoulos, Andreas10aHuman genome–guided identification of memory-modulating drugs  ap.

It is not clear, however, to what extent this knowledge can be used as a starting point for drug identification, one of the central hopes of the human genome project. The aim of the present study was to identify memory-modulating compounds through the use of human genetic information. We performed a multinational collaborative study, which included assessment of aversive memory—a trait central to posttraumatic stress disorder—and a gene-set analysis in healthy individuals. We identified 20 potential drug target genes in two genomewide-corrected gene sets: the neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction and the long-term depression gene set. In a subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, we aimed at providing a proof of concept for the genome-guided identification of memory modulating compounds. Pharmacological intervention at the neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction gene set led to significant reduction of aversive memory. The findings demonstrate that genome information, along with appropriate data mining methodology, can be used as a starting point for the identification of memory-modulating compounds.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrugs 3agene interaction 3agenes 3ahumans 3amemory 3avolunteers 0aemotional memory 0apharmacology 0aPTSD1 aGerhards, Christiane1 aHeck, Angela1 aAckermann, Sandra1 aAerni, Amanda1 aSchicktanz, Nathalie1 aAuschra, Bianca1 aDemougin, Philippe1 aMumme, Eva1 aElbert, Thomas1 aErtl, Verena1 aGschwind, Leo1 aHanser, Edveena1 aHuynh, Kim-Dung1 aJessen, Frank1 aKolassa, Iris-Tatjana1 aMilnik, Annette1 aPaganetti, Paolo1 aSpalek, Klara1 aVogler, Christian1 aMuhs, Andreas1 aPfeifer, Andrea1 ade Quervain, Dominique J.-F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Nov. 12, v. 110, no. 46 p.E4369-E4374dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13144781103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245018000154300001800334520156200352592002801914650002701942650001101969650003401980650001502014650001502029650001102044650001402055650004402069650001502113650001402128650001302142650002002155700001802175700001502193700001202208700001602220773012902236856007402365852000902439655001202448IND60660299920221121233906.0190823e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066029992DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay01266d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qian10aPreparative separation of flavonoid glycosides and flavonoid aglycones from the leaves of Platycladus orientalis by REV-IN and FWD-IN high-speed counter-current chromatography  ap. 4260-4266.  aThree flavonoid glycosides and four flavonoid aglycones were isolated and purified for the first time from the leaves of Platycladus orientalis via two different elution modes of high-speed counter-current chromatography. First, the fractions containing the flavonoid glycosides and flavonoid aglycones were obtained via polyamide column chromatography to remove the nonflavonoids; afterwards, a reverse-inlet (REV-IN) elution mode was applied to purify the flavonoid glycosides using a two-phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate–ethanol–acetic acid–water (4 : 1 : 0.25 : 5, v/v); then, a forward-inlet (FWD-IN) elution mode was applied to purify the flavonoid aglycones with a two-phase solvent system composed of chloroform–methanol–water (4 : 3 : 2, v/v). In total, three flavonoid glycosides, myricetrin (1, 10.2 mg), quercetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside (2, 25.8 mg), and kaempferol-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside (3, 9.3 mg), and four flavonoid aglycones, quercetin (4, 10.5 mg), kaempferol (5, 4.5 mg), amentoflavone (6, 13.8 mg) and myricetin (7, 14.7 mg), were successfully obtained from the enriched fractions of flavonoid glycoside and flavonoid aglycone by the REV-IN mode HSCCC and FWD-IN mode HSCCC, respectively, structures of which were elucidated by HR-ESI-MS and ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the combination of polyamide column chromatography and HSCCC is effective for the rapid enrichment and separation of flavonoid glycosides and flavonoid aglycones from the leaves of P. orientalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatycladus orientalis 3acarbon 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aglycosides 3akaempferol 3aleaves 3amyricetin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyamides 3aquercetin 3asolvents 3astable isotopes1 aGeng, Yanling1 aWang, Xiao1 aLi, Jia1 aYu, Jinqian0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Aug. 22, v. 11, no. 33 p.4260-4266dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay01266d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01361naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012400154300002000278520032300298592002800621650002300649650002400672650001900696650001700715700001800732700001500750700001700765700001600782700001700798773013600815856007500951852000901026655001201035IND60659099820221120092217.0190827e20111018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065909982DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14709a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Liang10aHierarchically structured nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite assembled hollow fibers as a promising protein delivery system  ap. 11674-11676.  aNanocrystalline hydroxyapatite assembled hollow fibers (NHAHF) in the membrane form were fabricated by combining the electrospinning technique and the hydrothermal method.

Herein, we report a novel biphasic tandem catalytic process (biTCP) for synthesizing cycloalkanes from renewable terpenoid biomass, such as 1,8-cineole. Multistep tandem reactions, including C–O ring opening by hydrolysis, dehydration, and hydrogenation, were carried out in the “one-pot” biTCP. 1,8-Cineole was efficiently converted to p-menthane at high yields (>99%) in the biTCP under mild reaction conditions.

We have identified previously a natural variant, X. citri Aᵀ, that triggers a host‐specific defence response in Citrus limon. However, the mechanisms involved in this canker disease resistance are unknown. In this work, the defence response induced by X. citri Aᵀ was assessed by transcriptomic, physiological and ultrastructural analyses, and the effects on bacterial biofilm formation were monitored in parallel. We show that X. citri Aᵀ triggers a hypersensitive response associated with the interference of biofilm development and arrest of bacterial growth in C. limon. This plant response involves an extensive transcriptional reprogramming, setting in motion cell wall reinforcement, the oxidative burst and the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA) and phenolic compounds. Ultrastructural analyses revealed subcellular changes involving the activation of autophagy‐associated vacuolar processes. Our findings show the activation of SA‐dependent defence in response to X. citri Aᵀ and suggest a coordinated regulation between the SA and flavonoid pathways, which is associated with autophagy mechanisms that control pathogen invasion in C. limon. Furthermore, this defence response protects C. limon plants from disease on subsequent challenges by pathogenic X. citri. This knowledge will allow the rational exploitation of the plant immune system as a biotechnological approach for the management of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus limon 3aautophagy 3abiofilm 3acell walls 3adisease resistance 3aflavonoids 3ahost specificity 3ahypersensitive response 3aimmune system 3amicrobial growth 3apathogens 3aplant response 3asalicylic acid 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3avacuoles1 aFavaro, María A.1 aChiesa, María A.1 aAlemano, Sergio1 aVojnov, Adrián A.1 aCastagnaro, Atilio P.1 aFilippone, María P.1 aGmitter, Frederick G., jrcjr1 aGadea, José1 aMarano, María R.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2017 Dec., v. 18, no. 9 p.1267-1281dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.124893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245011200164300001600276520100500292592002801297650001801325650001601343650001901359650000701378650001201385650001301397650001401410700001801424700002001442773009801462856008501560852000901645655001201654IND4450496720221116160458.0141111e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445049672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudgal, P.10aEffects of protein concentration and CaCl₂ on cold-set thickening mechanism of β-lactoglobulin at low pH  ap. 319-326.  aEffects of protein concentration and CaCl₂ on the cold-thickening mechanism of a pH-modified β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) ingredient were studied. Flexible fibrillar networks were formed at pH 3.35, and more branching was observed with an increase in CaCl₂ equating to an increase of ionic strength (I) of 60 mm. This increase in ionic strength of β-lg solutions led to an increased conversion of monomers to aggregates (>10⁶ Da), especially at concentrations above 6.9% (w/w), the critical concentration (Cc) for this modified protein system. A more connected flexible fibrillar network was observed following freeze-drying, with increased viscosities of rehydrated modified powders as compared with modified solutions prior to drying. A small increase in I (∼10 mM) at concentrations greater than Cc resulted in improved thickening with similar network characteristics and thus provided an option for manipulation of protein and CaCl₂ concentration to obtain improved thickening behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreeze drying 3aingredients 3aionic strength 3apH 3apowders 3aproteins 3aviscosity1 aDaubert, C.R.1 aFoegeding, E.A.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2011 May, v. 21, no. 5 p.319-326dElsevier Ltdx0958-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2010.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01856naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007900157300001600236520077500252592002801027650001301055650001501068650001101083650000901094650001901103650001901122650000901141650001901150650000901169650002001178700001601198700001901214700001701233700001801250773011901268856007401387852000901461655001201470IND60626956120221120025923.0190128e20190107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062695612DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra08527g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sanghee10aGrowth of hierarchical gold clusters for use in superomniphobic electrodes  ap. 761-765.  aWe developed a method to fabricate a superomniphobic gold electrode by synthesizing hierarchical gold clusters on a gold substrate and treating the surface with low surface energy materials. The reduction of gold ions was repeated several times, causing the gold microparticles to grow in random directions and form hierarchical gold clusters. Treatment of the gold structures with perfluorothiol resulted in a superhydrophobic surface that also exhibited superoleophobicity for oils and liquids with surface tensions as low as 25.6 mN. The resulting electrode was not contaminated by hydrophilic and hydrophobic liquids, and by analyzing the current–voltage characteristics of the electrode with a PEDOT:PSS solution droplet, the electrode was found to be waterproof.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3agold 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3amicroparticles 3aoils 3asurface tension1 aKim, Wuseok1 aYim, Changyong1 aYong, Kijung1 aJeon, Sangmin0 tRSC advances.g2019 Jan. 07, v. 9, no. 2 p.761-765dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08527g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01701naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008300171300001800254520074300272592002801015650001901043650001101062650001801073650001701091650001501108650001901123700002301142700001401165700002201179773008101201856008401282852000901366655001201375IND60092217420221119131906.0141103e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009221742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Shunsuke10aPreparation of ordered mesoporous carbon membranes by a soft-templating method  ap. 3184-3189.  aPreparation of continuous mesoporous carbon membranes without the use of an intermediate inorganic template was achieved using a thermosetting phenolic resin, resorcinol/phloroglucinol/formaldehyde, and a thermally-decomposable organic template, Pluronic F127 (PEO₁₀₆–PPO₇₀–PEO₁₀₆).

This raises the concern for two-way COVID-19 transmission between humans and animals. Here, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for serodiagnosis of COVID-19 which can theoretically be used in virtually all kinds of animals. We used 187 serum samples from patients with/without COVID-19, laboratory animals immunized with inactive SARS-CoV-2 virions, COVID-19-negative animals, and animals seropositive to other betacoronaviruses. A cut-off percent inhibition value of 22.345% was determined and the analytical sensitivity and specificity were found to be 1:64–1:256 and 93.9%, respectively. Evaluation on its diagnostic performance using 155 serum samples from COVID-19-negative animals and COVID-19 human patients showed a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 80.8% and 100%, respectively. The cELISA can be incorporated into routine blood testing of farmed/captive animals for COVID-19 surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic sensitivity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3anucleocapsid 3aserodiagnosis 3aseroprevalence1 aHe, Zirong 1 aTsang, Chi-Ching 1 aChan, Tony  T.

The importance of ubiquitination in the regulation of many aspects of plant immunity has been increasingly appreciated in recent years. Most of the studies linking ubiquitination to the plant immune system, however, have been focused on the E3 ubiquitin ligases and the conventional ubiquitination that leads to the degradation of the substrate proteins by the 26S proteasome. By contrast, our knowledge about the role of unconventional ubiquitination that often serves as non‐degradative, regulatory signal remains a significant gap. We discuss, in this review, the recent advances in our understanding of ubiquitination in the modulation of plant immunity, with a particular focus on the E3 ubiquitin ligases. We approach the topic from a perspective of two broadly defined types of ubiquitination in an attempt to highlight the importance, yet current scarcity, in our knowledge about the regulation of plant immunity by unconventional ubiquitination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteins 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination1 aZeng, Lirong0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2017 Dec., v. 18, no. 9 p.1313-1330dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mpp.125213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245015600167300001800323520178400341592002802125650003702153650001102190650001402201650001302215650002002228650002802248650002602276650002102302650001902323650002502342650001802367650001302385650001302398650001102411650001702422650001402439650001902453650001902472650001102491650002402502650001402526650002102540650001602561700002402577700002302601700003002624700001902654700002202673700002802695773012102723856007402844852000902918655001202927IND60626956220221120025859.0190128e20190117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062695622DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra08541b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz-Rodriguez, Sergio10aSurface modification and direct plasma amination of L605 CoCr alloys: on the optimization of the oxide layer for application in cardiovascular implants  ap. 2292-2301.  aStents are cardiovascular devices used to treat atherosclerosis, and are deployed into narrowed arteries and implanted by expansion to reopen the biological lumen. Nevertheless, complications after implantation are still observed in 10–14% of the implantations. Therefore, functionalizing these devices with active molecules to improve the interfacial effects with the surrounding tissue strongly impacts their success. A plasma-based procedure to directly graft biomolecules to the surface of cobalt chromium alloys, without any polymeric coating, has been recently reported. Assuring the stability of the coating during plastic deformation generated during the implantation whilst avoiding the corrosion of the surface is crucial. This study explores different surface treatments to be used as a pre-treatment for this novel procedure. The effects of (i) electropolishing, (ii) thermal treatments, and (iii) the plasma immersion ion implantation of oxygen on the chemical composition, roughness, wettability and efficiency during the plasma-amination procedure whilst avoiding cracks after deformation, thus maintaining corrosion resistant behaviour, were investigated by XPS, AFM, ToF-SIMS imaging and depth profile, and WCA. Furthermore, the hemocompatibility of the surface and cell viability assays were also performed. Results showed that all of the treatments created a different surface chemical composition: EP mainly of chromium oxide, PIII with a layer of cobalt oxide and TT with a mixture of oxides, as observed by XPS and ToF-SIMS. Moreover, EP was the process that generated a surface with the highest efficiency to amination and the most corrosion resistance among the treatments, and it appeared as the most suitable pre-treatment for stent functionalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3aamination 3aarteries 3aatherosclerosis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiochemical compounds 3abiocompatibility 3acell viability 3achemical composition 3achromic oxide 3achromium 3acoatings 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acorrosion 3aheat treatment 3aimage analysis 3aoxygen 3aplastic deformation 3aroughness 3aviability assays 3awettability1 aChevallier, Pascale1 aPaternoster, Carlo1 aMontaño-Machado, Vanessa1 aNoël, Céline1 aHoussiau, Laurent1 aMantovani, D.q(Diego),0 tRSC advances.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 9, no. 4 p.2292-2301dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08541b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245012800184300001600312500001500328520092600343592002801269650001101297650001101308650001801319650001601337650000901353650001601362650001601378650001501394650001801409650001001427650001401437650001701451650002401468650001101492650002201503650003001525650003201555650003601587650001801623650002301641650002501664650002901689650002201718650001301740650001601753650002401769650002901793650002101822653001201843700001401855773008801869856008601957852000902043655001202052IND4466897920221116160515.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446689792DNAL7 a221970772pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.11.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPronyk, C.10aFractionation of triticale, wheat, barley, oats, canola, and mustard straws for the production of carbohydrates and lignins  ap. 117-124.  a2019-12-06  aFive cereal (triticale, durum wheat, CPS wheat, feed barley, oats) and two oilseed (canola, mustard) straws were fractionated with pressurized low polarity water in a flow-through reactor at 165°C with a flow rate of 115mL/min and a solvent-to-solid ratio of 60mL/g. The conversion and extraction of the major carbohydrates and lignin from the reactor system during hydrothermal treatment was largely completed within the first 20–30min. Glucan content of all straws were enriched by the process. More than 90% of the xylan and nearly 50% of the lignin were extracted and there was no effect on yield due to crop species. However, there were differences in solid residue and liquid extract composition. Cereal crops yielded a residue richer in glucan and lower in lignin. Oilseed crop residues contained very low levels of ash. Xylo-oligosaccharides from oilseed crops contain more acetyl and uronic acid substituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola 3abarley 3afractionation 3agrain crops 3aoats 3adurum wheat 3afeed barley 3acrop yield 3aoilseed crops 3astraw 3atriticale 3auronic acids 3ahot water treatment 3alignin 2aAvenaxchemistry. 2aBrassica napusxchemistry 2aCarbohydratesxbiosynthesis 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aFreeze Drying 2aHordeumxchemistry 2aLigninxbiosynthesis 2aMustard Plantxchemistry 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aPressure 2aTemperature 2aTriticumxchemistry 2aWaste Productsxanalysis 2aWaterxchemistry 0amustard1 aMazza, G.0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Feb., v. 106 p.117-124dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.11.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04736naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245015700189300001800346520235400364592002802718650001802746650004402764650002102808650000902829650003002838650001602868650002202884650002502906650001902931650001102950650001802961650001402979650001802993650002003011650003303031650001103064650001203075650005803087650002903145650003103174650003503205650001803240650003203258650002803290650003103318650002903349650004903378650003303427650003503460650004503495650002203540650002203562700002503584700003603609700002803645700003003673700002003703700002703723700001903750700002303769700002703792700002703819773009903846856004803945852000903993655001204002IND50059681020221121210552.0130220e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005968102DNAL7 a219938812pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2667-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarimuthu, Sampath10aLousicidal activity of synthesized silver nanoparticles using Lawsonia inermis leaf aqueous extract against Pediculus humanus capitis and Bovicola ovis   ap. 2023-2033.  aIn the present work, we describe inexpensive, nontoxic, unreported and simple procedure for synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using leaf aqueous extract of Lawsonia inermis as eco-friendly reducing and capping agent. The aim of the present study was to assess the lousicidal activity of synthesized Ag NPs against human head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer (Phthiraptera: Pediculidae), and sheep body louse, Bovicola ovis Schrank (Phthiraptera: Trichodectidae). Direct contact method was conducted to determine the potential of pediculocidal activity and impregnated method was used with slight modifications to improve practicality and efficiency of tested materials of synthesized Ag NPs against B. ovis. The synthesized Ag NPs characterized with the UV showing peak at 426 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra clearly shows that the diffraction peaks in the pattern indexed as the silver with lattice constants. XRD analysis showed intense peaks at 2θ values of 38.34°, 44.59°, 65.04°, and 77.77° corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) Bragg’s reflection based on the fcc structure of Ag NPs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of Ag NPs exhibited prominent peaks at 3,422.13, 2,924.12, 2,851.76, 1,631.41, 1,381.60, 1,087.11, and 789.55 cm⁻¹. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph showed mean size of 59.52 nm and aggregates of spherical shape Ag NPs. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed the complete chemical composition of the synthesized Ag NPs. In pediculocidal activity, the results showed that the optimal times for measuring percent mortality effects of synthesized Ag NPs were 26, 61, 84, and 100 at 5, 10, 15, and 20 min, respectively. The average percent mortality for synthesized Ag NPs was 33, 84, 91, and 100 at 10, 15, 20, and 35 min, respectively against B. ovis. The maximum activity was observed in the aqueous leaf extract of L. inermis, 1 mM AgNO₃ solution, and synthesized Ag NPs against P. humanus capitis with LC₅₀ values of 18.26, 7.77, and 1.33 mg l⁻¹ and r ² values of 0.863, 0.900, and 0.803 and against B. ovis showed with LC₅₀ values of 21.19, 8.49, and 1.41 mg l⁻¹ and r ² values of 0.920, 0.938 and 0.870, respectively. The findings revealed that synthesized Ag NPs possess excellent anti-lousicidal activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovicola ovis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLawsonia inermis 3aOvis 3aPediculus humanus capitis 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical composition 3adirect contact 3aenergy 3aleaf extracts 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 2aAnimals 2aInsecticidesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aIschnoceraxdrug effects 2aLawsonia Plantxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNanoparticles 2aParasitic Sensitivity Tests 2aPediculusxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aSilverxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSpectrometry, X-Ray Emission 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aSurvival Analysis 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aRahuman, Abdul Abdul1 aSanthoshkumar, Thirunavukkarasu1 aJayaseelan, Chidambaram1 aKirthi, Arivarasan Vishnu1 aBagavan, Asokan1 aKamaraj, Chinnaperumal1 aElango, Gandhi1 aZahir, Abdul Abduz1 aRajakumar, Govindasamy1 aVelayutham, Kanayairam0 tParasitology research.g2012 Nov., v. 111, no. 5 p.2023-2033dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2667-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245008700158520133200245592002801577650001301605650001801618650002101636650002001657650001101677650001601688650001501704650001001719650001101729650001601740650001601756650001001772650002901782650001501811650001401826700002101840700002401861773011901885856007302004852000902077655001202086IND60742570420221120142906.0210624e20210522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074257042DNAL7 a10.3390/f120606592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cuizhen 10asUAS for 3D Tree Surveying: Comparative Experiments on a Closed-Canopy Earthen Dam  aDefined as “personal remote sensing”, small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) have been increasingly utilized for landscape mapping. This study tests a sUAS procedure of 3D tree surveying of a closed-canopy woodland on an earthen dam. Three DJI drones—Mavic Pro, Phantom 4 Pro, and M100/RedEdge-M assembly—were used to collect imagery in six missions in 2019–2020. A canopy height model was built from the sUAS-extracted point cloud and LiDAR bare earth surface. Treetops were delineated in a variable-sized local maxima filter, and tree crowns were outlined via inverted watershed segmentation. The outputs include a tree inventory that contains 238 to 284 trees (location, tree height, crown polygon), varying among missions. The comparative analysis revealed that the M100/RedEdge-M at a higher flight altitude achieved the best performance in tree height measurement (RMSE = 1 m). However, despite lower accuracy, the Phantom 4 Pro is recommended as an optimal drone for operational tree surveying because of its low cost and easy deployment. This study reveals that sUAS have good potential for operational deployment to assess tree overgrowth toward dam remediation solutions. With 3D imaging, sUAS remote sensing can be counted as a reliable, consumer-oriented tool for monitoring our ever-changing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acanopy height 3adams (hydrology) 3adata collection 3aflight 3ainventories 3alandscapes 3alidar 3amodels 3aremediation 3atree height 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awatersheds 3awoodlands1 aMorgan, Grayson 1 aHodgson, Michael E.0 tForests.g2021 May 22, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120606593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245011400179300001600293500000900309520152300318592002801841650002201869650001301891650003701904650001401941650001801955650001101973650001401984650001201998651002102010773020702031856009402238852000902332655001202341IND60666503720221118071805.0191028e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066650372DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000010036x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Michael T.10aRailway Right-of-Way Contaminants in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons  ap. 228-234.  aepub  aBallast from five railway rights-of-way and the adjacent ditches flowing to salmon streams in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada, were sampled in 1989 to determine the occurrence and levels of 16 selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Reference and background levels of PAH in ditches leading to fish streams were obtained from pristine parklands and agricultural lands. PAH levels in sediments reported by Goyette and Boyd (1989) for Burrard Inlet (Inner Harbour), the commercial harbour of Vancouver, British Columbia, were used for comparison. All 16 PAH were found in the ballasts and ditch sediments/water of the five railway rights-of-way. In the ballasts, total levels of the 16 PAH varied from 1.562-58.773 g/m², averaging 18.069 g/m². The mean concentration of the total 16 PAH in ditch sediments was 213.47 µg/g (range, 1.89-1168.71 µg/g). PAH were not consistently found in ditch water at all study sites, but at sites where they occurred, the selected 16 compounds had an average total concentration of 606.9 ug/L (range, 1-3515.9 µg/L). PAH were not detected in the ditches of pristine parklands but low concentrations were detected in some agricultural samples. The total level of the 16 PAH in sediments from railway ditches were respectively 205 and 40 times higher than levels found in the sediments of farmland ditches and Burrard Inlet. Some biological implications of PAH-contaminated sediments and water from railway ditches discharging into fish habitats are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3ahabitats 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arailroads 3arights of way 3asalmon 3asediments 3astreams 3aBritish Columbia0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1991 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.228-234dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000010036x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010500171300001600276520116600292592002801458650001901486650001001505650001301515650001201528650001701540650001501557650001101572650002101583650001501604650002001619650001001639650002501649650001001674653001901684653001501703653001501718653001801733700001901751700001801770700001901788700001901807773010901826856008601935852000902021655001202030IND60533326220221118003655.0190319e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053332622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Seong-Tae10aSeasonal growth and characteristics of fruits developed from delayed flowers of ‘Fuyu’ persimmon  ap. 108-111.  aGrowth and characteristics of the fruits developed from “delayed flowers” (DFs) of ‘Fuyu’ persimmon (Diospyros kaki) were investigated to determine their usefulness to supplement the frost-damaged normal flowers (NFs). In hand-pollinated trees without frost damage, DFs bloomed on June 6 and June 5 in 2012 and 2013, respectively, 13 and 11 days later compared with NFs. DF fruit diameters were 5.8–9.4mm less than the NF fruits on July 16 in both years, but the difference became 1.5–2.4mm on August 27. Such a difference persisted until harvest on November 12. DF fruits at harvest weighed 6.6–7.3% less compared with NF fruits, an insignificant reduction. Skin color, firmness, and soluble solids of fruits were not different between both DF and NF. In trees with insufficient NFs due to spring-frost, DF bloomed 10 days later than NF. DF decreased fruit drop under open pollination but produced more deformed fruits. DF fruits, containing more seeds, were not significantly lower in size, skin color, and soluble solids. It was concluded that DFs could yield marketable fruits with no delay in maturity although their size is slightly smaller.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiospyros kaki 3acolor 3afirmness 3aflowers 3afrost injury 3afruit drop 3afruits 3aopen pollination 3apersimmons 3aseasonal growth 3aseeds 3atotal soluble solids 3atrees 0aDiospyros kaki 0aBloom date 0aFull bloom 0aMaturing time1 aPark, Doo-Sang1 aKim, Eun-Seok1 aShin, Hyun-Yul1 aKang, Seong-Mo0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 02, v. 177 p.108-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.07.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011600184300001800300520152500318592002801843650000801871650001901879650001801898650001001916650001601926650001501942650001401957650002501971650001401996650001802010650002002028650003202048650002102080650001802101650002902119650001602148650007502164650002802239650001402267650003402281650002702315650002702342651001602369651001802385700001902403700001902422700002002441773010102461856004802562852000902610655001202619IND50066496320221122004924.0130518e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006649632DNAL7 a235156782pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-013-9904-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sooyeon10aGeojedonia litorea gen. nov., sp. nov., a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae isolated from coastal seawater  ap. 1255-1262.  aA Gram-negative, non-flagellated, non-gliding and rod-shaped, coccoid or filamentous bacterial strain, designated YCS-16ᵀ, was isolated from coastal seawater from a seaweed farm on the South Sea, South Korea, and its taxonomic position was investigated by using a polyphasic study. Strain YCS-16ᵀ was observed to grow optimally at 30 °C, at pH 7.0–7.5 and in the presence of 2 % (w/v) NaCl. Strain YCS-16ᵀ exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values to the type strains of Bizionia echini (96.1 %), Formosa spongicola (95.8 %), Bizionia algoritergicola (95.5 %) and Psychroserpens mesophilus (95.4 %). Neighbour-joining and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YCS-16ᵀ joined the cluster comprising the type strains of Psychroserpens species. Strain YCS-16ᵀ was found to contain MK-6 as the predominant menaquinone and iso-C₁₇:₀ 3-OH, iso-C₁₅:₁ G and iso-C₁₅:₀ as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids detected in strain YCS-16ᵀ were phosphatidylethanolamine and one unidentified lipid. The DNA G+C content of strain YCS-16ᵀ was determined to be 35.7 mol%. The phylogenetic analysis, chemotaxonomic data and other phenotypic properties revealed that strain YCS-16ᵀ constitutes a new genus and species within the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the name Geojedonia litorea gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Geojedonia litorea is YCS-16ᵀ (=KCTC 32260ᵀ = CCUG 63682ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPsychroserpens 3acoastal water 3afarms 3afatty acids 3amacroalgae 3anew genus 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asodium chloride 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFatty Acids 2aFlavobacteriaceaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aSouth Korea 0aKorea (South)1 aLee, Jung-Sook1 aLee, Kenu-Chul1 aYoon, Jung-Hoon0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2013 June, v. 103, no. 6 p.1255-1262dSpringer-Verlagx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-013-9904-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245012500200500001900325500002000344520146200364592002801826650001701854650002501871650002001896650001201916650001401928650001001942650001401952650001301966650001801979650001401997650001902011650001802030700005702048700002802105700005702133700005702190773014202247856007402389852000902463655001202472IND60738295720221121224611.0210524e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073829572DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.153922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaycar, Abdullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4995-227510aUsing white spread and compound chocolate as phenolic compound delivering agent: A model study with black carrot extract  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study examined the effect of black carrot extract (BCE), an important anthocyanin source, in the composition of different cocoa products (white spread and compound chocolate) with a factorial design. Water activity, moisture content, color, textural, sensory, melting, and flow behavior properties of the samples were determined. Total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of samples were determined before and after in vitro digestion. Moisture content, particle size, hardness, a*, h°, yield stress, plastic viscosity values increased in compound chocolate samples significantly (p < .05). Particle size, a*, and h° values increased in spread samples, but no significant effect on sensory properties was determined. BCE in compound chocolate caused a decrease in the sensory parameters. The bioaccessibility values for total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in both groups were determined as 125.5%–244.4% and 118.6%–255.8%, respectively. These values show BCE may be an important phenolic delivering agent without any intolerable quality character change. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Black carrot extract (BCE) powder was used as a coloring agent and anthocyanin source. This study is the first study using BCE powder in the spread (SC) and compound chocolate (CC). In vitro bioaccessibility of total phenolic compounds was increased. BCE powder has the potential to improve the visual and functional properties of SC and CC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abioavailability 3acarrots 3achocolate 3acolor 3adigestion 3ahardness 3aparticle size 3aviscosity 3awater activity 3awater content1 aKonar, Nevzat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7383-39491 aPoyrazoglu, Ender Sinan1 aGoktas, Hamza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9802-93781 aSagdic, Osman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2063-14620 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.e15392-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.153923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05384naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245012300159300001800282506010400300506007600404520321200480592002803692506003703720650001303757650001303770650002303783650001703806650001003823650001903833650001103852650001503863650002403878650001503902650001803917650001803935650001303953650002403966650001803990650001004008650002004018650001204038650002304050650002004073650002004093650001604113650001804129650001104147650002804158650003104186650002304217653000904240653001304249653001304262653002104275700002004296700001904316700001704335700001704352700002904369700001404398700001904412773015504431856007904586852000904665655001204674IND60792078620221207131208.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079207862DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2022-218382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, M.E.10aEffect of supplementation with algae β-glucans on performance, health, and blood metabolites of Holstein dairy calves  ap. 7998-8007.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStudies have shown that β-glucans extracted from the cell wall of cereals, algae, and yeasts have been associated with improved immune function. However, it is unknown whether algae β-glucan supplementation affects the performance, blood metabolites, or cell counts of immune cells in dairy calves. The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate whether supplementation of β-glucans to milk replacer in dairy calves fed 6 L/d improved growth performance and fecal status and altered the blood metabolite profile. In this trial, we enrolled Holstein calves (n = 34) at birth (body weight 36.38 ± 1.33 kg; mean ± standard deviation) to receive, from 1 d of age, either 2 g/d algae β-glucans mixed into 6 L/d of milk replacer (22.4% crude protein and 16.2% fat) or an unsupplemented milk replacer (control). The calves were blocked in pairs according to birth weight, sex, and date of birth (up to 5 d difference). Calves were housed individually, and calf starter (24.7% crude protein and 13.9% neutral detergent fiber) was offered ad libitum based on orts of the previous day until 56 d of age (end of the trial). Body weight was measured weekly, and health checks and daily fecal consistency were evaluated daily in every calf by the same observer. Calves with 2 consecutive days of loose feces that sifted through bedding were considered diarrhea positive. We used a linear mixed effects model to evaluate the effects of β-glucan supplementation fed during the preweaning period on performance (average daily gain), final weight, feed efficiency (FE), white blood cell count, and selected blood metabolites, repeated by time. A generalized linear mixed effects model was also run to evaluate the likelihood of a diarrhea bout in the first 28 d of life, controlling for the calf as the subject with a logistic distribution. We included age, serum total protein at 48 h, and birth weight as covariates. At 56 d, β-glucan-supplemented calves weighed more than control calves (56.3 vs. 51.5 kg). Treatment had no effect on total starter intake, but there was a treatment by age interaction for FE, with greater FE for β-glucan-supplemented calves in wk 3 and 5 of age. There was only a tendency for average daily gain to be greater in supplemented calves than in control calves for the duration of the study. Furthermore, control calves had 14.66 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 9.87–21.77] times greater odds of having a diarrheal bout than β-glucan-supplemented calves. Control calves had 12.70 (95% CI: 8.82–18.28) times greater odds of having an additional day with an abnormal fecal score compared with β-glucan-supplemented calves, suggesting that supplementation ameliorated diarrhea severity. We found no association of treatment with concentrations of serum total protein, albumin, creatinine, or glucose during the preweaning period. Our findings suggest that dietary supplementation of 2 g/d of algae β-glucans to milk replacer improved fecal status and may affect growth, as evidenced by a higher weaning weight, compared with control calves. Future studies should explore the effect of algae β-glucans on lower-gut physiology and digestibility in dairy calves.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aalbumins 3aaverage daily gain 3abirth weight 3ablood 3ablood proteins 3acalves 3acell walls 3aconfidence interval 3acreatinine 3acrude protein 3adairy science 3adiarrhea 3adietary supplements 3adigestibility 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3aleukocyte count 3ametabolites 3amilk replacer 3amodels 3aneutral detergent fiber 3arandomized clinical trials 3astandard deviation 0acalf 0adiarrhea 0aimmunity 0aEuglena gracilis1 ade Toledo, A.F.1 ada Silva, A.P.1 aPoczynek, M.1 aCantor, M.C.1 aVirgínío Júnior, G.F.1 aGreco, L.1 aBittar, C.M.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Oct., v. 105, no. 10 p.7998-8007dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2022-218383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245015000198300001800348500001400366500002000380520158600400592002801986596006902014596005902083596005902142596006202201596007502263650002002338650001602358650001602374650001602390650001202406650001402418650000902432650001002441650002002451650001302471650001102484650001402495650001902509650002202528700001402550700001802564700001702582700001702599700001702616700001602633700001702649700001102666700002202677700001702699773012702716856007902843852000902922655001202931IND60711386120221116153943.0200923e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071138612DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.131902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6082-947310aChromosome‐level genome assembly of a cyprinid fish Onychostoma macrolepis by integration of nanopore sequencing, Bionano and Hi‐C technology  ap. 1361-1371.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOnychostoma macrolepis is an emerging commercial cyprinid fish species. It is a model system for studies of sexual dimorphism and genome evolution. Here, we report the chromosome‐level assembly of the O.macrolepis genome obtained from the integration of nanopore long‐read sequencing with physical maps produced using Bionano and Hi‐C technology. A total of 87.9 Gb of nanopore sequence provided approximately 100‐fold coverage of the genome. The preliminary genome assembly was 883.2 Mb in size with a contig N50 size of 11.2 Mb. The 969 corrected contigs obtained from Bionano optical mapping were assembled into 853 scaffolds and produced an assembly of 886.5 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 16.5 Mb. Finally, using the Hi‐C data, 881.3 Mb (99.4% of genome) in 526 scaffolds were anchored and oriented in 25 chromosomes ranging in size from 25.27 to 56.49 Mb. In total, 24,770 protein‐coding genes were predicted in the genome, and ~96.85% of the genes were functionally annotated. The annotated assembly contains 93.3% complete genes from the BUSCO reference set. In addition, we identified 409 Mb (46.23% of the genome) of repetitive sequence, and 11,213 non‐coding RNAs, in the genome. Evolutionary analysis revealed that O. macrolepis diverged from common carp approximately 24.25 million years ago. The chromosomes of O. macrolepis showed an unambiguous correspondence to the chromosomes of zebrafish. The high‐quality genome assembled in this work provides a valuable genomic resource for further biological and evolutionary studies of O. macrolepis.  aPublisher supplied data  acstc2018jscx‐mszd0380cChongqing Science and Technology Bureau  a31630082cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31572609cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31861123001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD0900202cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aCyprinus carpio 3aDanio rerio 3aOnychostoma 3achromosomes 3aecology 3aevolution 3afish 3agenes 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3amodels 3ananopores 3anon-coding RNA 3asexual dimorphism1 aGao, Tian1 aWang, Feilong1 aQin, Zuliang1 aYan, Longxia1 aTao, Wenjing1 aLi, Minghui1 aJin, Canbiao1 aMa, Li1 aKocher, Thomas D.1 aWang, Deshou0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2020 Sept., v. 20, no. 5 p.1361-1371dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.131903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010800161300001600269520116800285592002801453650001501481650001001496650001001506650001201516650001101528650001201539700002101551773011401572856007401686852000901760655001201769IND60642359320221122025350.0190507e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064235932DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027091752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitz, Barbara10aSnapping behaviour in intraspecific agonistic encounters in the snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis)  ap. 623-632.  aDuring intraspecific agonistic encounters in snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) the behaviour of the snapper, emitting a fast water jet by very rapid closure of the large modified snapper claw, and the receiver was analysed by single frame video analysis before, during, and after the snap. During snapping the opponents usually face each other. Snapping is most frequently preceded by touch of frontal appendages. The snapping animal keeps its snapper claw slightly across the midline, shielding frontal body parts, and its tailfan bent downwards. The mean claw cocking duration (generating muscle tension) before snapping amounts to about 500 ms. In 58% of the snaps, the snapper claw pointed at the opponent, its claws, densely covered with sensory hairs, representing the main target of the water jet. The mean distance for these directed snaps was 0.9 cm, while undirected snaps were emitted from larger distances of on average 3.4 cm. The snapper usually withdraws immediately after snapping, the receiver approaches. Initial snaps are often answered by return snaps and both are emitted from smaller distances and hit more often than subsequent snaps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappendages 3aclaws 3ahairs 3amuscles 3ashrimp 3asnapper1 aHerberholz, Jens0 tJournal of biosciences.g1998 Dec., v. 23, no. 5 p.623-632dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027091753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012500170300001600295520168900311592002802000650001702028650001702045650001202062650001102074650002002085650001402105650001702119650002102136650002602157650001602183650001602199650001302215650001902228650001302247650000902260773012202269856008302391852000902474655001202483IND60729924420221117224942.0210731e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072992442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10265-021-01259-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatilla, Angel J.10aCellular oxidative stress in programmed cell death: focusing on chloroplastic 1O2 and mitochondrial cytochrome-c release  ap. 179-194.  aThe programmed cell death (PCD) occurs when the targeted cells have fulfilled their task or under conditions as oxidative stress generated by ROS species. Thus, plants have to deal with the singlet oxygen ¹O₂ produced in chloroplasts. ¹O₂ is unlikely to act as a primary retrograde signal owing to its high reactivity and short half-life. In addition to its high toxicity, the ¹O₂ generated under an excess or low excitation energy might also act as a highly versatile signal triggering chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling (ChNRS) and nuclear reprogramming or cell death. Molecular and biochemical studies with the flu mutant, which accumulates protochlorophyllide in the dark, demonstrated that chloroplastic ¹O₂-driven EXECUTER-1 (EX1) and EX2 proteins are involved in the ¹O₂-dependent response. Both EX1 and EX2 are necessary for full suppression of ¹O₂-induced gene expression. That is, EXECUTER proteolysis via the ATP-dependent zinc protease (FtsH) is an integral part of ¹O₂-triggered retrograde signaling. The existence of at least two independent ChNRS involving EX1 and β-cyclocitral, and dihydroactinidiolide and OXI1, respectively, seem clear. Besides, this update also focuses on plant PCD and its relation with mitochondrial cytochrome-c (Cytc) release to cytosol. Changes in the dynamics and morphology of mitochondria were shown during the onset of cell death. The mitochondrial damage and translocation of Cytc may be one of the major causes of PCD triggering.

Low-level air bubbling and dietary S reduction were evaluated as methods for reducing peak H₂S emissions from swine (Sus scrofa) manure slurry samples. In a first experiment, 15-L slurry samples were stored in bench-scale digesters and continuously bubbled with air at 0 (control), 5, or 10 mL min⁻¹ for 28 d. The 5-L headspace of each digester was also continuously ventilated at 40 mL min⁻¹ and the mean H₂S concentration in the outlet air was <10 μL L⁻¹ On Day 28, the slurry was agitated suddenly. The peak H₂S concentration exceeded instrument range (>120 μL L⁻¹) from the control treatment, and was 47 and 3.4 μL L⁻¹ for the 5 and 10 mL min⁻¹ treatments, respectively. In a second experiment, individually penned barrows were fed rations with dietary S concentrations of 0.34, 0.24, and 0.15% (w/w). Slurry derived from each diet was bubbled with air in bench-scale digesters, as before, at 10 mL min⁻¹ for 12 d and the mean H₂S concentration in the digester outlet air was 11 μL L⁻¹ On Day 12, the slurry was agitated but the H₂S emissions did not change significantly. Both low-level bubbling of air through slurry and dietary S reduction appear to be viable methods for reducing peak H₂S emissions from swine manure slurry at a bench scale, but these approaches must be validated at larger scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aair 3abarrows 3adiet 3aemissions 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aodors 3apig manure 3aslurries 3asulfur1 aMorin, Brent1 aZhang, Yongcheng1 aSauer, Willem C.1 aFeddes, John J.

METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a 10-wk control diet (10% fat) or an HF diet (60% fat) containing lard (HF-L), olive oil (HF-O), sunflower oil, or canola oil. Food intake and body weight were measured. At euthanasia, blood was collected and adipose tissue was dissected. Serum hormones and cytokines were determined. RESULTS: The plasma insulin levels were higher in the HF-L and HF-O groups than in the other three groups (P < 0.0001). The levels of resistin were highest in the HF-L and HF-O groups (P < 0.0001). Leptin expression was also highest in these two groups (P < 0.0001). Of the four groups, interleukin-6 was expressed at the highest level in the HF-L group (P < 0.0005), whereas adiponectin was expressed at the lowest level (P < 0.0001). The accumulation of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues was higher in the HF-L group compared with the other groups. This group was hypertrophic because of excess subcutaneous fat and epididymal fat in the adipocytes. However, the ratio of subcutaneous to visceral fat was significantly lower in the HF-L and HF-O groups compared with the other groups. CONCLUSION: In mice fed fat-rich diets, the level of adipokines, the distribution of adipose tissue, and the metabolism of carbohydrates are more significantly influenced by the lipid content rather than the absolute amount of lipid.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahigh fat diet 3aadiponectin 3aleptin 3aresistin 3alipids 3ablood 3asunflower oil 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acanola oil 3ametrology 3atissue distribution 3alard 3asubcutaneous fat 3abody weight 3aolive oil 3aadipose tissue 3amice 3ainsulin 3alipid content 3afood intake 3ainterleukin-6 2aAdipocytes 2aAdipokinesxblood 2aAdiponectinxblood 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBody Fat Distribution 2aDiet, High-Fat 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aInsulinxblood 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aIntra-Abdominal Fatxmetabolism 2aLeptinxblood 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPlant Oilsxpharmacology 2aResistinxblood 2aSubcutaneous Fatxmetabolism 0acytokines1 aMartins, Marcela Anjos1 aCunha Brunini, Tatiana Marlowe1 aMendes-Ribeiro, Antonio Claudio1 aMandarim-de-Lacerda, Carlos Alberto1 aAguila, Marcia Barbosa0 tNutrition.g2012 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.212-219dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006300145245010100208300001800309500001400327500002000341520132600361592002801687596002101715596006201736596003201798596002601830650002801856650002201884650002301906650001201929650001401941650001101955650002001966650001201986650001201998650001102010650001402021650001402035650001402049700006002063700006302123773012702186856007902313852000902392655001202401IND60711386420221116153849.0200923e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071138642DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.131762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaworski, Coline C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6136-865610aChromosome‐level hybrid de novo genome assemblies as an attainable option for nonmodel insects  ap. 1277-1293.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe emergence of third‐generation sequencing (3GS; long‐reads) is bringing closer the goal of chromosome‐size fragments in de novo genome assemblies. This allows the exploration of new and broader questions on genome evolution for a number of nonmodel organisms. However, long‐read technologies result in higher sequencing error rates and therefore impose an elevated cost of sufficient coverage to achieve high enough quality. In this context, hybrid assemblies, combining short‐reads and long‐reads, provide an alternative efficient and cost‐effective approach to generate de novo, chromosome‐level genome assemblies. The array of available software programs for hybrid genome assembly, sequence correction and manipulation are constantly being expanded and improved. This makes it difficult for nonexperts to find efficient, fast and tractable computational solutions for genome assembly, especially in the case of nonmodel organisms lacking a reference genome or one from a closely related species. In this study, we review and test the most recent pipelines for hybrid assemblies, comparing the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to a nonmodel cactophilic Drosophila, D. mojavensis. We show that it is possible to achieve excellent contiguity on this nonmodel organism using the dbg2olc pipeline.  aPublisher supplied data  cFondation Fyssen  aIOS‐1557697cDivision of Integrative Organismal Systems  cNational Science Foundation  cUniversity of Arizona 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acomputer software 3acost effectiveness 3aecology 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenome assembly 3ahybrids 3ainsects 3amodels 3aorganisms 3apipelines 3asolutions1 aAllan, Carson W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2733-64821 aMatzkin, Luciano M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3580-91710 tMolecular ecology resources.g2020 Sept., v. 20, no. 5 p.1277-1293dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.131763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05576naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245020000200300001800400506010400418506007600522520300300598592002803601506003703629650001303666650001203679650001803691650003003709650002203739650002203761650002703783650001703810650001203827650001103839650001903850650002303869650000903892650001303901650002303914650001703937650001903954650001503973650002803988650001104016650001504027650001404042653001104056653001504067653002304082653001304105653001704118700005804135700005604193700005404249700005704303700006004360700005604420700005604476700005604532700005904588773015504647856007904802852000904881655001204890IND60792078920221207131159.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079207892DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2022-218852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, N.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8380-345210aEffects on feed intake, milk production, and methane emission in dairy cows fed silage or fresh grass with concentrate or fresh grass harvested at early or late maturity stage without concentrate  ap. 8036-8053.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of the study was to quantify the effects on dry matter intake (DMI), nutrient digestibility, gas exchange, milk production, and milk quality in dairy cows fed fresh grass harvested at different maturity stages. Sixteen Danish Holstein cows in mid-lactation were divided into 4 blocks and used in 4 incomplete 4 × 2 Latin squares with 2 periods of 21 d. The cows received 1 of 4 treatments in each period, resulting in 8 cows per treatment, as follows: grass-clover silage supplemented with 6 kg/d concentrate pellets (SILc), fresh grass harvested at late maturity stage supplemented with 6 kg/d concentrate pellets (LATc), fresh grass harvested at late maturity stage (LAT), and fresh grass harvested at early maturity stage (ERL). The cows were housed in tiestalls and milked twice daily. The cows had ad libitum access to the forage, and concentrate pellets were divided into equal amounts and fed separately in the morning and afternoon. Fecal samples were collected to determine apparent total-tract digestibility, and samples of rumen fluid were collected for determination of short chain fatty acid composition. Halters were used for measuring eating and rumination time. Gas exchange was measured in open-circuit respiration chambers. Total DMI was higher in LATc and ERL (16.9 ± 0.45 and 15.5 ± 0.39 kg/d, respectively) compared with LAT (14.1 ± 0.42 kg/d). Relative to SILc, cows fed fresh grass experienced a convex pattern in DMI during the experiment. The changes in DMI were related to changes in leaf to stem ratio, fiber concentration, and organic matter digestibility determined in vitro in samples of the fresh grass harvested throughout the experiment. The apparent total-tract digestibility of organic matter was higher in SILc and LAT compared with LATc. Methane yield was lower for LATc compared with LAT (19.5 ± 0.61 vs. 22.6 ± 0.55 g of CH₄/kg of DMI), and was not different between LAT and ERL. Compared with LAT, milk yield was higher for ERL (21.1 ± 1.14 vs. 23.4 ± 1.11 kg/d) and energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield was higher for LATc (21.5 ± 0.99 vs. 25.3 ± 1.03 kg/d). We detected no differences in milk or ECM yield between SILc and LATc. Milk protein yield was higher and milk fat concentration was lower in LATc compared with LAT. The fatty acid percentages of ∑C4-C14:1 and ∑C16 in milk were higher for SILc compared with LATc, signifying pronounced de novo synthesis. The n-6:n-3 ratio in milk fatty acids was lower for SILc and LAT compared with LATc, indicating improved nutritional quality for SILc and LAT. However, retinol concentration in milk was lower in SILc compared with all other treatments. The study implies that feeding silage instead of fresh grass has no effect on DMI, ECM yield, or CH₄ yield, and that concentrate supplementation can increase milk production, affects milk quality, and reduces the effect on climate, whereas feeding less mature grass increases DMI and milk yield, but has no effect on CH₄ yield.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aclimate 3adigestibility 3adigestible organic matter 3adry matter intake 3aearly development 3afatty acid composition 3agas exchange 3agrasses 3aleaves 3amaturity stage 3amethane production 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk protein yield 3amilk quality 3aorganic matter 3arumination 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asilage 3atie stalls 3avitamin A 0acasein 0afatty acid 0aperennial ryegrass 0aruminant 0azero-grazing1 aKristensen, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2552-22111 aJohansen, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2274-89391 aWiking, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1601-29331 aPoulsen, N.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9983-96631 aHellwing, A.L.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2881-399X1 aFoldager, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2639-826X1 aJensen, S.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9852-47741 aLarsen, L.B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9674-01071 aWeisbjerg, M.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6514-91860 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Oct., v. 105, no. 10 p.8036-8053dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2022-218853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245018400207300001100391506007600402520203900478592002802517506003702545650001402582650001302596650001602609650002302625650002402648650001802672650001502690650001302705650002602718650001402744650002002758650002602778650003102804650002102835650001302856651001002869700001802879700001702897700001802914700002002932773015902952856008103111852000903192655001203201IND60440654820221207082630.0151230e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044065482DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-015-0238-92doi7 aPMC44823162pmcid7 a261092872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenkins, Kim T12aA cross-sectional observational study of the nutritional intake of UK primary school children from deprived and non-deprived backgrounds: implications for school breakfast schemes  ap. 86.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: This study examined the nutritional intake of 9–11 year old children in Wales, UK, to assess the rationale for, and potential of, school breakfast initiatives. It also examined the possible unintended consequence of over consumption. METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional observational design within a randomized controlled trial of a free school breakfast programme. A total of 111 primary schools were randomly assigned to an intervention condition (in which a free school breakfast programme was implemented) or a control condition (in which implementation of the scheme was delayed). Sub-samples of children completed multiple-pass 24-hr dietary recall interviews at baseline (n = 581), and 12 months later (n = 582). Deprivation was assessed for each child in terms of whether or not they were entitled to free school meals. RESULTS: Prior to the introduction of the programme, rates of breakfast skipping were low and there was little evidence of widespread nutritional deficiency. However, there was a subset of children who consumed inadequate levels of a range of vitamins and minerals and 29 % of children ate very little for breakfast (less than 100 kcal). Children that ate larger breakfasts, had higher daily intakes of all nutrients that were examined. Children from deprived backgrounds consumed significantly lower levels of several vitamins and minerals at breakfast. Following the introduction of the breakfast scheme in intervention schools, there was little difference in the nutritional quality of school versus home breakfasts (n = 35 and 211 respectively). Where children ate breakfast at both school and home (n = 33), their overall energy intake was higher, but not significantly so. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall diet of this group of children was generally good prior to the breakfast scheme, the results suggest that such schemes could be beneficial for a subset of children who are poorly nourished and for those children who consume very little for breakfast.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreakfast 3achildren 3adiet recall 3aelementary schools 3aelementary students 3aenergy intake 3ainterviews 3aminerals 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aobservational studies 3arandomized clinical trials 3aschool breakfast 3avitamins 3aWales1 aBenton, David1 aTapper, Katy1 aMurphy, Simon1 aMoore, Laurence0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.86-86dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-015-0238-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04305naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245008800162300001800250500001400268500002000282520171900302592002802021596007502049596007502124596013302199596013302332596005902465596007102524596006702595650002302662650001702685650001902702650001302721650002402734650001502758650001202773650001802785650002602803650001602829650001002845650001302855650001302868650002602881650002102907650001802928650001102946650001802957650001402975650002102989650001803010650001603028650001603044700001503060700001803075700001403093700001303107700001503120700001403135700002003149700001603169700001403185700001503199700002003214700001703234700001703251700005203268773012703320856007903447852000903526655001203535IND60711386620221116153803.0200923e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071138662DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.132092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jiankai10aGenomic basis of environmental adaptation in the leathery sea squirt (Styela clava)  ap. 1414-1431.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTunicates occupy the evolutionary position at the boundary of invertebrates and vertebrates. It exhibits adaptation to broad environmental conditions and is distributed globally. Despite hundreds of years of embryogenesis studies, the genetic basis of the invasive habits of ascidians remains largely unknown. The leathery sea squirt, Styela clava, is an important invasive species. We used the chromosomal‐level genome and transcriptome of S. clava to explore its genomic‐ and molecular‐network‐based mechanisms of adaptation to environments. Compared with Ciona intestinalis type A (C. robusta), the size of the S. clava genome was expanded by 2‐fold, although the gene number was comparable. An increase in transposon number and variation in dominant types were identified as potential expansion mechanisms. In the S. clava genome, the number of genes encoding the heat‐shock protein 70 family and members of the complement system was expanded significantly, and cold‐shock protein genes were transferred horizontally into the S. clava genome from bacteria. The expanded gene families potentially play roles in the adaptation of S. clava to its environments. The loss of key genes in the galactan synthesis pathway might explain the distinct tunic structure and hardness compared with the ascidian Ciona species. We demonstrated further that the integrated thyroid hormone pathway participated in the regulation of larval metamorphosis that provides S. clava with two opportunities for adapting to their environment. Thus, our report of the chromosomal‐level leathery sea squirt genome provides a comprehensive genomic basis for the understanding of environmental adaptation in tunicates.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0900705cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2019YFE0190900cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2018SDKJ0302‐1cMarine S&T Fund of Shandong Province for Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao)  a2018SDKJ0406‐5cMarine S&T Fund of Shandong Province for Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao)  a31970487cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201822016cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a201502035cTaishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province, China 3aCiona intestinalis 3aStyela clava 3aStyela plicata 3abacteria 3acold shock proteins 3acomplement 3aecology 3aembryogenesis 3aenvironmental factors 3aexhibitions 3agenes 3agenomics 3ahardness 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ainvasive species 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3asynthesis 3athyroid hormones 3atranscriptome 3atransposons 3avertebrates1 aZhang, Jin1 aLu, Qiongxuan1 aRen, Ping1 aGuo, Xin1 aWang, Jing1 aLi, Xiang1 aChang, Yaoguang1 aDuan, Shuai1 aWang, Shi1 aYu, Haiyan1 aZhang, Xiaoming1 aYang, Xiuxia1 aGao, Hongwei1 aDong, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1616-53630 tMolecular ecology resources.g2020 Sept., v. 20, no. 5 p.1414-1431dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.132093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245023200176300001400408520216700422592002802589650002002617650001402637650001202651650001402663650001202677650001802689650001402707650001002721650001102731650002302742650001602765650001602781650001402797650001002811650001702821650001402838651001202852653001502864653003202879653001902911653002102930700002302951700001802974700002102992700002403013773012203037856008603159852000903245655001203254IND60533326820221118003537.0190319e20141023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053332682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Marlon C.T.10aEffects of storage length and flowering stage of pollen influence its viability, fruit set and fruit quality in ‘Red’ and ‘Lessard Thai’ sugar apple (Annona squamosa) and ‘Gefner’ atemoya (A. cherimola×A. squamosa)  ap. 55-60.  aThe fruit set of commercial Annonaceae pollinated by natural pollinators is generally insufficient to produce commercially acceptable yields. In addition, several studies have reported that both the pollen source and age affect the potential percent fruit set of sugar apple and atemoya. Annona flowers are hermaphrodite; however, the female part mature before the male, which is known as dichogamy of the protogynous type. The objectives of the present study were to determine the effect of pollen storage duration on pollen viability; the percent fruit set by hand pollination of ‘Red’ sugar apple, ‘Lessard Thai’ green sugar apple and ‘Gefner’ atemoya; and resulting fruit characteristics as a result of pollen source in South Florida. Hand pollination and in vitro pollen germination tests were arranged in a 3×5 factorial design, with three cultivars, five treatments, and five replicates per treatment. The percentage of in vitro pollen germination was the highest for ‘Red’ sugar apple pollen (26.5%) collected from male stage flowers and for pollen collected from female stage flowers collected late afternoon and germinated 18h later (23%). Percent pollen germination was higher for ‘Lessard Thai’ (∼33%) than for ‘Red’ sugar apple and pollen storage for up to 24h was not significantly different than male stage pollen used immediately and pollen collected from female stage flowers and used 18h later. ‘Gefner’ atemoya pollen did not germinate when pollen grains were collected from male stage flowers and when using female stage flowers collected late afternoon and stored for 72h. Fruit set and fruit quality varied significantly as a result of pollen storage treatments. Hand pollination promoted high percentages of fruit set, greater than 80% when female stage flowers were collected late afternoon and hand pollination performed 18h after collection. Fruit harvested as a result of the various pollen storage treatments varied significantly in weight, diameter, and the number of seeds per fruit. The pollen from ‘Lessard Thai’ sugar apple and ‘Gefner’ atemoya may be stored up to 24 and 48h, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona squamosa 3acultivars 3afemales 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afruit quality 3afruit set 3amales 3apollen 3apollen germination 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprotogyny 3aseeds 3astorage time 3aviability 3aFlorida 0aAnnonaceae 0aIn vitro pollen germination 0aFructification 0aHand pollination1 aCrane, Jonathan H.1 aMontas, Wanda1 aNietsche, Silvia1 aVendrame, Wagner A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2014 Oct. 23, v. 178 p.55-60dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2014.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009800166500001900264500001100283520248300294592002802777650002502805650002802830650001402858650001002872650002002882650001402902650001002916650001102926650001302937650001802950650001502968650001502983700006102998773014203059856007403201852000903275655001203284IND60738296320221123034122.0210524e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073829632DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.153982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarrosa, Ana Paula Q.10aFlour made from fruit by‐products: Characteristics, processing conditions, and applications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aThe disposal of fruit and vegetable by‐products has drawn the attention of several sectors worldwide, not only due to the concern over environmental impacts but also due to high ratios of nutrients and bioactive compounds that are found in these nonedible parts. These by‐products still have great technological potential, because they can be processed and transformed in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, and other products and biomaterial with high added value. The most common form of incorporating them into food is flour. Drying operations enable waste to keep higher concentration of nutrients, less susceptibility to be attacked by microorganisms (due to low humidity), lower storage volumes, and longer shelf‐life. The process of transforming residue into flours can be carried out by different equipment whose goal is to remove moisture. Afterwards, dry products pass through mills to reduce particle size. Then, standardization of granule size is recommended. In the conversion steps, processing conditions are particularly important because they should not cause any loss of nutrients, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity to the final product. In view of the need to control production steps, this review aimed at compiling information on the theme found in the literature and at highlighting existing gaps to show the scientific community the importance of studying the factors that affect the quality of dehydrated final products. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The disposal of fruit by‐products attracts the attention of several segments, not only due to the concern with environmental impacts worldwide but also due to the high levels of nutrients and bioactive compounds that are still present in these inedible parts that are not properly used. This review provides nutritional and technological information on fruit residues and their potential for application in food. The most common way of inserting these products in food matrices is through flour, but this process is not just about removing moisture from the product, several factors need to be studied and controlled aiming at the minimum of nutritional and technological losses, reduction of antinutritional factors that may be present in the residues, reduced development of microorganisms, and enzymatic activity, and for these reasons, this review was constructed, to bring the main scientific findings in the literature that reports studies on these subjects to the scientific community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocompatible materials 3acosmetics 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3aequipment 3aflour 3afruits 3ahumidity 3aparticle size 3ashelf life 3avegetables1 aOtero, Deborah M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9792-39920 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.e15398-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.153983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014100172300002000313520210500333592002802438650002202466650001802488650001002506650003902516650001502555650001402570650002102584650001302605650001302618650004402631650002102675650001802696650001302714650001102727650002202738650001902760650001402779650001602793700002402809700001702833700002502850700002102875700003102896700002302927773010102950856008603051852000903137655001203146IND60577559720171221000000.0170809e20161213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057755972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b033672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValero, Margarita10aCompetitive and Synergistic Interactions between Polymer Micelles, Drugs, and Cyclodextrins: The Importance of Drug Solubilization Locus  ap. 13174-13186.  aPolymeric micelles, in particular PEO-PPO-based Pluronic, have emerged as promising drug carriers, while cyclodextrins (CD), cyclic oligosaccharides with an apolar cavity, have long been used for their capacity to form inclusion complexes with drugs. Dimethylated β-cyclodextrin (DIMEB) has the capacity to fully breakup F127 Pluronic micelles, while this effect is substantially hindered if drugs are loaded within the micellar aggregates. Four drugs were studied at physiological temperature: lidocaine (LD), pentobarbital sodium salt (PB), sodium naproxen (NP), and sodium salicylate (SAL); higher temperatures shift the equilibrium toward higher drug partitioning and lower drug/CD binding compared to 25 °C (Valero, M.; Dreiss, C. A. Growth, Shrinking, and Breaking of Pluronic Micelles in the Presence of Drugs and/or β-Cyclodextrin, a Study by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering and Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Langmuir 2010, 26, 10561−10571). The impact of drugs on micellar structure was characterized by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), while their solubilization locus was revealed by 2D NOESY NMR. UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, Dynamic and Static Light Scattering were employed to measure a range of micellar properties and drug:CD interactions: binding constant, drug partitioning within the micelles, critical micellar concentration of the loaded micelles, aggregation number (Nₐgg). Critically, time-resolved SANS (TR-SANS) reveal that micellar breakup in the presence of drugs is substantially slower (100s of seconds) than for the free micelles (<100 ms) (Valero, M.; Grillo, I.; Dreiss, C. A. Rupture of Pluronic Micelles by Di-Methylated β-Cyclodextrin Is Not Due to Polypseudorotaxane Formation. J. Phys. Chem. B 2012, 116, 1273−1281). These results combined together give new insights into the mechanisms of protection of the drugs against CD-induced micellar breakup. The outcomes are practical guidelines to improve the design of drug delivery systems as well as a better understanding of competitive assembly mechanisms leading to shape and function modulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aguidelines 3alidocaine 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3aneutrons 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoligosaccharides 3apentobarbital 3apolymers 3asodium 3asodium salicylate 3asolubilization 3asynergism 3atemperature1 aCastiglione, Franca1 aMele, Andrea1 ada Silva, Marcelo A.1 aGrillo, Isabelle1 aGonzález-Gaitano, Gustavo1 aDreiss, Cécile A.0 tLangmuir.g2016 Dec. 13, v. 32, no. 49 p.13174-13186dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b033673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04991naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245009100175300001800266506010400284506007600388520295400464592002803418506003703446650001103483650001303494650001603507650001503523650000903538650001603547650001603563650001803579650002903597650003003626650002203656650001803678650002003696650001403716650000903730650001303739650001503752650002803767650002803795650001703823650001503840650001803855653001803873653002003891653002003911653001103931653001503942700002603957700002103983700002504004700002304029700002304052700002304075773015504098856007904253852000904332655001204341IND60792079220221207132852.0220921e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079207922DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2022-219182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, W.

Holstein dairy cows (n = 20) in 5, 4 × 4 Latin squares (21-d periods) were fed a combination of strategies for feeding fibrous coproducts in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of the following treatments: (1) forage feeds: the partial replacement of WPCS (CS) with CEFC (CO), and (2) concentrate feeds: the partial replacement of wet corn gluten feed (GF) with a blend of pelleted citrus and corn distillers dried grains (CD) to have isonitrogenous diets. The concentrations of physically effective neutral detergent fiber (NDF; ₚₑNDF>₈) were (% of dry matter): 21.8% for CS, 19.2% for CO, 20.7% for GF, and 20.2% for CD. Cows fed diet CS-CD had the highest yield of energy-corrected milk (30.0 kg/d) relative to the other diets (28.4 kg/d). Milk fat concentration was reduced on CO relative to CS. Cows fed the CO diets had higher DMI (21.2 vs. 20.2 kg/d) and digestible organic matter intake and tended to have a lower ratio of energy-corrected milk to DMI than cows fed CS. Diets CO reduced the daily intake of ₚₑNDF>₈ and the intake as percent of body weight of ₚₑNDF>₈, forage NDF, and total NDF relative to CS. Cows fed CO had greater meal frequency and lower daily meal time, meal duration, meal size, and duration of the largest meal than cows fed CS. The CO diet reduced rumination and total chewing in minutes per day and minutes per kilogram of DMI. When expressed per unit of ₚₑNDF>₈ intake, rumination and total chewing were not affected by forage source. The total-tract starch digestibility coefficient was lower for cows fed CO than CS, but the intake of digestible starch was higher on CO than CS. Cows fed GF had reduced milk yield (29.6 vs. 30.8 kg/d), tended to have reduced DMI (20.4 vs. 21.0 kg/d), and had reduced digestible organic matter intake than cows fed CD. Feed efficiency was not affected by source of concentrate. The type of concentrate did not affect the intake of forage NDF and ₚₑNDF>₈, but cows fed GF had higher intake of total NDF as percent of body weight than cows fed CD. The GF increased meal frequency and reduced meal size and largest meal duration and size. Cows fed GF had higher rumination and total chewing than cows fed CD (min/d, min/kg of DMI, and min/kg ₚₑNDF>₈). Starch digestibility was higher and the intake of digestible starch tended to be higher on cows fed GF than CD. Plasma urea-N was higher, milk urea-N tended to be higher, and N utilization efficiency tended to be lower on cows fed GF than CD. Ruminal microbial yield was not affected by any treatment. All strategies evaluated were nutritionally viable and CEFC was a feasible partial replacement for WPCS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus 3aHolstein 3abody weight 3acoproducts 3acorn 3acorn gluten 3acorn silage 3adigestibility 3adigestible carbohydrates 3adigestible organic matter 3adry matter intake 3aeating habits 3afeed conversion 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutrient use efficiency 3aportion size 3arumination 3aurea nitrogen 0adigestibility 0aeating behavior 0aeffective fiber 0aintake 0arumination1 aCarvalho, Flaviane R.1 aSilva, Rayana B.1 aPereira, Renata A.N.1 aÁvila, Carla L.S.1 aDeVries, Trevor J.1 aPereira, Marcos N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Oct., v. 105, no. 10 p.8099-8114dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2022-219183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245007900175300001600254520168100270592002801951650001501979650002501994650001702019650001402036650002002050650001502070650001302085650001702098650001402115650002302129650002502152650001402177700003202191700003202223700002602255700003102281700003902312700002502351773011702376856008102493852000902574655001202583IND60572748420221119092437.0170717e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057274842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-016-9459-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar-Arteaga, Karina10aDetermination of cyclamate by a cheap and simple spectrophotometric method  ap. 879-886.  aIn this work, a simple method based on anthocyanins degradation by nitrite ion was used to determine cyclamate in table-top sweeteners. The method was carried out in four steps: (1) cyclamate hydrolysis (hydrolysed cyclamate, HC); (2) reaction between HC and nitrous acid; (3) anthocyanins degradation by residual nitrous acid; and (4) Absorbance measurements at 515 nm. The anthocyanins degradation reaction was done at 20 and 60 °C with 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 mgL⁻¹ HNO₂, and several reaction times were tested (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min). Under the best conditions (60 °C, 10 mgL⁻¹HNO₂ and 45 min of reaction time) the calibration curve for cyclamate was linear in the range from 3.19 to 20 mgL⁻¹; the relative standard deviation was 0.62% (for n = 5) and the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.96 mgL⁻¹. The method was applied for determination of cyclamate in table-top sweeteners and the results were compared with the official method (AOAC 957.09). The effect of synergistic sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame, sucralose, and saccharin) was also analysed. The results show that the proposed method: (1) reduces considerably the analysis time (from 26 to 2 h, approximately); (2) decreases the LOD and the sample amount is lesser; (3) uses less number of reagents which produces few residues; and (4) it is friendly with the environment, because the anthocyanins source is a plant and the residues can be considered as non-toxics. According with the analysis of synergistic sweetener sacesulfame-K and sucralose present interference; meanwhile aspartame and saccharin (the most used with cyclamate) have not interference in the determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacesulfame potassium 3aanthocyanins 3aaspartame 3adetection limit 3ahydrolysis 3anitrites 3anitrous acid 3asaccharin 3aspectrophotometers 3astatistical analysis 3asucralose1 aDe Jesús-Fuentes, Karla I.1 aContreras-López, Elizabeth1 aAñorve-Morga, Javier1 aCastañeda-Ovando, Araceli1 aGonzález-Olivares, Luis Guillermo1 aJaimez-Ordaz, Judith0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2017 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.879-886dSpringer USx2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-016-9459-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03481naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245012500203300001800328500001400346500002000360520178300380592002802163596005902191650001802250650002702268650003002295650001602325650002202341650002102363650001402384650002202398650001502420650004202435650001602477650001902493650001502512650002402527650002602551650001102577650001202588650002402600700001902624700005802643700005902701773012702760856007902887852000902966655001202975IND60711386920221116153918.0200923e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071138692DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.132002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuji, Satsuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0963-620010aQuantitative evaluation of intraspecific genetic diversity in a natural fish population using environmental DNA analysis  ap. 1323-1332.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis using high‐throughput sequencing (HTS) enable evaluation of intraspecific genetic diversity in a population. As the intraspecific genetic diversity provides invaluable information for wildlife conservation and management, there is an increasing demand to apply eDNA analysis to population genetics and the phylogeography by quantitative evaluation of intraspecific diversity. However, quantitative evaluations of intraspecific genetic diversity using eDNA is not straightforward because the number of eDNA sequence reads obtained by HTS may not be an index of the quantity of eDNA. In this study, to quantitatively evaluate genetic diversity using eDNA analysis, we applied a quantitative eDNA metabarcoding method using the internal standard DNAs. We targeted Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) and added internal standard DNAs with known copy numbers to each eDNA sample obtained from three rivers during the library preparation process. The sequence reads of each Ayu haplotype were successfully converted to DNA copy numbers based on the relationship between the copy numbers and sequence reads of the internal standard DNAs. In all rivers, the calculated copy number of each haplotype showed a significant positive correlation with the haplotype frequency estimated by a capture‐based survey. Furthermore, estimates of genetic indicators such as nucleotide diversity based on the eDNA copy numbers were comparable with those estimated based on a capture‐based study. Our results demonstrate that eDNA analysis with internal standard DNAs enables reasonable quantification of intraspecific genetic diversity, and this method could thus be a promising tool in the field of population genetics and phylogeography.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP18J10088cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aDNA barcoding 3aPlecoglossus altivelis 3aadministrative management 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental DNA 3afish communities 3afrequency 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainformation 3aphylogeography 3apopulation 3apopulation genetics 3aquantitative analysis 3arivers 3asurveys 3awildlife management1 aShibata, Naoki1 aSawada, Hayato1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1415-34811 aUshio, Masayuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4831-71810 tMolecular ecology resources.g2020 Sept., v. 20, no. 5 p.1323-1332dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.132003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245011700161300001600278520200800294592002802302653002002330653001002350653000902360653000902369653001202378700002602390700001902416700002802435700001602463773015502479856007502634852000902709655001202718IND60131701420221120062618.0151127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013170142DNAL7 a10.1638/2008-0044.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLéécu, Alexis10aSerologic Response and Safety to Vaccination Against Avian Influenza Using Inactivated H5N2 Vaccine in Zoo Birds  ap. 731-743.  aDue to the spread of the H5N1 highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus across Europe, a preventive vaccination occurred in early 2006 among 135 French zoologic institutions. Approximately 25,000 birds were vaccinated with a H5N2 inactivated vaccine. Among them, 4,369 birds were monitored by members of Association Francophone des Véétéérinaires de Parc Zoologique regarding safety issues of the vaccination protocol. A total of 1,686 blood samples were collected before the first injection (n == 255), at the time of booster (n == 463), 60 day after the booster (n == 514), and 180 day (n == 229) and 330 day (n == 217) after the initial injection. Thus, sera of 126 species representing 15 different avian orders were tested using the hemagglutinin inhibition assay to evaluate seroconversion and the long-term serologic profile of selected anti-H5 antibody. Safety was considered satisfactory in all orders, and there were no deleterious effects on large-volume injection/body weight ratio. After the second injection, 71%% of the birds developed a titer ≥≥32, with a mean titer of 558. Titers then decreased in all birds, with 42%% of the remaining birds having a titer ≥≥32 at day 180 and only 26%% at day 330. Results demonstrated that a booster 42 days after initial vaccination was mandatory to raise the titer above 32, considered to be the protective level in poultry, and to increase the number of seroconverted birds. Differences in the serologic responses among the orders and species of birds were detected and could be linked with the variation of vaccine dose injected per body weight or with species-specific immune response. The protocol for additional campaigns will be adjusted for some bird orders through the increase of injected dose or a half yearly booster to sustain better titers over the year. Vaccination is a useful tool, together with biosecurity, that should always be used as a primary method of preventing and controlling avian influenza outbreaks.  aPublisher supplied data 0aavian influenza 0abirds 0aH5N1 0aH5N2 0avaccine1 aDe Langhe, Christophe1 aPetit, Thierry1 aBernard, Fréédééric1 aSwam, Hanny0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2009 Dec., v. 40, no. 4 p.731-743dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2008-0044.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014100172300001600313520106700329592002801396650001901424650002501443650001201468650001501480650002201495650001201517650001801529650002001547650001501567653001801582653001101600653002501611653001501636653001301651700001901664700001701683700001801700700001301718700001701731773010001748856008701848852000901935655001201944IND60542228120221120170432.0190402e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054222812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Han-Seob10aOptimization of enzymatic hydrolysis conditions for extraction of pectin from rapeseed cake (Brassica napus L.) using commercial enzymes  ap. 332-338.  aThe aims of this study were to extract pectin from rapeseed cake (RSC) by enzymatic hydrolysis using commercial enzymes (Celluclast and Alcalase) and to investigate the effects of different reaction conditions, such as enzymatic hydrolysis time, enzyme–RSC ratio, and Celluclast–Alcalase ratio, on the degradation of RSC and pectin yield. RSC was treated using a combined extraction process that consisted of a fat removal process, enzymatic hydrolysis, and isopropanol/ethanol precipitation. After the fat removal process and enzymatic hydrolysis, defatted-RSC was suitably decomposed, and the loss of liberated reducing sugars was minimized when the hydrolysis condition reached a hydrolysis time of 270min or an enzyme–RSC ratio of 1:50. Based on these results, various Celluclast–Alcalase ratios were applied. Alcalase led to the destruction of protein–carbohydrate complex in defatted-RSC, whereas Celluclast cleaved some linkages of carbohydrate slightly. As a result, the highest pectin yield was 6.85% at the Celluclast–Alcalase ratio of 1:4.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3ahydrolysis 3aisopropyl alcohol 3apectins 3arapeseed cake 3areducing sugars 3asubtilisin 0aRapeseed cake 0aPectin 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aCelluclast 0aAlcalase1 aKim, Ho-yŏng,1 aAhn, Sye Hee1 aOh, Sei Chang1 aYang, In1 aChoi, In-Gyu0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 157 p.332-338dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04067naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245016000185520246400345592002802809650003002837650001502867650002702882650002702909650002002936650001302956650001002969650001902979650001602998650002403014650001503038650001103053650002403064650001403088650001503102650001403117650001503131650001903146650002403165650001003189651001103199653001403210653001503224653001603239700002103255700001603276700002203292700001903314773009603333856008703429852000903516655001203525IND60714025420221118064001.0220103e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071402542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1076722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGichohi-Wainaina, Wanjiku N.10aAflatoxin contamination: Knowledge disparities among agriculture extension officers, frontline health workers and small holder farming households in Malawi  aThe aims of this study were to assess the state of knowledge and perceptions regarding aflatoxin contamination among frontline workers in direct contact with small holder farming households in Malawi as well as among the households themselves. The study first investigated and documented demographic profiles of agriculture extension workers (n = 22) and frontline health workers (n = 161) both from Ntchisi district and small holder farming households (n = 915) from Dedza, Balaka and Mzimba districts. Structured questionnaires were administered to document knowledge and perceptions. Majority of the respondents in Ntchisi were frontline nutrition and health workers as follows: care group promoters (31.7%), cluster leaders (51.9%) and health surveillance assistants (4.4%). Only 12% of the respondents were agriculture extension officers. Among frontline workers, using factor analyses, factors highly associated with the knowledge on domestic management of aflatoxin contamination and the impact of aflatoxin contamination on child linear growth and health in general were most prominent. Whereas, their knowledge of pre & post-harvest practices that pre-dispose crops to aflatoxin contamination and impact of aflatoxin contamination on trade and income losses was relatively low. On the other hand, among small holder farming households, lowest knowledge was related to occurrence of aflatoxin contamination pre and post-harvest. Highest knowledge was observed on issues around loss of income due to aflatoxin contamination. Across all districts over 50% of surveyed respondents reported that they perceived aflatoxin contamination severity as low. Majority of the households (>50%) did not perceive aflatoxin contamination as a problem that could be controlled.This is the first study to investigate knowledge, attitudes, practices and perceptions on aflatoxin contamination among a combination of agriculture extension officers and frontline health workers in parallel with the households they usually are in contact with. The current investigation is crucial because it elucidates knowledge gaps in aflatoxin critical control across agriculture extension, health workers and the small holder farming households. This is especially crucial among agriculture extension workers and frontline health workers as they have direct contact with households and therefore serve as an important source of information that could influence behavior change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aaflatoxins 3aagricultural extension 3aattitudes and opinions 3abehavior change 3achildren 3acrops 3adirect contact 3afood safety 3ahealth care workers 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3ainformation sources 3aknowledge 3amonitoring 3anutrition 3aoccurrence 3aquestionnaires 3asmall-scale farming 3atrade 3aMalawi 0aAflatoxin 0aMycotoxins 0aFood safety1 aKumwenda, Nelson1 aZulu, Rodah1 aMunthali, Justice1 aOkori, Patrick0 tFood control.g2021 Mar., v. 121 p.107672-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1076723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011400163300001600277520111200293592002801405650001801433650001201451650002001463650002201483650002301505650002001528650001601548650001301564650002801577650001501605650001301620650003201633650001801665650002001683650001701703700001701720700001301737700001501750700001501765773011701780856008101897852000901978655001201987IND60572748720221119092555.0170717e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057274872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-016-9453-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbboudi, M.10aMonitoring phthalates leaching into polyethylene terephthalate sterilized bottled water by ionizing radiation  ap. 818-826.  aWater from a single natural spring filled in PET has been used to examine the sterilization effect of Gamma and E-Beam irradiation on the chemical and microbial quality of water through 6 months of storage under real consumer conditions. Two strategies were adapted in this work; the first was the sterilization of PET empty bottles at 20 kGy dose which were then filled by UV sterilized water. The second was the sterilization of the PET bottled water at the recommended microbial decontamination dose of 5 kGy. Dibutyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, and dimethyl phthalate concentrations increased significantly during storage under sunlight exposure in comparison with a dark laboratory storage. Nitrite was only presented in PET bottled water that was sterilized by Gamma irradiation and stored in the dark. 5 kGy dose could be considered good for microbial sterilization of PET bottled water and has less impact on leaching of phthalates compounds than 20 kGy dose. Moreover, it could be an emergent method for water decontamination at an industrial level and consequently improve the public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottled water 3abottles 3adecontamination 3adibutyl phthalate 3adimethyl phthalate 3agamma radiation 3airradiation 3aleaching 3amicrobiological quality 3amonitoring 3anitrites 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apublic health 3asolar radiation 3astorage time1 aAljoumaa, K.1 aOdeh, A.1 aAlkaid, A.1 aKoudsi, Y.0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2017 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.818-826dSpringer USx2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-016-9453-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245009900200300001800299506007600317520168200393592002802075506003702103650002602140650000802166650002102174650002702195650002302222650001402245650002702259650001402286650002102300650001402321650001402335650001102349650001502360700002202375700002402397700002202421773010302443856007502546852000902621655001202630IND60531050620221207073117.0160723e20130416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053105062DNAL7 a10.1021/bi40023752doi7 aPMC36709412pmcid7 a235609832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesai, Kevin
K.10aStructures of the Noncanonical RNA Ligase RtcB Reveal the Mechanism of Histidine Guanylylation  ap. 2518-2525.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRtcB is an atypical RNA ligase that joins either 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate or 3′-phosphate termini to 5′-hydroxyl termini. In contrast to typical RNA ligases, which rely on ATP and Mg(II), catalysis by RtcB is dependent on GTP and Mn(II) with ligation proceeding through a covalent RtcB–histidine–GMP intermediate. Here, we present three structures of Pyrococcus horikoshii RtcB complexes that capture snapshots along the entire guanylylation pathway. These structures show that prior to binding GTP, a single manganese ion (Mn1) is bound to RtcB. To capture the step immediately preceding RtcB guanylylation, we determined a structure of RtcB in complex with Mn(II) and the unreactive GTP analogue guanosine 5′-(α-thio)triphosphate (GTPαS). This structure shows that Mn1 is poised to stabilize the pentavalent transition state of guanylylation while a second manganese ion (Mn2) is coordinated to a nonbridging oxygen of the γ-phosphoryl group. The pyrophosphate leaving group of GTPαS is oriented apically to His404 with the ε-nitrogen poised for in-line attack on the α-phosphorus atom. The structure of RtcB in complex with GTPαS also reveals the network of hydrogen bonds that recognize GTP and illuminates the significant conformational changes that accompany the binding of this cofactor. Finally, a structure of the enzymic histidine–GMP intermediate depicts the end of the guanylylation pathway. The ensuing molecular description of the RtcB guanylylation pathway shows that RtcB and classical ATP- and Mg(II)-dependent nucleic acid ligases have converged upon a similar two-metal mechanism for formation of the nucleotidylated enzyme intermediate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPyrococcus horikoshii 3aRNA 3aRNA ligase (ATP) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acatalytic activity 3aguanosine 3aguanosine triphosphate 3ahistidine 3ahydrogen bonding 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3aoxygen 3aphosphates1 aBingman, Craig A.1 aPhillips, George N.1 aRaines, Ronald T.0 tBiochemistry.g2013 Apr. 16, v. 52, no. 15 p.2518-2525dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi40023753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245010600177300001400283520101100297592002801308596004401336650002101380650002601401650002301427650002601450650001801476650001901494650001801513650001701531700001901548700007001567773011701637856008201754852000901836655001201845IND60729925420221117225021.0210304e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072992542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10709-021-00114-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzdemirel, Huseyin Ozgur10aStreptomycin and nalidixic acid elevate the spontaneous genome-wide mutation rate in Escherichia coli  ap. 73-80.  aSince antibiotic resistance is a growing public health problem worldwide, it is important to understand how antibiotics and spontaneous mutations cooperate and shape the genome-wide mutation rate and spectrum. Here, we quantitatively evaluate genome-wide mutational profiles of Escherichia coli after long-term subinhibitory exposure to a broad-spectrum (streptomycin) and a narrow-spectrum antibiotic (nalidixic acid), using a mutation accumulation design combined with whole-genome resequencing of replicate lines as a mutagenicity test. We determined that, while the genome-wide mutation rate is slightly higher in the streptomycin-treated lines compared to the control lines, there is a significant increase in the nalidixic acid-treated lines. Our findings suggest that both broad and narrow-spectrum antibiotics may elevate the mutation rates in E. coli, but mechanisms of action may affect the consequence, thus contribute to accelerating the rate of adaptation and conferring antibiotic resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  aFBB-2017-15738cHacettepe Üniversitesi 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3agenotoxicity tests 3amutation accumulation 3amutation rate 3analidixic acid 3apublic health 3astreptomycin1 aUlusal, Dilara1 aKucukyildirim Celik, Sibel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2241-30600 tGenetica.g2021 Feb., v. 149, no. 1 p.73-80dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl1577x0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-021-00114-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015000167300001600317520175700333592002802090650002502118650001502143650001302158650002502171650001802196650002402214650001502238650001702253650001602270650001202286650002702298650002602325650001302351650001902364650001802383650001502401650002302416650002302439650001102462650001002473700002002483700002702503700001702530773011702547856008102664852000902745655001202754IND60572748920221119092401.0170717e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057274892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-016-9407-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamir, Mohammad10aCactus pear peel snacks prepared by instant pressure drop texturing: Effect of process variables on bioactive compounds and functional properties  ap. 388-400.  aCactus pear (Opuntia ficus-indica) has a growing interest from both food manufacturers and consumers due to its medicinal and functional traits. Peel is a major waste from cactus pear juice industry accounting for about 38 % of the fruit weight. New concept of snacks preparation has been developed using instant controlled pressure drop (Détente instantanée controlee, DIC) techniques that provide a texturing stage between initial and final hot air drying stages. In this study, the application of DIC of cactus pear peel (CPP) was performed to be used as starch-free snacks with functional attributes. DIC resulted in high crispness CPP snacks with improved structural and nutritional attributes as well as high relative expansion ratio (up to 21 times). DIC expanded CPP snacks exhibited cutting force (3.34 N) that was much lower than untreated CPP (19.41 N). It is worth noting that optimized DIC treatment (P = 0.6 MPa for t = 15 s) allowed more availability of phenolic compounds and β-carotene by 83 and 551 %, respectively. In addition, antioxidant activity was increased up to 53 %. Results showed that steam pressure had significant effect on fat and alcohol insoluble solids (AIS) contents, wherein the correlation coefficients revealed critical relationships between structural and biochemical availabilities. Therefore, DIC could be used as an innovative technology to value this by-product leading to manufacture of crispy CPP snacks with high nutritious quality. There was a significant difference among the DIC treated and untreated CPP in respect to sensory properties, DIC treated CPP at operation conditions of saturated steam pressure = 0.6 MPa and processing time = 15 had the highest acceptability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aair drying 3aalcohols 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-carotene 3abioactive compounds 3abyproducts 3acactus pears 3acorrelation 3acutting 3afood processing wastes 3afunctional properties 3ahardness 3ajuice industry 3amanufacturing 3apear juice 3aphenolic compounds 3asensory properties 3asnacks 3asteam1 aElzahar, Khaled1 aRamadan, Mohamed Fawzy1 aAllaf, Karim0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2017 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.388-400dSpringer USx2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-016-9407-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011000207300001100317506007600328520195100404592002802355506003702383650002002420650001302440650002402453650001802477650001402495650002502509650002202534650001102556650001202567650002602579650000902605650001202614700002202626700001902648700002302667700002502690700001602715700002102731773015902752856008102911852000902992655001203001IND60440655520221207093237.0161031e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044065552DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-015-0256-72doi7 aPMC45010612pmcid7 a261693742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosli, Rana H.10aMealtime behavior among siblings and body mass index of 4–8 year olds: a videotaped observational study  ap. 94.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Being a last-born child and having a sister have been associated with higher body mass index (BMI). Encouragement to eat that overrides children’s self-regulation has been reported to increase the risk of obesogenic eating behaviors. This study sought to test the hypothesis that encouragement to eat during mealtime from older siblings and sisters mediates associations of being last-born or having a sister with higher BMI. METHODS: Children aged 4–8 years (n = 75) were videotaped while eating a routine evening meal at home with one sibling present. Encouragement to eat (defined as direct prompts to eat or general positive statements about food) delivered to the index child (IC) from the sibling was coded from the videotape. Path analysis was used to examine associations between IC’s birth order, sibling’s sex, encouragement counts, and IC’s measured BMI z-score (BMIz). RESULTS: Being the younger sibling in the sibling dyad was associated with the IC receiving more encouragements to eat from the sibling (β: 0.93, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.59, 1.26, p < 0.0001). The IC having a sister compared with a brother was not associated with the IC receiving more encouragements to eat from the sibling (β: 0.18, 95 % CI: −0.09, 0.47, p = 0.20). The IC receiving more encouragements to eat from the sibling was associated with lower IC BMIz (β: −0.06, 95 % CI: −0.12, 0.00, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Children were more likely to receive encouragements to eat from older siblings than younger siblings. Being the recipient of encouragements to eat from a sibling was associated with lower, not higher, child BMIz, which may reflect sibling modeling of maternal behavior. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether encouragements to eat from siblings lead to increase in BMI over time. Encouragements from siblings may be a novel intervention target for obesity prevention.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3aeating habits 3aingestion 3alongitudinal studies 3amaternal behavior 3amodels 3aobesity 3aobservational studies 3arisk 3asisters1 aMiller, Alison L.1 aKaciroti, Niko1 aPeterson, Karen E.1 aRosenblum, Katherine1 aBaylin, Ana1 aLumeng, Julie C.0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2015 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.94-94dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-015-0256-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011800178300001600296520104900312592002801361650002001389650001701409650000901426650002201435650001801457650001401475650001501489650001801504650001701522650002601539650001401565650001701579650001501596650001201611650001801623650002501641650001401666650001901680650000901699650001701708650001401725650001401739653001301753653001301766653001401779653001601793653001601809653001201825700002301837700002601860700003801886773010901924856008602033852000902119655001202128IND60533327420221118003802.0190319e20141023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053332742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2014.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMphahlele, Rebogile R.10aPreharvest and postharvest factors influencing bioactive compounds in pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)—A review  ap. 114-123.  aPomegranate fruit is a rich source of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, phenolic acids and vitamin C and are attributed with diverse medicinal properties and health benefits that are highly desirable. Flavonoids, phenolic acids and vitamin C are found mainly in the peel, pith and juice (arils) of the pomegranate. The fruit is commonly consumed as fresh fruit or juice. In addition, the fruit is used in food industry in the manufacture of jellies, concentrates, and flavouring and colouring agents. Pomegranate juice is a rich source of antioxidant, found to be higher than other natural juices and beverages such as green tea and red wine. The stability and concentration of these functional properties are affected by preharvest factors such as cultivar, agro-climatic conditions, maturity, harvest season, irrigation and fertilization and postharvest factors such as storage, packaging and treatments. This review discusses in details the preharvest and postharvest factors influencing the functional properties of pomegranate fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPunica granatum 3aantioxidants 3aaril 3aartificial colors 3aascorbic acid 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3afood industry 3afruit juices 3afunctional properties 3agreen tea 3aharvest date 3airrigation 3ajellies 3amanufacturing 3amedicinal properties 3apackaging 3aphenolic acids 3apith 3apomegranates 3araw fruit 3ared wines 0aCultivar 0aMaturity 0aPackaging 0aPolyphenols 0aPomegranate 0aStorage1 aFawole, Olaniyi A.1 aStander, Marietjie A.1 aOpara, U.

Untreated BGN served as the control. Cooking, physical, chemical, and sensory characteristics were investigated to assess quality. All parboiled‐dried samples cooked significantly (p ≤ .05) faster (43%–86%) than the control. Freeze‐dried samples showed significantly (p ≤ .05) higher L* values than their sun‐ and oven‐dried counterparts, irrespective of parboiling time. Sphericity and aspect ratio significantly (p ≤ .05) reduced with all the drying methods, though insignificantly when parboiling was extended from 45 to 90 min. Pretreated BGN had higher protein but lower antinutrient contents. Mineral leaching was minimal at 45 min parboiling. Parboiled‐dried BGN cooked samples were generally accepted by the panelists as demonstrated by scores of >6 on a 1–9 Hedonic scale. Combined parboiling and (sun‐ or oven‐) drying presents a practicable strategy for BGN farmers/processors to offer an easy‐to‐cook product, potentially storable for later food preparation by consumers. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The study provides a useful strategy to farmers/food industries in their quest to meet the increasing demand of consumers for more convenience foods as opposed to the drudgery associated with the long cooking time of Bambara groundnut. Combined parboiling and drying operations produced Bambara groundnut seeds which cooked 43%–86% faster, and had storable potential for later food preparation. The results from the study may enhance the research efforts in recent times aimed at further promoting the utilization of the crop for better food and nutrition security, particularly in regions where its cultivation is favored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna subterranea 3aantinutritional factors 3afreeze drying 3ahedonic scales 3anutrition1 aAdegbaju, Kikelomo E.1 aAkeem, Sarafa A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5588-76521 aBalogun, Mutiat A.1 aAdediran, Olabanji J.1 aAruna, Tawakalitu E.1 aOnwudinjo, Happiness O.1 aAkintayo, Fadilat M.1 aAdesina, Boluwatife O.1 aOjo, Peter K.1 aKolawole, Fausat L.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.e15351-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.153513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245016100167500001900328500002000347520169800367592002802065650003402093650002202127650001602149650002002165650002702185650001802212650001702230650001902247650001302266650002702279650001302306650001802319650001602337650002502353650001602378700001702394700001802411700003302429700006802462700002402530700002502554700006402579773014402643856007402787852000902861655001202870IND60719868820221120181227.0201208e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071986882DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.148092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShabbir, Muhammad Asim14aThe quality behavior of ultrasound extracted sunflower oil and structural computation of potato strips appertaining to deep‐frying with thermic variations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the impact of Soxhlet extraction and ultrasound‐assisted extraction on the yield and quality parameters of sunflower seeds oil. Ultrasound extraction sunflower oil (UESO) was further opted to frying behavior, which included UESO which was heated without any product (blank sunflower oil, that is, BSO) and UESO, which was used to fry potato strips (sunflower oil with potato strips, that is, SOPS). The free fatty acids and acrylamide content of BSO and SOPS treatments significantly increased, while peroxide value of both treatments decreased with increase in frying temperatures (150, 170, and 190°C). 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity and iodine value significantly decreased during heating process. The fatty acid profile of UESO showed significant changes (p < .05) in saturated fatty acids indicating a decreasing trend of unsaturated fatty acids. Raw potato strips and UESO fried potato strips, were analyzed for structural morphology, textural properties, and oil uptake after frying process. Scanning electron micrographs of the potato strips revealed that they were able to retain their structure, shape, and call wall integrity at temperature as high as 170°C. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, ultrasound‐assisted extraction (UAE) reduced the extraction time, solvent consumption and enhances oil yield. Moreover, UAE retained as the best technology and an effective method which may have major influence for future applications. The findings of this study may be helpful on both personal and commercial scales in selecting the feasible method for extracting oil from various oilseeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aHelianthus annuus 3aacrylamides 3adeep fat frying 3afatty acid composition 3afree radicals 3aiodine value 3aperoxide value 3apotatoes 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asunflower oil 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aAhmed, Waqar1 aLatif, Sumera1 aInam‐Ur‐Raheem, Muhammad1 aManzoor, Muhammad Faisal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3705-02771 aKhan, Moazzam Rafiq1 aBilal, Rana Muhammad1 aAadil, Rana Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0185-00960 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2020 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.e14809-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.148093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245018100164300001600345520168700361592002802048650002202076650001202098650001902110650002002129650001202149650001302161650001402174650003002188650002002218650001602238650002902254650002602283650001702309700002402326700001402350700001702364700002502381773011402406856007402520852000902594655001202603IND60642360520221122154814.0190507e199906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064236052DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029411952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamalingam, Sandhya10aElucidation of the lesions present in the transcription defectivefitA76 mutant ofEscherichia coli: Implication of phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase subunits as transcription factors  ap. 153-162.  aEarlier reports from our laboratory dealt with the identification, mapping and characterization of a temperature sensitive mutant (fitA76) with a primary transcription defect at 42‡C and two of its suppressors (fitA24 andfitB). We report here the cloning and molecular characterization of a 2-1 kb DNA fragment which complemented the Ts phenotype of thefitA76 andfitA24 mutants but not that due to thefitB mutant. Cloning of this fragment in the T7 expression vector pT7.5 revealed the synthesis of a 33 kDa protein. The fragment hybridized with the Kohara phages 322 and 323 whose overlapping regions includepheS,pheT andrplT genes. Nucleotide sequencing showed that the fragment contains the entirepheS gene and the N-terminal portion ofpheT. Although these results implied that thefitA andpheS genes could be one and the same, earlier data had ruled out such a possibility. In order to know whether thefitA76 mutation defines a novel allele ofpheS, thepheS region of thefitA76 mutant was also sequenced, revealing a G → A nucleotide transition at position 293 of the coding region. This lesion is the same as that reported for thepheS5 mutant. However, it is shown that thefitA76 mutant is primarily transcription-defective while thepheS5 mutant is primarily translation-defective. These results suggested that thefitA76 mutant might harbour another mutation, in addition topheS5. In this report, we present genetic evidence for a second mutation (namedfit95) in thefitA76 mutant. Thefit95 by itself confers a Ts phenotype on rich media devoid of sodium chloride. It is proposed that the subunits of phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase could act as transcription factors (Fit) also.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aalleles 3abacteriophages 3agenetic vectors 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aphenylalanine-tRNA ligase 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atransfer RNA1 aMunavar, M.

Natural fermented maize seeds were soaked for variable times (0, 24 and 48 h) and directly decorticated or roasted before milling into flour. Generally during the 24 to 48 h natural fermentation, total sugars (80.3–92.0 g/100 g) and proteins contents (4.0–7.6 g/100 g) decreased while they significantly increased with soaking. Soluble sugars content of the unroasted maize significantly decreased with fermentation while that of roasted maize significantly increased. Reverse observations were made on soluble proteins. The antinutrients (phytates and total polyphenols) contents of the grains as well as the functional properties of their flours were observed to have been significantly changed following fermentation and roasting. In particular the least gelation concentration (6 to 18 g/100 mL), an important reverse index of gelating power significantly increased with fermentation and roasting. As consequence the viscosity of the fermented maize flours were systematically significantly lower than that of the unfermented flour. Generally while the effects of duration of fermentation and roasting on the viscosity were not consistent, the 48 h natural fermented and roasted flour was observed to particularly produce flours of much lower viscosity. This highlighted the positive effect of combining fermentation and roasting to improve the quality of weaning flour made from maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantinutritional factors 3acorn 3acorn flour 3afermentation 3agelation 3amilling 3apasting properties 3apolyphenols 3aproteins 3aroasting 3aseeds 3asoaking 3asugars 3aviscosity 3aweaning1 aNjintang, Yanou Nicolas1 aMbofung, Carl Moses F.0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2017 June, v. 11, no. 2 p.451-459dSpringer USx2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-016-9413-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010200170300001600272500001900288520116400307536043001471592002801901596009701929596011802026650001902144650001402163650000902177650001402186650002002200650002602220650001302246650000902259650001502268650000902283650001702292650002202309653001702331653001602348653001302364653001202377653001402389700001602403700002002419700001902439700002302458700002102481700002402502700002302526773011702549856008502666852000902751655001202760IND60695042720221120110257.0200515e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069504272DNAL7 a10.1080/1343943X.2019.15982722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyagi, Atsuko10aOxalate contents in leaves of two rice cultivars grown at a free-air CO₂ enrichment (FACE) site  ap. 407-411.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRice straw can be used as a feed for livestock. It accumulates soluble oxalate, which is harmful to livestock as it can cause mineral deficiency. It is therefore necessary to reduce the oxalate content in rice leaves so that the usage of rice straw for a livestock feed can be increased. Several oxalate synthesis pathways have been reported in various plants. However, the oxalate synthesis pathway in rice has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we found that the oxalate content of the leaves of two rice cultivars, Koshihikari and Takanari, was different. The differences in the oxalate contents in the leaves of two cultivars were also maintained under the elevated CO₂ concentration and/or temperature conditions. These findings suggest that oxalate accumulation has a genetic basis and does not depend on CO₂ and temperature conditions.

Therefore, exploitation of natural antimicrobials, such as essential oils and bacteriocins etc., is necessary to protect against microbial growth and to prolong the self-life of food commodities. However, facile degradation of these bioactive compounds, along with their low water solubility and unacceptable taste, e.g. in the case of essential oils, pose a great challenge for the food industry. Encapsulation is an innovative and promising approach to overcome these challenges. It ameliorates the stability (physical, chemical, and thermal) of bioactive a compounds as well as provides controlled release and targeted delivery. This review provides valuable insights into the incorporation of encapsulated antimicrobial compounds in diverse range of food formulations, their influence on organoleptic characteristics of food; and their interactions with various components of the food matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural products 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteriocins 3abioactive compounds 3abiopreservatives 3adegradation 3aencapsulation 3aessential oils 3afood industry 3afood matrix 3afood safety 3amicrobial growth 3ataste 3awater solubility 0aEssential oils 0aBacteriocins 0aEncapsulated antimicrobials 0aControlled release 0aNatural preservatives1 aKaur, Lovedeep0 tFood control.g2021 May, v. 123 p.107678-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1076783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002400166245010200190300001400292500001500306520203200321592002802353650001502381650001302396650003302409650001002442650002102452650000902473650002202482650002202504650001502526650002502541651001002566653001602576653001502592653001202607653001702619653001302636653001802649653001802667653003802685700001502723700003002738773010702768856011402875852000902989655001202998IND50065165520221121075711.0151127e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006516552DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2007)18[25:GEOTSR]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Bello, Francesco10aGrazing effects on the species-area relationship: Variation along a climatic gradient in NE Spain  ap. 25-34.  a2019-12-04  aQuestions: Does grazing have the same effect on plant species richness at different spatial scales? Does the effect of spatial scale vary under different climatic conditions and vegetation types? Does the slope of the species-area curve change with grazing intensity similarly under different climatic conditions and vegetation types?Location: Pastures along a climatic gradient in northeastern Spain.Methods: In zones under different regimes of sheep grazing (high-, low-pressure, abandonment), plant species richness was measured in different plot sizes (from 0.01 to 100 m²) and the slope of the species-area curves was calculated. The study was replicated in five different locations along a climatic gradient from lowland semi-arid rangelands to upland moist grasslands.Results: Species richness tended to increase with grazing intensity at all spatial scales in the moist upland locations. On the contrary, in the most arid locations, richness tended to decrease, or remain unchanged, with grazing due to increased bare soil. Grazing differentially affected the slope (z) of the species-area curve (power function S == c Aᶻ) in different climatic conditions: z tended to increase with grazing in arid areas and decrease in moist-upland ones. ββ-diversity followed similar pattern as z.Conclusions: Results confirm that the impact of grazing on plant species richness are spatial-scale dependent. However, the effects on the species-area relationship vary under different climatic conditions. This offers a novel insight on the patterns behind the different effects of grazing on diversity in moist vs. arid conditions reported in the literature. It is argued that the effect of spatial scale varies because of the different interaction between grazing and the intrinsic spatial structure of the vegetation. Variations in species-area curves with grazing along moisture gradients suggest also a different balance of spatial components of diversity (i.e. αα- and ββ-diversity).Nomenclature: Bolòòs et al.

In this study, the enhancement effect of Ca-based additives on sludge P transformation to hydroxylapatite through pyrolysis was systematically investigated. Three Ca-based additives were added in the pyrolysis of SS, and they were found to promote the conversion of sludge P to hydroxylapatite, which is bioavailable to plants. The characterization of the sludge-derived pyrochars indicated that the addition of 10% CaO, 5% Ca(OH)₂, or 10% Ca₃(PO₄)₂ facilitated peak hydroxylapatite production. The thermodynamic simulation of the production of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis showed that these additives increased the enthalpy of the pyrolysis system. Furthermore, the pyrolysis with CaO addition had the lowest enthalpy, thereby suggesting that the addition of CaO during sludge pyrolysis was preferable for recovering sludge P in the form of hydroxylapatite. Moreover, the hydroxylapatite produced with these additives was unstable when the pyrolysis temperature was above 900 °C. The pot experiment demonstrated the feasibility using the sludge-derived pyrochars as P fertilizer for plant growth. Therefore, changing the Ca form and/or Ca/P ratio with the addition of Ca-based additives could be an effective strategy for reclaiming P from SS in the form of hydroxylapatite, and this demonstrates a pathway for global P sustainability by recycling P from P-abundant wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acalcium oxide 3aenthalpy 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant growth 3apyrolysis 3aresearch 3asewage sludge 3atemperature 3awater 0aSewage sludge pyrolysis 0aPhosphorus transformation 0aCa-based additives 0aHydroxylapatite 0aP sustainability1 aTang, Siqi1 aYan, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9603-29681 aZhang, Zuotai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3580-60180 tWater research.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 171 p.115450-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.1154503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100001700173245017100190300001600361520128100377592002801658650002901686650002301715650001101738650001501749650001401764650001301778650000901791650001801800650001001818650001201828650000901840650001801849650001001867650001501877650002201892650002401914650001001938650001201948650002101960650002101981650001102002650002402013650001302037650000902050650002702059650004102086650002002127700001802147700001802165700001902183773011702202856005502319852000902374655001202383IND50065397420221116160937.0130422e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006539742DNAL7 a229286332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2012.01040.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYODER, J.

Arrestment activity in response to guanine was lower than that in response to natural excreta, indicating the presence of other active ingredients in natural excreta. The selective removal of appendages was used to establish the important roles played by the palps and the front pair of legs in the detection of the pheromone. Reaction to chemically pure guanine at varying concentrations occurred without a dose response; thus only the presence of guanine, not a critical amount, is required to induce assembly. Higher speed and intensity of clustering occurred at 33% relative humidity (RH). We conclude that female adults of R. sanguineus are more prone to assemble under dry conditions that match the arid microhabitats preferred by this species and that this tendency allows this tick to reside in human dwellings and dog kennels that maintain standards of comfort at 30–50% RH. Cleaning or removing tick excreta‐covered surfaces on which ticks aggregate from within and around human dwellings may prove useful as a means of interfering with the establishment of off‐host clusters of R. sanguineus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aactive ingredients 3aadults 3aappendages 3abioassays 3acleaning 3adogs 3adose response 3afeces 3aguanine 3alegs 3amicrohabitats 3apalps 3apheromones 3arelative humidity 3aresidential housing 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aGuaninexmetabolism 2aHumidity 2aMale 2aPheromonesxmetabolism 2aRhipicephalus sanguineusxphysiology 2aSocial Behavior1 aJAJACK, A.

The central position in a complex regulatory network is occupied by the protein FT, which acts as a florigen. We found that light, following a permissive period of darkness, was essential to induce the floral promoter CrFTL1 and to initiate flowering in seedlings of the short-day plant Chenopodium rubrum L. We also identified two novel CONSTANS-like genes in C. rubrum and observed their rhythmic diurnal and circadian expressions. Strong rhythmicity of expression suggested that the two genes might have been involved in the regulation of photoperiod-dependent processes, despite their inability to complement co mutation in A. thaliana. The CrCOL1 and CrCOL2 genes were downregulated by dark–light transition, regardless of the length of a preceding dark period. The same treatment activated the floral promoter CrFTL1. Light therefore affected CrCOL and CrFTL1 in an opposite manner. Both CrCOL genes and CrFTL1 displayed expression patterns unique among short-day plants. Chenopodium rubrum, the subject of classical physiological studies in the past, is emerging as a useful model for the investigation of flowering at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChenopodium rubrum 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 0aChenopodium rubrum 0aCONSTANS-like 0aflowering 0aFLOWERING LOCUS T-like 0agene expression 0alight sensitivity 0ashort-day plant.1 aCháb, David1 aKolář, Jan,1 aHaškovcová, Kateřina1 aŠtorchová, Helena0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2014 May, v. 65, no. 8 p.2137-2146dOxford University Press [etc.]wJournal:jnl44658x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008100158300001800239520116400257592002801421650001401449650002201463650001101485650002501496650001601521650001401537650001401551650002201565650002501587650002801612650001701640650002101657651001001678700001501688700001901703700001601722700001901738773012101757856007401878852000901952655001201961IND60626953320221122224444.0190128e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062695332DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra08284g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shoujiang10aPurification and rapid dissolution of potassium sulfate in aqueous solutions  ap. 2156-2161.  aWater soluble potassium sulfate dissolves rapidly and completely in water. Its main characteristics are purity and dissolution rate. In this study, the purification and rapid dissolution of potassium salt (K₂SO₄) separated from potassium brine deposits collected from Lop Nur basin of China (referred to as LN K₂SO₄) were studied for utilization in agricultural farming as a potash fertilizer. First, the dissolving-crystallizing process was conducted to remove the insoluble content and improve the purity of K₂SO₄. Second, physical modification of K₂SO₄ surfaces was accomplished based on the Noyes–Whitney equation. The results showed that the water insoluble content could be completely removed and the purity of K₂SO₄ reached 100% in the purification process. The dissolution rate was significantly improved with the help of environmentally-friendly additives such as sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP)/urea phosphate (UP). These additives ameliorated the diffusion coefficient (D) and the diffusion layer thickness (h) for K₂SO₄. Results also demonstrated that a larger K₂SO₄ surface area (S) induced a higher dissolution rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aaqueous solutions 3abasins 3aconventional farming 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3apotassium 3apotassium sulfate 3apurification methods 3asodium tripolyphosphate 3asurface area 3awater solubility 3aChina1 aSun, Kaige1 aZhao, Yunliang1 aNie, Guihua1 aSong, Shaoxian0 tRSC advances.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 9, no. 4 p.2156-2161dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08284g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245009500208300002000303506007600323520135600399592002801755506003701783650000801820650002001828650001701848650001101865650001601876650001501892650002901907700002001936700002801956773017601984856008302160852000902243655001202252IND4481156320221207094342.0120502e20111011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448115632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11082681082doi7 aPMC31932152pmcid7 a219695362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheffer, Margot P.10aEvidence for short-range helical order in the 30-nm chromatin fibers of erythrocyte nuclei  ap. 16992-16997.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChromatin folding in eukaryotes fits the genome into the limited volume of the cell nucleus. Formation of higher-order chromatin structures attenuates DNA accessibility, thus contributing to the control of essential genome functions such as transcription, DNA replication, and repair. The 30-nm fiber is thought to be the first hierarchical level of chromatin folding, but the nucleosome arrangement in the compact 30-nm fiber was previously unknown. We used cryoelectron tomography of vitreous sections to determine the structure of the compact, native 30-nm fiber of avian erythrocyte nuclei. The predominant geometry of the 30-nm fiber revealed by subtomogram averaging is a left-handed two-start helix with approximately 6.5 nucleosomes per 11 nm, in which the nucleosomes are juxtaposed face-to-face but are shifted off their superhelical axes with an axial translation of approximately 3.4 nm and an azimuthal rotation of approximately 54°. The nucleosomes produce a checkerboard pattern when observed in the direction perpendicular to the fiber axis but are not interdigitated. The nucleosome packing within the fibers shows larger center-to-center internucleosomal distances than previously anticipated, thus excluding the possibility of core-to-core interactions, explaining how transcription and regulation factors can access nucleosomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aerythrocytes 3agenome 3anucleosomes 3atomography 3atranscription (genetics)1 aEltsov, Mikhail1 aFrangakis, Achilleas S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Oct. 11, v. 108, no. 41 p.16992-16997dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11082681083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194072000900203100001700212245012400229300001600353500002400369520133500393650002801728650003101756650002601787650002001813650002601833650002201859650001801881650002001899650002501919650002201944650002401966650001501990650003002005651001802035651001802053651002002071651001102091651001202102653002802114700002002142700002102162700002002183700001602203700001902219773013702238852000902375856006902384856011102453930003302564945002502597946001302622655001202635IND4376390920221119071707.0051201e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437639092DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2005)098[0395:GEFTSO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF851 0aK510 0aL200 0aL001 0aL7001 aAustin, J.W.10aGenetic evidence for the synonymy of two Reticulitermes species: Reticulitermes flavipes and Reticulitermes santonensis  ap. 395-401.  aIncludes references  aBy applying the 16S rRNA mitochondrial marker to 434 populations of Reticulitermes termites from North, Central, and South America; France; and Germany with other locations around the world that we have analyzed, identical DNA sequence data were obtained from Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) in North America and Germany and for Reticulitermes santonensis Feytaud from undisturbed (nonurban) forested locations in western France. We also discovered identical DNA sequence data from previously unidentified Reticulitermes specimens from South America and Easter Island. Haplotypes F, M, and GG were observed in France; haplotype F in Germany; and haplotype GG was found on Easter Island, Santiago, Chile, and Montevideo, Uruguay. All of these haplotypes are found in numerous states within the continental United States. In light of their well documented morphological, chemical, and phylogenetic relationships, coupled with this new data that directly link these disjunct groups, R. flavipes and R. santonensis should be synonymized. Compared with other studies that largely suggest phyletic similarities, this is the first study that specifically matches haplotypes from North America (where populations of R. flavipes are endemic) with populations in Europe (where R. flavipes, described as R. santonensis, is presumed exotic). 3aReticulitermes flavipes 3aReticulitermes santonensis 3asubterranean termites 3ainsect taxonomy 3amolecular systematics 3amitochondrial DNA 3aribosomal DNA 3agenetic markers 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3apopulation genetics 3ahaplotypes 3ageographical distribution 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 3aCentral America 3aFrance 3aGermany 0amolecular sequence data1 aSzalanski, A.L.1 aScheffrahn, R.H.1 aMessenger, M.T.1 aDronnet, S.1 aBagneres, A.G.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2005 May, v. 98, no. 3 p.395-401dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ann/3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2005)098%5B0395:GEFTSO%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20060112b20060202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/12/07  aOther US 7aarticle03342naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245015000164520205700314592002802371650001902399650002502418650001302443650001202456650001502468650002502483650003502508650001802543650002002561650001202581650001702593650001202610651001102622700002002633700002602653700002002679700003202699773011902731856007302850852000902923655001202932IND60742567020221120225043.0210624e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074256702DNAL7 a10.3390/f120607092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanišić, Mirjana,10aClimate Change Governance in Forestry and Nature Conservation in Selected Forest Regions in Serbia: Stakeholders Classification and Collaboration  aClimate change, with various economic, environmental and social consequences, is one of the greatest challenges faced by society. Climate change governance in forestry and nature conservation includes developing joint activities and collaboration among stakeholders that combine different interests, influences and competences at national, regional and local levels. This research aims to classify climate change stakeholders within the forestry and nature conservation sectors in Serbia. They are classified according to their interests and perceived influences. We analyze factors impacting the development of different areas for the collaboration by combining stakeholder analysis and social network analysis. A total of 103 representatives of civil society and public sector organizations in forestry and nature conservation at different governance levels with expertise in climate change participated in the survey. The results show that most civil sector organizations are distributed in the ‘subject’ quadrant with lower perceived influence and are not well interconnected. Seven different areas for the collaboration were identified, with disconnected stakeholders and limited representation and mostly peripheral position of civil society organizations (except in the case of the area for the collaboration through workshop and seminars knowledge exchange). The analyzed factors have different positive and negative effects on the development of the different areas for the collaboration, with the frequency of contacts standing out as a significant factor of collaboration at the level of the whole collaboration network. There is a strong indication of a centralized, top-down approach to climate change governance in forestry and nature conservation in Serbia. Multilevel and horizontal stakeholder governance is needed to achieve effective implementation of strategic climate-change policy commitments. The most important step to achieve such a structure is the empowerment of local-level organizations in climate change collaboration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental policy 3aforestry 3aforests 3agovernance 3ainformation exchange 3anatural resources conservation 3apublic sector 3asocial networks 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3aSerbia1 aLovrić, Marko 1 aNedeljković, Jelena 1 aNonić, Dragan 1 aPezdevšek Malovrh, Špela 0 tForests.g2021 May 30, v. 12, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120607093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014100166500001900307520171500326592002802041650002102069650001502090650001902105650002502124650001302149650001302162650001002175653004102185653003202226653001902258700001502277700001702292700001702309773009702326856008502423852000902508655001202517IND60679926020221119173059.0200318e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067992602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.1154522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xiafei14aThe growth process of the cake layer and membrane fouling alleviation mechanism in a MBR assisted with the self-generated electric field  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe electric field assisted membrane bioreactor (MBR) is an effective technique to alleviate membrane fouling. In this study, the spontaneous electric field was introduced into the MBR to observe the growth process of cake layer on the membrane surface. The external resistance for spontaneous electric field MBR (S-50) and S-500 were 50 Ω and 500 Ω respectively. During the experiments, S-50 maintained the highest electric field intensity of 11.83 mV/cm. The reduction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content in activated sludge, transmembrane pressure (TMP) growth rate reached 52.8% and 51.7% respectively. After 28 days operation, S-50 obtained the minimum contaminant specific biovolume (23.316 μm³/μm²), which was 68.2% lower than that of it in Control-MBR. The metal oxide or metal hydroxide were distributed in the cake layer. EPS played a significant role in the formation and growth of the cake layer. Based on the results obtained in this study, the growth of the biofouling layer on the membrane surface could be divided into three stages. EPS first deposited on the membrane surface, and then microorganisms embedded in the cake layer to form clusters. After that, EPS and total cells further increased and led to a faster biovolume growth rate. Subsequently, the biovolume growth rate decreased in the cake layer. The spontaneous electric field delayed the deposition of EPS on the membrane surface. The produced H₂O₂ and •OH were beneficial to the degradation of organics, causing the smaller contaminant biovolume on the membrane surface. This work aims to provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of the electric field to control membrane fouling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiofouling 3aelectric field 3amembrane bioreactors 3apolymers 3aresearch 3awater 0aSpontaneous electric field intensity 0aMembrane fouling mitigation 0aGrowth process1 aLi, Xiufen1 aHua, Zhaozhe1 aRen, Yueping0 tWater research.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 171 p.115452-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.1154523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01358naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245010400169300002000273520037200293592002800665650002300693650002700716650000900743700003300752700001600785700002000801700001600821773013600837856007400973852000901047655001201056IND60660297520221122005721.0190823e20140826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066029752DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc05794e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 a               Ueji, Kan10aThermally activated polymorphic transition from a 1D ribbon to a 2D carpet: squaric acid on Au(111)  ap. 11230-11233.  aPolymorphic transition from the 1D ribbon to the 2D carpet superstructure of squaric acid molecules on Au(111) was achieved through a thermally activated process.

It is shown that the specific surface obtained corresponds to what is known for the CNT, taking into account their treatments (freeze-drying, high temperature evacuation, etc.).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3afreeze drying 3amixing 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aDevillers, S.1 aSeffer, J.-F.1 aNagy, J.B.1 aMekhalif, Z.1 aDelhalle, J.0 tCarbon.g2011 Aug., v. 49, no. 9 p.2935-2943dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014000158300002000298520030500318592002800623650001200651650001900663650001300682650001400695650001100709650001900720700002000739700002000759700001500779700001800794700002300812700001800835773013600853856007500989852000901064655001201073IND60659097620221121185221.0190827e20111011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065909762DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc14662a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIde, Yūsuke,10aSunlight-induced efficient and selective photocatalytic benzene oxidation on TiO₂-supported gold nanoparticles under CO₂ atmosphere  ap. 11531-11533.  aThe sunlight-induced photocatalytic oxidation of aqueous benzene on TiO₂-supported gold nanoparticles was considerably improved when the reaction was conducted under a CO₂ atmosphere. 13% yield and 89% selectivity of phenol was obtained on P25-supported gold nanoparticles under 230 kPa of CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acarbon dioxide 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis1 aNakamura, Naoya1 aHattori, Hideya1 aOgino, Ryo1 aOgawa, Makoto1 aSadakane, Masahiro1 aSano, Tsuneji0 tChemical communications.g2011 Oct. 11, v. 47, no. 41 p.11531-11533dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc14662a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015400173500001900327520172300346592002802069650005002097650001302147650001202160650001702172650001502189650001302204650001902217650001702236650001302253650002002266650001202286650001302298650001002311653001202321653002702333653003002360700001502390700002002405700002102425773011102446856008502557852000902642655001202651IND60679926320221119173158.0200228e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067992632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.1154552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Abraham S.C.10aRemoving arsenic and co-occurring contaminants from drinking water by full-scale ion exchange and point-of-use/point-of-entry reverse osmosis systems  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the performance of two full-scale ion exchange (IX) systems, one point-of-entry (POE) reverse osmosis (RO) system and nine point-of-use (POU) RO units for simultaneous removal of arsenic and several co-occurring contaminants from drinking water. The study was performed as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Arsenic Treatment Demonstration Program. The IX systems, with strong base anionic (SBA) resins, effectively removed arsenic (As), nitrate (NO₃⁻) and uranium (U) to below respective maximum contaminant levels and vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo) to below 2 μg/L. The useful run length, as determined by either 10-mg/L (as N) nitrate or 10-μg/L arsenic breakthrough, was approximately 400 bed volumes (BV) initially. However, it was decreased over time, e.g., by 15% in 13 months at one site and 33% in 7 months at another site, apparently caused by resin fouling due to the presence of 2-mg/L natural organic matter (NOM) in source waters. The use of dual resins ‒ an acrylic SBA resin underlain by a polystyrene SBA resin ‒ effectively removed NOM and allowed the system to perform at its baseline level through the 13-month study. Arsenic and nitrate peaking occurred when the resins were not regenerated timely. The removal of contaminants appeared to follow a selectivity sequence: U, Mo > V > SO₄²⁻ > HAsO₄²⁻ > NO₃⁻ > HCO₃⁻. RO effectively removed arsenic, nitrate, antimony, uranium and vanadium, mostly with a >99% rejection rate. The POE RO coupled with dual plumbing (only treating a fraction of water for potable use) and POU RO in individual homes could be used as low-cost alternatives to traditional RO treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3aion exchange 3amolybdenum 3anitrates 3aorganic matter 3apolystyrenes 3aresearch 3areverse osmosis 3auranium 3avanadium 3awater 0aNitrate 0aNatural organic matter 0aCo-occurring contaminants1 aWang, Lili1 aSorg, Thomas J.1 aLytle, Darren A.0 tWater research.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 172 p.115455-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.1154553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002500168245010700193300001600300520113900316592002801455650002001483650001001503650001301513650001501526650001901541650001001560650001001570650004901580650004801629650001301677650001101690650001101701650001601712650002601728650003001754650002201784653001301806653001801819653001501837653001901852653002201871653001601893653001201909653002101921700002601942700002001968773009401988856008402082852000902166655001202175IND50060272520221122033121.0190318e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006027252DNAL7 a230636052pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendieta-Tan, Agueda10aWomen’s experiences of using drugs in weight management. An interpretative phenomenological analysis  ap. 220-225.  aThis study examines the experiences of women using drugs in weight management. Whilst some of the commonly used substances have been deemed to be safe, most, if not all, still have potentially dangerous side effects for the individual. Five women spoke of their experiences of using drugs in weight management through semi-structured interviews. These were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Three themes arose from the analysis: the challenges of weight management, the appealing aspects of drug use and emotion and control. Findings revealed that participants believed they need to be thin in order to be happy and they found weight management difficult due to a variety of internal and external aspects. Drug use was seen as an easier and guaranteed way to manage weight. Participants felt that the use of substances for the purpose of weight management was erroneous with shame attached to it, and yet, drugs helped them to feel in control of their lives, their weight and also acted as a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3adrugs 3aemotions 3ainterviews 3aweight control 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAnti-Obesity Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxdrug therapy. 2aEmotions 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdrug therapy 2aWeight Lossxdrug effects 2aWomenxpsychology 0aDrug use 0aSubstance use 0aDiet pills 0aSlimming pills 0aWeight management 0aWeight loss 0aObesity 0aEating disorders1 aHulbert-Williams, Lee1 aNicholls, Wendy0 tAppetite.g2013 Jan. 01, v. 60 p.220-225dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245012400182300001800306520128700324592002801611650001601639650001301655650001901668650001801687650001601705650003701721700002901758700002301787700002401810700001901834700002401853773008001877856008401957852000902041655001202050IND60092214420221119132024.0141103e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009221442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez-Santos, M. Beatriz10aComplementary X-ray scattering and high resolution imaging of nanostructure development in thermally treated PBO fibers  ap. 2960-2970.  aStructural changes in poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) derived carbon fibres (CFs), treated in the range 900°C⩽T⩽2700°C, are investigated by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), and by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). SAXS detects rough interfaces within the fibres, normal to the fibre axis and belonging to a fibril structure. HRTEM and SAXS also reveal nanometre-sized elongated voids spaced semi-regularly along the fibre axis. With increasing temperature, longitudinal packing becomes denser and the broad reflections in the WAXS region sharpen into the reflections characteristic of graphite. Preferential axial orientation of the graphitic layers is due to the internal fibril structure of the fibre, which itself is governed by the draw axis of the parent PBO fibre and improves substantially on going from 2400°C to 2700°C. In-plane reflections in the parallel direction are well resolved, demonstrating tri-periodic ordering within the graphitic sheets (“true” graphitization, with hkl reflections in place of the hk bands of bi-periodic turbostratic carbons). This study of PBO-based CFs is the first detailed analysis of the nanostructural changes that occur during the graphitization process of 1D carbons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3agraphene 3aimage analysis 3ananomaterials 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMartínez-Alonso, Amelia1 aTascón, Juan M.D.1 aRouzaud, Jean-Noël1 aGeissler, Erik1 aLászló, Krisztina0 tCarbon.g2011 Aug., v. 49, no. 9 p.2960-2970dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2011.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011700155300001800272520155600290592002801846650001601874650001501890650002401905650002101929650001801950650001601968650001301984650001001997650002002007650003602027650001802063650001302081650002102094650001502115650002002130700001902150700001502169700001902184700001702203700001702220700002002237700001402257700001402271700001402285700001702299700001602316700001302332700001702345700002302362773012602385856007402511852000902585655001202594IND60639988320221121230713.0190503e20170717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063998832DNAL7 a10.1039/c7gc00571g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHummel, M.10aPhase-out-compliant fluorosurfactants: unique methimazolium derivatives including room temperature ionic liquids  ap. 3225-3237.  aExpedient alkylations of 1-methyl-3H-imidazole-2-thione, a pharmaceutical active ingredient available in bulk quantities, provide high yield access to numerous protonated, or quaternized imidazoliums with chemospecific attachment of the fluoroponytail at the 2-mercapto functionality. The deprotonated primary target products represent valuable nitrogen heterocyclic bases, capable of further substitution, and salt or complex formation. Specific physicochemical characteristics that are relevant for phase and surface responsive behavior, e.g. critical micelle concentration, oleophobicity, depression of the aqueous surface tension, foam formation, emulsification of microgranular PTFE, are investigated for selected representatives and compared to the properties of common fluorosurfactants and ionic liquids. Remarkably, it is found that halogen bonding between iodide counterions of respective polyfluoroalkylmethimazolium systems and 1-iodoperfluoroalkanes, serving as the σ-hole partner of the halides, greatly affect the solubility profile of the resulting molecular adducts. Single-crystal X-ray structure determinations are carried out across the new fluorous substance classes. Strikingly, the helical arrangement of fluorine atoms along the chains typically encountered in polyfluorinated compounds is not found as the prevailing conformation. Rather, they are outnumbered by structural motifs exhibiting the rare zig-zag (linear alkane-like) chain conformation. Key derivatives are also subjected to preliminary ecotoxicological testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aalkylation 3aambient temperature 3achemoselectivity 3aecotoxicology 3aemulsifying 3afluorine 3afoams 3agreen chemistry 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3aionic liquids 3amicelles 3aperfluorocarbons 3asolubility 3asurface tension1 aMarkiewicz, M.1 aStolte, S.1 aNoisternig, M.1 aBraun, D.

Until now the aetiological agent, Neoparamoeba perurans, has not been amenable to in vitro culture and therefore Koch’s postulates could not be fulfilled. The inability to culture the amoeba has been a limiting factor in the progression of research into AGD and required the maintenance of an on-going laboratory-based infection to supply infective material. Culture methods using malt yeast agar with sea water overlaid and subculturing every 3–4days have resulted in the establishment of a clonal culture of N. perurans, designated clone 4. Identity of the amoeba was confirmed by PCR. After 70days in culture clone 4 infected Atlantic salmon, causing AGD, and was re-isolated from the infected fish. Diagnosis was confirmed by histology and the infectious agent identified by PCR and in situ hybridisation using oligonucleotide primers and probes previously developed and specific to N. perurans. This study has fulfilled Koch’s postulates for N. perurans as a causative agent of AGD and illustrates its free-living and parasitic nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmoeba 3aSalmo salar 3aagar 3aclones 3afarmed fish 3agills 3agrowers 3ahistology 3ain situ hybridization 3ain vitro culture 3amalt 3aoligonucleotide probes 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asalmon 3aseawater 3ayeasts 2aAmebiasisxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aAmoebozoaxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Protozoanxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFish Diseasesxparasitologyxpathology. 2aGillsxparasitologyxpathology. 2aHistocytochemistry 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSalmo salarxparasitology 3aAustralia 0aAustralia1 aBridle, A.R.1 aCadoret, K.1 aNowak, B.F.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2012 May 1, v. 42, no. 5 p.511-515dElsevier Ltdx0020-75197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245007400212300001500286506007600301520139600377592002801773506003701801650001501838650001701853650002301870650001301893650001101906650001101917650001101928650001701939650001201956650001101968650001501979653003101994653002702025653001702052653001402069653000802083653001402091653000902105653000902114653001502123653001402138653001602152653001802168653002302186653000902209653001602218700002402234700001902258700002302277700001902300700003102319773011102350856008402461852000902545655001202554IND60633261420221207081817.0190410e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063326142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.02.0152doi7 aPMC66854242pmcid7 a308263992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez, Gustavo A.10aHuman neural crest induction by temporal modulation of WNT activation  ap. 99-106.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe developmental biology of neural crest cells in humans remains unexplored due to technical and ethical challenges. The use of pluripotent stem cells to model human neural crest development has gained momentum. We recently introduced a rapid chemically defined approach to induce robust neural crest by WNT/β-CATENIN activation. Here we investigate the temporal requirements of ectopic WNT activation needed to induce neural crest cells. By altering the temporal activation of canonical WNT/β-CATENIN with a GSK3 inhibitor we find that a 2 Day pulse of WNT/β-CATENIN activation via GSK3 inhibition is optimal to generate bona fide neural crest cells, as shown by their capacity to differentiate to neural crest specific fates including peripheral neurons, glia, melanoblasts and ectomesenchymal osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes. Although a 2 Day pulse can impart neural crest character when GSK3 is inhibited days after seeding, optimal results are obtained when WNT is activated from the beginning, and we find that the window of competence to induce NCs from non-neural ectodermal/placodal precursors closes by day 3 of culture. The reduced requirement for exogenous WNT activation offers an approach that is cost-effective, and we show that this adherent 2-dimensional approach is efficient in a broad range of culture platforms ranging from 96-well vessels to 10 cm dishes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipocytes 3achondrocytes 3acost effectiveness 3aectoderm 3aethics 3ahumans 3amodels 3aneural crest 3aneurons 3asowing 3astem cells 0aHuman embryonic stem cells 0aPluripotent stem cells 0aNeural crest 0aSignaling 0aWNT 0aCHIR99021 0aCHIR 0aGSK3 0aOsteoblast 0aAdipocyte 0aChondrocyte 0aSmooth muscle 0aPeripheral neurons 0aGlia 0aMelanocytes1 aPrasad, Maneeshi S.1 aSandhu, Nabjot1 aShelar, Patrick B.1 aLeung, Alan W.1 aGarcía-Castro, Martín I.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 May 15, v. 449, no. 2 p.99-106dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012100166520145900287592002801746650001601774650001801790650001801808650001501826650001501841650001701856650002601873650002001899650002601919650001801945650002901963650002001992650002502012650000702037650001402044650001102058653002502069653002402094653001002118653001702128653001602145700002902161700002202190700002102212700006202233700002802295700002502323700002002348700006202368700005702430773011802487856008202605852000902687655001202696IND60755907520221117215538.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075590752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaid, Olfa Ben10aEnhanced pilot bioremediation of oily sludge from petroleum refinery disposal under hot-summer Mediterranean climate  aLarge pilot scale bioremediation approaches were implemented for the treatments of oily sludge (OS) characterised by alkaline pH (pH > 9), high concentration of metals (3% dry weight) and high total petroleum hydrocarbons content (TPH) rangingbetween 22,000 and 67,300 mg kg ⁻¹ from a Tunisian petroleum refinery. The treatments included bioaugmentation and biostimulation approaches with autochthonous isolated bacterial strains and consortia. Chemical, microbial, and ecotoxicological analyses were performed over a period of 180 days incubation. The bioremediation treatments favoured the development of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes following an ecological succession of specialist bacterial groups, first associated to hydrocarbon degradation (e.g. Marinobacter and Alcanivorax) that resulted in a greater extent of TPH-degradation (up to 80%), and the selection of metal resistant bacteria including Hyphomonas, Phaeobacter, and Desulfuromusa. The best performances were obtained when bioaugmentation and biostimulation were combined. Over 90% of the TPH initial concentration was degraded over 180 days, which was accompanied with a 3-fold reduction of ecotoxicity. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of large pilot scale bioremediation of highly contaminated oily sludge, providing the evidence that the management of autochthonous microbial communities is of paramount importance for the success of the bioremediation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcanivorax 3aBacteroidetes 3aDesulfuromusa 3aFirmicutes 3aHyphomonas 3aMarinobacter 3aMediterranean climate 3abioaugmentation 3aecological succession 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental technology 3ametal tolerance 3aoil and gas industry 3apH 3apetroleum 3asludge 0aBacterial consortium 0aIllumina sequencing 0aMetal 0aHydrocarbons 0aEcotoxicity1 aCravo-Laureau, Cristiana1 aArmougom, Fabrice1 aCipullo, Sabrina1 aKhelil, Meriem Ben1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8608-16701 aYahiya, Marouen Ben Haj1 aDouihech, Abdeljabar1 aBeyrem, Hamouda1 aCoulon, Frédéric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4384-32221 aDuran, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2351-85530 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.102037-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006200165300001800227520124500245592002801490650001901518650001801537650001501555650002101570650001401591650001801605650001501623650002201638650001601660650001301676650001201689650002401701650001801725650002001743651001201763651001901775700001801794700002401812700002001836773010801856856008201964852000902046655001202055IND60578881020221119222535.0170814e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057888102DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-01-17-0082-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Meng-Jun10aInvestigation of Potential Causes of Peach Skin Streaking  ap. 1601-1605.  aPeach skin streaking is a previously undescribed skin discoloration affecting red-blush peach cultivars in Georgia and South Carolina. Streaked peach fruit have been observed in the field close to harvest. The cause of streaking is still unknown but one hypothesis is that atmospheric pollutants may be involved. The goal of this study was to establish proof of concept that commonly found air pollutants can produce streaks on peach skin similar to those observed in commercial orchards and investigate the susceptibility of peach fruit during maturation. Common reactive byproducts of atmospheric pollutants, including sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), nitric acid (HNO₃), and hypochlorite acid (HCl), at concentrations up to 10 μg/ml did not produce streaking under field conditions when applied at week 3, 2, and 1 prior to commercial harvest. However, sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) in the form of Clorox solution and chlorine dioxide (ClO₂) at 100 μg/ml generated from the Aquamira water treatment solution produced streaking symptoms on detached peach fruit under controlled conditions and in the field. Peach fruit were most susceptible to streaking closest to harvest, suggesting that NaClO and ClO₂ interfere with pigment formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3abyproducts 3achlorine dioxide 3acultivars 3adiscoloration 3aharvesting 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitric acid 3aorchards 3apeaches 3asodium hypochlorite 3asulfuric acid 3awater treatment 3aGeorgia 3aSouth Carolina1 aPeng, Congyue1 aMelgar, Juan Carlos1 aSchnabel, Guido0 tPlant disease.g2017 Sept., v. 101, no. 9 p.1601-1605dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-01-17-0082-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245016800187300001800355520194400373592002802317650002102345650002002366650002402386650002302410650002102433650001102454650001702465650001502482650003102497650002102528650002502549650003402574650001202608650001702620650004502637650003802682650003402720650001802754650002202772650002002794650001902814650002402833653003102857653001402888653002702902653001002929653000902939700001402948700001802962700001502980773008402995856008403079852000903163655001203172IND60088344920221118171531.0160901e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008834492DNAL7 a237068602pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.01.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaonan10aEffects of nanosized titanium dioxide on the physicochemical stability of activated sludge flocs using the thermodynamic approach and Kelvin probe force microscopy  ap. 3947-3958.  aThe wide application of nanosized titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) will result in high concentrations of the molecule in the aquatic environment, especially in the influent of wastewater treatment plants. The present study focuses on the potential effect of nano-TiO2 on the physicochemical stability of activated sludge flocs after long-term exposure, on which limited information is currently available. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was innovatively applied to assess the surface potential of the activated sludge in situ. The physicochemical characteristics of the bioflocs with and without long-term exposure to nano-TiO2 were well elucidated by the thermodynamic approach. The results showed that the repulsive force predominated the bioflocs system as the concentration of nano-TiO2 increased, owing to the corresponding increase in the density of the negative charge. The bioflocs exposed to 100 ppm nano-TiO2 presented the strongest stability compared to the other two samples with low concentrations of nano-TiO2, which also indicated that the bioflocs with long-term exposure to nano-TiO2 had a low settlement efficiency of the corresponding activated sludge. Further, the extended Derjaugin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek (XDLVO) theory was used to explore the flocculation stability of the bioflocs system. As the concentration of nano-TiO2 increased, the ΔGiwiLWattraction (the van der Waals interaction) and the effective Hamaker constant decreased, the ΔGiwiEL(the electrostatic double-layers interaction) increasingly contributed to the interfacial repulsion, the ΔGiwiAB(the Lewis acid–base interaction) also exhibited a repulsive contribution to the total interaction energy and the ΔGiwiTOT (the total free energy of interaction) exhibited a repulsive contribution. These results are the keys for interpreting the adverse effects of nano-TiO2 on the activated sludge flocs of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadverse effects 3aaquatic environment 3abiofloc technology 3achronic exposure 3aenergy 3aflocculation 3amicroscopy 3aphysicochemical properties 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aFlocculation 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Forcexmethods 2aNanoparticlesxultrastructure 2aParticle Size 2aSewagexchemistry 2aSurface Tension 2aThermodynamics 2aTitaniumxchemistry 0aNanosized titanium dioxide 0aStability 0aActivated sludge flocs 0aXDLVO 0aKPFM1 aCui, Fuyi1 aGuo, Xiaochun1 aLi, Dapeng0 tWater research.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 47 p.3947-3958dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.01.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245016400166300001400330520165600344592002802000650002702028650002802055650002502083650002002108650001702128650001902145650001102164650001502175650001002190650001402200650001202214650001102226650001502237650001902252650001902271650001102290650001602301650001202317650001302329650001402342650001302356650001502369650001602384650001002400650002002410650001102430651001602441700001902457700001902476700001602495773007802511856008402589852000902673655001202682IND4463921720221118044958.0141110e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446392172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2011.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWearing, C.H.10aEcology and management of the leafroller (Tortricidae) complex over ten years during establishment of an organic pipfruit orchard in Central Otago, New Zealand  ap. 82-93.  aThe ecology and management of leafroller pests (Tortricidae) in a newly-planted organic pipfruit orchard at the Clyde Research Centre, Central Otago, New Zealand were studied from 1991 to 2001. Adults were monitored with pheromone traps and fermented molasses bait traps, and immature stages and their damage by sampling vegetative shoots, fruit clusters, and harvested fruits. The dominant pest species was Epiphyas postvittana, followed by Planotortrix octo, and minor damage was caused by Ctenopseustis obliquana and Pyrgotis plagiatana. The major leafroller species are bivoltine in the region, with generations well synchronised. High damage (>30%) was expected under organic management but did not eventuate, with only 0.3–2.6% of harvested fruit being damaged on standard cultivars, which received regular fungicide sprays, with no trend of increasing damage over time. Disease-resistant cultivars, which received minimal or no fungicide sprays, suffered damage at harvest of 0.8–9.4%, which similarly did not increase over time. Population sampling from 1994 to 1998 indicated high larval mortality, including major parasitism by the braconid Dolichogenidia tasmanica, but with scope for further parasitoids known to be present in Otago but not yet present in this young orchard. The standard apple and pear cultivars ‘Fuji’ and ‘Taylor's Gold’ regularly suffered harvest damage >2%, which is a problem for exports to some markets. Sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis against the larvae of the first generation on these cultivars were only partially successful in protecting the crop.

Nerve and wound epidermis have great impacts on this regeneration. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to play roles in the regeneration of amphibian tails and limbs. In this study, a bi-phasic up-regulation of HDAC1 was noted before early differentiation stage of axolotl limb regeneration. Limb regeneration was delayed in larvae incubated with an HDAC inhibitor MS-275. Local injection of MS-275 or TSA, another HDAC inhibitor, into amputation sites of the juveniles did not interfere with wound healing but more profoundly inhibited local HDAC activities and blastema formation/limb regeneration. Elevation of HDAC1 expression was more apparent in wound epidermis than in mesenchyme. Prior denervation prohibited this elevation and limb regeneration. Supplementation of nerve factors BMP7, FGF2, and FGF8 in the stump ends after amputation on denervated limbs not only enabled HDAC1 up-regulation but also led to more extent of limb regeneration. In conclusion, nerve-mediated HDAC1 expression is required for blastema formation and limb regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphibians 3aamputation 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahistone deacetylase 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alimbs (animal) 3anerve tissue 3atissue repair 0aAxolotl 0aHistone deacetylases 0aLimb regeneration 0aNerve 0aWound epidermis1 aWu, Cheng-Han1 aHuang, Ting-Yu1 aSung, Hung-Wei1 aChiou, Ling-Ling1 aLin, Shau-Ping1 aLee, Hsuan-Shu0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 May 15, v. 449, no. 2 p.122-131dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245006400188300001800252520095400270592002801224650001601252650001201268650000901280650001301289650001801302650000901320650001201329650003501341650003801376650002601414651001201440651001201452653001001464653000901474653001501483653001901498700001901517773010901536856008401645852000901729655001201738IND50087244520221122042037.0150325e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008724452DNAL7 a237823522pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2013.8010862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKostiainen, E.10aArtificial radioactivity of Finnish vegetables in the 2000s  ap. 1316-1321.  aA survey on long-lived artificial radionuclides ¹³⁷Cs and ⁹⁰Sr in vegetables produced in Finland was carried out in 2009–2010.

All organizations in private and public sectors produce not only desirable (good) but also undesirable (bad) outputs as a result of their economic activities. The proposed use of DEA determines the level of unified (operational and environmental) efficiency of all the organizations. A contribution of this study is that it explores how to measure not only RTS (Returns to Scale) on desirable outputs but also a new concept regarding “DTS: Damages to Scale” (corresponding to RTS for undesirable outputs). This study discusses how to measure RTS under natural disposability and DTS under managerial disposability by DEA. The measurement of RTS and DTS is formulated by incorporating “Strong Complementary Slackness Conditions (SCSCs)”. As a result, this study can handle an occurrence of multiple reference sets and multiple projections in the RTS/DTS measurement. The incorporation of SCSCs makes it possible both to restrict DEA multipliers in a specific range without any prior information and to identify all possible efficient organizations as a reference set. Using the unique capabilities of SCSCs, this study discusses the use of DEA environmental assessment by exploring how to classify the type of RTS/DTS with SCSCs. Such analytical capabilities are essential, but not previously explored in DEA environmental assessment for energy industries. As an illustrative example, this study applies the proposed approach for the performance evaluation of Japanese manufacturing industries. This study finds that these firms need to introduce technology innovation to reduce an amount of greenhouse gases and wastes. The empirical result confirms the importance of measuring RTS/DTS in DEA environmental assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy industry 3aenvironmental assessment 3agreenhouse gases 3amanufacturing 3amultipliers 3awastes 3aJapan1 aGoto, Mika0 tEnergy economics.g2012 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.1422-1434dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2012.06.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245013700165500002000302520217200322592002802494596004502522596005502567596006002622596007302682596007402755596002402829650001502853650002502868650001702893650002502910650001802935650002702953650002002980650001503000650001303015650001503028650001903043650002003062650001703082650002003099650001303119651001003132700005403142700002303196773014403219856007403363852000903437655001203446IND60674683820221121095349.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468382DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.142062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Muhammad Saeed14aThe effect of geographic variation on chemical composition, antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities of Morus alba L. polysaccharides  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMorus alba L. is an edible fruit with multiple medical function. To reveal the geographic variation pattern of polysaccharide content in the mulberry fruits and its antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities, the fruit samples were collected and analyzed from seven geographic locations throughout the distribution areas in China. The polysaccharide content in the mulberry fruits ranged from 4.13 ± 0.04% to 1.07 ± 0.07%. All the polysaccharides derived from mulberry fruit showed certain antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities with a significant variation. Significant differences were observed among polysaccharide content, antioxidant activity, and sunshine hours, but no clear geographical or polysaccharide content variation patterns were observed for hypoglycemic activity. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the annual average sunshine hours was significantly correlated to the polysaccharide content and antioxidant activity. According to the polysaccharide contents and bioactivities, certain natural populations of M. alba L. such as Xinjiang, Hunan, and Anhui were recommended for food and medical use in future. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Morus alba L. belonging to the family Moraceae, is cultivated across an extensive range of geographical, climatic, and soil conditions. Polysaccharides from mulberry fruit have been proved to have the function of enhancing immunity, antiaging, anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and hypoglycemic effects with no toxic record in clinic. It has been reported that the phytochemicals accumulation in plants is greatly affected by genetic, climatic, and harvesting factors during the growing period. We revealed the geographic variation pattern of polysaccharide content in the mulberry fruits and its antioxidant activity. Based on the polysaccharide contents and bioactivities, certain natural populations of M. alba L. such as Xinjiang, Hunan, and Anhui were recommended for food and medical use in future. The information obtained by this study could be useful for the selection of natural populations with adequate polysaccharide content, as well as high food and medical use for M. alba L.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0400703cNational Key R&D Program  a2018M643092cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a201907010035cGuangzhou Science and Technology Programm  a201803050001cGuangzhou Science Technology and Innovation Commission  a2016GJ001cScience & Technology Planning Project of Nansha, Guangzhou  aB17018c111 Project 3aMorus alba 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3achemical composition 3aedible fruits 3ageographical variation 3aglycemic effect 3aharvesting 3aimmunity 3amulberries 3aphytochemicals 3apolysaccharides 3asoil quality 3asolar radiation 3atoxicity 3aChina1 aChen, Chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2178-14381 aFuehrer, Bernhard,0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14206-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.142063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245011800187300001800305520126800323592002801591650001901619650001501638650001301653650001001666650001701676650002001693650003801713650002101751650001901772650001101791650002201802650001301824650001501837650001201852650002701864650001501891650001201906650001801918650001201936650003601948650003801984650003202022650002302054650003102077653003102108653001202139653001802151653001002169653002502179653001602204700001902220700001802239773010902257856008402366852000902450655001202459IND50087244620221122051014.0150325e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008724462DNAL7 a237899182pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2013.8010872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNamee, S.E.10aSimultaneous immunochemical detection of four banned antibiotic growth promoters in raw and cooked poultry tissue  ap. 1270-1278.  aSpiramycin, tylosin, bacitracin and virginiamycin are among a group of antibiotic growth promoters that have been banned in the European Union since the 1999 Council. This was due to concerns over the development of resistant bacteria emerging between humans and animals with the threat of antibiotics no longer being able to be used effectively to treat human infections. A sensitive and fast immunochemical method is presented for the determination of these four antibiotic growth promoters simultaneously in poultry tissue. The method employs methanol extraction followed by sample clean-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) with determination by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). The limit of detection (LOD) was less than 1 ng g ⁻¹ and the detection capability (CCβ) was 3 ng g ⁻¹ or less for all four antibiotic growth promoters. Validation was completed with both raw and cooked chicken, therefore either matrix could be used for the monitoring of these banned drugs. In a feeding trial no residues of either bacitracin or virginiamycin were found in medicated birds even without a withdrawal period. In the case of tylosin and spiramycin much higher residues level were detected immunochemically than was the case by mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abacitracin 3abacteria 3abirds 3acooked foods 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agrowth promotion 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3apoultry 3asolid phase extraction 3aspiramycin 3atylosin 3avirginiamycin 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGrowth Substancesxanalysis 2aLimit of Detection 2aPoultry Productsxanalysis 0aantibiotic growth promoter 0apoultry 0afood analysis 0aELISA 0asimultaneous testing 0afood safety1 aCunningham, R.1 aElliott, C.T.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2013 July 1, v. 30, no. 7 p.1270-1278dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2013.8010873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245011300216520145400329592002801783650001701811650002901828650001201857650004301869650001001912650001501922650001201937650001101949650002801960650001701988650003302005650001302038650001502051650001602066650002502082650001602107653002902123653002502152653001802177653001602195700006202211700006602273700006402339700006902403700007402472700002702546773011802573856008202691852000902773655001202782IND60755907920221118013432.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075590792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñiz-Márquez, Diana B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8070-119410aEffect of ultrasound on the extraction of ellagic acid and hydrolysis of ellagitannins from pomegranate husk  aIn this study, an ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of ellagic acid (EA) from pomegranate husk was studied according to a central composite design (CCD) matrix and analyzed under response surface methodology (RSM). Effect of several factors such as temperature (26–93 °C), sonication time (4–55 min), concentration of solvent (aqueous ethanol, 24%–75%), and solid–liquid ratio (3–16​ g/mL) were evaluated. EA yield was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and then CCD model was validated. The best extraction conditions were at 93.60 °C of extraction temperature for 55.23 min using 75.23 % of aqueous ethanol and liquid/solid ratio of 3.27 mL/g of vegetal material obtaining a recovery of EA of 19.47 mg/g. In addition, four experiments were conducted to evaluate the extent to which the individual impact of sonication and temperature on EA extraction from pomegranate husk. A positive effect combined both factors was observed. On the other hand, the results could suggest that UAE has no effect on purified ellagitannins hydrolysis under conditions used in this study, indicating that increase in the EA yield is attributed only to the cell rupture. The optimal conditions of EA extraction from pomegranate husk established in this research could be applicable in the food and pharmaceutical industry due to the UAE method presents many advantages in comparison with conventional technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aellagic acid 3aenvironmental technology 3aethanol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahulls 3ahydrolysis 3aliquids 3amodels 3apharmaceutical industry 3apomegranates 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3asonication 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aAlternative technologies 0aNatural antioxidants 0aEllagitannins 0aPomegranate1 aWong-Paz, Jorge E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5866-26781 aAguilar-Zárate, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7983-90221 aSepúlveda, Leonardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2596-83011 aBuenrostro-Figueroa, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5314-98241 aAscacio-Valdés, Juan Alberto,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6595-863X1 aAguilar, Cristóbal N.0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.102063-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008900165300001800254520079500272592002801067650001101095650002001106650001101126650001601137650001401153700001901167773009201186856008301278990002301361852000901384655001201393IND60096693220221123040933.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009669322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2012.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qingfu10aJump spillovers in energy futures markets: Implications for diversification benefits  ap. 1447-1464.  aIn this paper, we investigate jump spillover effects of five energy (petroleum) futures and their implications for diversification benefits. In order to identify the latent historical jumps for each of these energy futures, we use a Bayesian MCMC approach to estimate a jump-diffusion model for each. We examine the simultaneous jump intensities of pairs of energy futures and the probabilities that jumps in crude oil (and natural gas) cause jumps or usually large returns in other energy futures. In all cases, we find significant evidence that the diffusion-jump process is a better characterization for energy futures prices. We further find that jump spillovers significantly reduce the diversification benefits of an energy futures portfolio in a tranquil (rather than crisis) period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afutures trading 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apetroleum1 aTu, Anthony H.0 tEnergy economics.g2012 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.1447-1464dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2012.06.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245009600202520106200298592002801360650001501388650002101403650001501424650002101439650002901460650001601489650001301505650001401518650000701532650001701539650002701556650001101583650001601594650000901610650001601619650002201635653002301657653002801680653001001708653002201718653002401740653002301764700001601787700001601803700001501819700001801834700001601852700001601868773011801884856008202002852000902084655001202093IND60755908020221117215530.0220103e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075590802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Huali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8907-171510aDeveloping a new controlled-release KMnO[formula omitted] for groundwater DNAPL remediation  aControlled release material (CRM) is an emerging oxidant delivery technique for in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) to solve the problems of contaminants rebound, backflow and wake in groundwater remediation. In this paper, the potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) was used as the main oxidant, paraffin as the carrier, and to enhance the permeability and adsorption quartz sand and activated carbon were added to make a new type CRM. By comparing the trichloroethylene (TCE) remediation efficiency, it was found that the optimal mass ratio of the CRM with KMnO₄: paraffin: quartz sand: activated carbon is 2:10:10:2. Under the groundwater environment with lower temperature, lower pH, lower dissolved oxygen (DO), the new CRM provide longer release time. At the same time the higher the flow rate, the higher the permeability of the medium, the faster the release rate of the new CRM. The absorption of the medium may also influence the CRM release rhythm. The current work demonstrates the potential and better DNAPL remediation in groundwater of the new CRM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental technology 3agroundwater 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apH 3apermeability 3apotassium permanganate 3aquartz 3aremediation 3asand 3atemperature 3atrichloroethylene 0aControlled release 0aGroundwater remediation 0aDNAPL 0aContaminated site 0aIn situ remediation 0aChemical oxidation1 aLu, Jiqiang1 aWu, Liguang1 aWang, Ting1 aLiu, Zhengwen1 aWang, Cheng1 aYan, Kaixin0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Nov., v. 24 p.102064-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1020643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04062naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245017800171300001800349520182900367536041802196592002802614650001402642650001602656650000902672650002002681650001702701650001802718650001402736650002002750650000902770650002202779650001602801650001402817650002502831650001802856653001202874653001802886653002002904653001402924653003102938653003002969653001802999653001803017700002003035700002403055700001703079700002303096700002503119700002103144700001503165700002403180700001603204773014503220856008603365852000903451655001203460IND60769088020221119052725.0220819e20220312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908802DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.18487862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassey, Chizoba10aImpact of home food production on nutritional blindness, stunting, wasting, underweight and mortality in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials  ap. 1856-1869.  aVitamin A deficiency is highly prevalent and remains the major cause of nutritional blindness in children in low-and middle-income countries, despite supplementation programmes. Xeropthalmia (severe drying and thickening of the conjunctiva) is caused by vitamin A deficiency and leads to irreversible blindness. Vitamin A supplementation programmes effectively reduce vitamin A deficiency but many rural children are not reached. Home food production may help prevent rural children’s vitamin A deficiency. We aimed to systematically review trials assessing effects of home food production (also called homestead food production and agricultural interventions) on xeropthalmia, nightblindness, stunting, wasting, underweight and mortality (primary outcomes). We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL and trials registers to February 2019. Inclusion of studies, data extraction and risk of bias were assessed independently in duplicate. Random-effects meta-analysis, sensitivity analyses, subgrouping and GRADE were used. We included 16 trials randomizing 2498 children, none reported xerophthalmia, night-blindness or mortality. Home food production may slightly reduce stunting (mean difference (MD) 0.13 (z-score), 95% CI 0.01 to 0.24), wasting (MD 0.05 (z-score), 95% CI −0.04 to 0.14) and underweight (MD 0.07 (z-score), 95% CI −0.01 to 0.15) in young children (all GRADE low-consistency evidence), and increase dietary diversity (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34). Home food production may usefully complement vitamin A supplementation for rural children. Large, long-duration trials with good randomization, allocation concealment and correct adjustment for clustering are needed to assess effectiveness of home food production on nutritional blindness in young children.  aThis work was carried out as part of a self-funded PhD (CB).

A Box–Behnken experimental design was used to optimize the OD conditions with respect to physicochemical and chromatic parameters, and mechanical properties of Nopal pads. Factors studied were: Three concentrations of sucrose (30, 40, and 50°Brix), calcium lactate (1, 2, and3%), and immersion time (1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 hr). Results showed that sucrose concentration and immersion time were the variables with higher influence. Quality properties mentioned before and the final mineral content of the dried samples (at 60°C for 48 hr) were analyzed. The combined drying (OD + HAD) reduced the moisture content in the range of 23% to 30% compared to HAD alone. It was found that the optimization of OD allowed preserving the quality properties, being a good alternative to give an added value for dried Nopal pads. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Nopal has important bioactive properties for both humans and animal diets, since it is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and fibers. However, the main problem of its production is that post harvesting waste is greater than 50%. For this reason, there is a great interest to study inexpensive preservation methods that allow keeping the main attributes of processed fruits. The osmotic dehydration (OD) and the hot air drying (HAD) are two simple and inexpensive techniques which can be applied by both the food industry and small‐scale food producers. In the present study, the optimization of OD as a pretreatment before HAD was a reliable tool to preserve the quality properties of Nopal pads.  aPublisher supplied data  aPNAIYAV 1130033cInstituto de Tecnología Agropecuaria  aA17T06cUADE 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aair drying 3abioactive properties 3acalcium 3adiet 3aexperimental design 3afood industry 3afruits 3aharvesting 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3amechanical properties 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aosmotic treatment 3asucrose 3avitamins 3awastes 3awater content1 aSancho, Ana María1 aBarrio, Yanina1 aRosito, Pablo1 aGozzi, Marta Sofía1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8961-230X0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14183-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.141833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245012700200300001600327520131700343592002801660596007901688596006901767650001501836650002401851650001001875650001601885650002001901650002201921650001301943650000901956650002201965650001501987650001702002700001502019700001402034700001402048700001602062700001402078700001702092773014502109856008202254852000902336655001202345IND60683273020221119200005.0200207e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068327302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-019-02284-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9986-877110aSmartphone colorimetric determination of hydrogen peroxide in real samples based on B, N, and S co-doped carbon dots probe  ap. 861-870.  aIn this paper, we report the use of a smartphone and B, N, and S co-doped carbon dots (BNS-CDs) as a promising peroxidase mimic to quantify hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). The synthesized BNS-CDs exhibited excellent peroxidase-like activity to catalyze the reaction of the chromogenic substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with H₂O₂ to generate a blue oxide product (ox-TMB) with maximum absorption at 652 nm. Steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrated that the BNS-CDs showed much higher affinity than natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for H₂O₂ due to their small size and larger specific surface area. A smartphone colorimetric readout device was employed to record the RGB (red green blue) value of the ox-TMB solution via the Android application Color Grab for quantitative detection. A good linear relationship (R² = 0.9970) between the H₂O₂ concentration and |R-Rbₗₐₙₖ| value was obtained in the range of 3–30 μM with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.8 μM. The current method was successfully applied to determine H₂O₂ in mouthwash and milk with recoveries of 92.70–108.30%. The developed assay is a promising portable detection platform for H₂O₂ with good sensitivity and selectivity, simple operation, fast response, and low cost.

The most important role of packaging is to ensure the highest quality and safety of packaged products and to extend their shelf life. Given that microbiological contamination is a problem for manufacturers and consumers due to the fact that it reduces the quality of packaged products and poses a health risk, this work describes solutions related to antimicrobial packaging. More attention is given to antioxidant packaging that releases synthetic or natural antioxidants to prevent food oxidation. The purpose of intelligent packaging is to monitor the quality of food products, as well as inform consumers and food producers of their quality. Therefore, many studies focus on developing time temperature indicators. The work also discusses radio frequency identification (RFID), whose application has a lot of advantages, such as identifiability, management of stored products, labor cost savings and ensuring the quality and safety of packaged products. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The current trends related to food safety and the growing expectations of the consumers lead to changes in the approach to food packing. Active and intelligent packaging has been present on the global packaging market for years, and scientists all over the world are looking for novelties related to this kind of packaging. For these reasons, this work focuses on presenting new solutions in active and intelligent packaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial packaging 3aantioxidants 3acost effectiveness 3afood industry 3afood packaging 3afood safety 3afoods 3ahealth effects assessments 3alabor 3amarkets 3aoxidation 3aradio frequency identification 3ashelf life 3astored products 3atemperature1 aPrzekop, Robert1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7355-58030 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14194-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.141943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001800170245012400188300001500312520159200327592002801919650001901947650001601966650002601982650001702008650001802025650000902043650001002052650001302062650001302075650001302088650001002101650001302111650001202124650001102136650001602147650001102163650001802174650001202192650001502204650001402219650001002233650001702243650001702260650002002277650002402297650001302321650004802334650001302382650004102395650002002436650001302456650003602469650001502505700001902520700002102539700001502560700002202575700001902597700001602616700002402632700002302656773007702679856008702756852000902843655001202852IND4473217320221120192032.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447321732DNAL7 a223702212pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRohloff, Jens10aMetabolite profiling reveals novel multi-level cold responses in the diploid model Fragaria vesca (woodland strawberry)  ap. 99-109.  aWinter freezing damage is a crucial factor in overwintering crops such as the octoploid strawberry (Fragaria×ananassa Duch.) when grown in a perennial cultivation system. Our study aimed at assessing metabolic processes and regulatory mechanisms in the close-related diploid model woodland strawberry (Fragaria vescaL.) during a 10-days cold acclimation experiment. Based on gas chromatography/time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC/TOF-MS) metabolite profiling of three F. vesca genotypes, clear distinctions could be made between leaves and non-photosynthesizing roots, underscoring the evolvement of organ-dependent cold acclimation strategies. Carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, photosynthetic acclimation, and antioxidant and detoxification systems (ascorbate pathway) were strongly affected. Metabolic changes in F. vesca included the strong modulation of central metabolism, and induction of osmotically-active sugars (fructose, glucose), amino acids (aspartic acid), and amines (putrescine). In contrast, a distinct impact on the amino acid proline, known to be cold-induced in other plant systems, was conspicuously absent. Levels of galactinol and raffinose, key metabolites of the cold-inducible raffinose pathway, were drastically enhanced in both leaves and roots throughout the cold acclimation period of 10days. Furthermore, initial freezing tests and multifaceted GC/TOF-MS data processing (Venn diagrams, independent component analysis, hierarchical clustering) showed that changes in metabolite pools of cold-acclimated F. vesca were clearly influenced by genotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria vesca 3aacclimation 3aamino acid metabolism 3aantioxidants 3aaspartic acid 3acold 3acrops 3adiploidy 3afreezing 3afructose 3agases 3agenotype 3aglucose 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aoverwintering 3aproline 3aputrescine 3araffinose 3aroots 3aspectroscopy 3astrawberries 2aAcclimatization 2aCold-Shock Response 2aDiploidy 2aFragariaxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFreezing 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aMetabolome1 aKopka, Joachim1 aErban, Alexander1 aWinge, Per1 aWilson, Robert C.1 aBones, Atle M.1 aDavik, Jahn1 aRandall, Stephen K.1 aAlsheikh, Muath K.0 tPhytochemistry.g2012 May, v. 77 p.99-109dElsevier Ltdx0031-94227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245007700204500001400281506007600295520149200371592002801863506003701891650001701928650001001945650001601955650001101971700002601982700002402008700002302032700002602055700001802081773012002099856007402219852000902293655001202302IND60676989420221207125553.0191122e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067698942DNAL7 a10.3390/ani91109732doi7 aPMC69126382pmcid7 a317395872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeeming, Laura  E.14aThe Development of a Hoof Conformation Assessment for Use in Dairy Goats  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe assessment of hoof conformation is important due to its recognized relationship with the biomechanical functionality of the hoof. Hoof conformation can be assessed using objective measures or subjective scores. However, to date, there are limited data using either method in dairy goats. Therefore, the aims were to (1) develop a reliable method of assessing hoof conformation in dairy goats, and (2) compare two aspects of a subjective assessment against corresponding objective measures as a means of validation. A total of 1035 goats contributed photographs across 16 commercial dairy goat farms. Photographs were taken of the left front and left hind hoof in the lateral and dorsal aspect at five assessments across the goats&prime; first two lactations. Hoof conformation was assessed using five subjective scores (toe length, heel shape, fetlock shape, claw splay, and claw shape) and two objective measures (toe length ratio and claw splay distance). Following the training of two observers, high levels of inter and intra-reliability were achieved for both the subjective scores (>0.8 weighted kappa) and objective measures (>0.8 Lin&prime;s concordance correlation coefficient). Two aspects of the subjectively assessed ordinal scores were compared with the objective measures with high levels of accuracy (>0.8). This suggests that the subjective scores may be a suitable alternative to more time-consuming objective measures when assessment is completed using photographs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomechanics 3aclaws 3adairy goats 3ahooves1 aBeausoleil, Ngaio J.,1 aStafford, Kevin J.,1 aWebster, James  R.1 aStaincliffe, Maryann 1 aZobel, Gosia 0 tAnimals.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani91109733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010100174300001600275500001900291520183700310592002802147650001302175650002902188650001102217650001202228650000902240650001302249650002702262650001302289650001702302650001402319650001902333650002102352650000902373650001102382650001402393650001102407653002002418653003202438653002002470653001702490700001802507700001902525773014502544856008302689852000902772655001202781IND60707044720221119165827.0200812e20200318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070704472DNAL7 a10.3159/TORREY-D-19-00038.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbrecht, Matthew A.10aSeed germination traits in the rare sandstone rockhouse endemic Solidago albopilosa (Asteraceae)  ap. 172-184.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding how temperature and other environmental cues influence germination traits can aid in the conservation and management of rare plant species. We examined the germination niche of the narrow endemic Solidago albopilosa, a perennial herb restricted to sandstone rockhouses in the southeastern United States. We experimentally subjected seeds to varying lengths of cold stratification, incubation temperatures, photoperiods, and seasonal temperature cycles that simulated current ambient temperatures and a climate warming scenario. Seeds exhibited conditional physiological dormancy and germinated at greater proportions following chilling than when fresh in all temperatures and light regimes tested. In seasonal temperature cycles that simulate those after seed dispersal in late autumn, seeds began germinating after 9 wk in late-winter temperatures (February), with peak germination occurring in early spring (March). Germination timing shifted 1 wk earlier in the spring with climate warming, but germination proportions did not differ among treatments. Buried seeds did not persist to the second germination season (spring), suggesting minimal carryover among years. Seed viability declined in the smallest (< 50 stems) populations but varied less among sites with different levels of human disturbance. A germination niche defined by conditional physiological dormancy, a minimal chilling requirement, dark germination, seasonal germination cueing, and low persistence in the soil is consistent with the expectation of a perennial herb from a stable habitat, but diverges in some aspects from seed traits found in Solidago species of grasslands and open habitats. These results suggest that dormancy or germination do not limit seed regeneration in most natural populations nor contribute to S. albopilosa's rarity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolidago 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3aclimate 3acold 3adormancy 3agermplasm regeneration 3ahabitats 3arare species 3asandstone 3aseed dispersal 3aseed germination 3asoil 3aspring 3aviability 3awinter 0aclimate warming 0aphysiological seed dormancy 0aRed River Gorge 0arockshelters1 aDell, Noah D.1 aLong, Quinn G.0 tJournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2020 Mar. 18, v. 147, no. 2 p.172-184dTorrey Botanical SocietywJournal:jnl55516x1940-06167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159/TORREY-D-19-00038.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04262naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100005900187245008600246300001600332520203000348592002802378596004702406596004502453596004902498596003002547650002402577650002002601650002102621650001302642650002402655650003002679650001302709650001002722650002602732650002102758650001502779650001302794650001502807650002302822650002202845650002302867650001502890650000902905650001502914650001102929650002202940650002102962650001002983650002502993650001303018651001303031653001703044653002103061653002203082653002403104653002003128653004003148653002003188700002403208700002203232700002003254700002603274773014803300856008303448852000903531655001203540IND60751301020221119000641.0211213e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075130102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2021.08.0092chorus7 a10.1016/j.rama.2021.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonde, David W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8112-005X10aAvifauna Assemblages in Sand Shinnery Oak Shrublands Managed with Prescribed Fire  ap. 164-174.  aSand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) shrublands are estimated to have once occupied 5−7 million ha across the southwestern United States. As a result of herbicide and plowing, this endemic vegetation community has been significantly reduced in extent. Further, sand shinnery oak shrublands were historically maintained by relatively frequent fires, but recent fire suppression has resulted in substantial changes in plant community composition and structure where this vegetation type remains. Few studies have been conducted to determine wildlife species composition and richness in remaining sand shinnery oak shrublands and how management practices, such as fire, may influence species occurrence. In this study, we conducted breeding bird surveys in an intact sand shinnery oak shrubland managed with prescribed fire in western Oklahoma to describe the breeding bird assemblage and evaluate the effects of prescribed fire on species abundance. We found the breeding bird community varied along a gradient of sites with high tree/tall shrub density to more open sites dominated by grasses and sand shinnery oak. Bird species richness increased with higher tree/tall shrub densities and declined with greater cover of grasses, shrubs, and bare ground. The 10 most common bird species displayed a range of responses to prescribed fire. Species such as northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) had their greatest relative abundance in recently burned patches, and species such as painted bunting (Passerina ciris) and Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii) were most abundant in patches that were > 36 mo post fire, with many of the remaining species having peak abundance in intermediate times since fire. Our findings show prescribed fire can be used to create a diversity of vegetation structure that provides habitat for multiple shrubland and grassland bird species. However, factors such as tree density and precipitation may influence the response of bird species to prescribed fire.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  cOklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station  cOklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation  cOklahoma State University 3aColinus virginianus 3aPasserina ciris 3aQuercus havardii 3aSpizella 3aThryomanes bewickii 3aadministrative management 3aavifauna 3abirds 3abotanical composition 3afire suppression 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aherbicides 3aindigenous species 3aplant communities 3aprescribed burning 3arangelands 3asand 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3aspecies abundance 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3avegetation structure 3awildlife 3aOklahoma 0aBiodiversity 0aCassin's Sparrow 0aNorthern Bobwhite 0aOccupancy Modelling 0aprescribed fire 0aQuercus havardii, sand shinnery oak 0atime since fire1 aCarroll, J.

This is because both affect the medium’s porosity as well as mass transport parameters and flow paths. We address this challenge by means of a multiscale model. At the pore scale, the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is used to solve differential equations describing particularly the bacteria’s and the nutrient’s development. Likewise, a sticky agent tightening together solid or bio cells is considered. This is combined with a cellular automaton method (CAM) capturing structural changes of the underlying computational domain stemming from biomass development and solid restructuring. Findings from standard homogenization theory are applied to determine the medium’s characteristic time- and space-dependent properties. Investigating these results enhances our understanding of the strong interplay between a medium’s functional properties and its geometric structure. Finally, integrating such properties as model parameters into models defined on a larger scale enables reflecting the impact of pore scale processes on the larger scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiomass 3aequations 3afunctional properties 3ageometry 3ahomogenization 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aporosity 3aporous media 3awater resources 0aSoil structure 0aBiomass development 0aTransport properties 0aMathematical modeling 0aCellular automaton 0aMultiscale methods1 aRupp, Andreas1 aPrechtel, Alexander0 tAdvances in water resources.g2017 Sept., v. 107 p.393-404dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010100167300001600268520147000284592002801754650001601782650001001798650001001808650002201818650000901840650001001849650001501859650003001874650001201904650000901916650001101925650001401936650001401950650001401964650001301978650001101991653002202002653000802024653003102032653001402063653002102077700001602098700002102114700002402135700002102159700002602180773011302206856008402319852000902403655001202412IND60633262220221122054031.0200210e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063326222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, Rebecca10aPharmacological restoration of visual function in a zebrafish model of von-Hippel Lindau disease  ap. 226-234.  aVon Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder, characterised by hypervascularised tumour formation in multiple organ systems. Vision loss associated with retinal capillary hemangioblastomas remains one of the earliest complications of VHL disease. The mortality of Vhl⁻/⁻ mice in utero restricted modelling of VHL disease in this mammalian model. Zebrafish harbouring a recessive germline mutation in the vhl gene represent a viable, alternative vertebrate model to investigate associated ocular loss-of-function phenotypes. Previous studies reported neovascularisation of the brain, eye and trunk together with oedema in the vhl⁻/⁻ zebrafish eye. In this study, we demonstrate vhl⁻/⁻ zebrafish almost entirely lack visual function. Furthermore, hyaloid vasculature networks in the vhl⁻/⁻ eye are improperly formed and this phenotype is concomitant with development of an ectopic intraretinal vasculature. Sunitinib malate, a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor, market authorised for cancer, reversed the ocular behavioural and morphological phenotypes observed in vhl⁻/⁻ zebrafish. We conclude that the zebrafish vhl gene contributes to an endogenous molecular barrier that prevents development of intraretinal vasculature, and that pharmacological intervention with sunitinib can improve visual function and hyaloid vessel patterning while reducing abnormally formed ectopic intraretinal vessels in vhl⁻/⁻ zebrafish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abrain 3aedema 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aeyes 3agenes 3agerm cells 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amarkets 3amice 3amodels 3amortality 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3atyrosine 3avision 0aVon Hippel-Lindau 0aVHL 0aRetinal neovascularisation 0aZebrafish 0aSunitinib malate1 aAli, Zaheer1 aSlater, Kayleigh1 aReynolds, Alison L.1 aJensen, Lasse D.1 aKennedy, Breandán N.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 457, no. 2 p.226-234dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008000167300001600247500001900263520077800282592002801060650001401088650002201102650001401124650001201138650002101150650001401171650000701185650001501192650001301207650001401220650000901234651001201243653001901255653002201274653002201296653001901318653002301337653001801360653001901378773014401397856008301541852000901624655001201633IND60707044920221119165857.0200812e20200518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070704492DNAL7 a10.3159/TORREY-D-19-00045.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWyatt, Robert10aCorydalis flavula and Nemophila aphylla in Georgia: Ecological observations  ap. 185-189.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFollowing removal of thickets of the invasive nonnative Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense Lour.), two rare winter annuals, Corydalis flavula (Raf.)

Moreover, these sites in Clarke County were more than 100 km from the few previously known localities of the species in Georgia. Soil samples revealed that these sites were strongly divergent from typical secondary forests of the Piedmont with respect to pH, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium (all significantly higher). It is possible, but unlikely, that these species were recently transported to these sites. It seems more likely that recent management activities stimulated seeds to emerge from a dormant seed bank.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorydalis 3aLigustrum sinense 3aNemophila 3acalcium 3ainvasive species 3amagnesium 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apiedmont 3apotassium 3asoil 3aGeorgia 0aChinese privet 0aCorydalis flavula 0aNemophila aphylla 0aPiedmont soils 0aplant distribution 0aseed dormancy 0awinter annuals0 tJournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2020 May 18, v. 147, no. 2 p.185-189dTorrey Botanical SocietywJournal:jnl55516x1940-06167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159/TORREY-D-19-00045.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245013900167520144600306592002801752650002001780650001301800650001101813650001101824650002201835650001401857650001601871650002701887650002101914650001401935650002501949650001101974650001701985650002402002700002002026700002102046773012202067856008002189852000902269655001202278IND60751418220221121023552.0210925e20210828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075141822DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110917172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, Alvaro 10aAnalysis of the Variability of Floral and Pollen Traits in Apple Cultivars—Selecting Suitable Pollen Donors for Cider Apple Orchards  aMost apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh.) are self-incompatible and fruit yield depends on cross-pollination between genetically compatible cultivars with synchronous flowering. Flowering intensity can vary strongly among years due to the biennial bearing habit of the cultivars. The knowledge of the phenological stages and floral and pollen characteristics is essential to select suitable pollen donors. We evaluated the phenotypic variability of flowering-related traits (i.e., flowering phenology, flowering intensity, pollen production and pollen quality) in 45 apple cultivars over two successive flowering seasons. Large phenotypic variability was found among the studied cultivars indicating that the local germplasm collection provides a good source of genetic and phenotypic diversity. However, low correlations were observed between floral biology traits and, consequently, the improvement in one trait seems not to affect other traits. Some of the cultivars such as ‘Perurico’ and ‘Raxila Dulce’ regularly produced copious amounts of high-quality pollen which can improve the pollen load dispersion leading to a most effective pollination process. We did not identify statistically significant correlations between pollen attributes and the biennial bearing phenomenon. The large variation in bloom dates from year-to-year observed under a typical Oceanic climate makes it advisable to combine cultivars in new plantings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aagronomy 3aapples 3aciders 3across pollination 3acultivars 3afruit yield 3agermplasm conservation 3amaritime climate 3aphenology 3aphenotypic variation 3apollen 3apollen loads 3apollen productivity1 aQuinet, Muriel 1 aDapena, Enrique 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Aug. 28, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110917173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008100173500001900254520101500273592002801288596008301316596004401399596004501443650002201488650002201510650001501532650001501547650001501562650001501577653002901592653002801621653003301649700001801682700001801700700001601718773011501734856008601849852000901935655001201944IND60700385320221122042437.0201223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1047512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPourmohammadi, P.10aPredicting developed land expansion using deep convolutional neural networks  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany aspects of land-use management and policy making require information regarding how and where land cover and land-uses will change in the future. In this research, we propose a method for modeling and predicting developed land expansion using the idea of pixel-wise semantic segmentation through deep convolutional neural networks. This analysis is done on a watershed scale with a focus on where developed lands are predicted to expand. We introduce a method to construct data cubes of the land patches which represent important information related to diverse characteristics of the area under consideration. We model the developed land expansion using an encoder-decoder network, and then perform prediction using a simple sigmoid layer. Our results indicate a performance accuracy of 98% on the test data. The proposed technique could thus play an important role in improving our understanding, mapping, and modeling of spatially explicit landscape changes, and in facilitating land-use decision making.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3acomputer software 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3aprediction 3awatersheds 0aDeveloped land expansion 0aPixel-wise segmentation 0aConvolutional neural network1 aAdjeroh, D.A.1 aStrager, M.P.1 aFarid, Y.Z.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2020 Dec., v. 134 p.104751-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1047513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011400182300001600296520139800312592002801710650001701738650001801755650002101773650002201794650001401816650000701830650001701837650001601854650002701870650002501897650006201922650005601984650001802040650005502058650002102113650001402134650002002148650003102168650001302199650005002212650002202262650003202284650002402316650002602340650003702366700001702403700002002420700001302440700002002453700001202473700002202485773011402507856004802621852000902669655001202678IND4474164620221120155500.0121003e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447416462DNAL7 a220813302pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-011-9446-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Zheng-Yu10aProduction and Characteristics of the Whole-Cell Lipase from Organic Solvent Tolerant Burkholderia sp. ZYB002  ap. 536-548.  aThe thermostable and organic solvent tolerant whole-cell lipase (WCL) was produced by Burkholderia sp. ZYB002 with broad spectrum organic solvent tolerance. The production medium of the WCL was primarily optimized, which resulted in the maximum activity of 22.8 U/mL and the 5.1-fold increase of the WCL yield. The optimized culture medium was as follows (% w/v or v/v): soybean meal 2, soybean oil 0.5, manganese sulfate 0.1, K2HPO4 0.1, olive oil 0.5, initial pH 6.0, inoculum density 2, liquid volume 35 mL in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and incubation time 24 h. The biochemical characterization of the WCL from Burkholderia sp. ZYB002 was determined, and the results showed that the optimal pH and temperature for lipolytic activity of the WCL was 8.0 and 65°C, respectively. The WCL was stable at temperature up to 70°C for 1 h and retained 79.2% of its original activity. The WCL was highly stable in the pH range from 3.0 to 8.5 for 6 h. Ca2+, K+, Na+, NO 3 − , etc. ions stimulated its lipolytic activity, whereas Zn2+ ion caused inhibition effect. The WCL was also relatively stable in n-butanol at a final concentration of 50% (v/v) for 24 h. However, the WCL was strongly inhibited in Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 10% (v/v). The WCL with thermal resistance and organic solvent tolerance showed its great potential in various green industrial chemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aculture media 3ainoculum density 3amanganese sulfate 3aolive oil 3apH 3asoybean meal 3asoybean oil 3atriacylglycerol lipase 2a1-Butanolxchemistry 2aBacterial Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBurkholderiaxenzymologyxisolation & purification. 2aCulture Media 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aEnzyme Stability 2aFuel Oils 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLipasexisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aSolventsxchemistry 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistry1 aWu, Ji-Guang1 aCheng, Lan-Xing1 aChen, De1 aJiang, Yong-Mei1 aLi, Xin1 aHuang, Jian-Zhong0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2012 Feb., v. 166, no. 3 p.536-548dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-011-9446-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245011700163300001800280520121000298536011201508592002801620596008201648650001401730650002501744650001801769650001501787650001801802650001401820650000901834650001901843650002201862700001501884700001501899700001501914700001701929700001601946773011801962856008602080852000902166655001202175IND60776850720221120152345.0220604e20220528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077685072DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2021.19735182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Yi,10aFolate Intake and Risk of Urothelial Carcinoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Epidemiological Studies  ap. 1593-1605.  aWe aimed to investigate the association between folate intake and the risk of urothelial carcinoma (UC). A systematic literature search using Pubmed and EMBASE databases was performed to find prospective cohort studies, population-based case-control study or hospital-based case-control study investigating the association of folate intake and the risk of UC. A total of 19 studies involving 11,175 cases and 656,161 individuals were included. High intake of folate was associated with a decreased risk of UC, with a pooled OR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.66–0.93, P = 0.006) for the highest category of intake vs. the lowest. The data suggested that folate may contribute to the prevention of urothelial cancer. However, the association was observed only in case-control studies (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.39–0.79, P = 0.001), but not in cohort studies (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.87–1.09, P = 0.638). Dose-response meta-analysis showed that an increment of folate intake (100 μg/day) corresponded to an 8% deceased risk of invasive UC (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87–0.98, P = 0.004). High folate intake might be inversely associated with risk of UC particularly invasive UC, which needs to be confirmed.  aThis study was supported by Postgraduate mentor team-building program of Southwest University (XYDS201905).  aPublisher supplied data  aXYDS201905cPostgraduate mentor team-building program of Southwest University 3acarcinoma 3acase-control studies 3adose response 3afolic acid 3ameta-analysis 3anutrition 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asystematic review1 aZeng, Jie,1 aZou, Yixin1 aLiu, Chang1 aFu, Hongjuan1 aZhang, Hui,0 tNutrition and cancer.g2022 May 28, v. 74, no. 5 p.1593-1605dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.19735183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245007600174300001600250520107600266592002801342650001901370650002201389650001401411650001301425650002201438653000701460653003201467653001501499700002301514700002001537773009601557856008901653852000901742655001201751IND60569247320221122051906.0190319e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056924732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Anna10aEvaluation of results and adaptation of EU Rural Development Programmes  ap. 298-314.  aThe EU Commission highlights evaluations as important for improving common policies. But do evaluations actually contribute? This paper examines whether this has been the case for the EU Rural Development Programmes (RDPs). We investigate 1) to what extent evaluations have influenced the design of national programmes and 2) if they have affected the Rural Development Regulation on which national programmes are based. Our main finding is that evaluations do not seem to affect future policy to any discernible degree. This is the case for both national programmes and the Regulation itself, which seems to have evolved in response to external pressures. Partly, this may be because evaluations tend to give vague or too general recommendations. Moreover, evaluations seldom apply counterfactual analysis, often because of a lack of data, implying that results may be methodologically questioned. Lastly, evaluations, and RDPs, are hard to locate and seldom translated from their native languages, impairing the possibilities of learning from the experiences of others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aissues and policy 3alanguages 3alearning 3arural development 0aEU 0aRural development programme 0aEvaluation1 aHöjgård, Sören,1 aRabinowicz, Ewa0 tLand use policy.g2017 Sept., v. 67 p.298-314dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245019800182520144900380592002801829650002001857650003101877650002801908650001201936650001501948650001301963650002001976650002501996650002402021650001802045650001502063650003302078650002502111650001302136650002002149653002402169653000902193653002002202653001402222653002502236700003502261700001802296700002102314700001802335700006302353773009102416856009002507852000902597655001202606IND60757174620221121021309.0220205e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075717462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1329522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTangahu, Bieby Voijant10aLead (Pb) removal from contaminated water using constructed wetland planted with Scirpus grossus: Optimization using response surface methodology (RSM) and assessment of rhizobacterial addition  aLead (Pb) is one of the toxic heavy metals that pollute the environment as a result of industrial activities. This study aims to optimize Pb removal from water by using horizontal free surface flow constructed wetland (HFSFCW) planted with Scirpus grossus. Optimization was conducted using response surface methodology (RSM) under Box–Behnken design with the operational parameters of initial Pb concentration, retention time, and aeration. Optimization results showed that 37 mg/L of initial Pb concentration, 32 days of retention time, and no aeration were the optimum conditions for Pb removal by using the systems. Validation test was run under two different conditions, namely, non-bioaugmented and bioaugmented with rhizobacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis, Brevibacillus choshinensis, and Rhodococcus rhodochrous). Results of the validation test showed that Pb removal in water achieved 99.99% efficiency with 0.2% error from the RSM prediction, while the adsorption of Pb by plants reached 5160.18 mg/kg with 10.6% error from the RSM prediction. The bioaugmentation of the five rhizobacterial species showed a slight improvement in Pb removal from water and Pb adsorption by plants. However, no significant improvement was achieved (p < 0.05). Overall results suggested that operating the HFSFCW under optimum conditions with no bioaugmentation might be a feasible choice for the treatment of Pb-contaminated water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBrevibacillus choshinensis 3aRhodococcus rhodochrous 3aScirpus 3aadsorption 3aaeration 3abioaugmentation 3aconstructed wetlands 3aexperimental design 3aoverland flow 3aprediction 3aresponse surface methodology 3arhizosphere bacteria 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 0aConstructed wetland 0aLead 0aPhytotechnology 0aPollution 0aWastewater treatment1 aSheikh Abdullah, Siti Rozaimah1 aBasri, Hassan1 aMushrifah Idris,1 aAnuar, Nurina1 aMukhlisin, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5139-70580 tChemosphere.g2022 Mar., v. 291 p.132952-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1329523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003800148245011200186520141600298592002801714650002801742650001701770650001501787650002101802650001701823650002001840650000901860650002301869650001701892650001401909650001001923650002101933650001301954653003301967653002102000653002302021653001202044653001402056653001102070700002602081700002702107700001602134700002002150700001502170700002002185773012302205856008302328852000902411655001202420IND60770751520221120022538.0220523e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077075152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1054992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Cachinho Cordeiro, Ivan Miguel10aPyrolysis and combustion characterisation of HDPE/APP composites via molecular dynamics and CFD simulations  aUnderstanding and characterisation of the pyrolysis and burning behaviour of flame retardant (FR) polymers are essential towards optimising the end-product in terms of flammability, charring, toxicity and smoke reduction. This study proposes a modelling framework to study the combustion behaviour, pyrolysis kinetics and FR mechanisms of FR treated polymer composites. This numerical framework has utilised reactive molecular dynamics (MD-ReaxFF) simulations to characterise the pyrolysis kinetics, char formation and residues fragments of High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and Ammonium polyphosphate filled HDPE (HDPE/APP) composites. Through MD characterisation of the polymer breaking process, thermal degradation behaviours are described by reactions rates in Arrhenius form and subsequently imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The modelling framework has well-predicted the heat release rate (HRR) profiles, ignition time and combustion duration of the HDPE and HDPE/APP composites, where average relative errors less than 15% were achieved compared to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and cone calorimeter tests. The proposed numerical framework demonstrated the capability to capture the burning behaviour and flammability of FR treated polymer composites and identify the pyrolysis kinetics and FR mechanisms offered by the APP additives, such as dehydration and char formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium polyphosphates 3acalorimeters 3acombustion 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3afluid mechanics 3aheat 3amolecular dynamics 3apolyethylene 3apyrolysis 3asmoke 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aFlame retardants 0aMolecular dynamics 0aPolymer 0aPyrolysis 0aReaxFF1 aChen, Timothy Bo Yuan1 aYuen, Anthony Chun Yin1 aWang, Cheng1 aChan, Qing Nian1 aZhang, Jin1 aYeoh, Guan Heng0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2022 May, v. 163 p.105499-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2022.1054993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245017300160300001800333500001900351520134500370592002801715650002201743650001101765650001401776650001101790650001801801650001501819650001701834650002101851650002901872653001401901653001601915653002001931700002301951700001701974773014601991856007502137852000902212655001202221IND60725667920221118191253.0210128e20201027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072566792DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toaa2252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkter, Humayra10aVisibility and Persistence of Fluorescent Dyes, and Impacts on Emergence, Quality, and Survival of Sterile Queensland Fruit Fly Bactrocera tryoni (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 2800-2807.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTephritid flies released in sterile insect technique pest management programs are usually marked with fluorescent dyes so that they can be distinguished from wild flies in monitoring traps. Dyes can have adverse effects on emergence, quality, and survival, which can impact sterile insect technique (SIT) success, and so it is important to identify dyes and doses that maximize marking efficacy while minimizing deleterious effects on fly quality. This study examines the effects of five fluorescent dye products, Fluoro Pink, Fluoro Orange, Stella Green, Arc Chrome, and Astral Pink applied at four dose levels (1, 2, 3, and 4 g/liter) on Queensland fruit fly. All dye products caused a similar dose-dependent reduction in percentage of adult emergence. Incidence of morphological deformity of emerged adults increased with dose, and this trend was similar for all dye products. No effects of dye product or dose were found on survival rates over the first 35 d of adulthood, although females tended to have higher survival than males. Visibility varied with dose and dye product; 1 g/liter dye was less visible than 2, 3, or 4 g/liter, and Stella green had lower visibility than other dyes. All of the tested dyes except for Stella green were similar in all assessed metrics of fly performance and are recommended for use in SIT programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera tryoni 3aStella 3aadulthood 3aadults 3adose response 3aentomology 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3asterile insect technique 0aemergence 0adye marking 0adye persistence1 aTaylor, Phillip W.1 aCrisp, Peter0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Oct. 27, v. 113, no. 6 p.2800-2807dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa2253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008500167500002200252520231400274592002802588650001802616650002002634650002202654650001102676650000902687650001402696650001702710650001102727650001502738650002602753650001202779650001102791653001302802653001302815653001902828653002402847653000902871653000802880700001902888700002102907700002502928700002002953773006802973856008403041852000903125655001203134IND60569247520221122052037.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056924752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2017.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrana, Mario10aExposure to ultrafine particles in different transport modes in the city of Rome  aPre-press version  aThere is evidence of adverse health impacts from human exposure to particulate air pollution, including increased rates of respiratory and cardiovascular illness, hospitalizations, and pre-mature mortality. Most recent hypotheses assign an important role to ultrafine particles (UFP) (<0.1 μm) and to associated transition metals (in particular Fe). In a large city like Rome, where many active people spend more than one hour per day in private or public transportation, it may be important to evaluate the level of exposure to harmful pollutants which occurs during urban travelling. In this context, the aim of this work was to examine the relative contribution of different transport modes to total daily exposure.We performed experimental measurements during both morning and evening traffic peak hours throughout the winter season (December 2013–March 2014), for a total of 98 trips. Our results suggest that the lowest UFP exposures are experienced by underground train commuters, with an average number concentration of 14 134 cm−3, and are largely a reflection of the routes being at greater distance from vehicular traffic. Motorcyclists experienced significantly higher average concentrations (73 168 cm−3) than all other exposure classes, and this is most likely a result of the presence of high-concentration and short-duration peaks which do not occur when the same routes are traveled by car. UFP concentrations in subway train environments were found to be comparable to urban background levels. Still, in underground trains we found the highest values of PM10 mass concentration with a maximum value of 422 μg/m3. PM10 concentration in trains was found to be four and two times higher than what was measured in car and motorbike trips, respectively. Transport mode contribution to total integrated UFP daily exposure was found to be 16.3%–20.9% while travelling by car, 28.7%for motorbike trips, and 8.7% for subway trips. Due to lower exposure times, commuting by car and motorbike is comparable to other daily activities in terms of exposure. Our data can provide relevant information for transport decision-making and increase environmental awareness in the hope that the information about inhaled pollutants can translate into a more rational approach to urban travelling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3adecision making 3aexposure duration 3ahumans 3airon 3amortality 3aparticulates 3apeople 3apollutants 3apublic transportation 3atraffic 3awinter 0aCommuter 0aExposure 0aTransport mode 0aUltrafine particles 0aPM10 0aSEM1 aToschi, Nicola1 aVicentini, Laura1 aPietroiusti, Antonio1 aMagrini, Andrea0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2017.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015800162520098100320592002801301650001801329650002301347650003801370650001601408650002001424650001301444650001401457650001601471650002301487650002101510653005601531653003701587653002301624653002501647653002501672653003101697700001701728700001301745700001301758700001601771700001801787700001901805773010001824856008201924852000902006655001202015IND60692518920221120085903.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069251892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2020.1785952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hua-Bo10aResearch on the decomposition kinetics and thermal hazards of 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride by experimental and simulation approach  aThe thermal behaviors of azo-compounds have been a topic received extensive attention. This paper attempted to obtain the decomposition kinetics of 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AIBA) by applying differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) experiments and slow cook-off test. Moreover, the thermal hazards parameters, such as self-accelerating decomposition temperature (SADT), time to maximum rate under adiabatic conditions (TMRₐd), time to conversion limit (TCL), were predicted. The results indicate that AIBA is a highly exothermic and hazardous substance, and the kinetic model including two-step parallel reaction paths, the n-order reaction and the autocatalytic reaction, is credible to evaluate the decomposition process of AIBA. Based on the kinetic model and fiberboard packaging, the simulated SADT of 50 kg drum and 25 kg box are 94 °C and 91 °C, respectively. The TMRₐd is 104.66 °C under 24 h, and 113.05 °C of 8 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo compounds 3acatalytic activity 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afiberboards 3aheat production 3akinetics 3apackaging 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3atoxic substances 0a2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride 0aDifferential scanning calorimery 0aSlow cook-off test 0aIsoconversion method 0aModel fitting method 0aThermal hazards prediction1 aWu, Wen-qian1 aPeng, Xu1 aWang, Xu1 aGuo, Xin-Yi1 aChen, Li-Ping1 aChen, Wang-Hua0 tThermochimica acta.g2020 July, v. 689 p.178595-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2020.1785953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169300001600322520222300338592002802561650001502589650001302604650001502617650001702632650001402649650004302663650001102706650002402717650002002741650002202761650002202783650002102805650001402826650001502840650001802855650002302873650001202896653001202908653003102920653001402951653004402965653001503009653000903024700001903033700002003052700002303072773007603095856008503171852000903256655001203265IND60562381020221119082553.0170719e20170515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056238102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaldi, Marina10aTowards automation in protein digestion: Development of a monolithic trypsin immobilized reactor for highly efficient on-line digestion and analysis  ap. 143-157.  aReducing experimental variability, limiting contamination and increasing automation are essential goals in the development of reliable analytical platforms for mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. In this work novel trypsin-based monolithic immobilized enzyme reactors (tryp-IMERs), obtained by covalent immobilization on convective interaction media (CIMac™) analytical columns (5mm×5.2mm I.D.), were developed. Notwithstanding the small dimensions, column format allowed the insertion in common high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems, thus avoiding the use of expensive micro- or nano-platforms. Monolith pore diameter and surface chemistry were optimized to achieve high digestion efficiency even with high molecular weight proteins and to avoid protein/peptide adsorption, peak broadening and sample loss. A full characterization of the tryp-IMERs was undertaken to select the best protocol for preparation and type of trypsin. Optimization of the operational and storage conditions was carried out by an off-line approach. On-line studies were performed by setting a multidimensional analytical platform, which included the tryp-IMER, a trapping column, an analytical C4 column and a high resolution hybrid mass spectrometer (ESI-Q-TOF). In the optimized conditions rapid protein digestion (90±9s), high protein coverage (≥60%) and high score values were achieved for five selected sample proteins (cytochrome c, myoglobin and albumins from different sources) differing in molecular size, isoelectric point and accessibility to cleavage sites as well as for a protein mixture of 200ng. The best performing tryp-IMERs showed high sensitivity down to the pmole level. The platform also resulted suitable for the analysis of high-molecular weight proteins such as a pool of human immunoglobulins G (hIgG) and for the high molecular weight fraction of human plasma proteins, which were digested in less than two minutes to an extent similar to that achieved by overnight incubation in a classical in solution protocol. Finally, underestimated key procedural issues were also highlighted during the study. Such aspects are of general interest both for tryp-IMER users and tryp-IMER developers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalbumins 3aautomation 3acytochrome c 3adigestion 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aimmunoglobulins 3aisoelectric point 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3amyoglobin 3aproteomics 3aspectrometers 3astorage conditions 3atrypsin 0aTrypsin 0aImmobilized enzyme reactor 0aMonoliths 0aLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aProteomics 0aIgGs1 aČernigoj, Urh1 aŠtrancar, Ales1 aBartolini, Manuela0 tTalanta.g2017 May 15, v. 167 p.143-157dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245017300157300001800330500001900348520128400367592002801651650002401679650002301703650003001726650001501756650001001771650002201781650001001803653002201813653002301835653001601858700002001874700002201894700002301916700002501939700002201964700002001986700002102006700002002027773014602047856007502193852000902268655001202277IND60725668020221118191701.0210128e20201022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072566802DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toaa2262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrei, Narin10aMicrobial Control of the Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) Using Beauveria bassiana (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) by the Means of an Autodissemination Device  ap. 2657-2665.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe FraxiProtec, an autodissemination device loaded with the fungus Beauveria bassiana isolate CFL-A, was tested in the field to evaluate its potential to infect emerald ash borer adults and reduce their populations.

The mean percentage of infected emerald ash borer in 2017 and 2018 in 15 treated sites was 43.3 ± 2.9% and 39.7 ± 3.9%, respectively, and no significant variation was observed over the tested years. Furthermore, a 40% significant reduction of the mean emerald ash borer population growth per tree in treated sites was recorded when compared to the control sites. Emerald ash borer infected with B. bassiana isolate CFL-A were collected from baited sticky traps in the sentinel stations in the area surrounding the FraxiProtec-treated sites.

Finally, exploratory analyzes were carried out on parameters such as the area to be treated, ash tree density, and FraxiProtec density to document potential relationships, which could be used in the determination of a prescription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus planipennis 3aBeauveria bassiana 3abiological control agents 3aentomology 3afungi 3apopulation growth 3atrees 0aemerald ash borer 0abiological control 0aFraxiProtec1 aGuertin, Claude1 aLavallée, Robert1 aLajoie, Marie-Ève1 aBrousseau, Christian1 aBergevin, Réjean1 aMiller, Fredric1 aMcMillin, Kendra1 aTrudel, Richard0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Oct. 22, v. 113, no. 6 p.2657-2665dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa2263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009900173500001900272520108400291592002801375650001701403650001201420650001901432650002201451650001701473651001501490700002301505700002401528773011601552856008601668852000901754655001201763IND60700385720221122042602.0200824e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1047812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Bethany10aDetecting early warning signals of long-term water supply vulnerability using machine learning  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdapting water resources systems to climate change requires identifying hydroclimatic signals that reliably indicate long-term transitions to vulnerable system states. While recent studies have classified the conditions under which vulnerability occurs (i.e., scenario discovery), there remains an opportunity to extend such methods into a dynamic planning context to design and assess early warning signals. This study contributes a machine learning approach to classifying the occurrence of long-term water supply vulnerability over lead times ranging from 0 to 20 years, using a case study of the northern California reservoir system. Results indicate that this approach predicts the occurrence of future vulnerabilities in validation significantly better than a random classifier, given a balanced set of training data. Accuracy decreases at longer lead times, and the most influential predictors include long-term monthly averages of reservoir storage. Dynamic early warning signals can be used to inform monitoring and detection of vulnerabilities under a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3awater supply 3aCalifornia1 aCohen, Jonathan S.1 aHerman, Jonathan D.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2020 Sept., v. 131 p.104781-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.1047813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008500162520132800247592002801575650001201603650000901615650002001624650002001644650001801664650002101682650002501703650002201728653001601750653002201766653002501788653001801813653002701831653001901858700002501877700001701902700001601919773010001935856008202035852000902117655001202126IND60692519020221120095902.0200614e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069251902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2020.1786122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, D.10aDesign, fabrication and validation of an improved coil for induction dilatometry  aDilatometry is a versatile tool to investigate thermal expansion or phase transformations in various materials based on the length changes upon heating and cooling. Since most modern thermal processes tend to take place at high heating and cooling rates it can be demonstrated that a large longitudinal temperature gradient within dilatometric samples impedes the accurate investigation of physical mechanisms. In this study we investigate how an instrumental advancement of the induction heating system can be implemented in a dilatometric setup in order to mitigate the temperature gradient and its effect on the measured length change for a wide range of heating rates. For this purpose a numerical method for heating design optimization using a FEM simulation of the dilatometric experiment is developed and validated. The presented heating component design method in combination with additive manufacturing capabilities allows for a more accurate and flexible method of detecting dilatation in a dilatometric setup. Extreme temperature differences of 140∘C for a maximum heating rate of 800∘C/s could be reduced by 15-45% within the sample using new optimized instrumentation. This leads to a more profound and exact interpretation of dilatometric data for high heating rates and complex time temperature profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aheat 3aheating systems 3ainstrumentation 3amanufacturing 3aphase transition 3atemperature profiles 3athermal expansion 0aDilatometry 0aInductive heating 0atemperature gradient 0aFE-Simulation 0aadditive manufacturing 0ainduction coil1 aTorres-Velasquez, D.1 aDietrich, S.1 aSchulze, V.0 tThermochimica acta.g2020 July, v. 689 p.178612-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2020.1786123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164300001800290520177800308592002802086650002602114650001902140650001402159650001302173650002002186650001002206650002702216650002302243650001102266650001702277650001302294650001302307650001302320650002402333650001202357650001302369650001902382700002202401700001702423700002302440700002002463773010502483856008102588852000902669655001202678IND60439955520221123042525.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043995552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-015-0856-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahul Kumar,10aGenomic Survey, Gene Expression, and Interaction Analysis Suggest Diverse Roles of ARF and Aux/IAA Proteins in Solanaceae  ap. 1552-1572.  aAuxin response factor (ARF) and Auxin/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins are the foremost regulators of auxin action and play an essential role in the coordination of many aspects of plant growth and development. Though many members of both ARF and Aux/IAA gene families have been identified and characterized in tomato, they are less studied in other Solanaceae species. In the present study, we focused on gaining insights into their functional conservation as well as diversification during auxin-mediated responses in Solanaceae. First, we identified their full complement in tomato, potato, pepper, Nicotiana benthamiana, eggplant, and petunia and found that both the gene families have expanded in N. benthamiana. We also looked into the structural variations associated with all the members of these two classes of genes in tomato and showed that huge natural variation exists in their sequence in wild relatives. The comprehensive gene expression analysis provided evidence of high conservation in the expression of orthologous ARFs and Aux/IAAs during fruit development and ripening in tomato and pepper. Furthermore, the molecular changes caused by exogenous plant hormones and abiotic stress conditions on their transcript levels were investigated which showed that many members of both the gene families may participate in various hormone- and stress-mediated responses in tomato and potato. Some of these genes may play a role in linking the hormone-controlled plant growth and stress-related signaling pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that single tomato ARF can interact with multiple Aux/IAA proteins and vice versa. Overall, our study will be very helpful in establishing both conserved as well as non-conserved functions of these genes in Solanaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aabiotic stress 3aeggplants 3afruiting 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aindole acetic acid 3apepper 3aplant growth 3apotatoes 3aproteins 3aripening 3asignal transduction 3asurveys 3atomatoes 3awild relatives1 aAgarwal, Priyanka1 aPareek, Amit1 aTyagi, Akhilesh K.1 aSharma, Arun K.0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2015 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.1552-1572dSpringer USx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-015-0856-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245008000138300001600218520174200234592002801976650002002004650002302024650001102047650001802058650002002076650003102096650001602127650002302143650001802166650001702184650001002201653001102211653002102222653003902243773012902282852000902411655001202420IND60705807920221120153106.0201224e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070580792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlshallash, Khalid S.10aControl of Italian ryegrass by pre- and post-emergence herbicides in barley  ap. 397-400.  aIn two glasshouse experiments, range of herbicides was applied as pre-or post-emergence to examine their effect in controlling Italian ryegrass (Loluim multiflorum) grown with barley. In experiment 1, treatment by one of the three herbicides named, chlorotoluron, controlled Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum) \significantly (P<0.01). However, the three herbicides differed significantly (P<0.05) in their dose. Chlorotoluron gave effective control of L. multiflorum at dose of 2 kg/ha with less than 10% of mean of ryegrass plants/pot survived and only a slight damage on barley was observed. Isoproturon and methabenzthiazuron were less effective in controlling the weed as more than 30% of L. multiflorum plants survived at different doses applied while barley plants were not affected significantly by the chemicals. In experiment 2, two herbicides diclofop-methyl or pendimethalin were applied as postemergence treatment. The herbicide diclofop-methyl achieved an effective control of Italian ryegrass associated with barley even at rates as low as 0.25 kg/ha. Mean of ryegrass numbers and fresh weight (20 plants)/pot were decreased significantly and only few plants of L. multifloruim survived at 1 kg/ha, however, they were very small in size and badly damaged. Barley plants were not damaged by diclofop-methyl treatments at all applied doses. Pendimethalin created a significant effect (P=0.05) on ryegrass numbers/pot or fresh weight (20 plants/pot) at doses, 0.125 or 0.25 kg/ha. However, at 1 kg/ha there was about 40% reduction in weed numbers/pot and its fresh weight (20 plants/pot), which indicate low control effect of this chemical. There was no evidence of damage to barley plants by pendimethalin at all tested rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aLolium multiflorum 3abarley 3achlorotoluron 3adiclofop-methyl 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aisoproturon 3amethabenzthiazuron 3apendimethalin 3aweed control 3aweeds 0aBarley 0aItalian ryegrass 0aPre- and post-emergence herbicides0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2015, v. 47, no. 4 p.397-400dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245007000206300001600276500001900292520105400311592002801365650002301393650001201416650002301428650001101451650001801462700006101480700002401541773011501565856008201680852000901762655001201771IND60700385820221122042507.0200824e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2020.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Leena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5723-498110aCRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing of banana for disease resistance  ap. 118-126.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBanana production is severely constrained by many pathogens and pests, particularly where a number of them are co-existing. The use of disease-resistant banana varieties is one of the most effective ways to mitigate the negative impacts of pathogens on banana production. Recent advances in new breeding techniques have the potential to accelerate breeding of banana for disease resistance. The CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing has emerged as the most powerful tool for crop improvement due to its capability of creating precise alterations in plant genome and trait stacking through multiplexing. Recently, the robust CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing of banana has been established, which can be applied for developing disease-resistant varieties. This article presents a synopsis of recent advancements and perspectives on the application of genome editing for generating disease-resistant banana varieties. It also summarizes the current status of regulatory requirements for the release of genome-edited crop varieties among different countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3abananas 3adisease resistance 3agenome 3aplant biology1 aNtui, Valentine O1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4709-80871 aTripathi, Jaindra N0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2020 Aug., v. 56 p.118-126dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2020.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007700172300001400249520198100263592002802244650002202272650002002294650002102314650001102335650002402346650000802370650001202378650002002390650001602410650001402426650001502440650001002455653002602465653003102491653001902522653001302541653001402554700001802568700003002586700002202616700002102638773008402659856008602743852000902829655001202838IND60692519120221120095937.0210820e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069251912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEleopra, Roberto10aClinical duration of action of different botulinum toxin types in humans  ap. 84-91.  aThe Botulinum NeuroToxin (BoNT) comprises several serotypes with distinct properties, mechanisms of action, sensitivity and duration of effect in different species. The serotype A (BoNT/A) is the prevalent neurotoxin applied in human's disease. In this paper we present an overview of the current knowledge regarding the duration of effect and the neuromuscular sprouting of different BoNT serotypes in humans. Then, we report the original results of a study in healthy subjects treated with BoNT/A, B, C and F using different neurophysiological techniques. Twelve healthy volunteers (7 men, 5 women) are treated with BoNT/A, B, C and F or placebo in Abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle of the hand. Before and after injections, an extensive neurophysiological study is performed with the CMAP amplitude variation, Multi-Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs) analysis, the Turns/Amplitude ratio of interference pattern (IP) and determination of jitter and Fiber Density (FD) at single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG), at week 2 (w2), 4 (w4), 6 (w6) and 8 (w8). A maximal neuromuscular block is obtained at w2 for all the serotypes. Afterwards, the CMAP trend appear similar for BoNT/A, B, and C while, BoNT/F shows a faster recover. Multi-MUAPs analysis and IP detect mild changes at w2 for all serotypes, except for BoNT/F that shows a greater change since w4. SFEMG have minimal changes in FD while, Jitter increase at w2 with a slower decrease over the time for all BoNTs. In conclusion, BoNT/F has earlier sprouting and complete recovery at w8. Other serotypes present a slower and similar profile. The EMG appear useful to study the functional recovery in humans, and these results should provide new evidence for assessing different serotypes. These findings improve our knowledge regarding the methods to evaluate duration of effects and dose equivalents in different serotypes, that in the future could change the clinicians strategy for disease-tailored BoNT therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaction potentials 3abotulinum toxin 3aelectromyography 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amen 3amuscles 3aneurophysiology 3aneurotoxins 3aserotypes 3avolunteers 3awomen 0aBotulinum neurotoxins 0aBotulinum toxins serotypes 0aMUAPs analysis 0aEDB test 0acMAP test1 aRinaldo, Sara1 aMontecucco, C.q(Cesare),1 aRossetto, Ornella1 aDevigili, Grazia0 tToxicon.g2020 May, v. 179 p.84-91dElsevier LtdwJournal:6279x0041-01017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04418naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245005800128300001600186520234000202592002802542650002402570650002102594650003402615650001502649650001602664650001602680650002302696650001702719650002002736650001202756650001602768650001302784650002102797650001502818650002102833650001002854650002602864650001602890650001802906650002602924650001802950650001802968650002402986650002803010650001303038650001503051650001203066650001803078650001303096650001303109650001703122650001703139650001503156650001303171650000903184650001503193650001903208650001303227650001103240650001603251653002503267653002703292653002003319700002303339700001403362700002003376700001403396700002003410700001503430700001403445700001503459773012903474852000903603655001203612IND60705808020221118121838.0201224e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070580802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, R.K.10aUse of botanical herbicides in system intensification  ap. 401-407.  aTen field experiments were conducted at Viswavidyalaya farm during 2004 - 14 in system intensification methodology on SRI rice (Oryza sativa), groundnut (Arachis hypogea), soybean (Glycine max), rapeseed (Brassica campestris), sesame (Sesamum indicum), greengram (Vigna mungo) and blackgram (Vigna aureus) crops grown in inceptisols following annual planning of weed management to find out the efficacy of botanical extracts.

Weedy check (WC), hand weeding (HW) at 20 and MW at 40 days after planting (DAP), pre-emergence (PE) herbicides at 1–2 DAP pretilachlor at 500 g/ha, alachlor at 1500 g/ha or pendimethalin at 750 g/ha + MW at 30 DAP and post-emergence (POE) herbicides quizalofop-ethyl or fenoxaprop-p-ethyl at 50 g/ha at 20 DAP + MW at 40 DAP were also used in different crops as standard check. The experiments on rapeseed and soybean during 2004–05 showed PE Eucalyptus leaf extract attributed 11.2% higher seed yield over WC besides two HW and pendimethalin. During 2010–11 in experiment on SRI rice, the grain yield was 6.35 t/ha in HW, 5.35 t/ha in CC, 5.16 t/ha in Tectona methanol extract while 3.44 t/ha in WC. In another experiment during 2010–11 on sesame, green and blackgram, the botanical extract of Ageratum conyzoides recorded higher growth and yield in sesame and blackgram while Ocimum sanctum extract among the botanicals in greengram exhibited higher harvest index, oil content and also soil nutrient status. In groundnut during 2012, average pod yield of botanical treatments was 32.5% (summer) and 42.5% (Kharif) which was higher than WC. Experiment on SRI rice during 2012–13 revealed that maximum WCE was obtained from HW (91%) followed by chemical control CC (84%) and BE (78%) compared to three MW (67%), two MW (53%) over WC. The mean grain yield data showed that HW recorded 88% followed by CC (79%), BE (76%), three MW (67%) and two MW (36%) over control. The maximum WCE was obtained from HW (91%) followed by CC (84%) and BE (78%) compared to 3 MW 67% and 2 MW 53%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgeratum conyzoides 3aArachis hypogaea 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aEucalyptus 3aGlycine max 3aInceptisols 3aOcimum tenuiflorum 3aOryza sativa 3aSesamum indicum 3aTectona 3aVigna mungo 3aalachlor 3aapplication rate 3ablack gram 3achemical control 3acrops 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3aherbicide application 3aleaf extracts 3alipid content 3amanual weed control 3amechanical weed control 3amethanol 3amung beans 3apeanuts 3apendimethalin 3aplanning 3aplanting 3apolysorbates 3apretilachlor 3aquizalofop 3arapeseed 3arice 3aseed yield 3asoil nutrients 3asoybeans 3asummer 3asurfactants 0aBotanical herbicides 0aSystem intensification 0aWeed management1 aShamurailatpam, D.1 aGhosh, A.1 aSentharagai, S.1 aLabar, A.1 aNongmaithem, D.1 aJana, P.K.1 aGhosh, S.1 aKole, R.K.0 tIndian journal of weed science.g2015, v. 47, no. 4 p.401-407dIndian Society of Weed SciencewJournal:2005x0974-81647nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001800150245006000168300001600228520167000244592002801914650001601942650003101958650001301989650001602002650002902018650001302047650001202060650001002072650001002082650001002092650001002102650004302112650001102155650001402166650002602180650001802206650001002224651002502234651001202259700002002271700001802291700001602309773008402325856008602409852000902495655001202504IND4468949720221120122107.0141111e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446894972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaied, Chiraz10aNatural occurrence of citrinin in Tunisian wheat grains  ap. 106-109.  aCitrinin (CIT) is a toxic metabolite produced by several filamentous fungi of the genera Penicillium, Aspergillus and Monascus, which has been known as a natural contaminant in cereal grains, foods and feedstuffs. CIT is a quinone methide with a powerful antibacterial effect, but toxic to humans and animals. This mycotoxin is mainly hepato-nephrotoxic, indeed it was implicated as a potential causative agent in human Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) associated with an increased frequency of urinary tract tumors in animals and humans. A total of 200 samples of wheat were collected during the harvest year of 2010 from the major cropping areas in Tunisia and they were analyzed for citrinin contamination. These samples were taken after the harvest which can last up to three months. During this period, Penicillium and Aspergillus can growth on the harvested crop and produce CIT. The aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the presence of CIT in widely-consumed cereals in Tunisia, especially in wheat, and to suggest some factors that can promote the production of CIT in Tunisia. To perform this study, we developed and validated in our laboratory conditions an HPLC method for quantitative analysis of CIT in solid cereal samples. Our results showed that the incidence of CIT contamination was 50%. The levels of contamination determined in the positive samples ranged between 01 and 170Â Î¼g/kg with an average of 28Â Î¼g/kg. These amounts of CIT in wheat are chiefly attributed to the geographic position of Tunisia as a Mediterranean country characterized by a climate that favors fungal proliferation and mycotoxins production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aBalkan endemic nephropathy 3aMonascus 3aPenicillium 3aantibacterial properties 3acitrinin 3aclimate 3acrops 3afeeds 3afoods 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aquantitative analysis 3aurinary tract 3awheat 3aMediterranean region 3aTunisia1 aZouaoui, Nidhal1 aBacha, Hassan1 aAbid, Salwa0 tFood control.g2012 Nov., v. 28, no. 1 p.106-109dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012000169300001600289520117400305592002801479650001201507650001201519650001901531650001201550650001101562650001001573650001301583650000901596650001801605650002101623651001101644700001901655700002101674700002401695700002201719700002001741700002301761700002201784700002101806773011301827856008101940852000902021655001202030IND60573960420221117160148.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057396042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-015-1637-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNsubuga, F .W. N.10aDetecting changes in surface water area of Lake Kyoga sub-basin using remotely sensed imagery in a changing climate  ap. 327-337.  aDetection of changes in Earth surface features, for example lakes, is important for understanding the relationships between human and natural phenomena in order to manage better the increasingly scarce natural resources. This work presents a procedure of using modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI) to detect fluctuations of lake surface water area and relate it to a changing climate. The study used radiometrically and geometrically rectified Landsat images for 1986, 1995 and 2010 encompassing the Kyoga Basin lakes of Uganda, in order to investigate the changes in surface water area between the respective years. The standard precipitation index (SPI) and drought severity index (DSI) are applied to show the relationship between variability of surface water area and climate parameters. The present analysis reveals that surface water area fluctuation is linked to rainfall variability. In particular, Lake Kyoga sub-basin lakes experienced an increase in surface water area in 2010 compared to 1986. This work has important implications to water resources management for Lake Kyoga and could be vital to water resource managers across Ugandan lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3ahumans 3alakes 3amanagers 3arain 3asurface water 3awater management 3aUganda1 aBotai, Joel O.1 aOlwoch, Jane M.,1 aRautenbach, C.J.deW1 aKalumba, Ahmed M.1 aTsela, Philemon1 aAdeola, Abiodun M.1 aSentongo, Ausi A.1 aMearns, Kevin F.0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Jan., v. 127, no. 1-2 p.327-337dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1637-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245014800172300001800320500001500338520135000353592002801703650001401731650001801745650002401763650003001787650001301817650002701830650001301857650001001870650001201880650002201892653001001914700001601924700002001940700002001960700001801980700001901998773010502017856008102122852000902203655001202212IND60439955720221122043826.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043995572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-015-0859-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Jagesh Kumar10aAllele Mining in Solanum Germplasm: Cloning and Characterization of RB-Homologous Gene Fragments from Late Blight Resistant Wild Potato Species  ap. 1584-1598.  a2019-12-06  aThe late blight disease can be managed by introduction of resistance (R) genes from the wild Solanum species into the cultivated potato. The R genes are mostly comprised of the nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains and share nucleotide sequence homology in the crop species. In this study, we used potato R gene-specific primers to amplify homologous genes from wild species. A total of 39 wild species were tested for late blight resistance by challenge inoculation of Phytophthora infestans under controlled conditions. Of these, only 15 species were highly resistant (HR) and these were PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplified by 53 primers representing 21 R genes of potato. Further, only single, distinct, and reproducible gene fragments were cloned and sequenced. Following sequence processing and analysis, 17 non-redundant sequences of RB-homologous genes were identified with uninterrupted open reading frames (ORFs) and nucleotide sequence homologies to known late blight R genes. Finally, 17 RB-homologous gene fragments amplified by the primers of the RB gene were isolated from 11 wild species. The isolation and characterization of 17 RB-homologous gene fragments from wild potato species may serve as an important genomic resource for the novel gene discovery in late blight resistance breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermplasm 3agenome mining 3aopen reading frames 3apolymerase chain reaction 3abreeding 3aPhytophthora infestans 3apotatoes 3agenes 3aSolanum 3asequence homology 0acrops1 aDevi, Sapna1 aSharma, Sanjeev1 aChandel, Poonam1 aRawat, Shashi1 aSingh, Bir Pal0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2015 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.1584-1598dSpringer USx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-015-0859-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010500167300001600272520050000288592002800788650001000816650002300826650002300849650001700872650002500889650001100914650001400925650001200939700002200951773010300973856008501076852000901161655001201170IND60579191320221120175656.0170816e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057919132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.5b034792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, You-Cai10aSilaborative Carbocyclizations of 1,7-Enynes.

When present in large numbers, house flies can negatively impact humans and animals through nuisance and the transmission of pathogens. Since the development of fly traps and sticky papers to capture flies in the late 1800s, these and other methods have been used as a means to monitor change in house fly density or fly activity over time. Methods include substrate sampling to record density of immature flies, visual observations of adult fly activity, instantaneous counts of landing or resting flies, accumulation of adult flies on/in traps, or accumulation of fly fecal and regurgitation spots deposited by flies onto white cards. These methods do not estimate true house fly density, but rather provide an index of house fly activity that is related to both fly density and the frequency of individual fly behavior (e.g., frequency of flight, landing events) and which is likely more predictive of negative impacts such as nuisance and pathogen transmission. Routine monitoring of house fly activity is a critical component of a house fly management program. Fly activity should be held to a level below a predetermined activity threshold (‘action threshold') above which negative impacts are anticipated to occur. This article is a review of methods utilized for monitoring house fly (Diptera: Muscidae) activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusca domestica 3adisease transmission 3aentomology 3apests 3awastes 0asurveillance 0atrap 0adensity 0athreshold 0aprecision0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 113, no. 6 p.2571-2580dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toaa2293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245008200202300002000284506007600304520073700380592002801117506003701145650001301182650001201195650001601207650001701223650003601240650001401276650002601290650001401316700002201330700002201352700002301374700003001397700002501427773013401452856007801586852000901664655001201673IND60559341420221207055808.0161207e20161207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055934142DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b089872doi7 aPMC51487412pmcid7 a277000712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhengan10aBiosynthetic Timing and Substrate Specificity for the Thiopeptide Thiomuracin  ap. 15511-15514.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe biosynthesis of the thiopeptide thiomuracin is a well-orchestrated process involving a multitude of posttranslational modifications. We show that six Cys residues of a precursor peptide are first cyclodehydrated and oxidized to thiazoles in an ordered, but nonlinear fashion that is leader-peptide-dependent. Then four alcohols are glutamylated and converted to alkenes in a C-to-N terminal directional process that is leader-peptide-independent. Finally, two of these alkenes undergo a formal [4 + 2] cycloaddition to form a trithiazole-substituted pyridine macrocycle. We describe here the factors that govern the substrate specificity and order of biosynthetic events that turn a ribosomal peptide into a powerful antibiotic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalcohols 3aalkenes 3aantibiotics 3abiosynthesis 3apost-translational modification 3apyridines 3asubstrate specificity 3athiazoles1 aHudson, Graham A.1 aMahanta, Nilkamal1 aTietz, Jonathan I.1 aVan der Donk, Wilfred A.,1 aMitchell, Douglas A.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2016 Dec. 07, v. 138, no. 48 p.15511-15514dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b089873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010400166520118500270592002801455650002001483650002101503650002401524650002601548650002201574650002201596650002201618650001901640650002701659650001301686650001901699650001501718651001601733653002201749653002501771653003101796653002001827700002301847773010301870856008601973852000902059655001202068IND60770752020221117162113.0220503e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077075202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1063002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaz, Sumra10aDelineating the genetic status of wild Cyprinus carpio as influenced by anthropogenic interventions  aThe ability of populations to persist and adapt to environmental changes is based on genetic diversity.

Significant deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was observed in 17 out of 84 tests. The pairwise FST values showed a moderate level of population differentiation. AMOVA revealed a significant genetic structuring among the wild populations. The UPGMA dendrogram constructed for analysis of genetic relatedness grouped all the populations into two clusters. The understanding of genetic structure of C. carpio in natural systems would be instrumental in genetic enhancement programs, effective management and sustainable conservation of riverine genetic resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3afish communities 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic stability 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aresearch 3ariparian areas 3awatersheds 3aIndus River 0aGenetic diversity 0aPopulation structure 0aMicrosatellite DNA markers 0aFreshwater fish1 aʻAbbās, Khālid,0 tFisheries research.g2022 July, v. 251 p.106300-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1063003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011800168300001800286520063200304592002800936650002300964650002300987650001301010650002001023650001101043650001501054650002401069653001501093653001501108653002401123700002301147700001901170700002101189700001901210700002501229700002001254700003501274773008101309856008101390852000901471655001201480IND60562381520221119082451.0170719e20170309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056238152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Brahmi, Nabil10aSymmetrical and unsymmetrical incorporation of active biological monomers on the surface of phosphorus dendrimers  ap. 1331-1341.  aPhosphorus-containing dendrimers are attractive carriers for the delivery of bioactive molecules due to their very particular architecture, globular shape and chemical and physical properties.

To introduce such a model applying simple data inputs, in this study a regional drought forecast method on the basis of artificial intelligence capabilities (artificial neural networks) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI in 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 monthly series) has been presented in Fars Province of Iran. The precipitation data of 41 rain gauge stations were applied for computing SPI values. Besides, weather signals including Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), NINO1+2, anomaly NINO1+2, NINO3, anomaly NINO3, NINO4, anomaly NINO4, NINO3.4, and anomaly NINO3.4 were also used as the predictor variables for SPI time series forecast the next 12 months. Frequent testing and validating steps were considered to obtain the best artificial neural networks (ANNs) models. The forecasted values were mapped in verification sector then they were compared with the observed maps at the same dates. Results showed considerable spatial and temporal relationships even among the maps of different SPI time series. Also, the first 6 months forecasted maps showed an average of 73 % agreements with the observed ones. The most important finding and the strong point of this study was the fact that although drought forecast in each station and time series was completely independent, the relationships between spatial and temporal predictions remained. This strong point mainly referred to frequent testing and validating steps in order to explore the best drought forecast models from plenty of produced ANNs models. Finally, wherever the precipitation data are available, the practical application of the presented method is possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aartificial intelligence 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adrought 3aindustry 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3arain gauges 3atime series analysis 3awater management 3aIran1 aHosseini, Mitra Esmaeilzadeh1 aAhani, Hossein1 aHakimelahi, Hemila0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2017 Jan., v. 127, no. 1-2 p.361-380dSpringer Viennax0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1624-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245007700180520131900257592002801576650001201604650002601616650002501642650001801667650001001685650002001695650002501715653002101740653001901761653002901780653002301809653002701832653002501859700001801884700002501902700001801927700001901945700001601964700001901980700002001999700002202019700002502041773010702066856008802173852000902261655001202270IND60751930220221122224311.0220205e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075193022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercure, Jean-Francois10aRisk-opportunity analysis for transformative policy design and appraisal  aThe climate crisis demands a strong response from policy-makers worldwide. The current global climate policy agenda requires technological change, innovation, labour markets and the financial system to be led towards an orderly and rapid low-carbon transition. Yet progress has been slow and incremental. Inadequacies of policy appraisal frameworks used worldwide may be significant contributors to the problem, as they frequently fail to adequately account for the dynamics of societal and technological change. Risks are underestimated, and the economic opportunities from innovation are generally not assessed in practice. Here, we identify root causes of those inadequacies and identify them to structural features of standard analysis frameworks. We use a review of theoretical principles of complexity science and the science of dynamical systems and formulate a generalisation of existing frameworks for policy analysis and the appraisal of outcomes of proposed policy strategies, to help better identify and frame situations of transformational change. We use the term “risk-opportunity analysis” to capture the generalised approach, in which conventional economic cost-benefit analysis is a special case. New guiding principles for policy-making during dynamic and transformational change are offered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acost benefit analysis 3aenvironmental policy 3aglobal change 3alabor 3apolicy analysis 3atechnological change 0aPolicy appraisal 0aClimate policy 0aScience-policy interface 0aComplexity science 0aEvolutionary economics 0aPublic policy-making1 aSharpe, Simon1 aViñuales, Jorge E.,1 aIves, Matthew1 aGrubb, Michael1 aLam, Aileen1 aDrummond, Paul1 aPollitt, Hector1 aKnobloch, Florian1 aNijsse, Femke J.M.M.0 tGlobal environmental change.g2021 Sept., v. 70 p.102359-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.1023593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011500169300001300284520108000297592002801377650002101405650001301426650001601439650001701455650002001472650000901492650002101501650002001522650001801542650003001560650001501590650001401605650001501619650001301634650002401647650001701671700006001688700005801748773012201806856008201928852000902010655001202019IND60700386220221122032632.0201216e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070038622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2020.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumamoto, Carol A14aThe gut, the bad and the harmless: Candida albicans as a commensal and opportunistic pathogen in the intestine  ap. 7-15.  aCandida albicans is a regular member of the intestinal microbiota in the majority of the human population. This underscores C. albicans’ adaptation to life in the intestine without inducing competitive interactions with other microbes, or immune responses detrimental to its survival. However, specific conditions such as a dysbalanced microbiome, a suppression of the immune system, and an impaired intestinal barrier can predispose for invasive, mostly nosocomial, C. albicans infections. Colonization of the intestine and translocation through the intestinal barrier are fundamental aspects of the processes preceding life-threatening systemic candidiasis. Insights into C. albicans’ commensal lifestyle and translocation can thus help us to understand how patients develop candidiasis, and may provide leads for therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing infection. In this review, we discuss the commensal lifestyle of C. albicans in the intestine, the role of morphology for commensalism, the influence of diet, and the interactions with bacteria of the microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3abacteria 3acandidiasis 3acommensalism 3across infection 3adiet 3ahuman population 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alifestyle 3amicrobiome 3apatients 3asecondary infection 3atherapeutics1 aGresnigt, Mark S1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9514-46341 aHube, Bernhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6028-04250 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 56 p.7-15dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2020.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01241naa a2200205 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245006500132300001800197520060800215592002800823650002100851650001500872773012700887852000901014655001201023IND60300899220221122055501.0150703e20130322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030089922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMervis, Jeffrey10aSuresh Leaves His Mark on NSF as He Heads to Carnegie Mellon  ap. 1380-1381.  aThe Indian-born, U.S.-trained mechanical engineer is leaving his position as director of the National Science Foundation less than halfway through his 6-year term to become president of Carnegie Mellon University.

The study aimed to estimate the external costs of silicon production to inform policy on the sustainable exploitation of solar energy. Specifically, the study estimated the cost of health damage and agricultural loss resulting from the pollution of silicon production. The data was collected from a silicon industrial zone in Southwest China. The cost of agricultural loss was estimated using a production function method, while the cost of health damage was estimated using dose-response functions, in which the air pollutant concentration was estimated based on a Gaussian dispersion model. The results show that the annual external cost of agricultural loss is CNY 0.76–4.13 million and that of health damage is CNY 26.53–44.63 million, or a total external cost is CNY 27.29–48.76 million. The average external cost is CNY 447.35 (CNY 321.1–473.82) per ton of metallurgical silicon. This information has implication for making policies on the control of pollution and the sustainable development of solar energy industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aalternative energy industry 3adose response 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3apollution control 3aproduction functions 3asilicon 3asolar energy 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aPhotovoltaic oriented silicon 0aExternal cost 0aAgricultural loss 0aHealth damage1 aWei, Wei0 tEnergy Policy.g2017 Aug., v. 107 p.437-447dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245015800159300001800317520156600335592002801901650002101929650002501950650001301975650000901988650001201997650001202009650001202021700002002033700002302053700002702076700002202103700002102125700006402146773014702210856007602357852000902433655001202442IND60603104820180905000000.0180712e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060310482DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b041512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCulcu, Gursu10aHeterobimetallic Complexes Comprised of Nb and Fe: Isolation of a Coordinatively Unsaturated NbIII/Fe0 Bimetallic Complex Featuring a Nb≡Fe Triple Bond  ap. 9627-9636.  aHeterometallic multiple bonds between niobium and other transition metals have not been reported to date, likely owing to the highly reactive nature of low-valent niobium centers. Herein, a C₃-symmetric tris(phosphinoamide) ligand framework is used to construct a Nb/Fe heterobimetallic complex Cl–Nb(ⁱPrNPPh₂)₃Fe−Br (2), which features a Fe→Nb dative bond with a metal–metal distance of 2.4269(4) Å. Reduction of 2 in the presence of PMe₃ affords Nb(ⁱPrNPPh₂)₃Fe–PMe₃ (6), a compound with an unusual trigonal pyramidal geometry at a Nbᴵᴵᴵ center, a Nb≡Fe triple bond, and the shortest bond distance (2.1446(8) Å) ever reported between Nb and any other transition metal. Complex 6 is thermally unstable and degrades via P–N bond cleavage to form a Nbⱽ═NR imide complex, ⁱPrN═Nb(ⁱPrNPPh₂)₃Fe−PMe₃ (9). The heterobimetallic complexes ⁱPrN═Nb(ⁱPrNPPh₂)₃Fe−Br (8) and 9 are independently synthesized, revealing that the strongly π-bonding imido functionality prevents significant metal–metal interactions. The ⁵⁷Fe Mössbauer spectra of 2, 6, 8, and 9 show a clear trend in isomer shift (δ), with a decrease in δ as metal–metal interactions become stronger and the Fe center is reduced. The electronic structure and metal–metal bonding of 2, 6, 8, and 9 are explored through computational studies, and cyclic voltammetry is used to better understand the effect of metal–metal interaction in early/late heterobimetallic complexes on the redox properties of the two metals involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3ageometry 3airon 3aisomers 3aligands 3aniobium1 aIovan, Diana A.1 aKrogman, Jeremy P.1 aWilding, Matthew J.

As a consequence, mate choice may be an important driver of allelic diversity. A complementary sex determination (CSD) system is responsible for intraspecific allelic incompatibility in many species of ants, bees, and wasps. CSD may thus favour disassortative mating and in this, resembles the MHC of the vertebrate immune system, or the self-incompatibility (SI) system of higher plants. RESULTS: Here we show that in the monogamous parasitic wasp Bracon brevicornis (Wesmael), females are able to reject partners with incompatible alleles. Forcing females to accept initially rejected partners resulted in sex ratio distortion and partial infertility of offspring. CONCLUSIONS: CSD-disassortative mating occurred independent of kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance in our experiment. The fitness consequences of mate choice are directly observable, not influenced by environmental effects, and more severe than in comparable systems (SI or MHC), on individuals as well as at the population level. Our results thus demonstrate the strong potential of female mate choice for maintaining high offspring fitness in this species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApoidea 3aBracon 3aFormicidae 3aalleles 3aenvironmental impact 3afemales 3aimmune system 3ainbreeding 3akin recognition 3aloci 3amating behavior 3aparasitic wasps 3aprogeny 3asex determination 3asex ratio1 aWeeda, Anne C1 ade Boer, Jetske G1 aHoffmeister, Thomas S.,0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2013 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.43-43dBioMed Centralx1742-99947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-10-433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245009500183300001800278520094200296592002801238650001201266650002001278650001401298650001401312650001101326650001201337650001701349650001101366650001201377650007101389650008001460650003401540650003701574650000901611650002401620650002601644650006901670650000901739650002501748650002701773650003601800700002301836700002001859700001901879700001701898773011001915856008102025990002302106852000902129655001202138IND60090860620221118011634.0141102e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009086062DNAL7 a242389032pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyosung10aBenzyloxybenzylammonium chlorides: Simple amine salts that display anticonvulsant activity  ap. 7655-7662.  aSeveral antiepileptic drugs exert their activities by inhibiting Na⁺ currents. Recent studies demonstrated that compounds containing a biaryl-linked motif (Ar-X-Ar′) modulate Na⁺ currents. We, and others, have reported that compounds with an embedded benzyloxyphenyl unit (ArOCH₂Ar′, OCH₂=X) exhibit potent anticonvulsant activities. Here, we show that benzyloxybenzylammonium chlorides (⁺H₃NCH₂C₆H₄OCH₂Ar′ Cl⁻) displayed notable activities in animal seizure models. Electrophysiological studies of 4-(2′-trifluoromethoxybenzyloxy)benzylammonium chloride (9) using embryonic cortical neurons demonstrated that 9 promoted both fast and slow inactivation of Na⁺ channels. These findings suggest that the potent anticonvulsant activities of the earlier compounds were due, in part, to the benzyloxyphenyl motif and provide support for the use of the biaryl-linked pharmacophore in future drug design efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aanticonvulsants 3achemistry 3achlorides 3amodels 3aneurons 3apharmacology 3asodium 2aAnimals 2aAnticonvulsantsxadministration & dosagexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aBenzylammonium Compoundsxadministration & dosagexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCerebral Cortexxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aMice 2aMolecular Structure 2aNeuronsxdrug effects 2aPhenyl Ethersxadministration & dosagexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSeizuresxdrug therapy 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aGold, Alexander S.1 aYang, Xiao-Fang1 aKhanna, Rajesh1 aKohn, Harold0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 21, no. 24 p.7655-7662dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.10.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03792naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001800167245012800185300001600313520161000329592002801939650001701967650002001984650001602004650000802020650001802028650001802046650002302064650001502087650002202102650001502124650001402139650001502153650001402168650001002182650001702192650001402209650001802223650001402241650002202255650001302277650001902290650001702309650001202326650006602338650001102404650004502415650002902460650001102489650002902500650002202529650001402551650003402565650002702599650004402626650004802670650003802718651001802756700001802774700002002792700001702812700001602829700001802845773010202863856008402965852000903049655001203058IND4470585520221120142508.0141111e20121012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447058552DNAL7 a225951392pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, V.S.10aInvestigation of postpartum dairy cows’ uterine microbial diversity using metagenomic pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene  ap. 460-469.  aThe objective of this study was the use of metagenomic pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for the investigation of postpartum dairy cows’ uterine bacterial diversity. The effect of subcutaneous supplementation of a trace mineral supplement containing Zn, Mn, Se, and Cu (Multimin North America, Inc., Fort Collins, CO) at 230 days of gestation and 260 days of gestation on dairy cows’ uterine microbiota was also evaluated. Uterine lavage samples were collected at 35 DIM and were visually scored for the presence of purulent or mucopurulent secretion. The same samples were also used for the acquisition of bacterial DNA. The 16S rRNA genes were individually amplified from each sample. Pyrosequencing of the samples was carried at the Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratories Center using Roche 454 GS-FLX System Titanium Chemistry. The Ribosomal Database Project online tools were used for the analysis of the obtained sequences library.

This paper proposes a novel digital photographic technique for estimating canopy light interception based on the shadow projected by trees on the ground surface. A total of 607 pictures taken from 20 different walnut and almond orchards across California, USA, and with canopy covers ranging from 5 to 98 % were processed to derive canopy shadow fraction and compared with LI recorded at the same time and location from a mobile platform of ceptometers, the mobile light bar (MLB), which systematically collected data as it is moved under the trees. Light interception values obtained with the photographic technique were highly correlated and very similar to those of the MLB (R² = 0.95).The contribution of MLB sampling error and other factors that lead to differences in light interception values between the two methods was analyzed and discussed. The image acquisition and processing in this new technique does not require special or expensive equipment, software or training and can be easily adopted by researchers and farmers, and the generated information can be combined with satellite imagery to extend to the orchard and regional scales. The advantages and limitations of the proposed technique are discussed along with suggestions for further improvements and automation which could lead to more accurate results and wider application for research and crop management purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmonds 3aautomation 3acanopy 3acomputer software 3acrop management 3acrops 3adigital images 3aequipment 3aevapotranspiration 3aorchards 3aphotosynthesis 3aprimary productivity 3aremote sensing 3atrees 3avegetation 3awalnuts 3aCalifornia1 aMetcalf, Samuel1 aStewart, William1 aUstin, Susan L.1 aLampinen, Bruce0 tPrecision agriculture.g2015 Aug., v. 16, no. 4 p.425-440dSpringer USx1385-22567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-015-9387-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245015500166520149600321592002801817650001001845650002201855650002301877650000901900650001101909650001701920650002101937650002701958650001301985650002201998650001202020650001002032650002002042650001702062650002102079650001802100700002802118700002802146700002002174700002302194773012202217856007902339852000902418655001202427IND60676986820221117223256.0191122e20191116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067698682DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy91107622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayans, Begoña 10aEvaluation of Commercial Humic Substances and Other Organic Amendments for the Immobilization of Copper Through 13C CPMAS NMR, FT-IR, and DSC Analyses  aThe application of organic amendments to contaminated agricultural lands can immobilize metals and improve soil conditions. The chemical structures and long-term stability of commercial humic substances and other composted organic amendments (sheep and horse manure, vermicompost, pine bark, and pruning waste) were analyzed using 13C CPMAS NMR, FT-IR, and DSC to evaluate their use in soil remediation. The interactions of humic substances and manure with Cu (0 and 5000 mg kg&minus;1) at different pH (2.5 and 5.0) were studied through a batch adsorption experiment observing the changes in their molecular structure using spectroscopic techniques. Humic substances exhibited high aromaticity and phenolic and carboxylic group content, with great affinity for Cu complexation. Humic substances and pruning waste were the most stable due to their high recalcitrant organic matter contents, whereas manure was the least stable, given the labile nature of its organic matter content. There were considerable changes in the carboxylic and phenolic groups of humic substances with pH, and also with Cu, albeit in a lesser extent, especially at pH 5.0, suggesting the great sorption capacity of humic substances and the key role of pH and these functional groups in metal complexation. Manure did not exhibit such changes. Commercial humic substances could be useful amendments for the remediation of contaminated agricultural soils due to their high sorption capacities and long-term stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3abark 3acopper 3ahorse manure 3ahumic substances 3aimmobilization in soil 3amoieties 3aorganic compounds 3apruning 3asheep 3asoil amendments 3asoil quality 3asoil remediation 3avermicomposts1 aPérez-Esteban, Javier 1 aEscolástico, Consuelo 1 aEymar, Enrique 1 aMasaguer, Alberto 0 tAgronomy.g2019 Nov. 16, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy91107623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008800166300001600254500001100270520120500281592002801486650004901514650001901563650001601582650002801598650001901626650001301645650002301658650001801681650004001699650001801739650001401757650001301771650001701784650002101801700003401822773009501856856008101951852000902032655001202041IND60586100620221119200819.0171116e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058610062DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-017-0220-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, Yuta10aDietary Patterns and Cardiovascular Disease Prevention among Patients with Diabetes  ap. 299-306.  aReview  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the most recent literature on dietary patterns and their effects on cardiovascular health among patients with diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies identified examined low-fat, low-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean dietary patterns. A limited number of short-term studies showed that intake of low-fat, low-carbohydrate, and low-glycemic index dietary patterns reduced body weight and blood pressure among individuals with diabetes. Short-term consumption of the DASH dietary pattern reduced blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in patients with diabetes. Most convincing evidence supports the effectiveness of Mediterranean dietary patterns in cardiovascular disease prevention by reducing cardiovascular risk factors and mortality among patients with diabetes, as supported by a prospective cohort study, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses. Among the dietary patterns identified, Mediterranean dietary patterns should be considered as primary nutritional recommendation for cardiovascular disease prevention among individuals with diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet 3ablood pressure 3abody weight 3acardiovascular diseases 3acohort studies 3adiabetes 3adisease prevention 3aeating habits 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3apatients 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols1 aSattler, Elisabeth Lilian Pia0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2017 Dec., v. 6, no. 4 p.299-306dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-017-0220-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245011000187300001800297520162700315592002801942650002301970650001101993650002002004650001702024650002102041650001902062650002502081650001502106650001502121650002702136650001402163650002002177650002102197650001202218650001102230650003902241650002502280650000902305650003102314651001102345653002002356653002202376653002502398653001102423700001902434700001702453700001602470700001602486700001802502700001702520773010902537856005102646852000902697655001202706IND50087242520221120214357.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008724252DNAL7 a236596602pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2013.7882562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPezzolato, M.10aHistopathology as a simple and reliable method to detect 17β-oestradiol illegal treatment in male calves  ap. 1096-1099.  a17β-Oestradiol is a steroid hormone banned as a growth promoter in food-producing animals all over Europe because of its carcinogenicity. Despite mandatory monitoring of illegal treatment all over Europe, official analytical methods in use test negative a few days after 17β-oestradiol administration, requiring new sensitive tools to ensure a high level of protection for consumers. The aim of this work was the evaluation of the accuracy of histopathology and immunohistochemistry for progesterone receptor (PR) as a screening method for the detection of low-dosage illegal treatments with 17β-oestradiol. Fresian male calves (153) were farmed under controlled conditions, and 89 of them were treated with 17β-oestradiol (5 mg/animal once a week for 4 weeks). After 15 days of suspension, all animals were slaughtered and sexual accessory glands (prostate and bulbo-urethral glands) were sampled for histological examination and immunohistochemical staining with anti-PR antibody (clone hPRa 2). Microscopically 86 out of 89 bulbo-urethral glands showed mild to severe metaplasia, while mild metaplasia was observed only in 1 control. Eighteen out of 89 samples of prostate did not show metaplastic lesions. Immunopositivity for PR characterised all treated animals, while no signal was detected in controls. These findings show that metaplasia of the sexual accessory glands is a sensitive and specific parameter for illegal 17β-oestradiol treatment in calves at the slaughterhouse, while the appliance of immunohistochemistry for PR can improve to 100% the accuracy of this highly reliable histological approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acalves 3acarcinogenicity 3afood animals 3agrowth promotion 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ametaplasia 3amonitoring 3aprogesterone receptors 3ascreening 3aslaughterhouses 3asteroid hormones 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aEstradiolxadministration & dosage 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMale 2aReproducibility of Results 3aEurope 0a17β-oestradiol 0aillicit treatment 0aimmunohistochemistry 0acalves1 aRichelmi, G.B.1 aMaurella, C.1 aPitardi, D.1 aVarello, K.1 aCaramelli, M.1 aBozzetta, E.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2013 June 1, v. 30, no. 6 p.1096-1099dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2013.788256  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001800165245011900183300001400302500001500316520113800331592002801469650001901497650002801516650001301544650002101557650001101578650001501589650002501604650001601629650001401645650001601659650001201675650002001687650003301707650001201740650001201752650002901764650005801793650004001851650005701891650006201948650003602010650002302046650002202069650002602091650003102117650001002148650003102158650006202189650003102251650005702282651001002339653002302349700001702372700001802389700001502407700001602422700001502438700001202453700001902465773011102484856008202595852000902677655001202686IND4461283320221120200933.0141112e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446128332DNAL7 a209471112pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Keshan10aRecombinant pseudorabies virus expressing P12A and 3C of FMDV can partially protect piglets against FMDV challenge  ap. 90-94.  a2019-12-06  aOne of the crucial factors for evaluation of an effective genetically engineered vaccine is whether susceptible animals are protected from virus challenge after vaccination. In this study, a recombinant pseudorabies virus (PRV-P12A3C) that expressed capsid precursor polypeptide P12A and nonstructural protein 3C of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was used as a vaccine. The expression of P12A3C and its immunogenicity and protective efficacy against FMDV challenge were measured. Humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated after each immunization. Subsequently, each piglet was challenged with 1000 ID₅₀ (50% infection dose) FMDV serotype O, named OR/80, which is used to produce vaccine in China. PRV-P12A3C induced a high level of neutralizing antibody and FMDV-specific lymphocytes. Inactivated vaccine provided 100% protection, and the vector strain (TK⁻/gE⁻/gI⁻) showed no protection. PRV-P12A3C induced 60% protection, compared with piglets that were vaccinated with TK⁻/gE⁻/gI⁻. The severity of clinical signs for the remaining two piglets was lighter and the appearance of vesicles was delayed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aproteins 3ahumoral immunity 3acapsid 3aantibodies 3ainactivated vaccines 3alymphocytes 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3aviruses 3aimmune response 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3apiglets 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aCapsid Proteinsxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesximmunology 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirectxveterinary 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseaseximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aHerpesvirus 1, Suidximmunology 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aImmunity, Humoral 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aPicornaviridaeximmunology 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesximmunology 2aVaccines, Syntheticxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aViral Proteinsximmunology 2aViral Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 3aChina 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aHuang, Jiong1 aWang, Qingang1 aHe, Yannan1 aXu, Zhuofei1 aXiang, Min1 aWu, Bin1 aChen, Huanchun0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2011 Aug., v. 91, no. 1 p.90-94dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2010.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01821naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007400157300002000231520089400251592002801145650002301173650001501196650000901211650002201220650001401242700001501256700002101271773014401292856007401436852000901510655001201519IND60707041720221119165613.0200812e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070704172DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03310c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shuaifei10aEmerging organic potassium-ion batteries: electrodes and electrolytes  ap. 15547-15574.  aOrganic potassium-ion batteries (OPIBs) can combine the merits of potassium-ion batteries (abundance, low cost and appropriate electrode potential of potassium) and the advantages of organic batteries (flexibility, ability of accommodating large ions, potentially low cost, green, recyclability and tunable molecular structure of organic electrode materials), and hence have become one of the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Compared with other metal-ion batteries, electrodes and electrolytes are particularly important in the current studies of OPIBs. Hence, this review, for the first time, summarizes the progress and challenges of these two unique aspects in OPIBs, provides potential solutions for high-performance OPIBs, and compares them with LIBs and SIBs. We hope this review can guide the future development of OPIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3aelectrodes 3aions 3alithium batteries 3apotassium1 aChen, Yuan1 aWang, Chengliang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 8, no. 31 p.15547-15574dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03310c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245012600180300001600306520085500322592002801177650001601205650001201221650001101233650001101244700002001255700002201275773008901297856008301386990002301469852000901492655001201501IND60096690320221123002923.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009669032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2012.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Veen, Reinier A.C.10aAgent-based analysis of the impact of the imbalance pricing mechanism on market behavior in electricity balancing markets  ap. 874-881.  aThe imbalance pricing mechanism is an important design variable within European-type electricity balancing markets that determines the incentives given to so-called Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) to balance their electricity production and consumption portfolio. To analyze the impact of alternative imbalance pricing mechanisms on balancing market performance, an agent-based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative mechanisms are analyzed. It is concluded that aiming for a small long position is generally the preferable BRP strategy. Different imbalance pricing mechanisms lead to comparable system imbalances, but single pricing results in the lowest imbalance costs for the BRPs and for the market as a whole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices1 aAbbasy, Alireza1 aHakvoort, Rudi A.0 tEnergy economics.g2012 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.874-881dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007200167300001600239520127000255592002801525650000801553650001101561650002101572650003401593650001301627650001801640650001401658650001001672650001201682650001601694650002101710700001801731700001601749700001501765700001601780700002001796700001601816773008701832856008501919852000902004655001202013IND60633259220221121065420.0200330e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063325922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2019.02.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xuewei10aHigh efficiency CNT-Si heterojunction solar cells by dry gas doping  ap. 164-171.  aCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been integrated with silicon to construct CNT-Si heterojunction solar cells; doping CNTs is one of the promising techniques to improve the solar cell performance. Here, we propose a gas-doping method by exposing as-fabricated CNT-Si solar cells to ozone for a short time. We find that a 5-min ozone treatment does not destroy the CNT structure but produces a significant impact on the cell characteristics (output voltage and fill factor), increasing the cell efficiency from 5.29% to 12.70% without degradation in 24 h. Ozone treatment donates holes to CNTs; this p-doping effect increases the work function of CNTs and subsequently enhances the built-in potential and Schottky barrier at the heterojunction for more efficient charge separation. Moreover, the ozone-treated CNT-Si cell could combine other established techniques such as colloidal antireflection and acid doping, to achieve an instantaneous high efficiency of >17% under standard illumination conditions (air mass 1.5, 100 mW/cm²). Compared to many reported doping methods relying on liquid or hazardous chemicals, our dry gas-doping strategy is very simple, highly effective, environmentally benign, and compatible to low-cost large-area solar cell manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectric potential difference 3alighting 3amanufacturing 3aozonation 3aozone 3asilicon 3asolar cells 3atoxic substances1 aWu, Huaisheng1 aYang, Liusi1 aWu, Yizeng1 aSun, Yuping1 aShang, Yuanyuan1 aCao, Anyuan0 tCarbon.g2019 June, v. 147 p.164-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2019.02.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007200140245013100212500002000343520218800363592002802551596003702579650000802616650002002624650001002644650002202654650001102676650003102687650001002718650002402728650002502752650001702777650001002794650001402804650002002818650001602838650001202854700005902866700006302925773014402988856007403132852000903206655001203215IND60674681720221121045457.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468172DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.141782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbaspour‐Gilandeh, Yousef1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9999-784514aThe effect of microwave and convective dryer with ultrasound pre‐treatment on drying and quality properties of walnut kernel  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, the drying kinetics of walnuts was investigated including specific energy consumption (SEC), shrinkage, and walnut kernels' color in two dryers, namely ultrasonic‐convection (US‐CON) and ultrasonic‐microwave (US‐MIC). To carry out this study, walnut samples were dried at three MIC powers (270, 450, and 630 W), three input air temperatures (40, 55, and 70°C) and four duration of ultrasonic pre‐treatment (0 min (control sample), 10, 20, and 40 min). Fifteen mathematical models were used to describe the walnuts' moisture ratio. The results showed that the Midilli et al. model was the best model for describing the process of drying walnuts in US‐CON and US‐MIC dryers. Effective moisture diffusivity (Dₑff) values were calculated to be between 2.77 × 10–⁹ and 5.56 × 10–⁹ m²/s for the US‐CON dryer and 3.12 × 10–⁹ to 8.99 × 10–⁹ m²/s for the US‐MIC dryer. The lowest rates of color change were observed in the US‐MIC dryer at the lowest microwave power and the lowest duration of ultrasonic pre‐treatment. The lowest SEC for the US‐CON dryer was 19.52 kWh/kg, and it was 15.90 kWh/kg for the US‐MIC dryer. The highest rate of shrinkage was 14.21%, which was seen in the US‐CON dryer at the air temperature of 70°C and the duration of ultrasonic pre‐treatment of 40 min. According to the results, the best quality of walnut with the lowest changes of color and shrinkage in the microwave dryer was calculated at microwave power 270 W and control sample. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Drying foods and agricultural products using microwave dryers is a relatively cheap method and has attracted the attention of many researchers today. Also, numerous studies have been conducted on drying agricultural products through microwave and convection dryers with ultrasound pre‐treatment. The result of this study could be applied for gathering comprehensive information regarding the drying process (kinetic, Dₑff, Eₐ, and SEC) as well as the qualitative properties (color and shrinkage) of walnut kernels dried using the microwave and convective hot air dryers accompanied by ultrasound pre‐treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Mohaghegh Ardabili 3aair 3aair temperature 3acolor 3aconvection dryers 3adrying 3aenergy use and consumption 3afoods 3amathematical models 3amoisture diffusivity 3apretreatment 3aseeds 3ashrinkage 3aspecific energy 3aultrasonics 3awalnuts1 aKaveh, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5285-22111 aJahanbakhshi, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1944-30900 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14178-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.141783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007600162300001600238500001900254520143100273592002801704650002201732650001001754650002201764650001701786650001201803650002001815650002301835653002701858653002701885653002601912653002801938653001801966700001801984700001802002773011502020856007702135852000902212655001202221IND60683270620221119195935.0200207s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068327062DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2019-01702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtemer, W.A.14aThe energy cost of feather replacement is not intrinsically inefficient  ap. 142-148.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFeathers serve a diversity of functions in birds and their continuous use and exposure to the environment requires a scheduled moult to maintain their full functionality. As feathers represent about 25% of a bird’s protein content, moult is expected to impose substantial energy and nutrient demands, but perhaps not to the extent reported. Energy conversion efficiencies for feather formation are among the lowest for any biological structure examined, but this assumes that increases in maintenance energy requirements (minimum resting metabolic rate (RMRₘᵢₙ)) during moult are predominately due to feather synthetic costs. We tested this assumption by comparing the RMRₘᵢₙ and protein turnover rates of House Sparrows (Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758)) during peak moult and in a non-moulting cohort before and 12 days after having a similar amount of feathers plucked. Replacement of plucked feathers had no effect on metabolic rate, whereas RMRₘᵢₙ was 28% higher in moulting than in non-moulting House Sparrows. Protein turnover rates were lowest in non-moulting birds, but rate differences between non-moulting and moulting birds were threefold higher than those between non-moulting and plucked House Sparrows. Thus, the energy inefficiencies reported for feather replacement are mainly due to costs associated with coincident processes rather than being a direct cost of feather synthesis per se.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasser domesticus 3abirds 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy costs 3amolting 3aprotein content 3aprotein metabolism 0aavian moult energetics 0aresting metabolic rate 0aprotein turnover rate 0amoult energy efficiency 0aHouse Sparrow1 aAddison, B.A.1 aKlasing, K.C.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2020, v. 98, no. 2 p.142-148dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2019-01703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04001naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245013600186300001800322500001500340520186100355592002802216650001402244650002202258650001502280650002402295650001302319650000902332650001802341650001702359650001802376650001302394650003302407650001602440650001002456650001802466650001602484650001002500650002502510650002002535650005202555650001802607650002302625650001702648650002202665651001902687651001902706653001602725653003102741653002002772653002102792653002402813653002302837653001402860653001302874653001802887653002802905653001702933700002002950700002002970700002102990700002303011700002503034700001903059773008403078856008403162852000903246655001203255IND60088343220221118171609.0160901e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008834322DNAL7 a235625632pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Chunming10aTravel distance and transformation of injected emulsified zerovalent iron nanoparticles in the subsurface during two and half years  ap. 4095-4106.  a2019-12-06  aNanoscale zerovalent iron (NZVI) such as Toda Kogyo RNIP-10DS has been used for site remediation, yet information is lacking regarding how far injected NZVI can travel, how long it lasts, and how it transforms to other minerals in a groundwater system. Previously we reported effective mass destruction of chlorinated ethenes dominated by tetrachloroethene (PCE) using emulsified zerovalent iron (EZVI) nanoparticles of RNIP-10DS in a shallow aquifer (1–6 m below ground surface, BGS) at Site 45, Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, South Carolina, USA. Here we report test results on transport and transformation of injected EZVI in the subsurface. We employed two EZVI delivery methods: pneumatic injection and direct injection. Effective delivery of EZVI to the targeted zone was achieved with pneumatic injection showing a travel distance from injection points of up to 2.1 m and direct injection showing a travel distance up to 0.89 m. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy studies on particles harvested from well purge waters indicated that injected black colored NZVI (α-Fe0) was transformed largely to black colored cube-like and plate-like magnetites (Fe3O4, 0.1–1 μm, 0–9 months), then to orange colored irregularly shaped lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH, 0.1–1 μm, 9 months to 2.5 years), then to yellowish lath-like goethite (α-FeOOH, 2–5 μm, 2.5 years) and ferrihydrite-like spherical particles (0.05–0.1 μm) in the top portion of the aquifer (1–2 m BGS). No α-Fe0 was found in most monitoring wells three months after injection. The formed iron oxides appeared to have a wider range of particle size (submicron to 5 μm) than the pristine NZVI (35–140 nm). Injected NZVI was largely transformed to magnetite (0.1–1 μm) during two and half years in the lower portion of the aquifer (3–6 m).  aPublisher supplied data 3amagnetite 3aX-ray diffraction 3amonitoring 3atetrachloroethylene 3agoethite 3airon 3alepidocrocite 3achlorination 3aparticle size 3aaquifers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aremediation 3acolor 3ananoparticles 3agroundwater 3awells 2aEmulsionsxchemistry 2aIronxchemistry 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aParticle Size 2aSurface Properties 2aTime Factors 2aX-Ray Diffraction 3aSouth Carolina 0aSouth Carolina 0airon oxides 0aEmulsified zerovalent iron 0aTravel distance 0aDirect injection 0aPneumatic injection 0aNanoiron corrosion 0aMagnetite 0aGoethite 0aLepidocrocite 0aGroundwater remediation 0aFerrihydrite1 aPuls, Robert W.1 aKrug, Thomas A.1 aWatling, Mark T.1 aO'Hara, Suzanne K.1 aQuinn, Jacqueline W.1 aRuiz, Nancy E.0 tWater research.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 47 p.4095-4106dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245009000203300001100293506007600304520141200380592002801792506003701820650001601857650001701873650001401890650002001904650001701924650001801941650001401959650002701973650001402000650001402014700002102028700001802049700001802067700001902085700005902104773011602163856008202279852000902361655001202370IND60586100920221207085714.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058610092DNAL7 a10.1186/s40529-017-0200-z2doi7 aPMC56880512pmcid7 a291431462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, Ya-Zhu10aScreening transferable microsatellite markers across genus Phalaenopsis (Orchidaceae)  ap. 48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Molecular identification based on microsatellite loci is an important technology to improve the commercial breeding of the moth orchid. There are more than 30,000 cultivars have been enrolled at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). In this study, genomic microsatellite primer sets were developed from Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana to further examine the transferability of across 21 Phalaenopsis species. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight polymorphic microsatellite markers were obtained using the magnetic bead enrichment method, with high transferability of the 21 species of the genus Phalaenopsis, especially in the subgenus Phalaenopsis. The 28 newly developed polymorphic microsatellite markers with high polymorphism information content values. The best and second fit grouping (K) are inferred as two and four by the ΔK evaluation in the assignment test. This result indicates that these microsatellite markers are discernible to subgenus Phalaenopsis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that these new microsatellite markers are useful for delimiting species within genus Phalaenopsis. As expected, the genetic relationships between species of subgenus Phalaenopsis can be well distinguished based on the assignment test. These molecular markers could apply to assess the paternity of Phalaenopsis as well as investigating hybridization among species of genus Phalaenopsis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA primers 3aPhalaenopsis 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3ahorticulture 3ahybridization 3amagnetism 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apaternity 3ascreening1 aShih, Huei-Chuan1 aTsai, Chi-Chu1 aHo, Hsing-Hua1 aLiao, Pei-Chun1 aChiang, Yu-Chung1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0551-93090 tBotanical studies.g2017 Dec., v. 58, no. 1 p.48-48dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22891x1999-31107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-017-0200-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245013100160300001600291500001900307520137100326592002801697650001101725650002101736650001901757650001501776650001201791651001401803653001201817653001401829653002401843653002601867653002401893700002401917700002101941700001701962773011501979856007702094852000902171655001202180IND60683270720221119200334.0200207s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068327072DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2019-01802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwerdt, L.10aThermal preferences and effects of temperature on fitness parameters of an endemic Argentinean tarantula (Grammostola vachoni)  ap. 134-141.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMygalomorphs depend on thermal microhabitats for successful behavior, but their thermal biology is still poorly known. Grammostola vachoni Schiapelli and Gerschman, 1961 is an endemic tarantula from Argentina and it is listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. However, little is known about its biology; therefore, we attempted to explore the thermal biology of juveniles and adult females of G. vachoni under laboratory conditions. We characterized the preferred temperatures, evaluated the relationship between temperature and locomotor performance, and calculated the thermal sensitivity. Individuals showed a peak temperature preference and spent 40% of the total time at 25–29 °C; we did not find any significant differences in temperature preference between juveniles and females. We found that locomotor performance is strongly affected by high temperatures. Different sprint speeds of juveniles and females were found at 5, 35, and 40 °C. The highest thermal sensitivity was recorded in the lowest temperature range and thermal sensitivity was lowest in the highest temperature ranges. Our results are relevant in the context of climate change, because thermal parameters constitute a useful tool to explore some possible effects of this change on body temperature and thus the physiological performance and vulnerability of ectotherms like G. vachoni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody temperature 3aclimate change 3aectothermy 3azoology 3aArgentina 0aendemic 0atarantula 0aGrammostola vachoni 0alocomotor performance 0athermal sensitivity1 ade Villalobos, A.E.1 aPérez-Miles, F.1 aFerretti, N.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2020, v. 98, no. 2 p.134-141dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2019-01803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245007500193300001600268500001500284520208800299592002802387650001902415650001502434650001502449650002402464650002602488650001502514650002202529650000902551650002102560650001402581650002102595650002502616650001502641650001702656650001102673650001702684650001202701650004702713650002902760650000902789650001102798650000902809650003902818650006802857650005002925653001702975700002302992700002703015773012103042856005503163852000903218655001203227IND4470132520221118044947.0120821e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447013252DNAL7 a226423202pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2012.00714.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoward, Jannicke,10aDiabetes mellitus affects the duration of action of vecuronium in dogs  ap. 472-479.  a2019-12-06  aObjective To compare the duration of action of vecuronium in diabetic dogs with a control group. Study design Prospective clinical study. Animals Forty client‐owned diabetic (n = 20) and non‐diabetic dogs. Methods Dogs were considered free from other concurrent disease based on clinical examination and laboratory data. After pre‐anaesthetic medication with acepromazine and methadone, anaesthesia was induced with intravenous (IV) propofol and maintained with isoflurane‐nitrous oxide in oxygen. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) was achieved with vecuronium, 0.1 mg kg−1 IV and its effects recorded by palpation (pelvic limb digital extension) and electromyography (m. tibialis cranialis) of responses (twitches; T) to repeated train‐of‐four (TOF) nerve stimulation. Time to onset of NMB was the period between vecuronium injection and loss of fourth twitch (T4) in the TOF pattern recorded by EMG and palpation. Duration of NMB was defined as the time from drug administration to return of T1 by palpation (T1tactile) and EMG (T1EMG). Times to return of T2‐4 were also recorded. Time from induction of anaesthesia to vecuronium injection was recorded. Heart rate, non‐invasive mean arterial pressure, body temperature, end‐tidal isoflurane and end‐tidal CO2 concentrations were recorded at onset of NMB and when T1EMG returned. Loss and return of palpable and EMG responses for diabetic and non‐diabetic dogs were compared using t‐tests and Mann Whitney U‐tests. Results There were significant (p < 0.05) differences between diabetic and non‐diabetic dogs for the return of all four palpable and EMG responses. Times (mean ± SD) for return of T1tactile were 13.2 ± 3.5 and 16.9 ± 4.2 minutes in diabetic and non‐diabetic dogs respectively. There were no differences between diabetic and non‐diabetic dogs in the time to onset of vecuronium with EMG or tactile monitoring. Conclusions and clinical relevance The duration of action of vecuronium was shorter in diabetic dogs as indicated by both tactile and EMG monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aheart rate 3aanesthesia 3aprospective studies 3aintravenous injection 3amonitoring 3adiabetes mellitus 3adogs 3abody temperature 3amethadone 3aelectromyography 3aclinical examination 3aisoflurane 3aacepromazine 3aoxygen 3anerve tissue 2aAnimals 2aDiabetes Mellitusxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxmetabolism 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNeuromuscular Blockadexveterinary 2aNeuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agentsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aVecuronium Bromidexmetabolismxpharmacology. 0adrug therapy1 aLeece, Elizabeth A1 aBrearley, Jacqueline C0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2012 Sept., v. 39, no. 5 p.472-479dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2012.00714.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245013000192300001800322520110900340592002801449650001501477650001501492650001201507650002401519650002201543650002201565650001301587650001901600650001501619650000701634650001501641650002101656650001701677650002101694650001401715650003401729650002101763650003301784650002401817650003301841650003101874650001301905650001001918650006501928650004301993650003402036650003402070650001402104650003302118650003502151650002302186650001602209650001602225650002402241650003202265653002302297653001502320653001502335653001902350653002102369653002202390700002102412700001902433700001902452773008402471856008402555852000902639655001202648IND60088343420221118171601.0160901e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008834342DNAL7 a235872642pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Saliby, Ibrahim10aAdsorption and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue over hydrogen–titanate nanofibres produced by a peroxide method  ap. 4115-4125.  aIn this study, Degussa P25 TiO2 was partially dissolved in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide at high pH. The fabrication of nanofibres proceeded by the hydrothermal treatment of the solution at 80 °C. This was followed by acid wash in HCl at pH 2 for 60 min, which resulted in the formation of hydrogen–titanate nanofibres. The nanofibres were annealed at 550 °C for 6 h to produce crystalline anatase nanofibres. The nanofibres were characterised for physico-chemical modifications and tested for the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a model water pollutant. An average specific surface area of 31.54 m2/g, average pore volume of 0.10 cm3/g and average pore size of 50 Å were recorded. The nanofibres were effective adsorbents of the model pollutant and adsorbents and good photocatalysts under simulated solar light illumination. No reduction in photocatalytic activity was observed over three complete treatment cycles, and the effective separation of nanofibres was achieved by gravity settling resulting in low residual solution turbidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3agravity 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alighting 3amethylene blue 3ananofibers 3apH 3aphotolysis 3asodium hydroxide 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 3aturbidity 2aAdsorptionxradiation effects 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCatalysisxradiation effects 2aHydrogenxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLight 2aMethylene Bluexisolation & purificationxradiation effects. 2aNanofibersxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aNephelometry and Turbidimetry 2aPhotolysisxradiation effects 2aSolutions 2aSpectrometry, X-Ray Emission 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aStatic Electricity 2aSuspensions 2aTemperature 2aTitaniumxchemistry 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aWater purification 0aAdsorption 0aNanofibres 0aPhotocatalysis 0aTitanium dioxide 0aHydrogen peroxide1 aErdei, László,1 aKim, Chong-ho,1 aShon, Ho Kyong0 tWater research.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 47 p.4115-4125dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245015400187300001800341520125400359592002801613650001101641650001501652650001901667650001101686650001901697650001901716650001501735650001901750650002901769650004201798650001201840650001101852650001101863650005701874650003501931653003901966653000902005653002202014653001202036653002002048653002802068653001802096700002102114700002102135700002402156773010902180856005102289852000902340655001202349IND50087242820221120193134.0140412e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008724282DNAL7 a237679762pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2013.7943072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Rijke, Eva10aConfirmation and 3D profiling of anabolic steroid esters in injection sites using imaging desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI) mass spectrometry  ap. 1012-1019.  aIn this study, desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI) linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (MSⁿ) was applied for the confirmation and three-dimensional profiling of anabolic steroid esters in an injection site of bovine muscle. The spatial resolution of the DESI-MSⁿ was demonstrated by scanning hormone esters and marker ink lines drawn at various distances on a microscopic slide at set distances, using an x-scanner with manual y and z adjustment. Tissue slices of bovine muscle injected with a hormone cocktail were analysed. All anabolic steroid esters could be directly detected in the sample and confirmed on the basis of identification points awarded for selected MS/MS transitions according to the performance criteria given in Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Moreover, the injection site could be mapped by two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging MS, showing a horizontal and vertical distribution through the muscle tissue. This DESI approach offers potential for analysis of injection sites of steroid esters from illegally treated animals; moreover, direct analysis by ambient imaging DESI-MS still allows conventional extraction and analysis of the whole tissue for further confirmatory or contra-analysis afterwards.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3adesorption 3adigital images 3aesters 3aimage analysis 3ainjection site 3aionization 3amuscle tissues 3atandem mass spectrometry 2aAnabolic Agentsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aEsters 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aSteroidsxanalysisxchemistry. 0adesorption electrospray ionisation 0aDESI 0amass spectrometry 0aimaging 0ainjection sites 0aanabolic steroid esters 0abovine tissue1 aHooijerink, Dick1 aSterk, Saskia S.1 aNielen, Michel W.F.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2013 June 1, v. 30, no. 6 p.1012-1019dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2013.794307  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006900171300001600240520164000256592002801896650001601924650001201940650001101952650001101963650002901974650000902003651001102012651001902023700002102042773008902063856008302152990002302235852000902258655001202267IND60096690720221121212101.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009669072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eneco.2012.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindström, Erik,10aModeling extreme dependence between European electricity markets  ap. 899-904.  aElectricity spot prices are characterized by sudden large movements, followed a few days later by an equally large movement in the opposite direction. These phenomena are called spikes (upward movements) and drops (downward movements). Recent research has suggested that the dynamics of the electricity spot prices can be accurately described by hidden Markov Regime Switching (MRS) models. Regime switch models separate the ordinary dependence and the extreme (spike or drop) dependence. This is a crucial point since it is the extreme dependence that is of interest when computing risks. We fit a large number of MRS models to six European electricity markets (EEX, PowerNext, APX Power UK & NL, Nord Pool System & Sweden) in order to analyze the nature of the prices. The estimated regimes are then used to analyze the probability of an extreme event and the conditional probability for one market to experience an extreme event, conditional that another market is experiencing the same event. We find that the frequency of extreme events is positively related to the amount of renewable energy sources in the power system. It can be argued that the dependence results in this paper give an indication of what future dependence (for even more integrated markets with more renewable energy) will be. The integration of markets will lead to efficient sharing of reserves while the additional renewable energy will increase the need for reserves. The results are of interest when computing financial risks (e.g. VaR or expected shortfall), when designing reserves but also as an indication of the degree of integration between markets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3arisk 3aSweden 3aUnited Kingdom1 aRegland, Fredrik0 tEnergy economics.g2012 July, v. 34, no. 4 p.899-904dElsevier B.V.x0140-98837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2012.04.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013200205520127100337592002801608650002201636650001501658650000901673650002601682650001301708650001701721650001001738650001201748650001601760650001201776650003701788650001701825650001501842650001501857650001601872653002301888653001601911653001001927653001301937700002301950773009501973856008302068852000902151655001202160IND60755905620221120051832.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075590562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1013412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLieu, My Dong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2836-529010aImprovement of shelf-life of mangoes by chitosan coating enriched with cinnamon oil dissolved in Tween 80 combined with ethanol  aThis study aimed to evaluate the efficiency Pseudo-Ternary-Phase-Diagram (PTPD) method to improve the antifungal activity of cinnamon oil against Aspergillus niger and combined with chitosan (1.5% w/v) for mango preservation (infected A. niger spores). The results showed that the PTPD method was necessary to determine the ratio of the cinnamon oil in emulsifiers. The Minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) value of cinnamon oil in Tween 80 using the PTPD method was 240 ppm which was 33% lower than the control sample. Ethanol was necessary to increase the solubility of cinnamon oil in which the MFC value of cinnamon oil in Tween 80: ethanol (5: 1) (CTE) was 140 ppm. The UV absorption value increased when increasing cinnamon oil concentration. In the agar diffusion test, the inhibition zone was only observed when cinnamon oil concentration in CTE increased to 4MFC value. Chitosan coating slowed down the weight loss and maintain the color of mango compared to control samples whereas, the CTE though did not affect the weight loss but on color changing of mango. The combination of chitosan and CTE (3MFC value) not only reduced the negative effect on mango peel cells but also maintain the antifungal efficiency over 12 days of mango storage at 30 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aabsorption 3aagar 3aantifungal properties 3achitosan 3acinnamon oil 3acolor 3aethanol 3amango peels 3amangoes 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apolysorbates 3ashelf life 3asolubility 3aweight loss 0aNatural antifungal 0aEdible film 0aMango 0aTween 801 aDang, Thi Kim Thuy0 tFood bioscience.g2021 Dec., v. 44 p.101341-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1013413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245009700180300001400277520146000291592002801751650002101779650002401800650001901824650001201843650003301855650001901888650001601907650001701923650002801940650001701968650001201985650001101997650001302008650001002021650001802031650002502049651001702074653001902091653001502110653001702125653001702142700002302159700002102182700001702203773013802220856008602358852000902444655001202453IND60769085820221119052135.0220303e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908582DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2021.19861312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaubenheimer, Sarah Lynn10aCould CO₂-induced changes to C₄ grass flammability aggravate savanna woody encroachment?  ap. 82-95.  aFire plays an important role in maintaining the savanna tree-grass balance by limiting the recruitment of heat-sensitive tree seedlings. However, fire behaviour may change under increasing CO₂ concentrations, due to altered flammability of the grassy layer. Here, we determined the effect of predicted future CO₂ concentrations, and how it interacts with water-availability, on grass flammability and traits influential to flammability, and uncovered the physiological mechanisms underpinning these responses. Using the widespread C₄ savanna grass, Themeda triandra, as a model, we found that improved water-use efficiency under elevated CO₂ (800 ppm) resulted in a larger (greater aboveground biomass), but wetter (higher moisture content) grass fuel load, that cured at a slower rate under drought conditions. These changes were associated with increased time to ignition, reduced flaming times and reduced predicted rate of spread. We modelled the effect of altered grass flammability on fire behaviour at a national level (South Africa), finding large-scale reductions in fire spread under elevated CO₂, mitigating the converse effects of predicted increases in aridity, and marginal increases in fireline intensity. CO₂-induced reductions in fire frequency, spread or intensity could have serious implications for savanna vegetation dynamics, possibly exacerbating the woody encroachment already seen in these ecosystems across the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThemeda triandra 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon dioxide 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3afire frequency 3afire spread 3aflammability 3aforage and feed science 3afuel loading 3agrasses 3amodels 3asavannas 3atrees 3awater content 3awater use efficiency 3aSouth Africa 0aclimate change 0aC4 grasses 0aelevated CO2 0afire regimes1 aSimpson, Kimberley1 aCarkeek, Richard1 aRipley, Brad0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 39, no. 1 p.82-95dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2021.19861313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013500172300001600307520124800323592002801571650001701599650002301616650001601639650002801655650001501683650001501698650001401713650000901727651001701736653001901753653002101772653001801793653002201811700002101833700002701854773014001881856008602021852000902107655001202116IND60769085920221119052504.0220303e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076908592DNAL7 a10.2989/10220119.2021.19873212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStalmans, Marc E12aA laissez-faire management approach in a grassland landscape results in a fine-scale, spatio-temporally heterogeneous fire pattern  ap. 175-188.  aWhat are the spatio-temporal characteristics of a fire pattern that is allowed to develop over time across a species- rich, predominantly grassy landscape? More than 1 300 fires were documented over 13 years in the 48 000 ha Songimvelo Game Reserve in the Barberton Mountainland, South Africa. Most fires were set by pastoralists and were uncontrolled. Lightning fires and prescribed burns made up <2% and <8% respectively of the total area burnt. Median and mean burn areas in the 31 700 ha game-fenced section were 35 and 187 ha respectively with a fire return period of 2.9 years. In the less-grazed 14 000 ha section that receives a higher annual rainfall, median and mean fire sizes were 124 and 501 ha and the return period was 1.5 years. These fire return periods are in line with generally accepted management prescriptions for grasslands. The annual number of fires, individual patches and different fire histories occurring in a moving window across the landscape were consistently higher, compared with those resulting from a small-scale or large-scale fixed fire regime. This laissez-faire approach thus resulted in a fine-scale, dynamic fire pattern with high landscape indices that could be conducive to maintaining biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3afire regime 3aforage and feed science 3agrasslands 3alandscapes 3alightning 3arain 3aSouth Africa 0afire frequency 0afire probability 0apatch burning 0alandscape indices1 aWitkowski, Ed TF1 aBalkwill, K.q(Kevin),0 tAfrican journal of range & forage science.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 39, no. 1 p.175-188dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000042x1727-93807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/10220119.2021.19873213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018300158500002000341520138500361592002801746650003001774650002401804650002801828650001201856650002501868650001001893650001401903650001701917650001201934650001901946650001701965650001501982650001601997650002502013650001202038650002402050650000702074650001202081650001502093650002302108650001502131700001602146700005902162773014402221856007402365852000902439655001202448IND60674682120221121105726.0191029e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067468212DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.142142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalik, Muneeb10aGrowth studies of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus casei) in carrot and beetroot juice substrates  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFermentation of beetroot juice, carrot juice, and blend juice (50:50 mixtures) was done for 72 hr by lactic acid bacteria (LAB; Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus). Lactic acid content, microbial counts, pH, acidity, and sugar utilization percentage of fermented juices was analyzed at every 24 hr intervals for 72 hr, and total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity were recorded before and after fermentation. During fermentation, both total phenols and flavonoids decreased, whereas, the antioxidant activity and viable cells increased. During storage, for three weeks at 4°C the fermented juices retained their properties. LAB were found to be viable above 6 Log CFU/ml, which satisfies the norm of probiotic juices during storage and also retained the sensory properties. So, carrot and beet can serve as suitable substrate to develop a healthy drink for consumers who are allergic or intolerant to lactose and strict vegetarians. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The research highlights development of a lactic‐fermented beverage with probiotic potential and antioxidant potential. Nondairy probiotic beverage developed serves as a useful alternative for delivering healthy bacteria to vegan population and lactose‐intolerant individuals, as commercially available options are essentially dairy‐based.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3abeets 3abeverages 3acarrot juice 3acarrots 3acell viability 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3alactose 3alactose intolerance 3apH 3aphenols 3aprobiotics 3asensory properties 3avegan diet1 aBora, Jinku1 aSharma, Vasudha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8004-57590 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2019 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.e14214-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.142143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03236naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245014600183520184700329592002802176650000802204650002202212650002402234650000902258650001502267650001302282650001702295650002602312650001802338650001602356650001202372650002202384653003602406653002202442653002902464653003202493653002002525700003102545700003302576773010202609856008202711852000902793655001202802IND60755905820221120051845.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075590582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2021.1002282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChukwuneme, Chinenyenwa Fortune10aImpacts of land-use and management histories of maize fields on the structure, composition, and metabolic potentials of microbial communities  aMicrobial diversity and functionality are impacted by land-use and management practices, with studies reporting reduced microbial activities due to anthropogenic activities. In this study, we analyzed and compared the composition, diversity, and metabolic profiles of microbial communities in maize rhizosphere soils of a former grassland and an intensively cultivated land. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from maize rhizosphere and bulk samples and sequencing was performed using the shotgun metagenomic approach. Comparative analyses of the metagenomes revealed differences in the distribution of microbial communities across the soils. Alpha diversity indices (Simpson, Shannon, and Evenness) were higher in the former grassland soils and beta diversity analysis revealed a significant difference (p = 0.01) in microbial community structure between the fields, with the highest dissimilarity (21.03%) observed between the rhizosphere soils. Among all taxonomic levels in the study, a total of 23 taxa were observed to be differentially abundant in the samples. Soil pH, with a contribution of 51% and a p-value of 0.002 was the most influential soil parameter that determined microbial distribution across the soils. Differences were also observed in the abundance of metabolic pathways (alpha = 0.05) across the samples. Overall, differences in the soils’ chemical properties were attributed to land-use and management histories, which contributed to the dissimilarities observed in the microbial structural diversity and metabolic pathways. These results provide knowledge on the impact of land-use practices on microbial diversity and function in cultivated soils and create opportunities for future experiments to mine the unclassified bacteria/sequences, with the intention of discovering novel microbes of agricultural importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aagricultural land 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3agrasslands 3aland use 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3aplant biology 3arhizosphere 3asoil pH 3aspecies diversity 0aLand-use and management history 0aPlant rhizosphere 0aSoil chemical properties 0aSustainable crop production 0aTillage systems1 aAyangbenro, Ayansina Segun1 aBabalola, Olubukola Oluranti0 tCurrent plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 28 p.100228-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2021.1002283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245016500172300001600337520068700353592002801040650002501068650001601093650001301109650001901122650001401141650001601155650001501171650001301186650002101199650002201220650001701242650001101259653002701270653001601297653001601313653001401329653002101343653001701364700001601381700002301397773010001420856008701520852000901607655001201616IND60567192220221121080711.0190402e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056719222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlowacz, Marcin10aControl of anthracnose disease via increased activity of defence related enzymes in ‘Hass’ avocado fruit treated with methyl jasmonate and methyl salicylate  ap. 163-167.  aDevelopment of anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz. is one of the major issues within the avocado supply chain.

We propose a new proxy to the living environment based on the combined oxygen and sulphur stable isotope analysis of vertebrate hydroxyapatite. We tested this isotopic proxy to 64 biogenic apatite (bones) samples that represent a wide spectrum of the extant vertebrate phylogenetic diversity including crocodiles, snakes, turtles, mammals, birds, lizards, fish and amphibians. We show that the combination of these two isotopic systems allows the living environment of all these vertebrates to be unambiguously distinguished between freshwater (aquatic vs semi-aquatic), seawater (aquatic vs semi-aquatic) and terrestrial. The main goal of this study is to provide a present-day isotopic reference frame and to discuss methodological issues that will serve to interpret future oxygen and sulphur isotope results obtained either from fossil or modern skeletal material. This new isotopic approach of combined oxygen and sulphur isotope analysis will be particularly useful to document major aquatic-terrestrial transitions in the fossil record but also to better constrain the living environment of some present-day species.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish 3afossils 3afreshwater 3ahydroxyapatite 3aoxygen 3aphylogeny 3aseawater 3astable isotopes 3asulfur1 aAmiot, Romain1 aBerthet, Didier1 aFourel, François1 aSimon, Laurent1 aLécuyer, Christophe,0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2020 Apr., v. 107, no. 2 p.10-10dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl16697x0028-10427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-019-1664-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007100200500001400271506007600285520138200361592002801743506003701771650002001808650001901828650002501847650002201872650000901894650002001903650001301923650002001936650001701956651001101973700001901984773012002003856007402123852000902197655001202206IND60676987620221207125545.0191122e20191112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067698762DNAL7 a10.3390/ani91109562doi7 aPMC69124962pmcid7 a317266642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Wei-Tse 10aEvaluation of Water Scarcity Footprint for Taiwanese Dairy Farming  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRaw milk production in Taiwan has increased year after year, which means that the environmental impact might also be intensified in certain regions. To balance both consumer demand and environmental sustainability, evaluating the potential impact and understanding the causal relationship between production and environment is imperative. This study applied the life cycle assessment (LCA) protocol to explore water consumption for raw milk production from cradle to farm gate of five dairy farms in Hsinchu County and evaluate the stress-weighted water scarcity footprint (WSF) as well as the water scarcity productivity (WSP) of the 16 Taiwanese counties and cities. Results indicated that the highest stress-weighted WSF of the dairy farms for raw milk production was located in northern and central Taiwan and was around 44.8 H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>eq</inf>/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). On the other hand, both the smallest stress-weighted WSF (about 2.2 H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>eq</inf>/kg FPCM) and the highest WSP (0.749 kg FPCM/m3 water) of the dairy farms were located in Nantou and Chiayi Counties, because these two counties were the least water-stressed regions in Taiwan. The achievement of this study could be the first and important reference for the sustainable production of raw milk and optimizing the industrial policy of dairy farming by policy makers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconsumer demand 3acradle-to-gate 3aenvironmental impact 3aissues and policy 3amilk 3amilk production 3araw milk 3awater shortages 3awater stress 3aTaiwan1 aSu, Jung-Jeng 0 tAnimals.g2019 Nov. 12, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani91109563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245006700192300001800259520171800277592002801995650001502023650001302038650001902051650001602070650001202086650001402098650001902112650001502131650002102146650002302167650001002190650001802200650001702218650001202235650002302247650001202270650001302282650001302295650003102308650001402339650002502353650005202378650003802430650002602468650002202494700002202516700003102538700002202569773008702591856004802678852000902726655001202735IND50068056920221120165526.0130724e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006805692DNAL7 a232924542pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-012-2572-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aT̤āriq, Muḥammad,10aDrought alters interactions between root and foliar herbivores  ap. 1095-1104.  aDrought can alter plant quality and the strength of trophic interactions between herbivore groups, and is likely to increase in occurrence and severity under climate change. We hypothesized that changes in plant chemistry due to root herbivory and drought stress would affect the performance of a generalist and a specialist aphid species feeding on a Brassica plant. High drought stress increased the negative effect of root herbivory on the performance of both aphid species (30 % decrease in fecundity and 15 % reduction in intrinsic rate of increase). Aphid performance was greatest at moderate drought stress, though the two species differed in which treatment combination maximized performance. Nitrogen concentration was greatest in high and moderately drought-stressed plants without root herbivores and moderately drought-stressed plants under low root herbivore density, and correlated positively with aphid fecundity for both species. Glucosinolate concentrations increased 62 % under combined drought stress and root herbivory, and were positively correlated with extended aphid development time. Root herbivory did not influence relative water content and foliar biomass under normal water regimes but they decreased 24 and 63 %, respectively, under high drought stress. This study shows that drought can alter the strength of interactions between foliar and root herbivores, and that plant chemistry is key in mediating such interactions. The two aphid species responded in a broadly similar way to root herbivore and drought-stress treatments, which suggests that generalized predictions of the effects of abiotic factors on interactions between above- and below-ground species may be possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aBrassica 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3adrought 3afecundity 3aglucosinolates 3aherbivores 3anitrogen content 3aplant biochemistry 3aroots 3awater content 3awater stress 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aBiomass 2aBrassica 2aDroughts 2aGlucosinolatesxmetabolism 2aHerbivory 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & development 2aStress, Physiological 2aWaterxphysiology1 aRossiter, John T.1 aWright, D.

We performed a bibliometric analysis of the current insecticide literature (2017–2019) and used the Sustainable Development Goals roadmap to identify research topics in insecticide research that should be promoted to attain sustainable cropping systems. Bioinsecticides and integrated pest management were identified as potential substitutes for synthetic insecticides while insecticide contamination, degradation and impacts on non-target organisms were pinpointed as topics with the potential to lessen detrimental effects of synthetic insecticides. We also highlighted how peculiarities specific to the tropics (tropical climate, high biodiversity, strong traditional knowledge, insecticide regulations, lack of local scientific data, and farmer training through extension services) affect the identified research topics and why they should be taken into account. We finally suggest to combine the identified research topics in order to promote research synergies across disciplines.  aPublisher supplied data 3abibliometric analysis 3abiodiversity 3abiopesticides 3acropping systems 3aextension education 3afarmers 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainsecticides 3aintegrated pest management 3anontarget organisms 3asustainable development 3atropics1 aSilvie, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3406-62300 tCurrent opinion in insect science.g2020 Aug., v. 40 p.24-30dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23301x2214-57457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cois.2020.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245010300185300001800288520129700306592002801603650002501631650001301656650001901669650002401688650002101712650001601733650002201749650004401771650001801815650000901833650003501842650002701877650003901904650002401943650002301967650003601990651002102026653002402047653001602071653002402087653000802111653001802119700002002137700002102157700001902178700001802197700002102215700001702236700001502253700002002268700001902288700001902307773010902326856008402435852000902519655001202528IND50087243320221120193145.0150325e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008724332DNAL7 a237996452pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2013.7938262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ji Won10aIsolation and identification of a sibutramine analogue adulterated in slimming dietary supplements  ap. 1221-1229.  aA suspected sibutramine analogue was detected in a slimming functional food by an ultra performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionisation–time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-TOF/MS) method. The ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of this suspected compound showed close similarity to that of sibutramine. The sample was extracted with 70% MeOH and isolated by semi-preparative column chromatography. The structure of this compound was identified by spectroscopic analyses (nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] technique, mass and tandem mass etc.). The structure of the unknown compound was demonstrated to be [(±)-dimethyl-1-[1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)cyclobutyl]- N,N ,3-trimethylbutan-1-amine (molecular formula C ₁₇H ₂₅NCl ₂) and named as chloro-sibutramine. Compared with sibutramine, it has one more chlorine atom than the 3-cholorophenyl group so was switched to 3,4-dichlorophenyl. Until now, chloro-sibutramine was isolated for the first time from the undeclared ingredient included in dietary supplements. Although the safety of chloro-sibutramine is unknown, there is a potential health risk to consumers because of a similar skeleton to sibutramine. For public health, this sibutramine analogue has been included in the inspection list of illegal adulterants in Korea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3achlorine 3achromatography 3adietary supplements 3afunctional foods 3aingredients 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apublic health 3arisk 2aAppetite Depressantsxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aCyclobutanesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aDietary Supplements 2aDrug Contamination 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 3aKorean Peninsula 0adietary supplements 0asibutramine 0asibutramin analogue 0aNMR 0amass spectrum1 aKweon, Soon Jae1 aPark, Seon Kyung1 aKim, Jung Yeon1 aLee, Ji-Hyun,1 aHan, Kyoung Moon1 aCho, Sooyeul1 aKim, Jinho1 aHan, Soon Young1 aKim, Hyoung Ja1 aKim, Woo Seong0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2013 July 1, v. 30, no. 7 p.1221-1229dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2013.7938263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010700161300002000268520094400288592002801232650001101260650001401271650002301285650001901308700002201327700002201349773014401371856007401515852000901589655001201598IND60707042620221119165928.0200812e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070704262DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03733h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurukawa, Shinya10aCatalyst design concept based on a variety of alloy materials: a personal account and relevant studies  ap. 15620-15645.  aAn overview of our recent advances in the development of highly efficient alloy materials for catalytic applications (intermetallic compounds, pseudo-binary, solid-solution, and single-atom alloys, and their derivatives) is provided as a personal account for the design of alloy-based catalysts. A series of important and emerging alloy materials and derivatives developed by other researchers for catalytic processes, such as Heusler alloys, high-entropy alloys, and rooted catalysts, are also introduced to cover a wide variety of such catalytic materials. The presented alloy materials are classified into (1) ordered, (2) disordered (random), and (3) precursors for nanocomposites, and each of them is further classified into subcategories based on their structure differences. The role of the metal elements, structural factors, and electronic properties in enhanced catalysis is also briefly explained by atomic scale interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ananocomposites1 aKomatsu, Takayuki1 aShimizu, Ken-ichi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 8, no. 31 p.15620-15645dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03733h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245014500181300001800326506011700344506007600461520134300537592002801880506003701908650002401945650002501969650001701994650001702011650002702028650001402055650001002069650002002079650001302099650001502112651001302127653002102140653001702161653001302178653001602191653001902207700006502226773009502291856008502386852000902471655001202480IND60755906120221207092353.0220425s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075590612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaipollizan, Qurratul Aina10aLaboratory efficacy and toxicology of two commercial insecticides (deltamethrin and fenitrothion) against two German cockroach field strains  ap. 1849-1855.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), a prominent pest that requires management due to its detrimental economic and medical consequences. Several research discovered that German cockroaches were insecticide resistant, mainly commercial pesticides. One-week-old nymphs from two strains in Penang, Malaysia (Georgetown strain: EL and Greenlane strain: IC strain) were tested in the laboratory against two commercial insecticides, Cislin® 25 (deltamethrin) and Sumithion 50 (fenitrothion). The concentration of solutions used in the residual test based on the manufacturer labeling. Cislin® was tested at 1.90 ppm, 1.60 ppm, 1.30 ppm, and 1.0 ppm; Sumithion 50 was tested at 25 and 27.00 ppm, 23.00 ppm, 18.00 ppm, 14.00 ppm using the residual method. Probit analysis and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare the data. Cislin® 25 and Sumithion 50 were more effective and high toxicity against the IC strain compared with the EL strain. Sumithion 50 demonstrated a fast knockdown time on cockroaches, but Cislin® 25 showed no knockdown time. Sumithion 50 showed a significant mortality rate in cockroaches within a short period of time compared to Cislin® 25. Both insecticides were found to be effective against both strains, but Sumithion 50 is more effective at controlling cockroaches than Cislin® 25.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlattella germanica 3aanalysis of variance 3adeltamethrin 3afenitrothion 3ainsecticide resistance 3amortality 3apests 3aprobit analysis 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aMalaysia 0aGerman cockroach 0aField strain 0aToxicity 0aInsecticide 0aSusceptibility1 aAb Majid, Abdul Hafiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5297-89810 tToxicology reports.g2021, v. 8 p.1849-1855dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245012500173520091600298592002801214650001201242650001601254650002501270650001201295650001701307650001401324650001701338650001101355650001301366650001301379650000701392650002201399650001701421650001101438650001501449650001301464650002601477653001601503653001701519653001101536653001501547653000901562700003001571700002801601700002301629773013001652856008401782852000901866655001201875IND60751298820221121031004.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075129882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1028362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalali-Jivan, Mehdi10aImproving the extraction efficiency and stability of β-carotene from carrot by enzyme-assisted green nanoemulsification  aIn this study, a green solvent (water: ethanol; 98:2) was applied to extract β-carotene (BC) from carrot pomace powder (CP). The low solubility (<5%) of BC was improved (~21%) by enzymatic hydrolysis of CP with a commercial pectinase (61 U/mL, 60 min); enzymatic liquefaction of CP improved the extraction efficiency up to 90%.

HPLC data revealed that BC (60%) and α-carotene (29%) were the major carotenoids extracted into micelles of NEs, whereas lutein (9%) and lycopene (2%) as the minor ones. Finally, stability monitoring confirmed that BC in ethanolic extract from CP was completely lost, while BC in NE platform showed good stability of ~25% and 32% as exposed to UV-light and acidic conditions (pH ~ 4), respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrots 3aemulsifying 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3afood science 3alecithins 3aliquefaction 3alutein 3alycopene 3amicelles 3apH 3apolygalacturonase 3apolysorbates 3apomace 3asolubility 3asolvents 3aultraviolet radiation 0aβ-Carotene 0aNanoemulsion 0aEnzyme 0aSurfactant 0aHPLC1 aFathi-Achachlouei, Bahram1 aAhmadi-Gavlighi, Hassan1 aJafari, Seid Mahdi0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2021 Dec., v. 74 p.102836-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl69720x1466-85647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2021.1028363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010700181300001600288520161100304592002801915650001401943650000901957650001701966650002201983650001202005650003102017650001002048650001102058650001002069650001502079650002402094650005302118650002302171650004402194650003802238650001702276650002902293650002702322650002902349650002802378650003302406650003702439650004902476650002702525700001502552700001402567700001902581700001802600700001902618700001802637700001902655700001702674773008202691856004802773852000902821655001202830IND4473560020221120201010.0120626e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447356002DNAL7 a223313682pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-012-1608-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wanhong10aTryptophan decarboxylase plays an important role in ajmalicine biosynthesis in Rauvolfia verticillata   ap. 239-250.  aTryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) converts tryptophan into tryptamine that is the indole moiety of ajmalicine. The full-length cDNA of Rauvolfia verticillata (RvTDC) was 1,772 bps that contained a 1,500-bp ORF encoding a 499-amino-acid polypeptide. Recombinant 55.5 kDa RvTDC converted tryptophan into tryptamine. The K m of RvTDC for tryptophan was 2.89 mM, higher than those reported in other TIAs-producing plants. It demonstrated that RvTDC had lower affinity to tryptophan than other plant TDCs. The K m of RvTDC was also much higher than that of strictosidine synthase and strictosidine glucosidase in Rauvolfia. This suggested that TDC might be the committed-step enzyme involved in ajmalicine biosynthesis in R. verticillata. The expression of RvTDC was slightly upregulated by MeJA; the five MEP pathway genes and SGD showed no positive response to MeJA; and STR was sharply downregulated by MeJA. MeJA-treated hairy roots produced higher level of ajmalicine (0.270 mg g−1 DW) than the EtOH control (0.183 mg g−1 DW). Highest RvTDC expression level was detected in hairy root, about respectively 11, 19, 65, and 109-fold higher than in bark, young leaf, old leaf, and root. Highest ajmalicine content was also found in hairy root (0.249 mg g−1 DW) followed by in bark (0.161 mg g−1 DW) and young leaf (0.130 mg g−1 DW), and least in root (0.014 mg g−1 DW). Generally, the expression level of RvTDC was positively consistent with the accumulation of ajmalicine. Therefore, it could be deduced that TDC might be the key enzyme involved in ajmalicine biosynthesis in Rauvolfia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRauvolfia 3abark 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymes 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3aroots 3atryptophan 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylasesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlucosidasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Barkxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRauwolfiaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSecologanin Tryptamine Alkaloidsxmetabolism 2aTryptophanxmetabolism1 aChen, Rong1 aChen, Min1 aZhang, Haoxing1 aPeng, Meifang1 aYang, Chunxian1 aMing, Xingjia1 aLan, Xiaozhong1 aLiao, Zhihua0 tPlanta.g2012 July, v. 236, no. 1 p.239-250dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-012-1608-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245009800171520131600269592002801585650002301613650001301636650001601649650001501665650001501680650002301695650001501718650001601733650001201749650001001761650000901771700002601780700002201806700002601828700002201854773012301876856008001999852000902079655001202088IND60751416220221120130352.0210925e20210921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075141622DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110918922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanghansová, Lenka 14aThe Effect of the Manure from Sheep Treated with Anthelmintics on Clover (Trifolium pratense)  aThe anthelmintics (regularly administered to livestock to control the infections caused by parasitic worms) and their metabolites formed in treated animals are excreted to the environment. This contamination might have a negative influence on non-target organisms including plants. Our previous studies described the uptake, metabolism, and effects of anthelmintics in plants using in vitro models exposed to anthelmintic drugs in solutions. The present study was performed in clover grown in soil fertilized with manure from sheep treated with the recommended dose of albendazole (ABZ), ivermectin (IVM), or monepantel (MOP). The uptake and metabolism of drugs in clover were monitored for six weeks using UHPLC-MS/MS, and several stress markers (proline accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzymes activities) were evaluated. The results showed that ABZ and MOP were absorbed, metabolized, and translocated to leaves, while IVM was detected only in the roots. No or minimal drug-response was observed in monitored stress markers, and only a temporary increase of several antioxidative enzymes activities was observed. Overall, manure from sheep treated with anthelmintics does not evoke chronic stress in clover, but it can cause the entry of anthelmintics in other organisms and the food-chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium pratense 3aagronomy 3aalbendazole 3afood chain 3aivermectin 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aproline 3asheep 3asoil1 aNavratilova, Martina,1 aSkálová, Lenka 1 aMoťková, Kateřina 1 aPodlipná, Radka 0 tAgronomy.g2021 Sept. 21, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy110918923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04081naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245006300189300001600252520190800268592002802176650001602204650003102220650002502251650002202276650002002298650001002318650001102328650001702339650002102356650001102377650000902388650001402397650001202411650002502423650001202448650008102460650006902541650001602610650002702626650003702653650001202690650001002702650004502712650006002757650000902817650002602826650007102852650002202923650000902945650002502954650002002979650007202999650001703071700002003088700002403108700002403132700001803156700001903174773011203193856008103305852000903386655001203395IND4468533420221120201042.0141111e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446853342DNAL7 a217716532pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2011.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLattanzio, Francesca10aIn vivo anti-inflammatory effect of Rosa canina L. extract  ap. 880-885.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rosa canina L. is a medicinal plant largely used in traditional folk medicine. Several compounds from rose hip extracts were reported to display in vitro anti-inflammatory activities. AIM OF THE STUDY: The in vivo effects of Rosa canina extracts are still poorly investigated. In the present study the anti-inflammatory and the gastroprotective effects of a hydroalcoholic crude extract of Rosa canina fruits were tested in rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity of the extract was tested on the carrageenin-induced rat paw edema assay. The gastroprotective effect was investigated on the ethanol-induced gastric damage model. The in vitro antioxidant activity of this extract was also quantified using the Briggs–Rauscher oscillating reaction, the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity method, and the Total Phenolic Content. RESULTS: Data show that the Rosa canina extract inhibits the development of carrageenin-induced edema; the anti-inflammatory power is similar to that of indomethacin. The antiedema effect was more significant using a higher dose of the extract. The total score expressing gastric damage was lower in Rosa canina pre-treated stomachs with respect to unpre-treated ones, although the antiulcerogenic effectiveness was not statistically significant. The antiulcerogenic effectiveness was not statistically detectable, even if the total score expressing gastric damage was lower in Rosa canina stomachs from pre-treated rats with respect to unpre-treated ones. Chemical analysis revealed that the extract owns a good antioxidant activity that may also contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects observed in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the present data demonstrate the anti-inflammatory property of Rosa canina suggesting its potential role as adjuvant therapeutic tool for the management of inflammatory-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa canina 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical analysis 3adisease control 3aedema 3afruits 3aindomethacin 3amedicinal plants 3amodels 3arats 3arose hips 3astomach 3atraditional medicine 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aCarrageenan 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEthanol 2aFruit 2aGastric Mucosaxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aInflammationxchemically inducedxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aRosaxchemistry 2aStomach Ulcerxchemically inducedxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aTime Factors1 aGreco, Emanuela1 aCarretta, Donatella1 aCervellati, Rinaldo1 aGovoni, Paolo1 aSperoni, Ester0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 137, no. 1 p.880-885dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245012100173300001400294520109000308592002801398650002001426650002601446650002901472650002801501650001601529650001101545650001301556650001101569650001401580650001701594650001501611650002601626650002001652650001301672650001101685653001601696653001301712653001501725653002601740653001901766653001101785700002001796700001901816700001701835700002301852773009801875856008701973852000902060655001202069IND60567192520221121080654.0190402e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056719252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaaksonen, Oskar10aImpact of apple cultivar, ripening stage, fermentation type and yeast strain on phenolic composition of apple ciders  ap. 29-37.  aHydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids in apple juices and ciders were studied using liquid chromatography.

Part of the samples was additionally inoculated with malolactic bacteria, Oenococcus oeni. The most notable difference among the samples was the appearance of phloretin in malolactic ciders in comparison to conventional ciders and the juices. Furthermore, the apple cultivars were significantly different in their phenolic contents and compositions. Additionally, ciders and juices made from unripe apples contained more phenolic compounds than the ripe or overripe, but the effect was dependent on cultivar. The commercial yeast strains differed in the release of free HCAs, especially p-coumaric acid, during the yeast fermentation. In ciders inoculated with S. bayanus, the content was higher than in ciders fermented with S. cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOenococcus oeni 3aSaccharomyces bayanus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTorulaspora delbrueckii 3aapple juice 3aapples 3abacteria 3aciders 3acultivars 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3aliquid chromatography 3ap-coumaric acid 3aripening 3ayeasts 0aApple cider 0aCultivar 0aFlavonoids 0aHydroxycinnamic acids 0aRipening stage 0aYeasts1 aKuldjärv, Rain1 aPaalme, Toomas1 aVirkki, Mira1 aYang, B.q(Baoru),0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 233 p.29-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014700168300001600315520172000331592002802051650001502079650001602094650002102110650001602131650001502147650001702162700002002179700001702199700002002216700002802236700001802264773016802282856007402450856004502524852000902569655001202578IND60586101820221119201127.0220409s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058610182DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.121872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarooque, Aitazaz Ahsan10aInfluence of Wild Blueberry Fruit Yield, Plant Height, and Ground Slope on Picking Performance of a Mechanical Harvester: Basis for Automation  ap. 655-666.  aSpatial variability in fruit losses in relation to fruit yield, plant height, and ground slope can help to automate the wild blueberry harvester to improve picking performance. Currently, harvester operators adjust harvester’s head height, ground speed, and revolutions per minute (rpm) manually. This is not only laborious but also stressful for operators, as they encounter spatial variability during harvesting. The goal of this work was to identify the automation potential of the harvester to improve harvestable yield and reduce operator’s stress, keeping in view the spatial variability. Two fields were selected and test plots were constructed to examine the performance of the harvester in five zones of plant height, fruit yield, and ground slope. Fruit yield plant height and ground slope were recorded from each plot manually to examine their impact on total fruit loss. Keywords: Automation, Fruit losses, Spatial variability, Wild blueberry, Zonal analysis.Results confirmed significant variability in fruit yield, plant height, and ground slope. Fruit losses were significantly influenced by the spatial variations. Fruit losses increased with an increase in fruit yield and ground slope during mechanical harvesting. The picking performance of the blueberry harvester was significantly lower in short and very tall plants within selected fields. The dependence of fruit losses on fruit yield, plant height, and ground slope emphasize the need for real-time adjustments in machine operating parameters to improve berry recovery. Based on the results, it is concluded that there is a significant advantage of harvester’s automation to increase profit margins for growers with no additional cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3ablueberries 3afruit harvesters 3afruit yield 3aharvesting 3aplant height1 aZaman, Qamar Uz1 aEsau, Travis1 aChang, Young Ki1 aSchumann, Arnold Walter1 aJameel, Waqas0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2017, v. 33, no. 5 p.655-666dAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.121873Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5861018  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245012100129300001600250520091800266592002801184650002101212650002401233650002301257650002401280650002101304650001701325650001301342650001101355650001501366650002401381650001301405650001501418650001701433650001701450650001401467650000901481650000901490650001001499650001801509650001801527651001101545653001501556653001001571653001201581653001201593653001701605653001401622700002301636700001801659700001401677700001501691773013001706852000901836655001201845IND60783060620221116184515.0220714e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078306062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArjune, Y.P.10aPerformance of celery (Apium graveolens) in response to the combined effects of vermicompost and different vermiwash  ap. 216-219.  aA field study was carried out during the dry season of 2020 at the University of Guyana, Guyana, South America, to determine the combined effects of vermicompost and vermiwash produced from lemongrass [Cymbopogon citratus Staph (DC.)], moringa (Moringa oleifera Lam.), madar (Calotropis gigantea (L.)

Physico-chemical analysis after harvesting showed the highest nitrogen (14.5 mg/L), phosphorus (703.9 mg/L) and potassium (1326.2 mg/L) levels in the soil of treatment with vermicompost + vermiwash + madar (T₁).  aPublisher supplied data 3aApium graveolens 3aCalotropis gigantea 3aCalotropis procera 3aCymbopogon citratus 3aMoringa oleifera 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomy 3acelery 3adry season 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3apotassium 3arice 3asoil 3astraw 3avermicomposts 3awater content 3aGuyana 0aLemongrass 0aMadar 0aMoringa 0aOrganic 0aVermicompost 0aVermiwash1 aGomathinayagam, S.1 aJaikishun, S.1 aGupta, R.1 aAnsari, A.0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2022 June, v. 67, no. 2 p.216-219dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014600174300001600320500001500336520191800351592002802269650002402297650002602321650001002347650002902357650000902386650001702395650001602412650001202428650002002440650002402460650002102484650003402505650001602539651002002555653001702575700001702592700002602609700002102635700001702656773008502673856008902758852000902847655001202856IND60111704320221117225256.0150809e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011170432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Renu10aKetoconazole, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor can potentiate the antimalarial action of α/β arteether against MDR Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis  ap. 150-155.  a2019-12-04  aThe emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Plasmodium falciparum in South East Asia and other tropical countries, is posing serious challenge for the international efforts to eradicate malaria. New drug target/ACT/non-ACT combinations need to be discovered to control the spread of MDR malaria. The present communication deals with antimalarial potential of a new combination comprising of ketoconazole (KTZ) (an antifungal/inhibitor of CYP3A4) and artemisinin derivative α/β arteether (ART). In vitro interactions of these drugs against chloroquine sensitive/resistant P. falciparum (Pf3D7/K1) have shown an overall additive interaction with mean sum fractional inhibitory concentrations (∑FICs) of 1.1±0.33 against 3D7 and 1.51±0.42 against K1 strains. Sub-curative doses of KTZ (150mg/kg×7 days) combined with ART (6.25–12.5mg/kg×5 days) both administered orally have shown 100% curative action against MDR P. yoelii nigeriensis in Swiss mice. Besides lower dose of KTZ (75mg/kg) which is non-curative itself, in combination with 12.5mg/kg×5 days of ART treatment, was also 100% curative. Further studies on mechanism of action of KTZ (150mg/kg single dose) have shown that significant inhibitory action of the antifungal drug is through very high level of suppression of CYP (nearly 90%) compared to that of healthy mice liver. The companion drug therapy comprising of KTZ together with ART (25mg/kg×1 dose) also produced more than 50% inhibitory effect on the CYP enzyme level. Since the ART is known to be rapidly metabolized by the liver cytochrome P₄₅₀ (CYP) 3A4 to Dihydroquinghasu, the combined therapy with KTZ (a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor) may influence the pharmacokinetics of ART and consequently slow down the drug metabolism and prolong the plasma life of the active drug, which would contribute to enhanced antimalarial action of ART against MDR P. yoelii nigeriensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3amechanism of action 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aliver 3amultiple drug resistance 3amice 3aketoconazole 3achloroquine 3amalaria 3anew combination 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aPlasmodium yoelii nigeriensis 3aartemisinin 3aSouth East Asia 0adrug therapy1 aRizvi, Amber1 aPandey, Swaroop Kumar1 aDwivedi, Hemlata1 aSaxena, J.K.0 tActa tropica.g2013 May, v. 126, no. 2 p.150-155dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245019700175300001600372520128900388592002801677650001501705650001401720650001501734650001701749650001001766650001801776650003701794650002201831650001501853650001701868650002501885650002301910651001701933651000901950700002501959700002201984700002202006700002002028700002302048700002102071700001802092700002602110700001902136773008502155856008902240852000902329655001202338IND60111704420221117225248.0150809e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011170442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Kento10aGenetic diversity of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in Lutzomyia spp., with special reference to Lutzomyia peruensis, a main vector of Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana in the Peruvian Andes  ap. 156-163.  aThe genetic divergence caused by genetic drift and/or selection is suggested to affect the vectorial capacity and insecticide susceptibility of sand flies, as well as other arthropods. In the present study, cytochrome b (cyt b) gene sequences were determined in 13 species circulating in Peru to establish a basis for analysis of the genetic structure, and the intraspecific genetic diversity was assessed in the Lutzomyia (Lu.) peruensis, a main vector species of Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana in Peruvian Andes. Analysis of intraspecific genetic diversity in the cyt b gene sequences from 36 Lu. peruensis identified 3 highly polymorphic sites in the middle region of the gene. Haplotype and gene network analyses were performed on the cyt b gene sequences of 130 Lu. peruensis in 9 Andean areas from 3 Departments (Ancash, Lima and La Libertad). The results showed that the populations of La Libertad were highly polymorphic and that their haplotypes were distinct from those of Ancash and Lima, where dominant haplotypes were observed, suggesting that a population bottleneck may have occurred in Ancash and Lima, but not in La Libertad. The present study indicated that the middle region of the cyt b gene is useful for the analysis of genetic structure in sand fly populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania 3aLutzomyia 3aarthropods 3acytochrome b 3agenes 3agenetic drift 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainsecticides 3anucleotide sequences 3avectorial capacity 3aAndes region 3aPeru1 aCáceres, Abraham G.1 aGomez, Eduardo A.1 aMimori, Tatsuyuki1 aIwata, Hiroyuki1 aKorenaga, Masataka1 aSakurai, Tatsuya1 aKatakura, Ken1 aHashiguchi, Yoshihisa1 aKato, Hirotomo0 tActa tropica.g2013 May, v. 126, no. 2 p.156-163dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011400167300001800281500001900299520120100318592002801519650002501547650001601572650002101588650001901609650002201628650001601650650001501666650001701681650001301698650002001711700001301731700001601744700001901760700001301779700005901792773012901851856008401980852000902064655001202073IND60701133620221119232834.0200707e20200608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070113362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c002422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huiying13aAn Integrated LC-MS/MS Strategy for Quantifying the Oxidative-Redox Metabolome in Multiple Biological Samples  ap. 8810-8818.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe cellular redox balance plays a significant role in cell fate decisions and in the regulation of responses to various kinds of stress. In this study, we defined a novel concept of the oxidative-redox metabolome, and established a method for the simultaneous quantification of 23 metabolites involved in the oxidative-redox metabolome, covering NAD⁺ pathway, FAD pathway, GSSG pathway, and ATP pathway by using the AB SCIEX 5500 QTRAP LC/MS/MS system. Corresponding oxidative-redox metabolomics analysis was performed in plasma of humans, hamsters and mice, and hamsters were demonstrated to display a stronger resemblance than mice to humans. The known reductant dithiothreitol (DTT) and oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) were selected to treat A549 and HeLa cells to validate the current method, showing that DTT moderately increased while H₂O₂ greatly decreased most analytes. Antibiotic treatment may disturb the oxidative-redox balance in vivo. By comparing the oxidative-redox metabolome in antibiotic-fed hamsters with that of control hamsters, we demonstrated a substantial metabolic disparity between the two, further verifying the applicability and reliability of our method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aantibiotics 3achemical species 3adithiothreitol 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aoxidants 3areducing agents1 aXu, Feng1 aGao, Yuqing1 aPang, Yuanyuan1 aXie, Cen1 aJiang, Changtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5206-23720 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 June 08, v. 92, no. 13 p.8810-8818dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c002423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245017200171300001600343520194400359592002802303650001802331650001602349650001702365650002002382650001202402650001302414650003302427650001502460650002202475650003002497650002802527650001802555650000902573650002202582650001402604650001502618650001502633651001702648651001402665700002302679700002202702700002202724700002402746700002002770773009302790856008402883852000902967655001202976IND60083957520221121031956.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008395752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2011.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanzone, Cecilia10aIntegrated analyses of chromosome, molecular and morphological variability in the Andean mice Eligmodontia puerulus and E. moreni (Rodentia, Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae)  ap. 555-562.  aPatterns of evolution and systematics of sigmodontine rodents are matters of continuous revision and debate. The silky mouse, Eligmodontia, is a phyllotine rodent adapted to arid environments. Chromosomal and molecular data have identified six species in this genus. Among these E. puerulus and E. moreni are sister taxa from the high Andean and lowland deserts, respectively, with large chromosomal differences and intermediate levels of molecular divergence. The purpose of our study was to quantify the degree of variability (morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular) and to analyze its evolutionary implications within, and between, these sister species in the Monte and Puna biomes of Argentina. Our results show a high variability at the chromosomal and molecular level, but low morphological differentiation among populations of E. puerulus. Diploid numbers vary from 31 to 37 due to a complex Robertsonian system, whereas cytochrome-b distances range from 0.15% to 5.75%. On the other hand, E. moreni shows high morphological differentiation between populations, but low intraspecific differentiation at the molecular (from 0.73% to 1.4%) and chromosomal level (2n=52). Comparison of E. puerulus with E. moreni reveals high morphological and chromosomal distinction between them, but absence of molecular differentiation. Our results suggest that: (1) the high genetic variability of E. puerulus could be associated to its geographic distribution in the complex topography of the high Andean Puna; (2) the high morphological differentiation between E. moreni and E. puerulus could be the result of natural selection; and (3) molecular polyphyly between E. puerulus and E. moreni could be due to introgression or a recent split of these taxa. Finally, our results emphasize the need to integrate different datasets in the analysis of species variability and diversification, as tools for understanding their evolutionary histories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSigmodontinae 3achromosomes 3acytochrome b 3adata collection 3adeserts 3adiploidy 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ainterspecific variation 3aintrogression 3amice 3anatural selection 3apolyphyly 3apopulation 3atopography 3aAndes region 3aArgentina1 aOjeda, Agustina A.1 aOjeda, Ricardo A.1 aAlbanese, Soledad1 aRodríguez, Daniela1 aDacar, Maria A.0 tMammalian biology =.g2011 Sept., v. 76, no. 5 p.555-562dElsevier GmbHx1616-50477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2011.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245013000175520109100305592002801396650003401424650002001458650002501478650001501503650001801518650001801536650001201554650002201566650002101588650002001609650001401629650001001643650001501653700003001668700002801698700003101726700003401757700002601791700002401817700003301841700002801874773012201902856007902024852000902103655001202112IND60646934020221121174034.0190614e20181003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064693402DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy81002152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-López, Josué I.10aZinc Oxide Nanoparticles Boosts Phenolic Compounds and Antioxidant Activity of <em>Capsicum annuum</em> L. during Germination  aThe effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles on seed germination and seedling growth of Capsicum annuum L. were determined in this research. Total phenols content, total flavonoids, and condensed tannins, as well as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant capacity was determined. Results indicated that treatment with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) improved seed germination rate during the first seven days. The seed vigor germination increased 123.50%, 129.40% and 94.17% by treatment with ZnO-NPs suspensions at 100, 200 and 500 ppm, respectively. The morphological parameters tested revealed that ZnO-NPs treatments did not significantly affect plumule development, but they had a significant impact (p ≤ 0.01) on radicle length. Suspensions at 100, 200 and 500 ppm of ZnO-NPs inhibited seedling radicle growth and promoted accumulation of phenolic compounds, with a phytotoxic effect in this organ. Results suggested that zinc oxide nanoparticles influence seed vigor and seedling development and promoted the accumulation of desirable phenolic compounds in the radicle.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCapsicum annuum 3aantioxidant activity 3aflavonoids 3ananoparticles 3aphytotoxicity 3aplumule 3aproanthocyanidins 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3avigor 3azinc oxide1 aZavala-García, Francisco1 aOlivares-Sáenz, Emilio1 aLira-Saldívar, Ricardo H.1 aDíaz Barriga-Castro, Enrique1 aRuiz-Torres, Norma A.1 aRamos-Cortez, Edith1 aVázquez-Alvarado, Rigoberto1 aNiño-Medina, Guillermo0 tAgronomy.g2018 Oct. 03, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy81002153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245013000176300001400306520117000320592002801490650002001518650001801538650002501556650001301581650002101594650001301615650001601628650001001644650002101654650001501675650001501690650001701705650002501722650001401747650002501761653000901786653002401795700002401819700001501843700001701858773016101875856008702036852000902123655001202132IND60783061020221116184450.0220714e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078306102DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4479.2022.00004.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThummar, Khushbu A.10aAntioxidant defence system induced by seed priming with nanoparticles to restrain Fusarium wilt in cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.)  ap. 27-34.  aAn experiment comprising of persuade of seed priming with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and nanoparticles was conducted to restrain fusarium wilt in cumin.

The combination of chitosan nanoparticles either with green silver nanoparticles or PGPR for seed priming would be found better for boosting up the antioxidant/defence system to restrain Fusarium wilt infection in cumin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuminum cyminum 3aFusarium wilt 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3achitosan 3achlorophyll 3acumin 3afree amino acids 3ananosilver 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aPGPR 0aGreen nanoparticles1 aTrivedi, Sandhya K.1 aGajera, HP1 aSavaliya, DD0 tIndian journal of agricultural biochemistry.g2022 June, v. 35, no. 1 p.27-34dThe Indian Society of Agricultural BiochemistswJournal:2076x0974-44797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-4479.2022.00004.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013200158300002000290520145000310592002801760650002001788650001701808650001201825650001901837650002201856650001101878650001601889650001401905650002601919650001201945650002001957700001801977700002201995700002602017773012702043856007502170852000902245655001202254IND60534782620221121141357.0160803e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053478262DNAL7 a10.1021/es402197s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashir, Safdar10aEnantioselective Carbon Stable Isotope Fractionation of Hexachlorocyclohexane during Aerobic Biodegradation by Sphingobium spp.  ap. 11432-11439.  aCarbon isotope fractionation was investigated for the biotransformation of γ- and α- hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) as well as enantiomers of α-HCH using two aerobic bacterial strains: Sphingobium indicum strain B90A and Sphingobium japonicum strain UT26. Carbon isotope enrichment factors (εc) for γ-HCH (εc = −1.5 ± 0.1‰ and −1.7 ± 0.2‰) and α-HCH (εc = −1.0 ± 0.2‰ and −1.6 ± 0.3‰) were similar for both aerobic strains, but lower in comparison with previously reported values for anaerobic γ- and α-HCH degradation. Isotope fractionation of α-HCH enantiomers was higher for (+) α-HCH (εc = −2.4 ± 0.8 ‰ and −3.3 ± 0.8 ‰) in comparison to (−) α-HCH (εc = −0.7 ± 0.2‰ and −1.0 ± 0.6‰). The microbial fractionation between the α-HCH enantiomers was quantified by the Rayleigh equation and enantiomeric fractionation factors (εₑ) for S. indicum strain B90A and S. japonicum strain UT26 were −42 ± 16% and −22 ± 6%, respectively. The extent and range of isomer and enantiomeric carbon isotope fractionation of HCHs with Sphingobium spp. suggests that aerobic biodegradation of HCHs can be monitored in situ by compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) and enantiomer-specific isotope analysis (ESIA). In addition, enantiomeric fractionation has the potential as a complementary approach to CSIA and ESIA for assessing the biodegradation of α-HCH at contaminated field sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aSphingomonas 3aaerobes 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3aenantiomers 3aequations 3aisotope fractionation 3alindane 3astable isotopes1 aFischer, Anko1 aNijenhuis, Ivonne1 aRichnow, Hans-Hermann0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 47, no. 20 p.11432-11439dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes402197s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01512naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245015000211300001800361506007600379520028300455592002800738506003700766650003000803650000800833650001000841650002500851700002500876700001900901700002600920773012700946856008001073852000901153655001201162IND60291237820221207095720.0150701e20150625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6029123782DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00571-152doi7 aPMC44479222pmcid7 a260219372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRückert, Christian10aComplete Genome Sequence of Corynebacterium kutscheri DSM 20755, a Corynebacterial Type Strain with Remarkably Low G+C Content of Chromosomal DNA  ap. e00571-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe complete genome sequence of the type strain Corynebacterium kutscheri DSM 20755 comprises 2,354,065 bp and 2,047 protein-coding genes.

On the structural side, these subclasses are characterized by specific interchain disulfide bridge connections. Different analytical techniques have been reported to assess intact IgGs subclasses, with recently special interest in native ion mobility (IM) and collision induced unfolding (CIU) mass spectrometry (MS). However, these two techniques exhibit significant limitations to differentiate mAb subclasses at the intact level. In the present work, we aimed at developing a unique IM–MS-based approach for the characterization of mAb subclasses at the middle level. Upon IdeS-digestion, the unfolding patterns of the F(ab′)₂ and Fc domains were simultaneously analyzed in a single run to provide deeper structural insights of the mAb scaffold. The unfolding patterns associated with the F(ab′)₂ domains are completely different in terms of unfolding energies and number of transitions. Thereby, F(ab′)₂ regions are the diagnostic domain to provide specific unfolding signatures to differentiate IgG subclasses and provide more confident subclass categorization than CIU on intact mAbs. In addition, the potential of middle-level CIU was evaluated through the characterization of eculizumab, a hybrid therapeutic IgG2/4 mAb. The unfolding signatures of both domains were allowed to corroborate, within a single run, the hybrid nature of eculizumab as well as specific subclass domain assignments to the F(ab′)₂ and Fc regions. Altogether, our results confirm the suitability of middle-level CIU of F(ab′)₂ domains for subclass categorization of canonical and more complex new generation engineered antibodies and related products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adisulfide bonds 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amass spectrometry 3atherapeutics1 aHernandez-Alba, Oscar1 aMalissard, Martine1 aWagner-Rousset, Elsa1 aDeslignière, Evolène1 aColas, Olivier1 aHaeuw, Jean-François1 aBeck, Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4725-17771 aCianférani, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4013-41290 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 May 26, v. 92, no. 13 p.8827-8835dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c002933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03963naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014400165520184800309592002802157650002302185650003102208650000802239650002202247650002202269650002302291650001802314650001602332650001002348650001602358650002502374650001902399650002502418650002102443650002002464650001702484650002102501650001002522650002102532650001502553650000902568650001802577650001302595650001602608650001302624650002502637650001302662650002202675651001002697653001302707653002302720653000802743653000702751653000802758653000702766653001002773653001002783653001002793653000902803653000802812653000902820653001702829700001702846700001802863700001402881700001502895700001502910700001902925700001802944773011602962856008203078852000903160655001203169IND60674906120221118054500.0200210e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067490612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1123662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Xiangcao10aTotal saponins extracted from Abrus cantoniensis Hance suppress hepatitis B virus replication in vitro and in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice  aHepatitis B, an infectious disease caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), is still a serious problem affecting global public health. Abrus cantoniensis Hance (AC), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used as a folk medicine for treating hepatitis in China from ancient times. However, its active ingredients are still unclear.Our previous study indicated that saponins extracted from AC (ACS) were the active anti-HBV ingredients in AC. This study aimed to further investigate the anti-HBV effect of ACS in vitro and in vivo.HepG2.2.15 cells which consecutively produce HBV DNA and HBV antigens were used for in vitro test, and C57BL/6 mice infected by a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 vector carrying 1.3 copies of HBV genome (rAAV8-HBV1.3) were used for in vivo test. The histopathological changes and the immune indices were evaluated in mice model. Genechip was conducted to identify genes and pathways regulated by ACS in HepG2.2.15 cells.In this study, we confirmed that ACS treatment prominently inhibited production of HBV DNA, Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg), and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in HepG2.2.15 cells. ACS treatment also decreased serum HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA level in rAAV8-1.3HBV transfected mice, which is in accordance with the in vitro results. Moreover, HBV infection-induced liver inflammation was significantly relieved by ACS, which could be observed in H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of HBcAg. ACS treatment elevated IFN-γ level in mice serum and increased CD4⁺ T cell percentage in splenocytes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that phenylalanine metabolism pathway and tyrosine metabolism pathway were greatly regulated by ACS treatment.ACS exerted potent inhibitory effects on HBV replication both in vivo and in vitro, which may provide basis for its potential clinical usage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbrus cantoniensis 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aDependoparvovirus 3aHepatitis B virus 3aactive ingredients 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3agenes 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3aliver 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolism 3amice 3aphenylalanine 3asaponins 3asplenocytes 3astaining 3atraditional medicine 3atyrosine 3avirus replication 3aChina 0aGenechip 0aHepG2.2.15 cells 0aHBV 0aAC 0aACS 0aLM 0aHBeAg 0aHBsAg 0aHBcAg 0aIL-4 0aIFN 0aKEGG 0arAAV8-1.3HBV1 aLi, Zhanquan1 aGong, Xiaomei1 aFu, Xiang1 aXiao, Xiao1 aHe, Maolin1 aHuang, Baokang1 aXu, Zhongyuan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 249 p.112366-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1123663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008900169300001500258520171900273592002801992650001602020650001602036650001402052650001002066650001702076650001102093650002202104650001402126650001202140650000902152650001202161650001402173650002002187650001802207650001302225650000902238650001702247650001202264650001602276653000902292653001202301653002402313653001102337700002102348700002402369773009302393856008102486852000902567655001202576IND60519688320221119093439.0160510e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051968832DNAL7 a10.2478/v10220-012-0008-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanczakowska, Ewa10aEffectiveness of Rapeseed Press Cake (RPC) in Sow Feeding in Two Reproduction Cycles  ap. 95-104.  aThe possibility of replacing soybean meal with rapeseed press cake (RPC) in feed was determined over two reproductive cycles in an experiment with 54 pregnant and lactating sows allocated to three groups with 18 gilts per group. Group I received the standard mixture, group II received RPC as the main protein source from insemination to 100 days of pregnancy, and the control diet during late pregnancy and lactation. In group III, RPC replaced all of soybean meal protein in early pregnancy and one-half of soybean meal protein during late pregnancy and lactation. Half of the sows in each group received a iodine supplement (1 mg/kg feed). Sows were weighed at mating, farrowing and weaning. Piglets were weighed at 1 and 28 days of age (weaning). Samples of milk were collected at 14 days postpartum to determine the content of protein, fat, lactose and iodine. After the first reproductive cycle sows were mated and allocated to the respective groups as in the first cycle. Neither RPC nor iodine had any effect on body weight of the sows. RPC had a beneficial effect on body weight of piglets at birth and weaning, which could be due to a higher content of fat and amino acids in sow RPC diets. RPC, especially when given throughout pregnancy and lactation significantly lowered iodine content in sow milk. Piglets grew significantly faster in the second compared to the first reproductive cycle (184 and 178 g per day, respectively). Iodine supplemented to sows reduced piglet daily weight gain from 185 to 177 g. It is concluded that rapeseed press cake can replace soybean meal in the diets for pregnant and lactating sows without a negative effect on their performance while improving piglet body weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abody weight 3afarrowing 3agilts 3ainsemination 3aiodine 3alactating females 3alactation 3alactose 3amilk 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3aprotein sources 3arapeseed cake 3asow milk 3asows 3asoybean meal 3aweaning 3aweight gain 0asows 0apiglets 0arapeseed press cake 0aiodine1 aWęglarzy, Karol1 aBereza, Małgorzata0 tAnnals of animal science.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 12, no. 1 p.95-104dVersitax1642-34027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10220-012-0008-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012800165520197600293592002802269650001802297650001102315650001102326650002002337650001502357650001202372650001102384650001102395650002002406650002102426650001702447650002502464650001902489650002002508650001702528650001502545650001702560651002402577651001302601653001502614653001202629653000702641653001302648653001102661653001102672700001702683773013202700856008502832852000902917655001202926IND60769995820221120100819.0220502e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076999582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1109292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguy, W.H.10aMiddle Miocene paleoenvironmental reconstruction in the central Great Plains, USA, from stable carbon isotopes in ungulates  aMiddle Miocene (~18–12 Ma) mammalian faunas of the North American Great Plains contained a higher diversity of presumed browsers than any modern biome. This has been attributed to greater primary productivity, which commonly corresponds with densely vegetated, forested habitats today. However, several lines of evidence suggest that open biomes, which support low browser diversity today, dominated the middle Miocene. To gain a better understanding of middle Miocene habitats on the northern Great Plains, we generated a large dataset of stable carbon isotope values (δ¹³C) from a wide variety of fossil ungulates. Tooth enamel was sampled from four local faunas in Nebraska of late Barstovian age (14.8–12.5 Ma). Paleoenvironmental interpretations were made using a predictive model based on δ¹³C values in vegetation and mammalian herbivores in modern biomes. Resulting mean δ¹³C fossil values for local faunas plot in the upper range expected for C₃ vegetation, indicating open biomes. Most mean values for genera plot in the range expected for open canopy habitats with only two genera in the closed canopy range. Of all the taxa, only the grazing horse, Neohipparion, plots in the range for likely C₄ consumption. Neohipparion has the highest mean δ¹³C value of any taxon, with one individual plotting in the range for unequivocal C₄ consumption and others in the mixed C₄/C₃ or C₃ water-stressed range. Neohipparion appears to be the earliest known taxon that included C₄ vegetation in its dietary niche. The range in carbon isotope values suggests browsers, mixed-feeders, and grazers all consumed vegetation in mostly open areas. Our model implies a fairly dry, open biome with limited riparian habitat. This interpretation is generally consistent with previous interpretations of an open savanna-like biome. A high diversity of middle Miocene browsers and other taxa appear to have lived in an open biome with no modern analog.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3acanopy 3acarbon 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afossils 3ahorses 3amodels 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aprimary productivity 3ariparian areas 3astable isotopes 3atooth enamel 3avegetation 3awater stress 3aGreat Plains region 3aNebraska 0aBarstovian 0aNeogene 0aC4 0aNebraska 0aFossil 0aMammal1 aSecord, Ross0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2022 May 15, v. 594 p.110929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1109293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007200164300002000236500001400256520118000270592002801450650001701478650001301495650001301508650001601521650001901537650002201556650002101578650001101599650001901610650001201629650001501641650002601656650002101682650001101703700002301714700002501737700002301762700001801785700001801803700002201821773012601843856007401969852000902043655001202052IND60710463520221122120231.0200909e20200904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071046352DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra05829g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolibaba, Thomas J.10aUV-protection from chitosan derivatized lignin multilayer thin film  ap. 32959-32965.  aNAL-light  aLignin is one of the most abundant renewable materials on the earth. Despite possessing useful antioxidant and UV absorbing properties, its effective utilization in technology has been hampered by its relative insolubility and difficulty to process. In this work, a simple chemical derivatization process is utilized which yields water-soluble lignin possessing anionic carboxylate groups. These carboxylate groups give lignin polyanionic behavior and enable its utilization in the growth of a functional film via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly with biologically sourced chitosan. The growth mechanism of this film is hypothesized to be a result of both hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. The film demonstrates excellent UV-absorptive capability. A 100 nm thick chitosan/lignin coating was applied to a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) film and shown to reduce its degradation sixfold over the course of a 1 hour exposure to harsh UV light. This is the first demonstration of lignin being utilized in a fully biologically derived LbL film. Utilization of lignin in LbL assembly is an important step in the development of renewable nanotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abehavior 3achitosan 3adegradation 3aderivatization 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrogen bonding 3alignin 3ananotechnology 3astyrene 3asulfonates 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater solubility 3ayields1 aStevens, Daniel L.1 aPangburn, Stephen T.1 aCondassamy, Olivia1 aCamus, Martin1 aGrau, Etienne1 aGrunlan, Jaime C.0 tRSC advances.g2020 Sept. 04, v. 10, no. 54 p.32959-32965dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra05829g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245008900170300001600259520134400275592002801619650001401647650001301661650001201674650001501686650001201701650001001713650001501723650001201738650002101750651002301771651001101794700003801805773009301843856008401936852000902020655001202029IND60083957820221121122811.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008395782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2011.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazquez, Jorge,10aSpatial relationships between burrows of an insular population of Dipodomys merriami  ap. 577-582.  aFor semi-fossorial rodents, descriptions of the distribution and use of burrows can advance in understanding the spatial and social organization of their population. This study describes the use and spatial relationships between burrows of the kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami insularis), a subspecies that is possibly on the verge of extinction. Individuals were captured and recaptured in an area of 79.8 hectares located at San José Island, Gulf of California, Mexico, during both the breeding (BRED, from March to May) and the non-breeding (NON-BRED, from October to November) seasons of 2008. Our results show that females and males use a median of 1–2 burrows; factors such as age class, season and frequency of captures account for the number of burrows used by individuals. Few individuals shared their burrows (9.2% during BRED and 1.1% during NON-BRED). The burrows showed a clumped spatial distribution in both sampling periods. The spatial relationship between burrows is characterized by the fact that animals of opposite sex are closer to each other than same-sex individuals, and this spatial relationship between nearest-neighbor burrows is influenced by age class. Our results show that D. m. insularis displays burrow use and spatial organization patterns similar to those observed in other populations of D. merriami.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipodomys 3abreeding 3aburrows 3aextinction 3afemales 3amales 3apopulation 3arodents 3asocial structure 3aGulf of California 3aMexico1 aAlvarez-Castañeda, Sergio Ticul,0 tMammalian biology =.g2011 Sept., v. 76, no. 5 p.577-582dElsevier GmbHx1616-50477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2011.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04698naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014400161520234100305592002802646650001802674650003402692650002502726650002602751650003102777650002702808650002102835650001502856650001002871650001902881650001402900650001702914650001002931650003802941650002002979650002502999650001503024650001703039650002203056650001303078650002603091650001303117650002403130650001803154650001103172650001203183650002503195650003103220650004303251650000903294650002403303650001103327650001703338650003603355650003203391651001003423653002003433653003003453653002603483653001603509700002203525700001203547700001803559700001503577700001303592700001903605700001403624700001403638700001503652700001803667773011603685856008203801852000903883655001203892IND60674906220221118054450.0200210e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067490622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1123652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiang10aGinkgo diterpene lactones inhibit cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced inflammatory response in astrocytes via TLR4/NF-κB pathway in rats  aGinkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) is a traditional Chinese medicine known to treating stroke and other cardio-cerebrovascular diseases for thousands of years in China. Ginkgo diterpene lactones (GDL) attracted much attention because of their neuroprotective properties.To uncover the effects of GDL, which consist of ginkgolide A (GA), ginkgolide B (GB), and ginkgolide K (GK), on ischemic stroke, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms.We used middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) models mimicking the process of ischemia/reperfusion in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Anticoagulant effects of GDL were investigated on platelet activating factor (PAF), arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation both in vivo and in vitro. We also evaluated the effects of GDL on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in primary cultured rats′ astrocytes. Infarct size, neurological deficit score, and brain edema were measured at 72 h after MCAO. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to analyze neurons necrosis and astrocytes activation. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrotic factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real time PCR. The levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) were assessed by real time PCR or Western blot.Compared with MCAO/R rats, GDL significantly reduced infarct size and brain edema, improved neurological deficit score. Meanwhile, GDL suppressed platelet aggregation, astrocytes activation, pro-inflammatory cytokines releasing, TLR4 mRNA expression and transfer of NF-κB from cytoplasm to nucleus. Furthermore, GDL alleviated OGD/R injury and LPS-induced inflammatory response in primary astrocytes, characterized by promoting cell viability, decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and inhibiting IL-1β and TNF-α releasing.In summary, GDL attenuate cerebral ischemic injury, inhibit platelet aggregation and astrocytes activation. The anti-inflammatory activity might be associated with the downregulation of TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway. Our present findings provide an innovative insight into the novel treatment of GDL in ischemic stroke therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo biloba 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanticoagulant activity 3aarachidonic acid 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3acell viability 3acytoplasm 3aditerpenoids 3aedema 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainfarction 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aischemia 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactones 3alipopolysaccharides 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3aneurons 3aplatelet aggregation 3aplatelet-activating factor 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asignal transduction 3astroke 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aChina 0aIschemic stroke 0aGinkgo diterpene lactones 0aAstrocytes activation 0aTLR4/NF-κB1 aHuang, Liangliang1 aLiu, Ge1 aFan, Wenxiang1 aLi, Binbin1 aLiu, Rui1 aWang, Junchen,1 aFan, Qiru1 aXiao, Wei1 aLi, Yunman1 aFang, Weirong0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 249 p.112365-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1123653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017800159300002000337500001400357520184700371592002802218650001102246650001602257650002102273650001402294650002802308650001702336650001602353650002302369650001302392650001102405650002102416650001502437650001602452650001402468650001102482700001502493700002002508700001902528700001702547700002202564700002602586773012602612856007402738852000902812655001202821IND60710463620221122183003.0200909e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071046362DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra05836j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLock, S.

This is essential since their effects are reversible. In addition, tedious experimental work is required to collect gas transport data at varying operating conditions. Recently, we have proposed a validated Soft Confining Methodology for Ultrathin Films that can be used to simulate ultrathin polysulfone (PSF) membranes upon confinement limited to 308.15 K and 2 bars. In industry application, these ultrathin membranes are operated within 298.15–328.15 K and up to 50 bars. Therefore, our proposed methodology using computational chemistry has been adapted to circumvent limitation in experimental study by simulating ultrathin PSF membranes upon confinement at different operating temperatures (298.15 to 328.15 K) and pressures (2 to 50 bar). The effect of operating parameters towards non-bonded and potential energy, free volume, specific volume and gas transport data (e.g. solubility and diffusivity) for oxygen and nitrogen of the ultrathin films has been simulated and collected using molecular simulation. Our previous empirical equations that have been confined to thickness dependent gas transport properties have been modified to accommodate the effect of operating parameters. The empirical equations are able to provide a good quantitative characterization with R² ≥ 0.99 consistently, and are able to be interpolated to predict gas transport properties within the range of operating conditions. The modified empirical model can be utilized in process optimization studies to determine optimal membrane design for typical membrane specifications and operating parameters used in industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesign 3adiffusivity 3aempirical models 3aequations 3aindustrial applications 3alaboratories 3ameasurement 3amolecular dynamics 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apotential energy 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athickness 3avolume1 aLau, K.

The paper presents the analysis of the effect of teleconnection patterns (NAO, SCAND, EA, EAWR) on ice conditions in lakes in North Poland, determining the relations between the teleconnection conditions in the cold half-year and selected features of the ice regime, i.e. dates of ice start and ice end, ice duration, and maximum ice thickness. Deviations of values of the aforementioned parameters in positive and negative phases of the considered teleconnection patterns were calculated in reference to mean values from the years 1956–2014. Two of them were determined to have considerable effect on the parameters of the ice regime, namely NAO, modifying ice start and ice end, ice duration, and maximum ice thickness in the season, and SCAND, considerably changing ice end, ice duration, and maximum ice thickness. The EA teleconnection pattern only affects ice end, and EAWR shows no correlations with the analysed ice parameters in lakes.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016/21/B/ST10/01440cNational Science Centre, Poland 3acold 3aecosystems 3aice 3alakes 3atemperature profiles 3awinter 3aPoland1 aTomczyk, Arkadiusz M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1576-87951 aWrzesiński, Dariusz,1 aBednorz, Ewa0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Nov., v. 138, no. 3-4 p.1961-1969dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02929-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007100148245010000219300001800319506011700337506007600454520144200530592002801972506003702000650001702037650001602054650002302070650001402093650000902107650002102116650002602137650002202163650001902185650001202204650001902216650001402235650002002249650001102269650002102280650001202301650001402313650001002327653002702337653001902364653002802383653001902411653002802430653001402458700002302472700006502495700001902560700002802579700002002607700006402627700006602691700006102757700005802818773011202876856008302988852000903071655001203080IND60708180020221207133033.0220502e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070818002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2020.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiñeiro-Ramos, José David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1628-907510aEffect of donor human milk on host-gut microbiota and metabolic interactions in preterm infants  ap. 1296-1309.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman milk is the gold standard for infant nutrition. Preterm infants whose mothers are unable to provide sufficient own mother's milk (OMM), receive pasteurized donor human milk (DHM). We studied metabolic signatures of OMM and DHM and their effect on the interplay of the developing microbiota and infant's metabolism. Metabolic fingerprinting of OMM and DHM as well as infant's urine was performed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and the infant's stool microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Significant differences in the galactose and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways when comparing OMM and DHM, and alterations of the steroid hormone synthesis and pyrimidine metabolism pathways in urine were observed depending on the type of feeding. Differences in the gut-microbiota composition were also identified. The composition of DHM differs from OMM and feeding of DHM has a significant impact on the metabolic phenotype and microbiota of preterm infants. Our data help to understand the origin of the observed changes generating new hypothesis: i) steroid hormones present in HM have a significant influence in the activity of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway in preterm infants; ii) the pyrimidine metabolism is modulated in preterm infants by the activity of gut-microbiota. Short- and long-term implications of the observed changes for preterm infants need to be assessed in further studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosynthesis 3abreast milk 3aclinical nutrition 3agalactose 3agold 3ainfant nutrition 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amicroorganisms 3amothers 3apasteurization 3aphenotype 3apremature birth 3astarch 3asteroid hormones 3asucrose 3asynthesis 3aurine 0aDonor human milk (DHM) 0aGut-microbiota 0aOwn mother's milk (OMM) 0aPreterm infant 0aUntargeted metabolomics 0aNutrition1 aParra-Llorca, Anna1 aTen-Doménech, Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4883-79481 aGormaz, María1 aRamón-Beltrán, Amparo1 aCernada, María1 aQuintás, Guillermo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4240-98461 aCollado, María Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6204-48641 aKuligowski, Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6979-22351 aVento, Máximo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0061-47420 tClinical nutrition.g2021 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.1296-1309dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245008200153300002000235520111700255592002801372650002301400650001501423650001701438650002201455650001401477650002201491650001301513650001901526650001601545700001601561700001801577700001601595700001401611700001201625700001701637773012301654856007401777852000901851655001201860IND60645890120221119192333.0190604e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064589012DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra02792k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Bo10aThree-dimensional graphene networks and RGO-based counter electrode for DSSCs  ap. 15678-15685.  aGraphene is considered to be a potential replacement for the traditional Pt counter electrode (CE) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Besides a high electron transport ability, a close contact between the CE and electrolyte is crucial to its outstanding catalytic activity for the I₃⁻/I redox reaction. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and three-dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) were used to fabricate the CE, and the graphene-based CE endowed the resulting DSSC with excellent photovoltaic performance features. The high quality and continuous structure of the 3DGNs provided a channel amenable to fast transport of electrons, while the RGO afforded a close contact at the interface between the graphene basal plane and electrolyte. The obtained energy conversion efficiency (η) was closely related to the mass fraction and reduction degree of the RGO that was used. Corresponding optimization yielded, for the DSSCs based on the 3DGN–RGO CE, a value of η as high as 9.79%, comparable to that of the device using a Pt CE and hence implying promising prospects for the as-prepared CE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy conversion 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3asolar cells1 aYu, Haogang1 aHuang, Weiqiu1 aSun, Yunfei1 aLi, Xufei1 aLi, Sen1 aMa, Tingting0 tRSC advances.g2019 May 20, v. 9, no. 28 p.15678-15685dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra02792k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245015400175520196900329592002802298650001702326650001902343650001202362650002302374650001402397650001102411650002002422650002102442650001702463650001102480650001402491650001202505651001102517653001402528653004302542653001102585653001402596700002002610700001902630700003202649773013202681856008502813852000902898655001202907IND60769996020221121035759.0220404e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076999602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1109312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorillo, Anthony R.10aPermian lobed Zoophycos as the product of the terrestrialization process: Behavioral innovation in the Tahkandit Limestone (Yukon River, Alaska, USA)  aPaleontological survey in the remote Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve in Alaska led to the discovery of lobed Zoophycos from the lower Tahkandit Limestone (informally named Sandstone unit), an interval characterized by grayish-green glauconitic sandstone and conglomerate of coastal origin. The studied Zoophycos consists of a lobate skirt-like spreite bounded by a marginal tube. Smaller tongue-shaped lobes branch off from larger parent lobes that share the same tongue-like shape. Sedimentological features, together with body fossils and associated trace fossils (Planolites, Chondrites), indicate a shoreface habitat for the Zoophycos producer. This shallow-marine environmental setting is in contrast with the deeper bathymetries in which lobed Zoophycos are recovered in post-Palaeozoic times. The producer of the lobed Zoophycos of the Yukon River is interpreted as a deposit-feeder that used sensory-driven, directed search for locating heterogeneously distributed trophic resources. The Zoophycos producer filled its burrow with Coprolus-like fecal pellets, possibly complementing deposit feeding with microbial gardening and/or food caching. Data presented here provide useful insight into the morphological evolution and bathymetric distribution of Zoophycos, suggesting two ‘Golden Ages’ for lobed Zoophycos: (1) Carboniferous–Permian and (2) Cretaceous–Neogene. This stratigraphic distribution supports the important ecological role of major terrestrialization events, that are, the Palaeozoic expansion of land plants and the Mesozoic expansion of angiosperms. The consequent increased input of nutrients to coastal areas was an important contributor to declining trends in porewater oxygen concentrations. This phenomenon favored adaptive traits to exploit nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor niches, among which the U-shaped marginal tube of lobed Zoophycos was an efficient adaptation to bring oxygenated water into low-oxygen substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesozoic era 3aPermian period 3aburrows 3aconservation areas 3alimestone 3aoxygen 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3arivers 3asandstone 3asurveys 3aAlaska 0aIchnology 0aYukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve 0aMarine 0aLimestone1 aFanti, Federico1 aBaucon, Andrea1 aChiarenza, Alfio Alessandro0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2022 May 01, v. 593 p.110931-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1109313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245016300168520142600331592002801757650004201785650001201827650001001839650001401849650002601863650002201889650001801911650001801929700001801947700001701965700002201982773012202004856007902126852000902205655001202214IND60646934420221121173930.0190614e20181005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064693442DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy81002182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuronuma, Takanori10aTipburn Severity and Calcium Distribution in Lisianthus (<i>Eustoma Grandiflorum</i> (Raf.) Shinn.) Cultivars under Different Relative Air Humidity Conditions  aTipburn is a major problem for the production of lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum (Raf.) Shinn.) cultivars. Relative air humidity is regarded as a key environmental factor affecting tipburn severity in commercial crops. However, there are limited studies comparing the occurrence of tipburn and calcium (Ca) distribution in lisianthus cultivars under different relative air humidity conditions. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of relative air humidity on tipburn severity, transpiration rate, and Ca content in seven lisianthus cultivars. Under a high humidity treatment (70%), only two cultivars (&ldquo;Voyage pink&rdquo; (VP) and &ldquo;Azuma-no-kaori&rdquo; (AK)) showed significantly higher tipburn severity than those under a low humidity treatment (50%), which suggests that high humidity conditions do not always increase tipburn severity in lisianthus. Transpiration rates of all cultivars, except for AK, were either significantly lower under the high humidity treatment than under the low humidity treatment, or did not vary significantly between the treatments. In contrast, total Ca concentrations in all cultivars, except for &ldquo;Piccolosa snow&rdquo; (PS), were significantly higher under the high humidity treatment than under the low humidity treatment. These results suggest that Ca acquisition and distribution in lisianthus cultivars are strongly influenced by Ca uptake from root pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEustoma exaltatum subsp. russellianum 3acalcium 3acrops 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3arelative humidity 3aroot pressure 3atranspiration1 aWatanabe, Yua1 aAndo, Masaya1 aWatanabe, Hitoshi0 tAgronomy.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy81002183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01255naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005800170300001600228520043700244592002800681650001200709650001500721650000900736650001000745650001500755773011300770856008500883852000900968655001200977IND60636917420221120203633.0190411e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063691742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheil, Douglas10aHow plants water our planet: advances and imperatives  ap. 209-211.  aMost life on land depends on water from rain, but much of the rain on land may also depend on life.

At Paso del Sapo, Cerrito Terciario and El Petiso localities (Chubut province), the La Pava Formation included Coprinisphaera ispp., Rosellichnus patagonicus, Rebuffoichnus casamiquelai, Feoichnus challa and burrows of spiders and earthworms, representing a case of the Rosellichnus ichnoassemblage of the Coprinisphaera Ichnofacies. Some of the components of this ichnoassemblage, scarce or absent in Cenozoic formations older than La Pava, are present in extant Patagonian habitats, pointing in the direction of extant invertebrate fauna. At El Petiso locality, the Collón Curá Formation included Celliforma ispp., Rosellichnus patagonicus, Fictovichnus ispp., Teisseirei barattinia and Teisseirei paladinco isp. nov., representing a case of the Celliforma Ichnofacies. The La Pava Formation comprises brownish, argillic, granular and strongly-developed palaeosols (Mollisols and Alfisols) formed in mildly stable to long-lasting landscapes, whereas the Collón Curá Formation comprises calcic, tuffaceous, paler and weakly-developed palaeosols (Andisols, Aridisols) formed in unsteady and ashy environments. The ichnofacies and palaeosols from the La Pava Formation indicate wooded grasslands developed in seasonal, subhumid and temperate-warm conditions, whereas those from the Collón Curá Formation indicate a habitat with reduced plant cover similar to semiarid and temperate-warm dry woodlands or bushlands. This shift towards more arid conditions in Patagonian landscapes would have been coeval with climatic changes corresponding to the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a lapse of global temperature decrease associated with extensive drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aAndisols 3aAridisols 3aMiocene epoch 3aMollisols 3aevolution 3ahabitats 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3apaleosolic soil types 3ashrublands 3asubhumid zones 3atemperature 3aArgentina 0aInsect trace fossils 0aTeisseirei paladinco isp. nov. 0aIchnofacies 0aPalaeosols 0aMiddle Miocene climate transition 0aPatagonia1 aBellosi, Eduardo S.1 aCantil, Liliana F.1 aGonzález, Mirta G.1 aPuerta, Pablo0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2022 May 15, v. 594 p.110932-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.1109323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011100177300001400288520169600302592002801998650002502026650001102051650002702062650001802089650002402107650001102131650002502142650001102167650002502178651001302203653002402216653002102240653001702261653001902278700002802297700001802325773009402343856008502437852000902522655001202531IND60720636620221121054628.0210212e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072063662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBello, Mufutau Opeyemi10aModelling the economic role of hydropower: Evidence from bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag approach  ap. 76-84.  aDespite being one of the most researched areas within the general field of energy economics, the energy-growth nexus remains largely inconclusive with four testable hypotheses that include the feedback, neutrality, conservation, and growth hypothesis. This study contributes to the extant literature of energy-growth nexus by investigating the causal dynamics between hydroelectricity consumption and economic growth in Malaysia in an augmented production function framework that incorporates human capital as additional regressor with an updated yearly time series data that span the period 1971–2017. Importantly, we have employed a recently developed bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (BARDL) modelling technique of McNown et al. (2018) [1]; to probe the long-run relationship between the variables and Granger causality test based on the new method was conducted to ascertain the causal dynamics in the model. The new technique is a significant improvement over the conventional ARDL method as it incorporates an additional F-test on the lagged independent variables (or t-test in the case of a single independent variable) which helps in avoiding a scenario of treating a degenerate case as a cointegrating case. The empirical findings show evidence that in the long run hydroelectricity consumption Granger causes gross domestic product (GDP), and physical capital Granger causes human capital while the short run analysis show that GDP and physical capital Granger cause hydroelectricity consumption. The study recommends more funding to improve hydroelectric facilities and investment in capital expenditure that can promote the development of human capital in the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3agross domestic product 3ahuman capital 3ahydroelectric power 3amodels 3aproduction functions 3at-test 3atime series analysis 3aMalaysia 0aEnergy-growth nexus 0aRenewable energy 0aFossil fuels 0aBootstrap ARDL1 aSolarin, Sakiru Adebola1 aYen, Yuen Yee0 tRenewable energy.g2021 May, v. 168 p.76-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.12.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02175naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008000163300001600243520133900259592002801598650001101626650002501637650001501662650001101677651001001688700001701698773011301715856004801828852000901876655001201885IND4472265520221119084022.0120815e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447226552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-012-0603-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shunjiu10aLong-term trend analysis for temperature in the Jinsha River Basin in China  ap. 591-603.  aOn the basis of the mean annual and seasonal temperatures from 30 meteorological stations in the Jinsha River Basin (JRB) from 1961 to 2008, the temperature trends are analyzed by using Mann–Kendall test and linear trend analysis. There is an increasing trend in mean annual and seasonal temperatures during this period, and the increasing trends in winter seem more significant than those in the other three seasons. The mean annual temperature has increased by 0.0158°C/year during the last 48 years. There are more than 70% of stations exhibiting increasing trends for annual and seasonal temperatures. The increasing trends in the headwater and upper reaches are more dominant than those in the middle and lower reaches. The largest increase magnitude occurred in the low temperature area, while the largest decrease magnitude occurred in the high temperature area. The decreasing trends are mainly characterized for the maximum temperature time series, and summer is the only season showing a slight and insignificant increasing trend. All the time series showed a statistically significant increasing trend at the level of α = 0.05 for the minimum temperature time series. As a whole, the increasing magnitude of the minimum temperature is significantly greater than the decreasing magnitude of the maximum temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aChina1 aZhang, Xinli0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2012 Aug., v. 109, no. 3-4 p.591-603dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0603-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245009500213300001800308500001900326520084200345592002801187650002801215650002201243650001101265650001801276650001701294653003501311653003001346653002201376653002601398700002001424700001801444773010001462856008601562852000901648655001201657IND60708180120221120063525.0201025e20200911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070818012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMessina, Nicole L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8404-446214aThe impact of human single nucleotide polymorphisms on Bacillus Calmette-Guérin responses  ap. 6224-6235.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe influence of genetic variability on human immune responses has major implications for the understanding of disease mechanisms and host-pathogen interactions. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is given globally to protect against tuberculosis, has high variability in its protective efficacy against mycobacteria and its beneficial off-target (heterologous) effects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are major cause of genetic variation and have been strongly associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis and outcomes following BCG immunotherapy for cancer. This review discusses the contribution of SNPs to the variability in mycobacterial-specific and off-target BCG responses, and the implications for this on development of novel TB vaccines and strategies to harness the beneficial off-target effects of BCG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3aimmunotherapy 3atuberculosis 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aBacillus Calmette-Guérin 0aImmune regulation 0aHeterologous immunity1 aNetea, Mihai G.1 aCurtis, Nigel0 tVaccine.g2020 Sept. 11, v. 38, no. 40 p.6224-6235dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007300175300001600248520091500264592002801179650002401207650001201231650001001243650001601253650002201269650002101291650001001312650002101322651001101343700003801354773009201392856008401484852000901568655001201577IND60083958220221120114508.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008395822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2011.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlagojević, Miloš,10aSexual shape dimorphism in Serbian roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.)  ap. 735-740.  aThe focus of studies of sexual dimorphism has been mainly on size whereas shape has remained largely ignored when assessing population differentiation. In order to extract exclusive information about shape variability, we combined multivariate statistical procedures with geometric morphometrics and visualization techniques (thin plate splines). All roe deer skulls, used in this study, originated from a single population in Serbia. Our results showed statistically significant sexual dimorphism of male and female skull shape. Different patterns of shape variability in males and females were observed, such as broader cranial base in males and elongated and more slender shape of female skull, with narrower basicranium. Shape differences appear to be regulated only broadly by social structure and sexual selection, and some other mechanisms could be proposed for further explanation of sexual dimorphism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3afemales 3amales 3amorphometry 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection 3askull 3asocial structure 3aSerbia1 aMilošević-Zlatanović, Svetlana0 tMammalian biology =.g2011 Nov., v. 76, no. 6 p.735-740dElsevier GmbHx1616-50477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2011.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006600167300001600233520065600249592002800905650001500933650002000948650001200968650001500980653001000995653002001005653001501025653001701040653001701057773009401074856008101168852000901249655001201258IND60519688720221119093342.0160510e20120420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051968872DNAL7 a10.2478/v10220-012-0012-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChronowska, Ewa10aStem Cell Characteristics of Ovarian Granulosa Cells - Review  ap. 151-157.  aRecently increasing interest in stem cells of mammalian ovary has been observed.

In this study, the regional climate model RegCM4 is used to simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of anthropogenic aerosols including sulfate, black carbon, and organic carbon in China around 2030 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios and estimate the contributions of climate difference, emission difference, and extra-regional transport difference to the change of anthropogenic aerosol concentration in the study area. The results show that the annual average concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols around 2030 decreased significantly with respect to those around 2010, and the decrease amplitude of black carbon surface concentration is the smallest, especially in the RCP8.5 scenario. The annual averages for sulfate, black carbon, and organic carbon surface concentrations in the central and eastern parts of China will be 8.5, 1.7, and 3.7 μg m⁻³, respectively, under the RCP4.5 scenario, whereas 10.0, 2.2, and 4.4 μg m⁻³, respectively, under the RCP8.5 scenario. The surface concentration of sulfate is higher in summer and spring, while lower in winter and autumn. The surface concentrations of black carbon and organic carbon are higher in winter and lower in other seasons. The results of sensitivity experiments demonstrate that the future difference in local emissions between RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios has the greatest impact on the anthropogenic aerosol concentrations throughout China, while the effects of future climate difference and extra-regional transport difference are much smaller around 2030. For the aerosol column burdens, the effect of future local emission difference between the two scenarios is still dominant, and the effect of extra-regional transport difference becomes very significant during spring and winter for organic carbon and black carbon. The results of this paper suggest that the impacts of future climate difference and extra-regional transport difference between RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios on anthropogenic aerosols are non-negligible in certain regions and seasons besides the impact of future local emission difference in China around 2030.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014CB441203cNational Key Basic Research Development Program of China  a91544230cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41621005cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41575145cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC0203303cNational Key Research and Development Plan of China 3aaerosols 3aautumn 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aemissions 3aglobal warming 3aorganic carbon 3aspring 3asulfates 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina1 aWang, Tijian1 aZhuang, Bingliang1 aXie, Min1 aHan, Yong0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Nov., v. 138, no. 3-4 p.2007-2020dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02947-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007400171300001600245520153000261592002801791650002001819650001101839650001401850650001001864650001701874650001301891650001301904650001501917650002701932650002601959650001301985650001501998650002902013700002002042700002202062773009202084856008402176852000902260655001202269IND60083958420221120140819.0141101e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008395842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mambio.2011.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbáñez, Belén10aNo inbreeding effects on body size in two captive endangered gazelles  ap. 748-754.  aSelection for body size is intricate, involving trade-offs between energy costs, reproductive output, foraging efficiency, and interaction with other community members. In dimorphic, polygynous ungulates, body size is highly correlated with reproductive success in both sexes. Body size has been proposed as a potential phenotypic indicator of genetic change, in wild and in captive populations. We analysed the relationship between adult body size and inbreeding in two captive populations of endangered gazelles. Two estimates of inbreeding were used: individual inbreeding coefficient (Fᵢ) and individual increase in inbreeding (ΔFᵢ). Six cranial traits and eight post-cranial bones were measured in 87 Cuvier's gazelles and 97 Mohor gazelles. The average level of individual inbreeding found for the alive population of Cuvier's gazelle was 0.236 and for Mohor gazelle 0.260. Our study demonstrated that within our populations most variability in body size is explained by sex, but we have not found any evidence of inbreeding depression in this morphological trait. Our results are surprising in the light of a widely held belief that from an evolutionary point of view close inbreeding has deleterious effects. The great diversity of factors acting on the effects of inbreeding on trait values make difficult to provide a simple framework to understand them all, hence, we suggest fitness consequences of inbreeding has to be assessed considering the conditions under which one should expect inbreeding depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGazella cuvieri 3aadults 3abody size 3abones 3aenergy costs 3aforaging 3agazelles 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding coefficient 3ainbreeding depression 3apolygyny 3apopulation 3areproductive performance1 aMoreno, Eulalia1 aBarbosa, Andrés,0 tMammalian biology =.g2011 Nov., v. 76, no. 6 p.748-754dElsevier GmbHx1616-50477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mambio.2011.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007400148245015300222300001800375520109500393592002801488650001201516650001901528650002001547650001101567650001501578650001601593700003501609773013501644856008201779852000901861655001201870IND60675287420221117063508.0191105e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067528742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-019-02921-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Lima, Jessé Américo Gomes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0591-816610aComparison between ERA Interim/ECMWF, CFSR, NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, and observational datasets over the eastern part of the Brazilian Northeast Region  ap. 2021-2041.  aMany studies have tried to determine the more accurate gridded datasets for a specific region of the world.

Subjects were 4430 gilts from pedigree farms, which were tested in performance stations. The breed composition of the animals was as follows (head): Polish Large White - 1240, Polish Landrace - 2083, Puławska - 104, Hampshire - 35, Duroc - 152, Pietrain - 208, line 990 - 608. Animals were kept in individual pens and fed standard diets. Intramuscular fat (IMF) content of the longissimus dorsi muscle was determined by Soxhlet using the SOXTHERM SOX 406 system (Gerhardt). The level of IMF served as a basis for dividing the test animals into three groups: below 2% (group I), between 2% and 3% (group II) and above 3% (group III). Animal breed had the highest and highly significant effect on the level of all traits analysed. As regards age at slaughter and carcass meat percentage, an interaction was found between animal breed and the group factor determined based on IMF level (P≤0.001). The factor expressed as IMF group had no effect on the level of analysed traits (P>0.05). Therefore, the results of this analysis concerning the parameters obtained from live evaluation do not permit these data to be used in selection for improved IMF levels. The high rate of lean deposition in the modern breeds prevented genetic differences in the level of IMF to fully manifest themselves at a slaughter weight of about 100 kg. This unfavourable information leads one to look for other factors that determine variation of this trait.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aPietrain 3aage at slaughter 3adiet 3afarms 3afinishing 3agenetic variation 3agilts 3ahead 3aintramuscular fat 3alandraces 3alongissimus muscle 3apedigree 3asensation 3aslaughter weight 0apigs 0aperformance 0aintramuscular fat 0alongisimus dorsi muscle1 aŻak, Grzegorz,0 tAnnals of animal science.g2012 Apr. 20, v. 12, no. 2 p.169-178dVersitax1642-34027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10220-012-0014-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245011600217520195800333592002802291650001802319650001602337650001902353650002802372650001302400650002202413650001302435650002002448650000902468650000902477650001402486653001302500653001502513653003402528653001602562653002202578653001102600700002002611700001902631700002402650700002902674700001902703700002102722700001902743700005802762773010502820856008602925852000903011655001203020IND60769996520221121015459.0220719e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076999652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2022.1137782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan-Coats, Stellan K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1422-456910aSomething new and something blue: Responses to novelty in a rodent model of depression and epilepsy comorbidity  aA bidirectional comorbidity exists between depression and epilepsy such that patients with epilepsy are at higher risk for developing depression, and vice versa. Each of these conditions individually can be complicated by behavioral effects that worsen quality of life, but less is known about these interactions within the comorbidity of depression and epilepsy. The SwLo rat has been selectively bred for depression-relevant behaviors and exhibits enhanced limbic seizure susceptibility. This study sought to characterize the effects of novelty and stress on the SwLo rodent model of this comorbidity. It was hypothesized that SwLo rats would exhibit altered responses to novelty, reflected in hyperactivity-, anxiety-, sensation seeking-, and/or compulsive behaviors, and that this would be exacerbated with stress. Compared to the SwHi rat (their depression- and epilepsy-resistant counterparts), SwLo rats showed increased entries in all areas of the Open Field Test and spent significantly more time in the light compartment of the Light-Dark Box. SwLo rats also had a significantly higher number of rearing behaviors in the inner squares of the Open Field Test, the closed arms of the Elevated Plus Maze, and both areas of the Light-Dark Box. They demonstrated increased Nestlet shredding but showed no difference in a marble burying task or in latency to consume food in a novelty suppressed feeding task. Interestingly, restraint stress showed little effect on these behaviors, despite increasing corticosterone levels. Combined, these results suggest an increase in exploratory sensation seeking and hypervigilant information-gathering behaviors in the SwLo rat that are not dependent on corticosterone levels. This shows the utility of this model for studying behavioral effects of comorbid depression and epilepsy and allows for their use in identifying underlying mechanisms or screening treatment strategies for this complex comorbidity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3acomorbidity 3acorticosterone 3aelevated plus-maze test 3aepilepsy 3amental depression 3anestlets 3aquality of life 3arats 3arisk 3asensation 0aEpilepsy 0aDepression 0aExploratory sensation seeking 0aComorbidity 0aNovel environment 0aStress1 aHughes, Sara D.1 aHolz, Faith M.1 aKreger, Rachelle B.1 aKoulibali, Chauncella I.1 aKhan, Humza A.1 aHarris, Kylie C.1 aKelly, Anna E.1 aEpps, S.Alisha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1422-45690 tPhysiology & behavior.g2022 May 15, v. 249 p.113778-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2022.1137783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245010100173300001600274520117500290592002801465650002101493650001801514650001101532650001301543650002401556650002901580650001901609653001801628653001801646653001301664653003201677653001401709653001501723700001801738700001401756700002401770700002201794773011001816856008501926852000902011655001202020IND60720637020221122225357.0210212e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072063702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Sterling S.10aTurbulence-parameter estimation for current-energy converters using surrogate model optimization  ap. 559-567.  aSurrogate models maximize information utility by building predictive models in place of computational or experimentally expensive model runs. Marine hydrokinetic current energy converters require large-domain simulations to estimate array efficiencies and environmental impacts. Meso-scale models typically represent turbines as actuator discs that act as momentum sinks and sources of turbulence and its dissipation. An OpenFOAM model was developed where actuator disc k-ε turbulence was characterized using an approach developed for flows through vegetative canopies. Turbine-wake data from laboratory flume experiments collected at two influent turbulence intensities were used to calibrate parameters in the turbulence-source terms in the k-ε equations. Parameter influences on longitudinal wake profiles were estimated using Gaussian process regression with subsequent optimization minimizing the objective function within 3.1% of those obtained using the full model representation, but for 74% of the computational cost (far fewer model runs). This framework facilitates more efficient parameterization of the turbulence-source equations using turbine-wake data.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydraulic flumes 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3amomentum 3anormal distribution 3arenewable energy sources 3aturbulent flow 0aActuator disc 0aMarine energy 0aOpenFOAM 0aGaussian process regression 0aSurrogate 0aTurbulence1 aSu, Jack C.P.1 aSilva, H.1 aChartrand, Chris C.1 aRoberts, Jesse D.0 tRenewable energy.g2021 May, v. 168 p.559-567dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245015900163300002000322520111600342592002801458650002401486650001201510650002101522650001901543650001801562650002201580650002001602650001901622650003301641650001301674650002201687650002101709700001501730700002101745773012301766856007401889852000901963655001201972IND60645890620221119192151.0190604e20190523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064589062DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra02999k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadokawa, Jun-ichi10aFormation of microparticles from amylose-grafted poly(γ-glutamic acid) networks obtained by thermostable phosphorylase-catalyzed enzymatic polymerization  ap. 16176-16182.  aAmylose is a natural polysaccharide with helical conformation, which spontaneously forms water-insoluble assemblies, such as double helixes and inclusion complexes, at ambient temperatures in aqueous media, whereas it is synthesized as a water-soluble single chain by thermostable phosphorylase-catalyzed enzymatic polymerization at elevated temperatures in aqueous buffer solvents. In this study, we investigated the enzymatic polymerization at 80 °C using a primer-grafted poly(γ-glutamic acid) (PGA) in the presence or absence of poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) as a guest polymer for inclusion by amylose. Consequently, the produced amylose-grafted PGAs formed microparticles by cooling the mixtures at room temperature after the enzymatic polymerization in either the presence or the absence of PLLA. The particle sizes, which were evaluated by SEM measurement, were dependent on the feed ratios of PLLA. Based on the characterization results by the powder X-ray diffraction, IR, and dynamic light scattering measurements, a mechanism for the formation of the microparticles in the present system is proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aamylose 3alight scattering 3amicroparticles 3aparticle size 3apolyglutamic acid 3apolylactic acid 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3athermal stability 3awater solubility1 aOrio, Saya1 aYamamoto, Kazuya0 tRSC advances.g2019 May 23, v. 9, no. 28 p.16176-16182dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra02999k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015900172300001600331520183700347592002802184650002702212650002002239650001602259650001702275650001402292650001602306650002702322650001402349650001502363650001402378650001502392650002602407650001702433700001702450700001702467773008602484856008902570852000902659655001202668IND60111705320221117225355.0150809e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011170532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkiner, M.M.10aYearly changes of insecticide susceptiblity and possible insecticide resistance mechanisms of Anopheles maculipennis Meigen (Diptera: Culicidae) in Turkey  ap. 280-285.  aTo evaluate the adulticide susceptibility and yearly changes of Anopheles maculipennis Meigen (Diptera: Culicidae) in Thrace, five mosquito populations were evaluated against the resistance status of four different adulticides. Three biochemical resistance mechanisms and yearly changes of activities were investigated. All the strains were highly resistant to DDT, and all the strains were placed in the resistance surveillance category for malathion, permethrin and deltamethrin in 2007. Although DDT mortality rates had increased from 2007 to 2008 except in the Seremkoy strain, malathion, permethrin and deltamethrin mortality rates have decreased in all of the tested strains. High rates of increase were determined for nonspecific esterases (NSEs) activity by using the substrate p-NPA and these results showed correlation with malathion mortality rates. All the strains showed high level of glutathione S transferases (GSTs), and their activity level had significantly increased from 2007 to 2008. Different insecticide susceptibility statuses were observed between localities, and high DDT resistance was observed although DDT was banned in the 1980s. Biochemical assay results suggest that NSEs and GSTs could play a role insecticide resistance in all tested strains. Malathion susceptibility has decreased in all the tested strains and NSE's activity is possibly the main enzymatic mechanism related to the insecticide resistance. DDT resistance is at a high degree in all the strains and GST's activity is probably related to this situation. GST's activity could play an important role for permethrin and deltamethrin susceptibility but needs to be confirmed for molecular studies. Our results provide important data on insecticide susceptibility and change over time for the Anopheles maculipennis populations in Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles maculipennis 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aadulticides 3adeltamethrin 3aesterases 3aglutathione 3ainsecticide resistance 3amalathion 3amonitoring 3amortality 3apermethrin 3aresistance mechanisms 3atransferases1 aCaglar, S.S.1 aSimsek, F.M.0 tActa tropica.g2013 June, v. 126, no. 3 p.280-285dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2013.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010500168300001500273520132300288592002801611650001701639650002501656650001501681650001401696650001601710650001801726650001401744650002101758650001201779650002101791650002001812650002601832653001901858653001701877653001601894653000801910653001401918653001601932700002001948773016201968856008702130852000902217655001202226IND60783062020221116184253.0220714e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078306202DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4479.2022.00014.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBal, Rajesh10aStudies on proximate composition and antioxidant activity of some specialty rice cultivars of Odisha  ap. 96-101.  aPeople are now becoming more concerned about their health, that is why they are moving to diets that have health claims and beneficial nutrients. Therefore, the present study was conducted to shed light on a few specialty rice cultivars from Odisha. These traditionally cultivated cultivars were rich in nutritional and health-promoting components. The objective of the present investigation was to carry out the nutritional value and antioxidant activity of these specialty rice cultivars from Odisha. A total of ten specialty rice (eight were aromatic and two were pigmented) and one as a check variety were taken in the study. The results showed that the selected specialty rice cultivars (pigmented and scented) were found to be superior to check variety in different nutritional parameters in the grain such as carbohydrates (71.31- 84.33 g%), crude protein (6.66- 10.384 g%), crude fibre (0.19- 0.984 g%), crude fat (1.08- 2.35 g%), total phenolic content (0.27- 0.83 g GAE/100gm), total anthocyanin (0.31- 5.02 Cya-3-gluE mg/100g FW), and antioxidant activity (10.21- 55.32%). From the results, it could be concluded that the black rice cultivar appeared to be a promising cultivar with a superior nutritional composition and antioxidant activity and thus has importance in health and great market potentiality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3ablack rice 3acrude fat 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3ahealth promotion 3amarkets 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aproximate composition 0aSpecialty rice 0aCarbohydrate 0aCrude fibre 0aAsh 0aPhenolics 0aAnthocyanin1 aKandali, Ranjan0 tIndian journal of agricultural biochemistry.g2022 June, v. 35, no. 1 p.96-101dThe Indian Society of Agricultural BiochemistswJournal:2076x0974-44797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-4479.2022.00014.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011000176300001800286520184700304592002802151596008502179650003002264650001202294650001402306650001402320650002002334650001602354650001902370650001502389651000902404700005702413773013502470856008202605852000902687655001202696IND60675287620221117063517.0191105e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067528762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-019-02872-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmani-Dehaghi, Narjes10aSpatiotemporal assessment of the PERSIANN family of satellite precipitation data over Fars Province, Iran  ap. 1333-1357.  aHigh resolution and global coverage of the satellite-based precipitation data have been found useful in many climate and hydrological studies, particularly in limited and nongauged areas. Due to systematic and nonsystematic factors, there are always deviations between ground-based and satellite-based precipitation. Among many satellite-based precipitation products, the PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks) family products attracted more attention. In this paper, we evaluated the PERSIANN family of monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation data over Fars Province, Iran, at four different spatial scales, namely point (station), pixel, regional, and provincial during the period of 2003–2015 using 132 rain gauge data as baseline. The performance of the products was first evaluated by calculating some statistical metrics. The result shows that in all spatial and temporal scales, the three products mirror the precipitation pattern and underestimate the precipitation in the province. The PERSIANN-CDR outperforms the other two products and is the superior product. The performance of PERSIANNN products is the best at the provincial scale followed by regional, pixel, and point scales. The performance of PERSIANN family products is also evaluated by the quantile–quantile plot from which a set of equations is proposed to accurately predict precipitation in Fars Province from the PERSIANN-CDR precipitation data. The proposed equations are verified by 2-year precipitation data that were not used in the assessment of the products. These equations provide highly accurate precipitation data from PERSIANN-CDR data particularly in nongauged sites at various spatiotemporal scales for application such as in statistical hydrology and hydroclimate-related projects.  aPublisher supplied data  a93GRD1M1206cOffice of the Vice Chancellor for Research, Shiraz University, Iran 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate 3aequations 3ahydrology 3aneural networks 3arain gauges 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aIran1 aSamani, Nozar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3959-86120 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2019 Nov., v. 138, no. 3-4 p.1333-1357dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02872-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03357naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245019900159300002000358520197300378592002802351650001902379650001402398650003602412650002902448650001902477650004402496650002202540650001102562650001002573650002602583651002002609700001902629700002402648700001902672700002002691700003002711773012302741856007402864852000902938655001202947IND60645890820221119192231.0190604e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064589082DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra03105g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFayez, Shaimaa10aAncistrobreveines A–D and related dehydrogenated naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids with antiproliferative activities against leukemia cells, from the West African liana Ancistrocladus abbreviatus  ap. 15738-15748.  aA unique series of six biaryl natural products displaying four different coupling types (5,1′, 7,1′, 7,8′, and 5,8′) were isolated from the roots of the West African liana Ancistrocladus abbreviatus (Ancistrocladaceae).

Among the African Ancistrocladus species, A. abbreviatus is so far only the second one that was found to produce compounds with such a molecular entity. Here, we report on four new representatives, named ancistrobreveines A–D (12–14, and 6). They were identified along with the two known alkaloids 6-O-methylhamateine (4) and ent-dioncophylleine A (10). The two latter naphthylisoquinolines had so far only been detected in Ancistrocladus species from Southeast Asia. All of these fully dehydrogenated alkaloids have in common being optically active despite the absence of stereogenic centers, due to the presence of the rotationally hindered biaryl axis as the only element of chirality. Except for ent-dioncophylleine A (10), which lacks an oxygen function at C-6, the ancistrobreveines A–D (12–14, and 6) and 6-O-methylhamateine (4) are 6-oxygenated alkaloids, and are, thus, typical ‘Ancistrocladaceae-type’ compounds. Ancistrobreveine C (14), is the first – and so far only – example of a 7,8′-linked fully dehydrogenated naphthylisoquinoline discovered in nature that is configurationally stable at the biaryl axis. The stereostructures of the new alkaloids were established by spectroscopic (in particular HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR) and chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism) methods. Ancistrobreveine C (14) and 6-O-methylhamateine (4) exhibited strong antiproliferative activities against drug-sensitive acute lymphoblastic CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and their multidrug-resistant subline, CEM/ADR5000.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAncistrocladus 3aalkaloids 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoptical isomerism 3aoxygen 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3aSouth East Asia1 aFeineis, Doris1 aAké Assi, Laurent,1 aSeo, Ean-Jeong1 aEfferth, Thomas1 aBringmann, G.q(Gerhard),0 tRSC advances.g2019 May 20, v. 9, no. 28 p.15738-15748dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra03105g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245011600166520181700282592002802099650001202127650002202139650002802161650002602189650001502215650002402230650001502254650002302269650001702292650003002309651003002339700001602369700001902385700002202404700002502426773012202451856007902573852000902652655001202661IND60646935020221121080337.0190614e20181010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064693502DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy81002242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadewa, Emmanuel10aSoil Moisture Mapping Using Multi-Frequency and Multi-Coil Electromagnetic Induction Sensors on Managed Podzols  aPrecision agriculture (PA) involves the management of agricultural fields including spatial information of soil properties derived from apparent electrical conductivity (EC<inf>a</inf>) measurements. While this approach is gaining much attention in agricultural management, farmed podzolic soils are under-represented in the relevant literature. This study: (i) established the relationship between EC<inf>a</inf> and soil moisture content (SMC) measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR); and (ii) evaluated the estimated SMC with EC<inf>a</inf> measurements obtained with two electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors, i.e., multi-coil and multi-frequency, using TDR measured SMC. Measurements were taken on several plots at Pynn&rsquo;s Brook Research Station, Pasadena, Newfoundland, Canada. The means of EC<inf>a</inf> measurements were calculated for the same sampling location in each plot. The linear regression models generated for SMC using the CMD-MINIEXPLORER were statistically significant with the highest R2 of 0.79 and the lowest RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.015 m3 m&minus;3 but were not significant for GEM-2 with the lowest R2 of 0.17 and RMSE of 0.045 m3 m&minus;3; this was due to the difference in the depth of investigation between the two EMI sensors. The validation of the SMC regression models for the two EMI sensors produced the highest R2 = 0.54 with the lowest RMSE prediction = 0.031 m3 m&minus;3 given by CMD-MINIEXPLORER. The result demonstrated that the CMD-MINIEXPLORER based measurements better predicted shallow SMC, while deeper SMC was better predicted by GEM-2 measurements. In addition, the EC<inf>a</inf> measurements obtained through either multi-coil or multi-frequency sensors have the potential to be successfully employed for SMC mapping at the field scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodzols 3aagricultural land 3aelectrical conductivity 3aprecision agriculture 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspatial data 3atime domain reflectometry 3aNewfoundland and Labrador1 aUnc, Adrian1 aCheema, Mumtaz1 aKavanagh, Vanessa1 aGalagedara, Lakshman0 tAgronomy.g2018 Oct. 10, v. 8, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy81002243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001600188245017200204300001100376506007600387520162000463592002802083596005002111596005002161596005302211506003702264650001802301650002302319650001402342650001902356650001302375650001902388700001702407700001502424700001302439700001502452700001702467773010502484856008202589852000902671655001202680IND60585052420221207070256.0211224e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058505242DNAL7 aPMC56630622pmcid7 a290937432pmid7 a10.1186/s13007-017-0242-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Heng10aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra revealing the inter-cultivar differences for Chinese ornamental Flos Chrysanthemum: a new promising method for plant taxonomy  ap. 92.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Flos Chrysanthemi, as a part of Chinese culture for a long history, is valuable for not only environmental decoration but also the medicine and food additive. Due to their voluminously various breeds and extensive distributions worldwide, it is burdensome to make recognition and classification among numerous cultivars with conventional methods which still rest on the level of morphologic observation and description. As a fingerprint spectrum for parsing molecular information, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) could be a suitable candidate technique to characterize and distinguish the inter-cultivar differences at molecular level. RESULTS: SERS spectra were used to analyze the inter-cultivar differences among 26 cultivars of Chinese ornamental Flos Chrysanthemum. The characteristic peaks distribution patterns were abstracted from SERS spectra and varied from cultivars to cultivars. For the bands distributed in the pattern map, the similarities in general showed their commonality while in the finer scales, the deviations and especially the particular bands owned by few cultivars revealed their individualities. Since the Raman peaks could characterize specific chemical components, those diversity of patterns could indicate the inter-cultivar differences at the chemical level in fact. CONCLUSION: In this paper, SERS technique is feasible for distinguishing the inter-cultivar differences among Flos Chrysanthemum. The Raman spectral library was built with SERS characteristic peak distribution patterns. A new method was proposed for Flos Chrysanthemum recognition and taxonomy.  aPublisher supplied data  a61422507cNatural Science Foundation of China  a61475095cNatural Science Foundation of China  a61520106014cNatural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChrysanthemum 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acultivars 3afood additives 3amedicine 3aplant taxonomy1 aChen, Zhenyi1 aLi, Taihao1 aChen, Na1 aXu, Wenjie1 aLiu, Shupeng0 tPlant methods.g2017 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.92-92dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-017-0242-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245021600157520169800373592002802071650001802099650001402117650001202131650002502143650001702168650001902185650002002204650001202224650001602236650001002252650002902262651001202291700001902303700002402322700002302346700002302369700001902392700002402411773012002435856007402555852000902629655001202638IND60790937120221122073247.0220826e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079093712DNAL7 a10.3390/f130812112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanaa, Fadil 10aBiomass and Carbon Stock Quantification in Cork Oak Forest of Maamora Using a New Approach Based on the Combination of Aerial Laser Scanning Carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Terrestrial Laser Scanning Data  aThe Mediterranean forests, particularly Cork oak (Quercus suber L., 1927), make a major contribution to the fight against climate change through Carbon sequestration. Hence, there is a great interest in the accurate quantification of biomass and carbon stock. In this context, this study aims at assessing the performance of a new approach, based on the combination of Unmanned aerial vehicle airborne Aerial laser scanning (ALS-UAV) and Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, in the determination of dendrometric parameters (Circumference at 1.30 m and Tree Height), and consequently the estimation of biomass and carbon stock, considering field data as reference. This study takes the Maamora forest in Morocco as an example of a Mediterranean Cork oak forest. The methodology consists of collecting data at three levels: the entire area level for an ALS-UAV scan, the plot and tree levels for TLS surveys, as well as field data collection. Afterwards, dendrometric parameters (Circumference at 1.30 m and the Tree height) were estimated using individual tree segmentation and biomass; the carbon stock (aboveground, belowground, and total) was estimated using allometric equations. The comparison of the estimated dendrometric parameters with those measured in the field shows a strong relationship, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.86 and 0.83, a correlation coefficient (R²) of 0.81 and 0.71, and a Root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.84 cm and 0.47 m, respectively. Concerning the biomass and carbon stock estimation, the proposed approach gives a satisfactory accuracy, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.77, an R2 of 0.83, and an RMSE of 36.40 kg for biomass and 20.24 kg for carbon stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus suber 3aallometry 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aforests 3atree height 3atrees 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aMorocco1 aImane, Sebari 1 aMohamed, Bouhaloua 1 aKenza, Ait El kadi1 aSouhail, Kellouch 1 aLfalah, Hamza 1 aKhadija, Meghraoui 0 tForests.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130812113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010200168300001600270500001500286520100500301592002801306650001801334650002201352650001801374650001001392650002101402650001601423650005201439650002901491650003001520650001201550651000901562653001001571700002601581700001801607700002101625773008201646856008101728852000901809655001201818IND60575585320221123034741.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057558532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-016-1422-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozorgi, Naghmeh10aSplicing features in the expression of the complementary-sense genes of Beet curly top Iran virus  ap. 323-327.  a2019-12-06  aBeet curly top Iran virus (BCTIV) is a distinct geminivirus which has been reported from sugar-beet-growing farms in Iran. In this study, the role of the splicing in expression of complementary-sense genes of BCTIV was studied. Total RNA was extracted from BCTIV-infected tissue, and the predicted intron position of complementary-sense mRNA transcripts was amplified by RT-PCR followed by cloning of the amplicons. Sequence confirmed that both spliced and unspliced mRNAs are synthesized by the same transcription unit. Sequence comparison showed that a 155-nt segment (intron) corresponding to nucleotides 1890–2044 of the viral genome has been removed from the latter transcript and therefore fusion of the C1:C2 genes resulted creation of a continuous reading frame for potential production of intact replication initiator protein (Rep). BCTIV intron comprises of most consensus splicing signals required for splicing in eukaryotes and several plant viruses including mastre- and capulaviruses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant viruses 3asequence analysis 3amessenger RNA 3afarms 3aeukaryotic cells 3anucleotides 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3aBeet curly top Iran virus 3aintrons 3aIran 0agenes1 aHeydarnejad, Jahangir1 aKamali, Mehdi1 aMassumi, Hossain0 tVirus genes.g2017 Apr., v. 53, no. 2 p.323-327dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1422-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011500175300001800290520189800308536012502206592002802331596001702359650001302376650002002389650002602409650001902435650002802454651001302482653001902495653001902514653002402533653003302557653002602590700002602616700003102642700002302673700002402696773013902720856008602859852000902945655001202954IND60791162720221119041954.0220826e20220603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079116272DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2022.21056662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawant, Shrutika S.10aMulti-objective multi-verse optimizer based unsupervised band selection for hyperspectral image classification  ap. 3990-4024.  aHyperspectral band selection is one of the efficacious ways to diminish the size of hyperspectral images. The process of selecting a few useful bands will be successful when two fundamental aspects are considered: information abundance and redundancy among the chosen bands. However, selecting the suitable number of bands in an ill-posed classification problem remains challenging. Overcoming this issue, a novel unsupervised multi-objective multi-verse optimizer-based band selection (MOMVOBS) approach is proposed. It explores optimal trade-offs among the different traits of the objective functions namely information richness, less redundancy and the number of bands to be selected. These three objective functions are optimized simultaneously using a multiverse optimizer (MVO) to obtain the best solutions. To evaluate the quality of selected bands, two widely used supervised classifiers are used, such as support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). Experimental results evidence for the superiority of the proposed approach over the recent multi-objective optimization-based band selection approaches by selecting the highly informative distinct bands that have better classification performance on four benchmark hyperspectral data sets. The proposed MOMVOBS have obtained 79.50% and 71.35% of overall accuracy for SVM and KNN classifier, respectively, in Indian Pines dataset with 10% of band retention, 93.06% and 88.88% of overall accuracy for SVM and KNN classifier, respectively, in Salinas dataset with 10% of band retention, 92.86% and 85.35% of overall accuracy for SVM and KNN classifier, respectively, in Pavia University dataset with 15% band retention, and 92.42% and 85.33% of overall accuracy for SVM and KNN classifier, respectively, in Botswana dataset with 11% band retention. The achievement of higher accuracy at less than 15% bands is significant.  aThe work was supported by the  New Faculty Grant Program, PSAU – College of Engineering, Saudi Arabia [2018/01/9362].  aPublisher supplied data  a2018/01/9362 3aAesculus 3adata collection 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3asupport vector machines 3aBotswana 0aBand selection 0aclassification 0ahyperspectral image 0amulti-objective optimization 0amulti-verse optimizer1 aPrabukumar, Manoharan1 aLoganathan, Agilandeeswari1 aAlenizi, Farhan A.1 aIngaleshwar, Subodh0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2022 June 03, v. 43, no. 11 p.3990-4024dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2022.21056663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245017200172520177600344592002802120650002102148650002102169650002002190650001202210650001502222650001702237650001502254650001702269650001402286650001302300650001902313650001102332700002702343700002002370700002102390773012502411856008302536852000902619655001202628IND60781097920221118033820.0220623e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078109792DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems60200562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafeiriou, Ioannis 10aSelenium Uptake by Lettuce Plants and Se Distribution in Soil Chemical Phases Affected by the Application Rate and the Presence of a Seaweed Extract-Based Biostimulant  aTo tackle selenium (Se) malnutrition, biofortification is among the proposed strategies. A biostimulant application in soils is thought to support a plant’s growth and productivity. Biofortification with Se(VI) may lead to a leaching hazard due to the high mobility of Se(VI) in the soil environment. In this study, the effect of the application of two Se(VI) rates—5 and 10 mg kg⁻¹ soil—and a biostimulant on the Se uptake by lettuce plants and on the Se(VI) distribution in soil fractions following the plants harvest, was investigated. Phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) concentrations in plants were also determined. A high Se(VI) rate suppressed plant growth, leading to a significant fresh weight decrease from 12.28 to 7.55 g and from 14.6 to 2.43 g for the control and high Se(VI) without and with biostimulants, respectively. Impaired plant growth was verified by the SPAD, NDVI and NDRE measurements. The significantly highest Se concentration in plants, 325 mg kg⁻¹, was recorded for the high Se(VI) rate in the presence of the biostimulant. Compared to controls, the low Se(VI) rate significantly decreased P and increased the S concentrations in plants. The post-harvest soil fractionation revealed that, in the presence of the biostimulant, the Se(VI) soluble fraction increased from 0.992 to 1.3 mg kg⁻¹ at a low Se(VI) rate, and decreased from 3.T85 to 3.13 mg kg⁻¹ at a high Se(VI) rate. Nevertheless, at a low Se(VI) rate, 3.6 and 3.1 mg kg⁻¹ of the added Se(VI) remained in the soil in less mobile forms, in the presence or absence of the biostimulant, respectively. This study indicated that the exogenous application of Se in soil exerted dual effects on lettuce growth and Se availability, depending on the level of selenate applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication rate 3abiofortification 3aedaphic factors 3alettuce 3amacroalgae 3amalnutrition 3aphosphorus 3aplant growth 3aselenates 3aselenium 3asoil separates 3asulfur1 aGasparatos, Dionisios 1 aIoannou, Dafni 1 aMassas, Ioannis 0 tSoil systems.g2022 June 15, v. 6, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems60200563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013500154300001800289520158100307592002801888650001401916650002301930650001501953650002101968650001101989650001702000650002002017650001302037650001802050650001202068650001502080650001502095650002402110650001602134650001902150700001502169700001902184700001502203700002402218700001902242773012602261856007402387852000902461655001202470IND60709146320221116233703.0200902e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070914632DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc01412e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Libo10aUtilizing hydrogen underpotential deposition in CO reduction for highly selective formaldehyde production under ambient conditions  ap. 5639-5647.  aFormaldehyde is an essential building block for hundreds of chemicals and a promising liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), yet its indirect energy-intensive synthesis process prohibits it from playing a more significant role. Here we report a direct CO reduction to formaldehyde (CORTF) process that utilizes hydrogen underpotential deposition to overcome the thermodynamic barrier and the scaling relationship restriction. This is the first time that this reaction has been realized under ambient conditions. Using molybdenum phosphide as a catalyst, formaldehyde was produced with nearly a 100% faradaic efficiency in aqueous KOH solution, with its formation rate being one order of magnitude higher compared with the state-of-the-art thermal catalysis approach. Simultaneous tuning of the current density and reaction temperature led to a more selective and productive formaldehyde synthesis, indicating the electrochemical and thermal duality of this reaction. DFT calculations revealed that the desorption of the *H₂CO intermediate likely served as the rate-limiting step, and the participation of H₂O made the reaction thermodynamically favorable. Furthermore, a full-cell reaction set-up was demonstrated with CO hydrogenation to HCHO achieved without any energy input, which fully realized the spontaneous potential of the reaction. Our study shows the feasibility of combining thermal and electrochemical approaches for realizing the thermodynamics and for scaling relationship-confined reactions, which could serve as a new strategy in future reaction design.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aformaldehyde 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3aliquids 3amolybdenum 3aphosphides 3apotassium hydroxide 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aPan, Yanbo1 aShen, Xiaochen1 aWu, Dezhen1 aBentalib, Abdulaziz1 aPeng, Zhenmeng0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 22, no. 17 p.5639-5647dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc01412e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245016400157520208400321592002802405650001202433650001702445650003002462650001502492650001202507650001202519650003002531650001302561650001502574650001902589651001202608700002402620700002202644700002302666773012002689856007402809852000902883655001202892IND60790937320221122063506.0220826e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079093732DNAL7 a10.3390/f130811592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLouail, Amal 10aRemote Sensing and Phytoecological Methods for Mapping and Assessing Potential Ecosystem Services of the Ouled Hannèche Forest in the Hodna Mountains, Algeria  aRegardless of their biogeographic origins or degree of artificialization, the world’s forests are a source of a wide range of ecosystem services (ES). However, the quality and quantity of these services depend on the type of forest studied and its phytogeographic context. Our objective is to transpose the concept of ES, in particular, the assessment of forest ES, to the specific Mediterranean context of the North African mountains, where this issue is still in its infancy and where access to the data needed for assessment remains difficult. Our work presents an introductory approach, allowing us to set up methodological and scientific milestones based on open-access remote sensing data and already tested geospatial processing associated with phytoecological surveys to assess the ES provided by forests in an Algerian study area. Specifically, several indicators used to assess (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the potential ES of the Ouled Hannèche forest, a forest located in the Hodna Mountains, are derived from LANDSAT 8 OLI images from 2017 and an ALOS AW3D30 DSM. The qualitative ES typology is jointly based on an SVM classification of topographically corrected LANDSAT images and a geomorphic-type classification using the geomorphon method. NDVI is a quantitative estimator of many plant ecosystem functions related to ES. It highlights the variations in the provision of ES according to the types of vegetation formations present. It serves as a support for estimating spectral heterogeneity through Rao’s quadratic entropy, which is considered a relative indicator of biodiversity at the landscape scale. The two previous variables (the multitemporal NDVI and Rao’s Q), completed by the Shannon entropy method applied to the geomorphon classes as a proxy for topo-morphological heterogeneity, constitute the input variables of a quantitative map of the potential supply of ES in the forest determined by Spatial Multicriteria Analysis (SMCA). Ultimately, our results serve as a useful basis for land-use planning and biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aecosystems 3aentropy 3aforests 3ageographical distribution 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aphytogeography 3aAlgeria1 aMessner, François 1 aDjellouli, Yamna 1 aGharzouli, Rachid 0 tForests.g2022 July 22, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f130811593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245007800162300001400240500002000254520182900274592002802103650002202131650002102153650002002174650002202194650001402216650002302230650001002253650002802263650001702291650001102308650002102319650002502340650002902365650000702394650003902401650002302440650001302463650001602476700001802492700002302510773012702533856007802660852000902738655001202747IND60588405220221123023934.0180117e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058840522DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017003572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Satbir10aCharacterization of a robust serine protease from Bacillus subtilis K‐1  ap. 88-98.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aProcess apt microbial proteases due to their wide range industrial applications have become the focus of intense scientific research during recent years. Considering the hostile process milieu, the proteases intended for application must be robust enough to withstand the extremes of temperature and pH, and presence of organic solvents and other potential enzyme inhibitors. Current study presents the characterization of a robust protease from a previously isolated bacterium Bacillus subtilis K‐1 (BSK‐1). Purification of BSK‐1 protease (5.21‐fold) was achieved to homogeneity by salt (ammonium sulfate) precipitation, and ion‐exchange (diethyl‐aminoethyl‐sephadex) and size exclusion chromatography (Sephadex G‐100). Molecular weight of BSK‐1 protease was determined by SDS‐PAGE analysis (42 kDa). Though the optimum temperature and pH for BSK‐1 protease activity was 50 °C and 10, respectively, but, the protease exhibited remarkable activity and stability over elevated temperatures (60–80 °C) and a broad pH range (pH 7–11). Protease showed resistance towards several organic solvents/other potential enzyme inhibitors. Drastic activity loss in presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride indicated that the enzyme is a serine protease. Kinetic parameters (Kₘ and Vₘₐₓ) for BSK‐1 protease were found to be 0.14 mg ml⁻¹ and 1176 mg min⁻¹, respectively. Putative amino acid sequence of BSK‐1 protease (derived from nucleotide sequence of protease gene) suggested that the enzyme belonged to peptidases S8/S53 super family with multidomain of S8. BSK‐1 protease being stable under harsh conditions may serve a model system for understanding the molecular basis of stability, and may help designing novel proteases that are suitable for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aammonium sulfate 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afluorides 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3aion exchange 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3anucleotide sequences 3aorganofluorine compounds 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aserine proteinases 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aGupta, Puneet1 aBajaj, Bijender K.0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2018 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.88-98dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2017003573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03919naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245013800195500001900333500002000352520250900372592002802881596005002909596006302959650002303022650001503045650003003060650002803090650001103118650001903129650002003148650002103168650001203189651001003201700001703211700002103228700001503249700001303264700001503277773011003292856007403402852000903476655001203485IND60684326220221120092558.0200218e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068432622DNAL7 a10.1111/maec.125802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3915-578510aAssessing the response of sandy‐beach macrobenthos to recreation and the ecological status of the beach ecosystem at Liandao, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSandy beaches, prime recreational assets that attract more people than other types of shorelines, are the main assets underpinning many coastal economies and developments. However, the intense stressors to the ecology of sandy beaches caused by recreational activities are generally underestimated or ignored. This study was the first to emphasize the ecological characteristics of recreational beaches in China and assess the response of macrobenthos at Liandao Beach, a typical sandy beach in the central part of China. Using the Before/During/After/Control/Impact (BDACI) method, differences in multiple variables (species richness, mean density, diversity) between a heavily recreationally impacted transect (TrH/Impact) and a less‐impacted transect (TrL/Control) in different impact periods (Before, During & After) were applied to assess the response of sandy‐beach macrobenthos to recreation and tourism. Meanwhile, a comparison between the macrobenthos conditions of the studied beach and reference conditions calculating from historical data of similar beaches with little recreation and tourism disturbances was carried out. Furthermore, the quality control chart approach was used to detect in detail the macrobenthos stable state and yearly response to recreational activities. The results showed that recreation and tourism posed a serious threat to the beach ecosystem; macrobenthos on the studied beach were seriously disturbed by recreational activities, and their variations were highly negatively related to the human recreational level. After monthly recreational impacts, the macrobenthos decreased sharply and recovered with difficulty during 1 year. Over the long‐term, the macrobenthos had a sharp decreasing trend, which indicated that the ecological environment of the beach was highly disturbed. Conservation measures for recreational beaches are very challenging because of the economic value and popularity of sandy beaches as recreational sites. However, practicable conservation measures could be implemented that prevent or slow ecological degradation. A number of management and conservation suggestions are put forward, such as the establishment of the ecological carrying capacity of Liandao Beach in terms of direct recreational use, creation of themed exhibitions related to the beach macrobenthos and beach ecosystem and dissemination of this knowledge to visitors, implementation of spatial zoning of beach use, visitor management and environmental education.  aPublisher supplied data  a41471431cNatural Science Foundation of China  aBK20130056cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental education 3ahumans 3amarine science 3aquality control 3aspecies richness 3atourism 3aChina1 aZou, Xinqing1 aZhong, Chongqing1 aYu, Wenwen1 aLi, Yali1 aWang, Teng0 tMarine ecology.g2020 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.e12580-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:1992x0173-95657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.125803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008100166520167000247592002801917650001901945650001901964650002501983650001402008650001702022650002002039650002102059650001602080650002102096650002602117650001302143650001902156650002402175650001802199650001502217650001002232650001302242773012502255856008302380852000902463655001202472IND60781098020221118033754.0220623e20220331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078109802DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems60200332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerke, Jörg 14aThe Central Role of Soil Organic Matter in Soil Fertility and Carbon Storage  aThe aim of the paper is to give an overview on the chemistry of soil organic carbon (SOC) affecting nutrient availability, the emission of greenhouse gases and detoxifying harmful substances in soil. Humic substances represent the stable part of SOC, accounting for between 50 and more than 80% of organically bound carbon in soil. Humic substances strongly affect the soil solution concentration of several plant nutrients and may increase P-, Fe-, and Cu- solubility, thereby increasing their plant availability. Soil organic carbon, mainly humic substances, can detoxify monomeric Al in acid soils, can strongly bind toxic heavy metals, making them unavailable to the plant roots, and may strongly bind a vast variety of harmful organic pollutants. Increasing SOC is an important goal in agriculture. The inclusion of mixtures of semi-perennial plant species and cultivars may strongly increase SOC and humic substance content in soils. To increase SOC, farmyard manure and its rotted or composted forms are superior compared to the separate application of straw and slurry to soil. The storage of carbon, mainly in organic form, in soils is very important in the context of the emission of greenhouse gases. Worldwide, soils release about 10 times more greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuel combustion. Small increments in SOC worldwide will strongly affect the concentration of atmospheric CO₂. The public discussion on soil fertility and greenhouse gas emissionshas been politically controlled in a way that leaves the important and positive contribution of soil organic carbon and mainly humic substances partly misinterpreted and partly underestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acultivars 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouses 3ahumic substances 3anutrient availability 3aslurries 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil solution 3asolubility 3astraw 3atoxicity0 tSoil systems.g2022 Mar. 31, v. 6, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems60200333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013400162300001400296500002000310520119800330592002801528650002501556650002901581650001601610650002201626650001901648650002301667650003001690650001401720650001201734650002401746650001601770650001101786650001601797650001001813650001101823700001501834700001201849700001601861773012701877856007802004852000902082655001202091IND60588405320221123023847.0180117e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058840532DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017002642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zongling10aBiocontrol ability of killer yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) isolated from wine against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides on grape  ap. 60-67.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA total of 216 killer yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, isolated from wine, were evaluated in controlling Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, a pre‐harvest anthracnose agent of grape. Three of these yeast isolates were tested positive for antagonizing C. gloeosporioides and were further evaluated for their mechanisms as biological control agents (BCAs): production of antifungal compounds, production of hydrolytic enzymes, inhibition of C. gloeosporioides conidia germination, colonization on grape berry, and efficiency in controlling anthracnose of grape. The results showed that all three S. cerevisiae isolates produced antifungal compounds, inhibited C. gloeosporioides conidia germination and produced β‐1,3‐glucanase and chitinase. All isolates colonized grape berry in large quantities and controlled C. gloeosporioides when artificially inoculated on grape berry. Among the three isolates, application of isolate GA8 resulted in 69.7% of disease reductions for C. gloeosporioides on grape berry. The antagonistic isolates of S. cerevisiae could represent important BCAs of anthracnose of grape caused by C. gloeosporioides that are responsible for economic losses in viticulture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanthracnose 3aantifungal agents 3abeta-glucanase 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3achitinase 3aconidia 3afinancial economics 3agermination 3agrapes 3aviticulture 3awines 3ayeasts1 aDu, Shuang1 aRen, Yi1 aLiu, Yanlin0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2018 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.60-67dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2017002643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03866naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005700154245023300211520197800444592002802422650002402450650001202474650001202486650001802498650001202516650002002528650001602548650001002564650002302574650001002597650001002607650002102617650001502638650001302653650002202666650001502688653000702703653000802710653000702718653000802725653000702733653001202740653000802752653000702760653000802767653000702775653000902782653000802791653000602799653000802805653001302813653001802826653004302844653001602887700002102903700005402924700002202978773011803000856008903118852000903207655001203216IND60733376720221118191622.0211001e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073337672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1149272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJlali, Maamer1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9741-309510aInvestigating the effect of available phosphorus and calcium level on the potential of a multi-carbohydrase and phytase complex on growth performance, amino acids and phosphorus digestibility in broilers from 1 to 21 days of age  aAn experiment was carried out to investigate the influence of dietary available phosphorus (avP) and calcium (Ca) levels on the nutritional potential of a multi-carbohydrase and phytase complex (MCPC) on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of amino acids (AA) and phosphorus (P) and performance of broilers fed with corn-soybean meal based-diets from 1 to 21 day of age. A total of 400 one-day-old male Cobb 500 chicks were allocated to 4 treatments in a randomized complete block design with 2 × 2 factorial arrangements of treatments. The two factors were levels of avP and Ca (adequate =4.5 g avP and 9. 0 g Ca per kg or suboptimal =3.5 g av and 7.5 g Ca per kg) and levels of MCPC supplementation (0 or 200 mL per ton feed). Growth performance, feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were measured on day 21. Excreta samples were collected on days 19–21 and ileal digesta were collected from all birds on day 21. There was an interaction between avP and Ca levels and MCPC on the final body weight (P < 0.001), body weight gain (BWG, P < 0.001) and FI (P = 0.002) from 1 to 21 days of age. Regardless of the dietary level of avP and Ca, supplementation with MCPC improved (P < 0.001) the BWG and the FCR. An interaction (P < 0.05) was also observed between level of avP and Ca and MCPC on AID of Cys, Gly, His, Lys, Met, Ser, Thr, Tyr, and Val. The addition of MCPC also improved (P < 0.001) apparent ileal digestibility of overall amino acids (AA) by (4.0% and 5.9%) and P (39% and 37%) for adequate and suboptimal levels of avP and Ca, respectively. This study demonstrated that MCPC is an effective solution to improve the availability of AA and P for broilers and consequently the performance. It also highlighted the need to consider interactions with dietary avP and Ca levels to optimize the nutritional benefits of an enzyme solution combining multi-carbohydrase and phytase activities in poultry nutrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight changes 3acalcium 3adigesta 3adigestibility 3aexcreta 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3agrowth performance 3aileum 3amales 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3apoultry nutrition 3atechnology 0aAA 0aavP 0aBW 0aBWG 0aCa 0adig.

This study presents a new feature space assessment protocol for oil spill mapping using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). First, we selected five free Sentinel-1A sensor images from the GEE catalogue. Next, we processed the features evaluated from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) spectral and texture data. A recursive protocol that comprises a sequential classification of the evaluated image was also applied, wherein each iteration, the feature with less importance, was removed based on the Gini index. We used the Random Forest algorithm for image classification. Each image was trained on 10,000 points and evaluated for accuracy, with an equal number of points collected independently. Our results showed that the Sum Average (Savg), Convolution Smooth (Smooth), Cluster Shade Shade, and Gray level Correlation (Corr) features were essential to identify oil spills and increase the accuracy values. The best classification results based on the features removal experiment and global accuracy were Angola (0.9960), Trinidad and Tobago (0.9829), Italy (0.9506), Kuwait (0.9547), and Dubai (0.9344). Furthermore, it revealed that the protocol created was essential for better understanding the parameter space to detect oil spills with SAR images.  aThis study is part of an ongoing project funded by the Brazilian Navy, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPQ), and the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MCTI) call CNPQ/MCTI June 2020 – _Research and Development for Coping with Oil Spills on the Brazilian Coast – Ciências do Mar Program, grant #440852/2020–0.

Defining specific indicators and thresholds for ecosystem services in line with land-related SDGs is crucial to establish “Lighthouses” that can act as inspiring examples if they meet the various thresholds. This exploratory paper discusses indicators and thresholds for an arable farm operating on marine, calcareous light clay soils in the Netherlands. Studies of a system experiment are used to discuss and test operational methodology to be widely applied when characterizing many “Living Labs” in future, as planned by the European Union. The important role of soils in contributing to ecosystem services is discussed in terms of soil health. Recommendations are made for innovative methodology to be associated with all land-related SDGs. Satisfying the thresholds of ecosystem services, which will vary by soil type, region and farm type, can be the basis for farm subsidies, such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Research on Living Labs and in system experiments has to be judged by different criteria than those associated with traditional linear research. The important contributions of soils to achieve ecosystem services are framed in terms of soil health and are the most effective way to promote soil science in a by now widely desired inter- and transdisciplinary context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aclay 3aecosystems 3asoil quality 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3aNetherlands1 ade Haan, Janjo 1 aDekkers, Maria-Franca S.0 tSoil systems.g2022 Apr. 08, v. 6, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems60200343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011500165300001800280520088200298592002801180650001801208650002201226650003701248650002301285650001301308650001201321650002201333650001901355650002001374650001301394650002101407650001301428650001901441650000701460650002501467700001701492700002001509700001801529700001601547700001201563773014501575856008301720852000901803655001201812IND60654011620221118123658.0210731e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065401162DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-019-02132-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jun feng10aSimultaneous removal of Cd2+, NO3-N and hardness by the bacterium Acinetobacter sp.

Optimum conditions were determined experimentally by varying the type of organic matter used, initial Cd²⁺ concentration, and pH. Under the optimum conditions, the maximum removal ratios of Cd²⁺, NO₃-N and hardness were 100.00, 89.85 and 71.63%, respectively. The mechanism of Cd²⁺ removal is a combination of co-precipitation with calcium carbonate and pH. Further confirmation that Cd²⁺ can be removed by strain CN86 was provided by XRD and XPS analyses. Meteorological chromatography analysis showed that N₂ was produced as an end product. These results demonstrate that the bacterial strain CN86 is a suitable candidate for simultaneously removing Cd²⁺, NO₃-N, and hardness during in wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3acadmium 3acalcium carbonate 3achromatography 3acoprecipitation 3ahardness 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apH 3awastewater treatment1 aGao, Yi chou1 aHuang, Ting lin1 aBai, Xue chen1 aLu, Jin suo1 aHe, Lei0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2019 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.1333-1342dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-019-02132-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04708naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245018400177520259900361592002802960650001102988650002502999650001303024650001603037650000903053650000903062650001803071650002203089650001103111650001903122650001203141650001003153650002003163650002803183650001303211650001103224650001203235650001503247650001003262650001403272653000703286653000803293653000803301653000803309653000903317653000903326653000703335653000803342653000703350653000903357653000703366653000803373653000903381653000703390653000703397653000703404653000703411653000703418653000603425653000703431653000803438653000803446653000903454653000803463653000703471653002303478653001003501653001803511653001603529653001203545653001003557653001703567700006603584773011803650856008903768852000903857655001203866IND60733376920221118191632.0211001e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073337692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1149292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiland, Sarah Ann10aEffect of xylanase supplementation on nutrient and energy digestibility at three time periods in growing pigs fed diets based on corn or corn distillers dried grains with solubles  aA digestibility trial was conducted to better understand how xylanase impacts diet utilization in pigs by measuring its impact on the digestibility of energy, nitrogen, fat, fiber, and starch in the small and large intestine and across the total tract at three collection periods. Thirty-two 16-week-old gilts (DNA 600 [DNA Genetics, Columbus, NE, USA] × C22 [PIC Inc., Hendersonville, TN, USA]) were surgically fitted with T-cannulae at the terminal ileum, housed individually, and assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design, providing 24 observations per treatment Diets were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial:0 vs 165 mg xylanase/kg (27,225 birch xylan units (BXU)/kg) of finished feed to corn-soybean meal diets and 0 g/kg (lower fiber: LF) vs 300 g/kg (higher fiber: HF) corn distillers’ dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Prior to surgery, the body weight (BW) of the pigs averaged 37.3 ± 0.8 kg. Three collection periods consisting of a 2-day fecal collection followed by a 3-day ileal collection occurred at day 9–13, 19–23 and 39–43 when pigs averaged 46.0 ± 0.4, 54.1 ± 0.4, and 70.3 ± 0.5 kg, respectively. Ileal and fecal samples were analyzed to determine the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of gross energy (GE), dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber assayed with heat stable amylase (aNDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and nitrogen (N), and the AID of starch and amino acids (AA). Apparent fat digestibility values were corrected for endogenous losses and reported as true ileal digestibility (TID) and true total tract digestibility (TTTD). Xylanase inclusion tended to decrease AID of aNDF and decreased ADF in LF diets, but had no impact in HF diets, resulting in a fiber level (FL) × xylanase interaction (P ≤ 0.100). The AID of nitrogen increased with xylanase in LF diets, but decreased in HF diets, resulting in a FL × xylanase interaction (P = 0.025). Xylanase inclusion tended to increase the hindgut disappearance of aNDF and ADF (P ≤ 0.100). In LF diets, xylanase decreased ATTD of ADF, but increased ATTD of ADF in HF diets resulting in a FL × xylanase interaction (P = 0.010). Xylanase inclusion changed the pattern of hindgut disappearance and ATTD of nitrogen over the three collection periods, resulting in a xylanase × collection period interaction. Overall, xylanase supplementation slightly increased digestibility in pigs fed lower fiber diets, and had no impact on digestibility in higher fiber diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3aacid detergent fiber 3aamylases 3abody weight 3acorn 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3aenergy 3aheat stability 3ahindgut 3aileum 3alarge intestine 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3astarch 3asurgery 3atechnology 3axylan 3axylanases 0aAA 0aADF 0aADG 0aAID 0aaNDF 0aATTD 0aBW 0aBXU 0aCP 0aDDGS 0aDM 0aDMI 0aEDTA 0aFL 0aGE 0aHF 0aLF 0aME 0aN 0aNE 0aSID 0aTID 0aTTTD 0aXYL 0aNE 0aEnzyme acclimation 0aFiber 0aDigestibility 0aAmino acids 0aCannula 0aSwine 0aCarbohydrase1 aPatience, John Francis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1672-51160 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2021 June, v. 276 p.114929-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.1149293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245010200171300002000273520163600293592002801929650001101957650001401968650000901982650002401991650002502015650002502040650002302065650001102088650001302099650001402112650001502126650001002141650001102151651001802162700001802180700002602198700003002224700002302254700002302277700002202300700002702322773010102349856007902450852000902529655001202538IND60425779420221118033258.0151008e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6042577942DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.129992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorrico, Damir Dennis10aCross‐Cultural Consumer Acceptability and Purchase Intent of Forage‐Finished Rib‐Eye Steaks  ap. S2287-S2295.  aRib‐eye steaks, from 3 forage‐finished systems (S1, S2, and S3) and 1 commercial steak (C), either cooked by 1‐sided‐grilling or 2‐sided‐grilling, were evaluated for sensory acceptability [overall appearance (ORA) and overall appearance of fat (OAF) for raw steaks; overall appearance (OCA), overall beef aroma (OBA), overall beef flavor (OBF), juiciness, tenderness and overall liking (OL) for cooked steaks] and purchase intent by Hispanic, Asian and U.S. consumers. They also indicated preferred degree of doneness and cooking methods. Cross‐cultural differences in preferences and consumer acceptability of rib‐eye steaks were observed. Grilling was the most preferred cooking method. Hispanics and Asians preferred medium and/or medium well, while U.S. consumers preferred medium and/or medium rare. For cooked steaks, the population effect was significant for all sensory attributes; Asians generally scored lower than did Hispanics and U.S. consumers. C and S3 generally had higher scores for all sensory attributes across 3 populations. Purchase intent for all forage‐finished steaks was higher for Hispanics and U.S. consumers compared to Asians (50.0% to 77.8% compared with 43.2% to 65.9%). Attributes influencing purchase intent of forage‐finished steaks differed among populations: tenderness (odds ratio = 1.4) for Hispanics, OCA (odds ratio = 1.5) for Asians, and OBF (odds ratio = 1.3) for U.S. consumers. Overall, this study demonstrated that the type of forage‐finished system and ethnic differences influenced sensory acceptability and purchase intent of forage‐finished rib‐eye steaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsians 3aHispanics 3abeef 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer preferences 3acultural differences 3aethnic differences 3aflavor 3agrilling 3ajuiciness 3aodds ratio 3aodors 3asteaks 3aUnited States1 aWardy, Wisdom1 aPujols, Kairy Dharali1 aCarabante, Kennet Mariano1 aJirangrat, Wannita1 aScaglia, Guillermo1 aJanes, Marlene E.1 aPrinyawiwatkul, Witoon0 tJournal of food science.g2015 Oct., v. 80, no. 10 p.S2287-S2295dThe Institutex0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.129993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009500159500001900254500002000273520149700293592002801790596008101818596008101899596008101980596007402061596003602135650001802171650001502189650002102204650002602225650001602251650002402267650001002291650001402301650001902315650001902334650001202353650001102365700006302376700002202439700002102461773011002482856007402592852000902666655001202675IND60684326520221120071659.0200218e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068432652DNAL7 a10.1111/maec.125792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Ya‐Fan10aSpatial variation of abundant picoeukaryotes in the subtropical Kuroshio Current in winter  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo understand the importance of picoeukaryotes in the biogeochemical cycle in the subtropical Kuroshio Current, a year‐round survey of the hydrography and the distribution of picoeukaryotes were conducted in four oceanographic cruises from October 2012 to July 2013. In comparison with other seasons, the highest abundancy of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes, with concentrations >10⁴ cells/ml, was observed around the eastern boundary of the Kuroshio in the winter. Accordingly, the composition of picoeukaryotes in this cold season was further studied by a metabarcoding analysis of the 18S rRNA gene. The majority of picoeukaryotes comprised Alveolata, followed by Haptophyta and Stramenopiles. Their composition was diverse in the waters affected by the Kuroshio and in the offshore province. For Haptophyta, in contrast to clade A prevailing in the Kuroshio waters, clade B1, which was considered the host of uncultivated diazotrophic cyanobacterium group A (UCYN‐A), appeared only in the offshore area. Similarly, in Stramenopiles, Pseudo‐nitzschia spp. and MAST‐1D, respectively, dominated in the Kuroshio‐influenced and offshore areas. While Alveolata was the most abundant group, the distributions of all lineages were similar. The association between picoeukaryote succession and hydrographic change is yet to be fully understood. Our results will assist future studies on the community composition of picoplankton and their relationship with marine ecology in the region.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOST103‐2611‐M‐019‐011cMinistry of Science and Technology of Taiwan  aMOST104‐2611‐M‐019‐011cMinistry of Science and Technology of Taiwan  aMOST104‐2811‐M‐019‐006cMinistry of Science and Technology of Taiwan  cCenter of Excellence for the Oceans, National Taiwan Ocean University  cMinistry of Education of Taiwan 3aDNA barcoding 3aHaptophyta 3aPseudo-nitzschia 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acold season 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3ahydrology 3amarine science 3aphotosynthesis 3asurveys 3awinter1 aChung, Chih‐Ching1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7843-41541 aGong, Gwo‐Ching1 aHsu, Ching‐Wei0 tMarine ecology.g2020 Feb., v. 41, no. 1 p.e12579-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:1992x0173-95657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.125793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04076naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011700164300001800281520258700299592002802886650001402914650001802928650002102946650002702967650001902994650001603013650001103029650001403040650002203054650001503076650002003091650002003111650001903131650001403150650001303164650002203177650002403199650001403223650002703237650001303264650000903277650001103286650001103297700002003308700002103328773012603349856007403475852000903549655001203558IND60709146720221116233304.0200902e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070914672DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc01647k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeereboer, Kjeld W.10aReview of recent advances in the biodegradability of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) bioplastics and their composites  ap. 5519-5558.  aThe detrimental impact of single-use plastics on the environment is daily news across the globe. Single-use plastic packaging materials and other plastic waste originating from petroleum-based sources are continuously building up in landfills and leaching into the environment. Managing plastic waste remains an urgent crisis in the environment and switching to biodegradable plastics can help mitigate some of these issues. This review will summarize recent advances and opportunities to utilize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as a biodegradable substitute in some applications where non-biodegradable and petroleum-based plastics are currently used. PHAs are a well-known family of bacteria-based biodegradable plastics and offer an approach to carbon neutrality and support a more sustainable industry. PHAs such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) show biodegradable behaviour in all aerobic and anaerobic environments defined by ASTM standards, and can be used to make completely compostable, and soil and marine biodegradable products – a strong positive compared to the negativity associated with the landfilling of plastics. However, PHAs are relatively expensive compared to petroleum-based alternatives. To reduce the cost, PHAs can be used in biocomposite materials, where bio-based agro-residues are incorporated, while maintaining the performance in certain applications. Organic fillers and fibres composed of cellulosic material can improve the properties of polymers, however, their effect on the marine biodegradable properties of the composite matrix remains an unexplored area. When used in biocomposites with PHAs, they improve biodegradation rates in all environments. In addition to cellulose, other bio-based fillers such as proteins (i.e. distillers dried grains with solubles) and starch have been reported to significantly improve soil and marine biodegradability rates compared to other fibres and fillers. Other components that affect biodegradability are additives (i.e. chain extenders) and compatibilizers (i.e. maleic anhydride etc.) that are added to optimize the service life properties, but are reported to inhibit the biodegradation properties by impacting the hydrophilicity of the polymer and enzyme activity. The multitude of possible combinations of polymers and fillers and fibres, and their effect on the biodegradation of PHA-based biocomposites are a largely unexplored frontier. The potential benefits of PHA-based biocomposites make a strong case for further research into this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abiocomposites 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradable products 3abiodegradation 3abioplastics 3acarbon 3acellulose 3adistillers grains 3adurability 3aenzyme activity 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrophilicity 3alandfills 3aleaching 3amaleic anhydrides 3apackaging materials 3apetroleum 3apoly-3-hydroxybutyrate 3aproteins 3asoil 3astarch 3awastes1 aMisra, Manjusri1 aMohanty, Amar K.0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 Aug. 31, v. 22, no. 17 p.5519-5558dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc01647k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245014200154300001600296500001900312500002000331520134600351592002801697596002501725596005101750596005701801650001901858650002101877650003201898650001601930650001601946650001401962650001201976650001001988650001201998650002802010650002202038650001202060650002002072650001002092650004302102650001702145700001802162700001502180700002002195773012502215856007302340852000902413655001202422IND60700838820221117233027.0200704e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070083882DNAL7 a10.1111/imb.126462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHusain, M.10aMolecular characterization, expression pattern and RNAi‐mediated silencing of vitellogenin receptor gene in almond moth, Cadra cautella  ap. 417-430.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe almond moth is an important pest of date fruits worldwide. The females produce several eggs; however, role of vitellogenin receptor (VgR) in oocyte development by mediating endocytosis of major yolk protein precursor Vg remains yet unexplored. To investigate the role of vitellogenin receptor (VgR) in reproduction, Cadra cautella vitellogenin receptor (CcVgR) transcript was obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends‐polymerase chain reaction. Expression analysis of CcVgR was performed using reverse transcriptase and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in different developmental stages. RNA interference was performed by injecting CcVgR‐based double‐stranded (ds)RNA at different exposure times. The results revealed that CcVgR is 5421 bp long, encoded 1807 amino acid, belongs to low‐density lipoprotein receptor superfamily and contains all conserved domains. Expression analysis confirmed that CcVgR is sex‐specific and starts to express in female larvae on day 19. Additionally, RNA interference (RNAi) of CcVgR‐based dsRNA inhibited CcVgR expression up to 83% after 72 h, reduced fecundity and hatchability, and confirmed involvement of CcVgR in C. cautella reproduction. This report provides a basis for gene silencing in this species, and proposes RNAi technology potential for pest management.  aPublisher supplied data  cKing Saud University  cKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology  cNational Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation 3aCadra cautella 3aRNA interference 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aamino acids 3aendocytosis 3afecundity 3afemales 3agenes 3ainsects 3alow density lipoprotein 3amolecular biology 3aoocytes 3apest management 3apests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3avitellogenin1 aRasool, K.

Using different Rhizopus sp. strains as fermentation agents, this paper describes a global strategy to identify interactions between cultivation parameters (pH 4.75–7.75, 7.5–82.5 g/l glucose, 0.75–3.75 g/l nitrogen, incubation time up to 5 days) for valorization of food industry by-products. Selected parameters and/or their interactions are critical for most of the proposed resulting values, giving the opportunity to optimize the process depending on the objective and making an “in silico” pre-evaluation of the process conditions. SmF of orange molasses leads to a high biomass and protein yield (11.9 g biomass/l and 4.0 g protein/l), with 43.1 ± 0.1% of essential amino acids and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction of almost 50%. Experiments with cheese whey result in 76.3 ± 1.1% of glucose consumption and a biomass production of 5.6 ± 2.2 g/l with 48.9 ± 5.1% of essential amino acids. SmF of orange molasses and cheese whey could contribute to promoting a sustainable feed industry while reducing by-product treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizopus 3abiomass production 3acheese whey 3achemical oxygen demand 3aessential amino acids 3afeed industry 3afood industry 3afungal biomass 3afungi 3aglucose 3aindustrial byproducts 3amolasses 3anitrogen 3asubmerged fermentation 3awaste treatment1 aHernández, Igor0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2019 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.1285-1300dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-019-02127-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006600167300001600233520121300249592002801462650002101490650001201511650002501523650001101548650002501559650001101584650002301595650002501618700002001643700001301663700001801676700001901694773009801713856008101811990002301892852000901915655001201924IND60093236620221118032030.0141103e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009323662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2013.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiao-Hong10aOxygen profiles in biofilms undergoing endogenous respiration  ap. 452-458.  aKnowledge of oxygen consumption related to oxygen distribution in biofilms is crucial to understand what is really happening in the biofilm endogenous metabolism. In this article, mature biofilms were taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant for lab-scale experiments. A pH7 buffer solution was used as influent instead of wastewater, indicating the absence of an external input of substrate. Oxygen distribution was measured in the next approximately 130h at different locations in the biofilm. Two distinct trends in oxygen profiles in the biofilm were observed during endogenous respiration. In the first period under starved condition, oxygen penetrated more and more deeply in the biofilm with time, which is related to the smaller endogenous oxygen uptake rate. This phenomenon agrees with the traditional endogenous respiration theory developed in activated sludge systems. However, opposite trends were observed as the time passed by, where oxygen penetration became shallower again. A diffusion–reaction model concerning the generation and utilization of electron-donor substrate during endogenous respiration was proposed and agreed well with the changes in the measured oxygen profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiofilm 3achemical engineering 3amodels 3amunicipal wastewater 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3awastewater treatment1 aZhang, Ming-Kai1 aYu, Tong1 aLiu, Yan-chen1 aShi, Han-Chang0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 220 p.452-458dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245014200177520134900319592002801668650001901696650001601715650001501731650001101746650003101757650000901788650001301797650002401810651001301834651001001847700002001857700002001877700002401897700002401921700002001945700002601965700003601991700002002027700002502047773012502072856008302197852000902280655001202289IND60781098520221118033852.0220623e20220417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078109852DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems60200382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodwin, Douglas Jeffrey10aCan Low-Cost, Handheld Spectroscopy Tools Coupled with Remote Sensing Accurately Estimate Soil Organic Carbon in Semi-Arid Grazing Lands?  aSoil organic carbon influences several landscape ecological processes, and soils are becoming recognized as a mechanism to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. There is a need to define methods and technologies for addressing soils’ spatial variability as well as the time and cost of sampling soil organic carbon (SOC). Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy have been suggested as a sampling tool to reduce inventory cost. We sampled nineteen ranch properties totaling 17,347 ha across Oklahoma and Texas in 2019 to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of a handheld reflectometer (Our Sci, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (370–940 nm) and existing remote sensing approaches to estimate SOC in semi-arid grazing lands. Our data suggest that the Our Sci Reflectometer estimated soil organic carbon with a precision of approximately (±0.3% SOC); however, it was least accurate at higher carbon concentrations. The Our Sci reflectometer, although consistently accurate at lower SOC concentrations, was still less accurate than a model built using only remote sensing and digital soil map data as predictors. Combining the two data sources was the most accurate means of determining SOC. Our results indicated that the Our Sci handheld Vis-NIR reflectometer tested may have only limited applications for reducing inventory costs at scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3ainventories 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3asoil 3asoil map 3asoil organic carbon 3aOklahoma 3aTexas1 aKane, Daniel A.1 aDhakal, Kundan 1 aCovey, Kristofer R.1 aBettigole, Charles 1 aHanle, Juliana 1 aOrtega-S., J.

In Brazil, almost 20 years after the first introduction in the 1990s, a new lineage (Lineage II) of the DENV-2 Asian/American genotype emerged and caused an epidemic with severe cases and hospitalizations. Severe dengue includes multiple organ failure, and renal involvement can be potentially related to increased mortality. In order to better understand the role of DENV infection in renal injury, here we aimed to investigate the outcomes of infection with two distinct lineages of DENV-2 Asian/American genotype in the kidney of a murine model. BALB/c mice were infected with Lineages I and II and tissues were submitted to histopathology, immunohistochemistry, histomorphometry and ultrastructural analysis. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was detected in blood sample accessed by cardiac puncture. A tendency in kidney weight increase was observed in mice infected with both lineages, but urea levels, on average, were increased only in mice infected with Lineage II. The DENV antigen was detected in the tissue of mice infected with Lineage II and morphological changes were similar to those observed in human dengue cases. Furthermore, the parameters such as organ weight, urea levels and morphometric analysis, showed significant differences between the two lineages in the infected BALB/c, which was demonstrated to be a suitable experimental model for dengue pathophysiology studies in kidneys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3adengue 3agenotype 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3amorphometry 3amortality 3apathophysiology 3aserotypes 3atissue weight 3aurea 3aurea nitrogen 3aBrazil1 aCaldas, Gabriela Cardoso1 aRasinhas, Arthur da Costa1 ade Almeida, Ana Luisa Teixeira1 ade Souza, Daniel Dias Coutinho1 aPaulino, Amanda Carlos1 ada Silva, Marcos Alexandre Nunes1 aBarth, Ortrud Monika1 ados Santos, Flávia Barreto1 aBarreto-Vieira, Débora Ferreira,0 tPathogens.g2021 Aug. 26, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100910843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245011400196300001600310500001900326500002000345520167300365592002802038596007502066650001802141650001902159650001602178650001402194650001002208650001902218650001902237650000902256650002602265650001302291650001402304650001202318650002202330650002002352650003002372650001902402650001702421700005802438773012502496856007302621852000902694655001202703IND60700839020221117232745.0200704e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070083902DNAL7 a10.1111/imb.126452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, S.‐C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3315-912514aThe unfolded protein response modulates the autophagy‐mediated egg production in the mosquito Aedes aegypti  ap. 404-416.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMosquitoes must feed on vertebrate blood for egg development. As a consequence, some mosquito species are vectors for pathogens that cause devastating diseases in humans. Hence, understanding the mechanisms that control egg developmental cycles is important for developing novel approaches for the control of mosquito‐borne diseases. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The UPR is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER. Massive proteins have been shown to be produced during egg development, and it is obvious that unfolded or misfolded proteins may arise during vitellogenesis. It has been shown that autophagy in the mosquito fat body plays a central role in the progression of gonadotrophic cycles in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of UPR and the correlation between UPR and autophagy remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is activated during vitellogenesis and that the activation of autophagy is correlated with the UPR. We also show that the expressions of UPR and autophagy can be induced in an in vitro fat body culture system through an amino acid treatment. In addition, the expressions of UPR, autophagy‐specific markers and vitellogenin were also induced during dithiothreitol treatment. Interestingly, the silencing of UPR‐related genes significantly reduced the expression of autophagy‐specific markers and inhibited mosquito fecundity. Taken together, we conclude that autophagy‐mediated egg production in the mosquito A. aegypti is regulated by UPR.  aPublisher supplied data  a108‐2321‐B‐400‐006cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan 3aAedes aegypti 3aacid treatment 3aamino acids 3aautophagy 3ablood 3adithiothreitol 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afat body 3afecundity 3ainsects 3amolecular biology 3astress response 3aunfolded protein response 3avitellogenesis 3avitellogenin1 aShiao, S.‐H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7749-78070 tInsect molecular biology.g2020 Aug., v. 29, no. 4 p.404-416dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl52413x0962-10757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/imb.126453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012300164300001600287520168900303592002801992650002402020650001902044650000802063650002502071650000902096650001302105650002002118650002002138650002002158650001502178650002602193650001102219650002702230653001402257653003202271653002302303653002202326653001402348700002602362700002202388700002302410773021202433856008202645852000902727655001202736IND60645051920221120114754.0200117e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064505192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrs.2019.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYones, M.S.10aHyperspectral application for early diagnosis of American foulbrood disease in the honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae  ap. 271-277.  aNon-destructive methods are of utmost importance for early diagnosis of American foulbrood (AFB) disease in honeybees’ larvae. This study discusses the potential application of spectroradiometric techniques for spectral discrimination of AFB disease in honeybees. AFB is a honeybees’ brood fully destructive bacterial disease caused by the spore forming bacterium; Paenibacillus larvae (P. larvae). It is important to detect the disease early as routine apiary administration and interchange of coloney components could spread it easily to healthy ones. Hyperspectral measurements of honeybee larval samples from 11 colonies were taken in range (350–2500 nm). The two spectral bands, Red and the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR2), were of the promising results for differentiation between healthy and the different degree of honeybees’ larval infection. Correlation coefficient between Red and SWIR2 spectral reflectance data indicates that SWIR2 is the best spectral band to be used for discriminating between healthy and infected honeybee larvae. Confirmation of AFB was carried out by both cultivating smears of suspected larvae on agar plates and KAT-PCR technique for bacterial DNA confirmation. Both cultivation and PCR results agreed with hyperspectral results indicating that 6 colonies were of high loads of P. larvae, 2 of moderate bacterial loads and 1 was weak. Only 2 colonies appeared free from bacteria. Data analysed, discriminatory signatures the diseased samples in their various pathological stages. this research is an attempt to determine the feasibility of early diagnosis of AFB disease in honeybee brood through the application of hyperspectral technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmerican foul brood 3aApis mellifera 3aDNA 3aPaenibacillus larvae 3aagar 3aapiaries 3adisease control 3aearly diagnosis 3ahoney bee brood 3ahoney bees 3ahyperspectral imagery 3alarvae 3anondestructive methods 0aHoneybees 0aPaenibacillus larvae larvae 0aAmerican foulbrood 0aSpectroradiometer 0aDiagnosis1 aMa'moun, Shireen A.M.1 aFarag, Rasha M.A.1 aEl-Raouf, M.M.

The results showed that the rate of Hg⁰ oxidation over SCR catalyst was zeroth order with respect to O₂ and nearly first order with respect to Hg⁰. Mercury oxidation followed the Eley–Rideal mechanism involving chlorine compounds as the intermediates that subsequently oxidize mercury. Formation of oxidized mercury (Hg²⁺) from Hg⁰ was likely the rate limiting step. The method for predicting mercury oxidation efficiency in a kinetic framework was also proposed, which used the reaction rate of mercury oxidation per catalyst mass to calculate oxidation efficiency. In agreement with the experimental results, the kinetic model well described the rate of Hg⁰ oxidation in the presence of HCl and O₂ at different conditions. The apparent activation energy for Hg⁰ oxidation over the SCR catalyst was 37.73kJ/mol according to the kinetic model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3achemical engineering 3achlorine 3ahydrochloric acid 3amercury 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aLiu, Qingcai1 aWu, Chang-Yu1 aLi, Hailong1 aLi, Ying1 aYang, Jian1 aWu, Guofang0 tChemical engineering journal.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 220 p.53-60dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2013.01.0623Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100005600189245008900245300001800334506007600352520102800428592002801456596005201484596006101536506003701597650002401634650002601658650001001684650001201694650001201706650001801718650001001736650001801746650001301764650001501777650001101792650001701803650001901820650002101839650001801860700001401878773014501892856008302037852000902120655001202129IND60654012020221207142046.0210731e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065401202DNAL7 a310251752pmid7 aPMC66473732pmcid7 a10.1007/s00449-019-02130-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHultberg, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7634-610210aFungi-based treatment of real brewery waste streams and its effects on water quality  ap. 1317-1324.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNutrient-rich liquid waste streams generated during the beer brewing were treated by submerged fungal growth.

Since the 1970s food scientists have devoted attention to the nature of these interactions and particularly to their effects on functional characteristics of protein-based foods. Previously, most of the published work was devoted to the biochemical aspects of protein-lipid interactions in biological systems. This article reviews the protein-lipid interactions of both naturally occurring protein-lipid complexes and protein-lipid complexes formed by induced interactions in foods and food products. The physicochemical characteristics of known protein-lipid complexes, the nature of binding which results in formation of these complexes and the effect of the interactions on food functionality are reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3afoods 3achemical reactions 3alipids 3achemical structure 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFood Handling 2aFood Technology 2aHumans 2aModels, Chemical 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism1 aAlli, Inteaz0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2002 Jan. 1, v. 53, no. 3 p.249-260dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096374802201328503Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02662naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009700177300001600274520139600290592002801686650001301714650003601727650001701763650001701780650001901797650002601816650002001842650001401862650002501876650002001901650001401921650001301935650001101948650001201959650001201971651001801983700001602001700001402017773010302031856008502134852000902219655001202228IND60559154520221118225717.0161127e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055915452DNAL7 a10.1080/03632415.2016.12199482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrimpong, Emmanuel A.10aIchthyMaps: A Database of Historical Distributions of Freshwater Fishes of the United States  ap. 590-599.  aFish occurrence data to support high-resolution distribution models and test various community and macroecological hypotheses have not been available at the national scale. We present IchthyMaps , a high-resolution database of historical freshwater fish occurrences throughout the conterminous United States. Designed on the principles of metacommunity ecology, IchthyMaps is a large compilation of fish presence records collected through approximately 1990, digitized from regional atlases, appended to 1:100,000 National Hydrography Dataset plus version 2 (NHDPlusV2) interconfluence stream segments, and readily aggregated within hierarchically coarser units (e.g., 8-digit and 12-digit U. S. Geological Survey [USGS] hydrologic units). IchthyMaps contains 606,550 presence records for 1,038 species and subspecies, spatially joined to 224,305 NHDPlusV2 interconfluence stream segments, representing more than 10% average sampling intensity considering all the NHDPlusV2 segments as the sampling frame. IchthyMaps is freely and publicly accessible through the USGS ScienceBase web portal. It offers new opportunities for both basic and applied research and conservation programs in areas such as modeling species distributions, community ecology, gap analysis, and assessments of impacts of land use, species invasions, climate change, conservation biogeography, and fisheries management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aconservation programs 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afisheries management 3afreshwater fish 3ahydrology 3aland use 3amodels 3astreams 3asurveys 3aUnited States1 aHuang, Jian1 aLiang, Yu0 tFisheries.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 41, no. 10 p.590-599dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19310x1548-84467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03632415.2016.12199483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005800160300001600218500001900234500002000253520139900273592002801672650003001700650001801730650002101748650002001769650004901789650002101838650001001859650001201869650001901881650002201900650002001922650001501942650001101957650001301968650001901981650001402000650001502014700002202029700002002051700002002071700002302091700005802114773011502172856007402287852000902361655001202370IND60684327020221120051231.0200218e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068432702DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.150252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Lis, Robert10aHybrid cluster proteins in a photosynthetic microalga  ap. 721-735.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHybrid cluster proteins (HCPs) are metalloproteins characterized by the presence of an iron‐sulfur‐oxygen cluster. These proteins occur in all three domains of life. In eukaryotes, HCPs have so far been found only in a few anaerobic parasites and photosynthetic microalgae. With respect to all species harboring an HCP, the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii stands out by the presence of four HCP genes. The study of the gene and protein structures as well as the phylogenetic analyses strongly support a model in which the HCP family in the alga has emerged from a single gene of alpha proteobacterial origin and then expanded by several rounds of duplications. The spectra and redox properties of HCP1 and HCP3, produced heterologously in Escherichia coli, were analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy on redox‐titrated samples. Both proteins contain a [4Fe‐4S]‐cluster as well as a [4Fe‐2O‐2S]‐hybrid cluster with paramagnetic properties related to those of HCPs from Desulfovibrio species. Immunoblotting experiments combined with mass spectrometry‐based proteomics showed that both nitrate and darkness contribute to the strong upregulation of the HCP levels in C. reinhardtii growing under oxic conditions. The link to the nitrate metabolism is discussed in the light of recent data on the potential role of HCP in S‐nitrosylation in bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aDesulfovibrio 3aEscherichia coli 3aS-nitrosylation 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ahybrids 3aimmunoblotting 3amass spectrometry 3ametalloproteins 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3anitrates 3aphotosynthesis 3aphylogeny 3aproteomics1 aBrugière, Sabine1 aBaffert, Carole1 aCouté, Yohann,1 aNitschke, Wolfgang1 aAtteia, Ariane1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5302-95500 tFEBS journal.g2020 Feb., v. 287, no. 4 p.721-735dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.150253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014000169520156500309592002801874650003201902650002601934650001601960650001001976650001501986650001502001650002902016650001302045650001402058650002602072650001602098650001702114700002202131700002002153700001902173773012302192856008102315852000902396655001202405IND60751679420221121024741.0210925e20210824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075167942DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100910702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Supang A.10aCoevolved Multidrug-Resistant HIV-1 Protease and Reverse Transcriptase Influences Integrase Drug Susceptibility and Replication Fitness  aIntegrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs) are recommended agents in first-line combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We examined the evolution of drug resistance mutations throughout HIV-1 pol and the effects on InSTI susceptibility and viral fitness. We performed single-genome sequencing of full-length HIV-1 pol in a highly treatment-experienced patient, and determined drug susceptibility of patient-derived HIV-1 genomes using a phenotypic assay encompassing full-length pol gene. We show the genetic linkage of multiple InSTI-resistant haplotypes containing major resistance mutations at Y143, Q148 and N155 to protease inhibitor (PI) and reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) resistance mutations. Phenotypic analysis of viruses expressing patient-derived IN genes with eight different InSTI-resistant haplotypes alone or in combination with coevolved protease (PR) and RT genes exhibited similar levels of InSTI susceptibility, except for three haplotypes that showed up to 3-fold increases in InSTI susceptibility (p ≤ 0.032). The replicative fitness of most viruses expressing patient-derived IN only significantly decreased, ranging from 8% to 56% (p ≤ 0.01). Interestingly, the addition of coevolved PR + RT significantly increased the replicative fitness of some haplotypes by up to 73% (p ≤ 0.024). Coevolved PR + RT contributes to the susceptibility and viral fitness of patient-derived IN viruses. Maintaining patients on failing cART promotes the selection of fitter resistant strains, and thereby limits future therapy options.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aantiretroviral agents 3acoevolution 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3aintegrases 3amultiple drug resistance 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteinases 3atherapeutics1 aCane, Patricia A.1 aPillay, Deenan 1 aMbisa, Jean L.0 tPathogens.g2021 Aug. 24, v. 10, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100910703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009600170300001600266520106800282592002801350650002301378650002601401650000901427650001801436650001101454650001001465650001901475650001101494651001401505651001601519651002201535651000901557651001501566651001401581773010301595856008501698852000901783655001201792IND60559154620221118225914.0161127e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055915462DNAL7 a10.1080/03632415.2016.12199492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda, L.

A prominent occupant of the valley was the Ohio River, estimated to have flowed 25,000 years ago over western Tennessee and Mississippi to join the Mississippi River north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 750–800 km south of the present confluence. Over time, shifts in the Mississippi and Ohio rivers toward their contemporary positions have left a legacy of abandoned paleochannels supportive of unique fish assemblages. Relative to channels abandoned in the last 500 years, paleochannels exhibit harsher environmental conditions characteristic of hypereutrophic lakes and support tolerant fish assemblages. Considering their ecological, geological, and historical importance, coupled with their primordial scenery, the hundreds of paleochannels in the valley represent a national treasure. Altogether, these waterscapes are endangered by human activities and would benefit from the conservation attention afforded to our national parks and wildlife refuges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3ageomorphology 3ahumans 3alakes 3anational parks 3arivers 3aLouisiana 3aMississippi 3aMississippi River 3aOhio 3aOhio River 3aTennessee0 tFisheries.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 41, no. 10 p.578-588dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19310x1548-84467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03632415.2016.12199493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012900165520159300294592002801887650002401915650001401939650001201953650002401965650002301989650001302012650002102025650002002046650002802066650002002094650002602114650001402140650001102154650001702165650002202182650001102204650000902215650001902224650002002243650001602263650001602279650001602295651001002311653002502321653001802346653002802364653001002392653001102402700001702413700001802430700001702448700001902465700001502484700002302499700002102522700002802543773011402571856008202685852000902767655001202776IND60645052320221122085906.0190719e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064505232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2019.1259182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhixin10aAbove- and belowground dry matter partitioning of four warm-season annual crops sown on different dates in a semiarid region  aBiomass production and partitioning are important for crop production and is influenced by environmental conditions. Sowing date can profoundly influence biomass production and portioning in crop plants depending upon the local climatic conditions. However, the accumulation of biomass in different plant components in annual forages in response to changes in sowing date has not been quantified, especially for semiarid farming systems. A field experiment was conducted during 2011–2013 to investigate how sowing date (early, mid, late) influences biomass partitioning and the interrelationships with environments in four warm-season annual crops in the Loess Plateau of China. The aboveground biomass of all four crops was more reliant on rainfall and solar radiation at flowering and temperature and rainfall at maturity. Solar radiation, rainfall, and temperature had a combined effect on belowground biomass (0–0.3 m), depending on the forage crop. Reductions in biomass in the late-sown treatment were mostly attributed to plant size; the ‘allometry’ among plant components did not change. The changes of shoot: root and leaf: stem ratios were related to the relationship between biomass accumulation and rainfall, temperature and intercepted radiation. It is evident that dry matter allocation patterns in crops must be analyzed using a dynamic approach (allometry) and relate with environmental conditions, rather than a static approach using ratios. The results from this study provide references for crop management in forage production and breeding in semiarid areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3aannuals 3abelowground biomass 3abiomass production 3abreeding 3aclimatic factors 3acrop management 3adry matter partitioning 3afarming systems 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3aforage 3aforage crops 3aforage production 3aleaves 3arain 3asemiarid zones 3asolar radiation 3asowing date 3atemperature 3awarm season 3aChina 0aBiomass distribution 0aPlanting date 0aSemiarid farming system 0aMaize 0aMillet1 aYu, Kailiang1 aJin, Xiuliang1 aNan, Zhibiao1 aWang, Jianfeng1 aNiu, Xueli1 aWhish, Jeremy P.M.1 aBell, Lindsay W.1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.M.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2019 Sept., v. 109 p.125918-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2019.1259183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012200162300001800284520110400302592002801406650001201434650001301446650001401459650001401473650001301487650001301500650001301513700001701526773014501543856008301688852000901771655001201780IND60654012420221118123655.0210731e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065401242DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-019-02134-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Yuxia10aSelenium reduction by a defined co-culture of Shigella fergusonii strain TB42616 and Pantoea vagans strain EWB32213-2  ap. 1343-1351.  aSelenium reduction was evaluated with pure batch cultures of Shigella fergusonii strain TB42616 (TB) and Pantoea vagans strain EWB32213-2 (EWB), respectively. A two-stage process, from Se(VI) to Se(IV) and then from Se(IV) to Se(0), was observed. The second stage of reduction, from Se(IV) to Se(0), was observed as the rate-limiting step resulting in accumulation of the more toxic Se(IV). In order to facilitate Se(VI) reduction and reduce Se(IV) accumulation, the Se(VI)-reducing strain TB was co-cultured with a Se(IV)-reducing strain EWB. Although Se(VI) reduction rate was not affected, Se(IV) reduction was significantly enhanced with low Se(IV) accumulation in the defined co-culture. Effects of culture composition as well as nitrate and arsenate on Se(VI) reduction were also investigated. A co-culture composition of 10:1 (EWB:TB) ratio was observed to achieve the best total selenium reduction. In addition, nitrate at 50 mg/L was observed to inhibit Se(IV) reduction but not Se(VI) reduction, while arsenate at 200 mg/L exhibited slight inhibition on both Se(VI) and Se(IV) reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPantoea 3aShigella 3aarsenates 3acoculture 3anitrates 3aselenium 3atoxicity1 aWang, Yi-tin0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2019 Aug., v. 42, no. 8 p.1343-1351dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-019-02134-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008400164300001600248520178300264592002802047650001602075650001002091650001402101650001702115650000902132650001002141650001402151650001102165650002702176650002402203650001502227650001402242650001902256650001302275653001302288653002602301653001602327653001202343653001902355700001202374700001802386700001402404700001502418700001902433700001602452700001402468773012102482856008202603852000902685655001202694IND60528613520221121024015.0160716e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052861352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Cheng10aEffects of vimentin disruption on the mechanoresponses of articular chondrocyte  ap. 132-137.  aHuman articular cartilage is subjected to repetitive mechanical loading during life time. As the only cellular component of articular cartilage, chondrocytes play a key role in the mechanotransduction within this tissue. The mechanoresponses of chondrocytes are largely determined by the cytoskeleton. Vimentin intermediate filaments, one of the major cytoskeletal components, have been shown to regulate chondrocyte phenotype. However, the contribution of vimentin in chondrocyte mechanoresponses remains less studied. In this study, we seeded goat articular chondrocytes on a soft polyacrylamide gel, and disrupted the vimentin cytoskeleton using acrylamide. Then we applied a transient stretch or compression to the cells, and measured the changes of cellular stiffness and traction forces using Optical Magnetic Twisting Cytometry and Traction Force Microscopy, respectively. In addition, to study the effects of vimentin disruption on the intracellular force generation, we treated the cells with a variety of reagents that are known to increase or decrease cytoskeletal tension. We found that, after a compression, the contractile moment and cellular stiffness were not affected in untreated chondrocytes, but were decreased in vimentin-disrupted chondrocytes; after a stretch, vimentin-disrupted chondrocytes showed a lower level of fluidization-resolidification response compared to untreated cells. Moreover, vimentin-disrupted chondrocytes didn't show much difference to control cells in responding to reagents that target actin and ROCK pathway, but showed a weaker response to histamine and isoproterenol. These findings confirmed chondrocyte vimentin as a major contributor in withstanding compressive loading, and its minor role in regulating cytoskeletal tension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aactin 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3agels 3agoats 3ahistamine 3ahumans 3aintermediate filaments 3amechanotransduction 3amicroscopy 3aphenotype 3apolyacrylamide 3avimentin 0aVimentin 0aArticular chondrocyte 0aCompression 0aStretch 0aCell mechanics1 aYin, Li1 aSong, Xiongbo1 aYang, Hao1 aRen, Xiang1 aGong, Xiaoyuan1 aWang, Fuyou1 aYang, Liu0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Jan. 01, v. 469 p.132-137dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.11.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015700158300001800315520090700333592002801240650002601268650001701294650002101311700001301332700001601345700001501361700001301376700001701389700001101406700001601417700001301433773012201446856007401568852000901642655001201651IND60618131520221121025805.0181029e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061813152DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07742d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Baixiang12aA novel fluorescent functional monomer as the recognition element in core–shell imprinted sensors responding to concentration of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol  ap. 6083-6089.  aWe have demonstrated a fluorescent functional monomer instead of the traditional functional monomers for molecularly imprinted sensors. The sensors were firstly used to selectively detect 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) by solid fluorescence detection without a dispersion solution. Moreover, the selectivity and anti-interference ability of the SiO₂@dye-FMIPs sensor meet the requirements of a fluorescent sensor. The novel fluorescent monomer introduced into MIP is no longer just a fluorophore without recognizing ability. The fluorescence intensity of SiO₂@dye-FMIPs showed a linear response to 2,4,6-TCP concentration in the range of 0–100 nM with a detection limit of 0.0534 nM. We could also demonstrate that such a system can not only get rid of the confines of traditional functional monomers and detection manner, but also improved the applications of MIPs sensors in sensing systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4,6-trichlorophenol 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes1 aQi, Huan1 aLi, Xiuying1 aLiu, Lihui1 aGao, Lin1 aChe, Guangbo1 aHu, Bo1 aWang, Liang1 aLin, Xue0 tRSC advances.g2018 Feb. 06, v. 8, no. 11 p.6083-6089dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07742d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012200172300001600294520148200310592002801792650002201820650000901842650001201851650001501863650001301878650002301891650002201914650001401936650001601950650002401966650001501990651002202005700002302027700001902050700002102069773010302090856008502193852000902278655001202287IND60559154720221118225858.0161127e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055915472DNAL7 a10.1080/03632415.2016.12217012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHupfeld, Ryan N.10aMississippi River Basin Paddlefish Population Dynamics: Implications for the Management of a Highly Migratory Species  ap. 600-610.  aManagement of migratory fishes is a difficult task for fishery managers because fish cross jurisdictional boundaries and encounter differing regulations. States within the Mississippi River basin have differing commercial and recreational regulations for riverine Paddlefish Polyodon spathula populations, and the current population dynamics have not been evaluated on a system-wide basis. The objective of this study was to simulate the current reproductive potential of the population using various harvest scenarios. At the current exploitation rate of all locations pooled (u = 14.8%), the population may experience recruitment overfishing at a 610 mm minimum length limit and has the potential to experience recruitment overfishing at a 710 mm length limit (u = ∼20%). Any added stressors (e.g., Asian carp) may cause further mortality; thus, adopting a precautionary approach is necessary to maintain sustainable Paddlefish fisheries. At an 810 mm length limit, the population would not realistically experience recruitment overfishing. Implementing a basin-wide minimum length limit of at least 810 mm on riverine Paddlefish fisheries is suggested. Given the migratory nature of Paddlefish, developing a form of governance to ensure management strategies are complementary, and a sustainable source of funding is available is imperative to ensure sustainability. To accomplish this, developing a Mississippi River Basin Interstate Fishery Commission may be beneficial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolyodon spathula 3acarp 3afunding 3agovernance 3amanagers 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3amortality 3aoverfishing 3apopulation dynamics 3awatersheds 3aMississippi River1 aPhelps, Quinton E.1 aTripp, Sara J.1 aHerzog, David P.0 tFisheries.g2016 Oct. 2, v. 41, no. 10 p.600-610dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19310x1548-84467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03632415.2016.12217013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245017000205500001400375500002000389520138400409592002801793650001601821650001401837650001001851650001501861650001501876650000901891650001801900650001701918650001801935650001101953650001001964650001301974700001901987773012302006856007302129852000902202655001202211IND60700839520221117232719.0200704e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070083952DNAL7 a10.1111/ivb.122932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, Samantha Jia Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7694-257X10aMating behavior, spawning, parental care, and embryonic development of some marine pseudocerotid flatworms (Platyhelminthes: Rhabditophora: Polycladida) in Singapore  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe reproductive biology of tropical marine cotylean polyclads is presently poorly known. Reproductive aspects of 16 polyclad species from the family Pseudocerotidae in the genera Acanthozoon, Nymphozoon, Phrikoceros, Pseudobiceros, Pseudoceros, Thysanozoon, and Tytthosoceros from Singapore were documented for the first time. Penis fencing was observed to be just a mating ritual and not necessary for insemination, not always aggressive, and could also result in eventual reciprocal insemination. Results showed that all species underwent similar embryonic developmental stages and hatched as Müller's larvae. Only Pseudoceros concinnus and Pseudoceros laingensis, with mean developmental times of >20 days and mean brood sizes of <1,000 eggs, displayed long‐term parental care. Polyclads producing larger brood sizes had shorter developmental times and only covered their egg masses for about one day. Phrikoceros baibaiye and Pseudobiceros spp. produced egg capsules with pointed opercula, whereas all other species possessed smooth, rounded opercula. All genera hatched with brownish‐orange larvae, except for Pseudoceros spp., which hatched with reddish‐purple larvae regardless of the initial embryo color (either grayish‐yellow or reddish‐purple). These could potentially complement current taxonomic characters in distinguishing polyclad genera and species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolycladida 3aSingapore 3acolor 3acomplement 3aegg masses 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3ainsemination 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3apenis 3aspawning1 aOng, Rene S.L.0 tInvertebrate biology.g2020 June, v. 139, no. 2 p.e12293-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867081x1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.122933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012800166300001600294520169400310592002802004650001302032650001102045650002002056650001602076650001202092650001102104650002002115650001802135650002002153650001002173650001202183700001302195700001602208700001302224700001702237700001802254700001602272773009702288856008102385852000902466655001202475IND60575586520221120024625.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057558652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10905-017-9602-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Huaijian10aEffects of Light Intensity on the Flight Behaviour of Adult Tirumala limniace (Cramer) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Danainae)  ap. 139-154.  aLight intensity significantly affects insect flight behaviour. Mating of butterflies is significantly associated with flight frequency. However, no research has elucidated the effects of light intensity on butterfly flight. Thus, a clear understanding of the effects of light intensity on flight has significant theoretical implications for the cultivation and utilization of butterflies. We observed the flight behaviour of adult Tirumala limniace (Cramer) exposed to light intensities from 243 to 2240 lx and measured the frequency of flight, take-off rhythm, thoracic temperature excess (△T) when perching and flying, and the tendency for thoracic temperature to increase. Results showed that high-intensity light significantly increased flight activity, and males were more active than females under similar light intensities; strong light (1280–2240 lx) resulted in female and male butterflies taking flight earlier compared with weak light (243–864 lx); and a similar pattern was observed for flight duration, with flights by males being significantly longer than those by females at 864–2240 lx; △T of adults flying in strong light was significantly higher than in weak light, whereas the thoracic temperature of perching adults was similar to the air temperature. Compared with other light intensities, the equilibrium thoracic temperature of adults exposed to 2240 lx was higher, and the time to reach it was shorter; in addition, the △T and rate of thoracic temperature increase were higher and achieved more quickly, respectively. Thus, of the 243–2240 lx range, 2240 lx was the most optimal light intensity for adult T. limniace flight and captive rearing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanainae 3aadults 3aair temperature 3abutterflies 3afemales 3aflight 3ainsect behavior 3ainsect flight 3alight intensity 3amales 3arearing1 aShi, Lei1 aLiu, Weifen1 aDu, Ting1 aMa, Yunqiang1 aZhou, Chengli1 aDeng, Jiang0 tJournal of insect behavior.g2017 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.139-154dSpringer USx0892-75537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-017-9602-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010500180300001600285520117100301592002801472650002401500650001901524650001301543650001201556650000901568651001601577653001201593653001201605653001201617700002101629700002301650773012401673856008601797852000901883655001201892IND60791164020221119041905.0220826e20220703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079116402DNAL7 a10.1080/03014223.2021.19674152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Heerbeek, Ruth J.

The current study was the first to examine the effect of visitor interactions on the reptile species, tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus). This pilot project also developed the first complete ethogram describing tuatara behaviour (a permanent research resource). The ethogram was customised for individually housed tuatara. We used the ethogram to describe behaviour of three tuatara before (8:30–10:30), during (10:30–11:30) and after (11:30–15:30) visitor contact sessions (where visitors could interact with a tuatara and handler in a controlled environment), and on control days (at the same times but with no visitor contact). Tuatara demonstrated increased time out of sight or time inactive following visitor contact (compared to days with no visitor contact). The current study provides insight into individual variation between animals that participate in visitor contact sessions and can inform how zoos approach ambassador-animal programmes to support animal welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphenodon punctatus 3aanimal welfare 3areptiles 3azoology 3azoos 3aNew Zealand 0acontact 0avisitor 0areptile1 aBrox, Bridget W.1 aMacaskill, Anne C.0 tNew Zealand journal of zoology.g2022 July 03, v. 49, no. 3 p.252-262dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12299x1175-88217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014223.2021.19674153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01551naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007900172300001600251520065900267592002800926650001900954650002400973650003100997650001101028650001501039650001001054773010301064856008501167852000901252655001201261IND60559154820221118225529.0161127e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055915482DNAL7 a10.1080/03632415.2016.12214042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Mary Anne10aGraphical Function Mapping as a New Way to Explore Cause-and-Effect Chains  ap. 638-643.  aGraphical function mapping provides a simple method for improving communication within interdisciplinary research teams and between scientists and nonscientists.

The positive effects of PCT on tree growth are well documented, however, there have been few operational studies of thinning productivity associated with later harvests in such stands and associated cost comparison with high-density, small-diameter stands. In the winters of 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 a long-term herbicide and PCT study in west-central Maine was commercially thinned using cut-to-length (CTL) and whole-tree (WT) harvesting systems in PCT and non-PCT stands, respectively. Thinning prescriptions consisted of three nominal removal intensities (33%, 50%, and 66% of the standing softwood volume) in a randomized block design with three to four replications. Stand density, basal area, hardwood content, and removal intensity were not significant in explaining variation in harvester and feller-buncher productivity. An analysis of unit cost of production indicated that wood chip production using a WT system in non-PCT stands is less costly than the production of roundwood using a CTL system in PCT stands. Profit, however, is similar for products harvested by either system. Our conclusion is that the WT system used in the study is economically feasible to treat highdensity, small-diameter stands in a commercial thinning. 3aharvesting 3atree growth 3awinter 3ahardwood 3aherbicides 3aconiferous forests 3aroundwood 3asoftwood 3astand density 3aproduction costs 3awood chips 3acase studies 3astand basal area 3aMaine 0abasal area1 aBenjamin, Jeffrey G.1 aRoth, Brian E.0 tForestry chronicle.g2015 , v. 91, no. 2 p.150-160dCanadian Institute of Forestry.x0015-75467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc2015-026  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011000167300001600277520092600293536046601219592002801685596016901713596008601882650001801968650001801986650001602004650003302020650001202053650001902065653001802084653004002102653001302142653001402155653001902169653002002188700001902208773010702227856008602334852000902420655001202429IND60425783220221119211003.0191213e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6042578322DNAL7 a10.1080/0269249X.2015.10553392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugie, Koji12aA new marine araphid diatom, Thalassionema kuroshioensis sp. nov., from temperate Japanese coastal waters  ap. 237-245.  aA new marine planktonic diatom Thalassionema kuroshioensis sp. nov., was described based on morphological comparison with five other extant Thalassionema species. Thalassionema kuroshioensis was found in coastal to offshore regions of the Kuroshio current in the temperate to subtropical western North Pacific. Morphological characteristics of T. kuroshioensis were identified using light and scanning electron microscopic observations and include isopolar valves, high density of areolae, cross- to club-shaped occluding bars, apical excavations, and sternum traversed across both ends of apices on the valve face. One rimoportula is located at the end of both valve apices connecting with the external opening slit in the deeply excavated apex. The outline of the valve is linear or slightly inflated. We provide size ranges and a key to the species of all known extant Thalassionema species, including the new species.  aThis study was partly funded by the following three projects: ‘Development of simulation techniques to nowcast the biodiversity of marine phytoplankton’ from the Japan Science and Technology Agency and ‘The study of Kuroshio Ecosystem dynamics for sustainable management’ and ‘Establishment of new ecozones in the oceans by meta-genetic community analysis (24121004)’ from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.  aPublisher supplied data  aDevelopment of simulation techniques to nowcast the biodiversity of marine phytoplanktoncJapan Science and Technology Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002241  a24121004cMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan 3aThalassionema 3acoastal water 3anew species 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asternum 3ataxonomic keys 0aThalassionema 0aThalassionema kuroshioensis sp. nov 0aplankton 0acell size 0aaraphid diatom 0acoastal species1 aSuzuki, Kōji,0 tDiatom research.g2015 July 3, v. 30, no. 3 p.237-245dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2016x2159-83477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2015.10553393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167520176300288592002802051650001202079650001302091650002702104650001002131650001302141650001802154650002402172650001302196650002502209650001402234650001602248650001702264650002202281650001902303650000902322653003302331653000902364653001502373700001702388700001802405700001902423700002002442700001902462773013002481856008502611852000902696655001202705IND60645052520221122061804.0190719e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064505252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.1030872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tianlin10aResponses of ammonia-oxidizers and comammox to different long-term fertilization regimes in a subtropical paddy soil  aNitrogen, including ammonium, is an essential nutrient for plant growth and heavily applied in agricultural systems via fertilization. Nitrification is a two-step microbiologically-mediated process in which ammonium is first oxidized to nitrite and then subsequently to nitrate. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of variable long-term (28 years) fertilization on the potential nitrification rate (PNR) and three prokaryotic groups involved in this process: (1) ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), (2) ammonium-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and (3) recently discovered bacteria with the capacity to perform complete nitrification (comammox). Fertilization treatments included urea ((NH2)2CO) only (N), urea ((NH2)2CO) + potassium sulfate (K2SO4) (NK), urea ((NH2)2CO) +calcium superphosphate (CaP2H4O8) +potassium sulfate (K2SO4) (NPK), and a control with no N. The PNR increased with N fertilization, indicating that N application accelerated soil nitrification. The lower AOB abundance, the highest AOA/AOB ratios and lower PNR were observed in the NK treatment compared to N and NPK treatments, suggesting that AOB may be the key driver of nitrification in this soil. Comammox had higher amoA gene abundance (2.72 × 107gene copies g−1 to 2.35 × 108 gene copies g−1 dry soil) than AOB and AOA for all treatments. The abundance of comammox clade A (7.38 × 107 gene copies g−1 -2.35 × 108 gene copies g−1 dry soil) was significantly higher than for comammox clade B (5.66 × 106 gene copies g−1 -1.42 × 107gene copies g−1 dry soil), and based on high abundance values, we suppose that comammox are non-negligible contributors to soil nitrification resulting from responsiveness to N fertilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aammonium 3afertilizer application 3agenes 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aoxidation 3apaddy soils 3aplant growth 3apotassium sulfate 3asuperphosphate 3aurea 0aPotential nitrification rate 0aamoA 0aNitrospira1 aWang, Zhihui1 aWang, Shuling1 aZhao, Yongpeng1 aWright, Alan L.1 aJiang, Xianjun0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 93 p.103087-dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.1030873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245016800168520138400336592002801720650001801748650002301766650001601789650001201805650002201817650001501839650002001854650001601874650002301890650001701913650001401930650002501944700003201969700003002001700002402031773013102055856007802186852000902264655001202273IND60781099220221118033735.0220623e20220531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078109922DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci90602632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChomchuen, Kitsadee 10aComparative Study of Phenotypes and Genetics Related to the Growth Performance of Crossbred Thai Indigenous (KKU1 vs. KKU2) Chickens under Hot and Humid Conditions  aTo improve the body weight and growth performance traits of crossbred Thai indigenous chickens, phenotypic performance and genetic values were estimated. Crossbred Thai indigenous chickens, designated KKU1 and KKU2, were compared. The data included 1375 records of body weight (BW0, BW2, BW4, and BW16), breast circumference at 6 weeks of age (BrC6), and average daily gain (ADG0–2, ADG0–4, and ADG0–6). A multi-trait animal model with the average information-restricted maximum likelihood (AI-REML) was used to estimate the genetic parameters and breeding values. The results showed that the body weight and breast circumference traits (BW2, BW4, BW6, and BrC6) for the mixed sex KKU1 chickens were higher than for the KKU2 chickens (p < 0.05). For the growth performance traits, the KKU1 chickens had higher average daily gain and feed intake and a lower feed conversion ratio than the KKU2 chickens (p < 0.05). The survival rates were not different except at up to 6 weeks of age, when that of the KKU1 chickens was slightly lower. The specific combining ability, heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations, and estimated breeding values showed that the KKU1 chickens had better genetics than the KKU2 chickens. In conclusion, KKU1 chickens are suitable for development as crossbred Thai indigenous chickens for enhanced growth performance and for commercial use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3abreasts 3acomparative study 3acrossbreds 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agrowth performance 3aheritability 3aphenotype 3astatistical analysis1 aTuntiyasawasdikul, Veeraya 1 aChankitisakul, Vibuntita 1 aBoonkum, Wuttigrai 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2022 May 31, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci90602633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002200139245014800161300001600309500001500325520193000340650001602270650001002286650001002296650001002306650001702316650001502333650001402348650001202362650001402374650000902388650001302397650001802410650001702428650001202445650001002457650001602467650001302483650001502496650002202511650002102533650001302554651001802567653001502585700001702600700002102617700002202638700002002660700001902680700001802699700001602717700002402733700001902757700001902776700002402795773010502819856004202924852000902966655001202975IND4512558720221122045027.0150513e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451255872DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc2015-0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacLean, David A.10aExperimental manipulation of habitat structures in intensively managed spruce plantations to increase their value for biodiversity conservation  ap. 161-175.  a2019-12-04  aSix intensively managed white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) plantations located in three general landscape contexts (plantation dominated, hardwood dominated, and mixed hardwood and plantation) in northern New Brunswick underwent alternative commercial thinning (CT) treatments: 1) an unthinned control; and three 40% basal area CT removals, with 2) slash and tops remaining on site (status quo CT), 3) branches and tops extracted from the site (biomass removal CT), and 4) clumps of unthinned trees left, and one-half girdled to create snags (enhanced structure CT). We examined responses of taxa that have a clear connection to deadwood and thinning response: beetles and bird species that are directly dependent upon deadwood, ground vegetation species sensitive to disturbance, and small mammals that have been observed to have low density in planted stands. Results three years post-thinning showed that crown width and tree growth responded positively to CT, and herbaceous vegetation diverged from reference stands and unthinned treatments with CT, but greatest compositional change was associated with biomass removal CT. Beetles responded positively to CT, small mammal species responded both positively (red-backed voles) and negatively (woodland jumping mice) to CT, but areas dominated by plantations had negative effects on voles. Effects of CT on songbirds were unclear and their quantification would require larger treated blocks, but maintenance of habitat at the landscape level is essential for the conservation of bird species that require deadwood. The experimental biomass removal CT was least similar to both unthinned and older unmanaged stands, and may therefore be detrimental to biodiversity conservation efforts. These results are only the initial three years after treatment but set the study up to permit a long-term legacy of determining long-term responses of taxa over stand development. 3aplantations 3asnags 3atrees 3avoles 3aPicea glauca 3aColeoptera 3awoodlands 3ajumping 3asongbirds 3amice 3abranches 3asmall mammals 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aslash 3atree growth 3ahardwood 3alandscapes 3aground vegetation 3astand basal area 3ahabitats 3aNew Brunswick 0abasal area1 aDracup, Evan1 aGandiaga, Franck1 aHaughian, Sean R.1 aMacKay, Allison1 aNadeau, Paryse1 aOmari, Kwadwo1 aAdams, Greg1 aFrego, Katherine A.1 aKeppie, Daniel1 aMoreau, Gaetan1 aVillard, Marc Andre0 tForestry chronicle.g2015 , v. 91, no. 2 p.161-175dCanadian Institute of Forestry.x0015-75467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc2015-027  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245009400197500001400291500002000305520200100325592002802326596004902354596004402403650001802447650001502465650001502480650000902495650001102504650002602515650001402541650001702555650001102572650002002583650002502603650002002628650001402648650001002662650001402672650001102686650001702697650002502714650001802739650001302757650001202770651001402782651001102796700007402807700006002881700006502941700005903006700006403065700006103129773012303190856007303313852000903386655001203395IND60700839720221117232653.0200704e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070083972DNAL7 a10.1111/ivb.122922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollin, Rachel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5103-446010aDNA barcoding of echinopluteus larvae uncovers cryptic diversity in neotropical echinoids  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSurveys of larval diversity consistently increase biodiversity estimates when applied to poorly documented groups of marine invertebrates such as phoronids and hemichordates. However, it remains to be seen how helpful this approach is for detecting unsampled species in well‐studied groups. Echinoids represent a large, robust, well‐studied macrofauna, with low diversity and low incidence of cryptic species, making them an ideal test case for the efficacy of larval barcoding to discover diversity in such groups. We developed a reference dataset of DNA barcodes for the shallow‐water adult echinoids from both coasts of Panama and compared them to DNA sequences obtained from larvae collected primarily on the Caribbean coast of Panama. We sequenced mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) for 43 species of adult sea urchins to expand the number and coverage of sequences available in GenBank. Sequences were successfully obtained for COI and 16S ribosomal DNA from 272 larvae and assigned to 17 operational taxonomic units (OTUs): 4 from the Pacific coast of Panama, where larvae were not sampled as intensively, and 13 from the Caribbean coast. Of these 17 OTUs, 13 were identified from comparisons with our adult sequences and belonged to species well documented in these regions. Another larva was identified from comparisons with unpublished sequences in the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) as belonging to Pseudoboletia, a genus scarcely known in the Caribbean and previously unreported in Panama. Three OTUs remained unidentified. Based on larval morphology, at least two of these OTUs appeared to be spatangoids, which are difficult to collect and whose presence often goes undetected in standard surveys of benthic diversity. Despite its ability to capture unanticipated diversity, larval sampling failed to collect some species that are locally common along the Caribbean coast of Panama, such as Leodia sexiesperforata, Diadema antillarum, and Clypeaster rosaceus.  aPublisher supplied data  aN/AcSmithsonian Tropical Research Institute  aN/AcNational Museum of Natural History 3aDNA barcoding 3aEchinoidea 3aNeotropics 3aOtus 3aadults 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abarcoding 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3acryptic species 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afauna 3aincidence 3alarvae 3amitochondria 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal DNA 3asampling 3asurveys 3aCaribbean 3aPanama1 aVenera‐Pontón, Dagoberto E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3320-36161 aDriskell, Amy C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8401-79231 aMacdonald, Kenneth S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0923-24601 aGeyer, Laura B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1532-197X1 aLessios, Harilaos A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4726-13821 aBoyle, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7287-13530 tInvertebrate biology.g2020 June, v. 139, no. 2 p.e12292-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867081x1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.122923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013700155300001800292520122100310592002801531650002201559650002301581650001101604650001701615650001101632650001701643650000901660650000901669650001401678650001101692650000701703650001701710650001301727650001401740650001601754700001301770700001701783700002001800700001701820700001701837700001701854773012101871856007401992852000902066655001202075IND60618131820221121230139.0181029e20180109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061813182DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra07841b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Jing10aActivation of peroxymonosulfate by metal (Fe, Mn, Cu and Ni) doping ordered mesoporous Co₃O₄ for the degradation of enrofloxacin  ap. 2338-2349.  aVarious transition metals (Fe, Mn, Cu and Ni) were doped into ordered mesoporous Co₃O₄ to synthesize Co₃O₄-composite spinels. Their formation was evidenced by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. It was found that Co₃O₄-composite spinels could efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to remove enrofloxacin (ENR) and the catalytic activity followed the order Co₃O₄–CuCo₂O₄ > Co₃O₄–CoMn₂O₄ > Co₃O₄–CoFe₂O₄ > Co₃O₄–NiCo₂O₄. Moreover, through the calculation of the specific apparent rate constant (kₛₐₚₚ), it can be proved that the Co and Cu ions had the best synergistic effect for PMS activation. The Co₃O₄-composite spinels presented a wide pH range for the activation of PMS, but strong acidic and alkaline conditions were detrimental to ENR removal. Higher reaction temperature could promote the PMS activation process. Sulfate radical was identified as the dominating reactive species in Co₃O₄-composite spinel/PMS systems through radical quenching experiments. Meanwhile, the probable mechanisms concerning Co₃O₄-composite spinel activated PMS were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3acopper 3aenrofloxacin 3aions 3airon 3amanganese 3anickel 3apH 3aporous media 3asulfates 3asynergism 3atemperature1 aYa, Chen1 aGe, Yongjian1 aCheng, Yongqing1 aChen, Yijing1 aXu, Mengyuan1 aWang, Hongyu0 tRSC advances.g2018 Jan. 09, v. 8, no. 5 p.2338-2349dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra07841b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245010000196500001400296500002000310520127000330592002801600596004601628596003201674650001501706650001201721650001301733650002601746650001001772650001601782650001401798650001101812650001301823773012301836856007301959852000902032655001202041IND60700839820221117232710.0200704e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070083982DNAL7 a10.1111/ivb.122852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPernet, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6200-565410aOpposed bands of cilia in the nonfeeding larvae of the serpulid annelid Salmacina tribranchiata  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe nonfeeding planktonic larvae of marine invertebrates typically lack larval feeding structures. One puzzling exception to this generalization is the annelid clade Sabellidae, in which nonfeeding larvae possess ciliary bands (specifically, food groove and metatroch) that, to the best of our knowledge, have no function other than in feeding. Nishi and Yamasu (1992b, Bulletin of the College of Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, 54, 107–121) published a scanning electron micrograph showing that nonfeeding larvae of the serpulid annelid Salmacina dysteri also possess food groove and metatrochal cilia. Here I demonstrate that nonfeeding larvae of Salmacina tribranchiata also bear ciliary bands identifiable as food groove and metatroch by position. High‐speed video of ciliary beat patterns shows that, together with the prototrochal cilia, these bands function in an opposed band system. The presence of feeding structures in nonfeeding annelid larvae is thus more widely distributed than previously recognized. The presence of feeding structures may make evolutionary transitions to planktotrophy more likely, and may underlie an inferred origin of larval feeding in the common ancestor of one of the two major clades of serpulid annelids, Serpulinae.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE‐1756531cDivision of Ocean Sciences  cNational Science Foundation 3aSabellidae 3aUrsidae 3aancestry 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acilia 3aexhibitions 3aknowledge 3alarvae 3aplankton0 tInvertebrate biology.g2020 June, v. 139, no. 2 p.e12285-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867081x1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.122853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245012100181520097200302592002801274650002401302650001101326650000901337650001801346650002101364650002101385650001201406650001701418651001101435653000901446653001501455653001601470653001201486653001301498700002801511700002501539773010601564856008801670852000901758655001201767IND60769993220221123015600.0220509e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076999322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1135222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Victor Vasques10aCOVID-19-related personal protective equipment (PPE) contamination in the highly urbanized southeast Brazilian coast  aThis study aimed to report personal protective equipment (PPE) contamination in Santos beaches (Brazil) using standardized procedures for the first time while comparing two periods to understand the progression of PPE contamination. The occurrence of PPE items was ubiquitous in all sampled sites, although the densities were relatively low compared to those in other parts of the world. Unlike previous studies, reusable face masks were the most common type of PPE. PPE density in the studied areas was similar in both sampling seasons, probably because of the influence of tourism, urbanization, and local hydrodynamic aspects. PPE items can release microfibers into the aquatic environment and pose entanglement hazards to marine biota. A wider monitoring of PPE pollution, accompanied by surveys on PPE usage and behavior, as well as chemical characterization of the discarded PPE items, is needed to fully understand this unprecedented form of plastic pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3acoasts 3aface 3ahydrodynamics 3amarine pollution 3asafety equipment 3atourism 3aurbanization 3aBrazil 0aMask 0aMonitoring 0aCoronavirus 0aPlastic 0aReusable1 aDe-la-Torre, Gabriel E.1 aCastro, Ítalo Braga0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Apr., v. 177 p.113522-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1135223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013800156300001800294520097900312592002801291650001101319650001501330650001201345650002001357650001501377650001901392650001501411650001401426650001301440650001201453650002001465650001201485650001301497650001801510650001901528650000901547700001701556700001801573700002101591700002301612700001901635700001901654773012501673856007401798852000901872655001201881IND60701131720221119232959.0200707e20200706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070113172DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc01402h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiao10aCalcium carbide as a dehydrating agent for the synthesis of carbamates, glycerol carbonate, and cyclic carbonates from carbon dioxide  ap. 4231-4239.  aCarbon dioxide (CO₂) is a nontoxic and inexpensive C1 building block, which can be used for the synthesis of valuable chemicals such as aromatic carbamates from anilines and methanol (MeOH), glycerol carbonate from glycerol, and cyclic carbonates from diols. However, these reactions generate water as the byproduct and suffer from thermodynamic limits, which lead to low yields. Calcium carbide (CaC₂) is a renewable chemical, which can be recycled from calcium that is abundant in the Earth's crust. Furthermore, CaC₂ rapidly reacts with water. In this work, we used CaC₂ as a dehydrating agent for the direct synthesis of carbamates (including polyurethane precursors) from amines, CO₂, and MeOH. All reagents were commercially available. In addition, CaC₂ was employed for the synthesis of glycerol carbonate from glycerol and CO₂ with a zinc catalyst and N-donor ligand. A similar protocol was applied to synthesize cyclic carbonates from diols and CO₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acalcium carbide 3acarbamates 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acatalysts 3aglycerol 3aglycols 3agreen chemistry 3aligands 3amethanol 3apolyurethanes 3athermodynamics 3azinc1 aYuan, Hao-Yu1 aLin, Xiao-Tao1 aFukaya, Norihisa1 aFujitani, Tadahiro1 aSato, Kazuhiko1 aChoi, Jun-Chul0 tGreen chemistry.g2020 July 6, v. 22, no. 13 p.4231-4239dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc01402h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245017000166300001400336520151300350592002801863650002401891650002001915650001901935650002401954650002201978650001702000650001302017650002302030650002102053650002002074650003102094650001702125650001102142650001102153650001802164650001502182651001702197653002302214653002402237653002102261653002102282653001602303700002302319700002302342700002302365773009902388856008302487852000902570655001202579IND60636915220221120224945.0190411e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063691522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2017.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtz, Ryan M.10aElevated native terrestrial snail abundance and diversity in association with an invasive understory shrub, Berberis thunbergii, in a North American deciduous forest  ap. 66-71.  aInvasive terrestrial plants often substantially reshape environments, yet how such invasions affect terrestrial snail assemblages remains understudied. We investigated how snail assemblages in deciduous forest soils with dense Berberis thunbergii (Japanese barberry), an invasive shrub in eastern North America, differ from forest areas lacking the shrub. Leaf litter and soil samples were collected from forest patches with dense B. thunbergii understories and adjacent control areas within two exurban forest tracts in western Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Snails were identified to species and quantified by standard diversity metrics. Contrary to our expectations, snails were significantly more abundant and diverse in B. thunbergii-invaded areas. Despite differences in abundance, the snail community composition did not differ between invaded and control habitats. The terrestrial snail assemblage we observed, which was composed entirely of native species, appears to respond favorably to B. thunbergii invasion and therefore may not be negatively impacted by physicochemical changes to soils typically observed in association with the plant. Such findings could reflect the fact that B. thunbergii likely creates more favorable habitat for snails by creating cooler, more humid, and more alkaline soil environments. However, the snail assemblages we retrieved may consist mostly of species with high tolerance to environmental degradation due to a legacy of land use change and acid deposition in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBerberis thunbergii 3aacid deposition 3aalkaline soils 3acommunity structure 3adeciduous forests 3aforest soils 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aland use change 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant litter 3ashrubs 3asnails 3asoil sampling 3aunderstory 3aPennsylvania 0aTerrestrial snails 0aBerberis thunbergii 0aTemperate forest 0aInvasive species 0aLeaf litter1 aPearce, Timothy A.1 aLewis, Danielle L.1 aMannino, Joseph C.0 tActa oecologica.g2018 Jan., v. 86 p.66-71dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2017.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245018500205300001800390506007600408520037800484592002800862506003700890650003200927650001000959650002500969650001700994650001301011650003101024700001701055700001901072700002001091700002501111700001801136700001801154773012701172856008001299852000901379655001201388IND60291234620221207111256.0150701e20150625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6029123462DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00541-152doi7 aPMC44479092pmcid7 a260219242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Kok-Gan10aGenome Anatomy of Streptococcus parasanguinis Strain C1A, Isolated from a Patient with Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Reveals Unusual Genomic Features  ap. e00541-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStreptococcus parasanguinis causes invasive diseases.

Concentrations of cadmium and lead in the edible muscle tissue of the blue shark captured in the south Peruvian coastal waters and offshore north-central Chile were determined. The Cd and Pb levels varied between 0.004 and 0.014 and 0.004 and 0.03 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. We found direct correlation of Cd concentration with the total length, nevertheless there was no clear relationship regarding sex, seasons, and capture areas. Both metals were below the safety limits for human consumption. The target hazard quotient (THQ) values suggest that its consumption does not represent a risk to the human health. In Peru, this is only the second paper that reports Cd and Pb in sharks. We recommend increasing the sampling by including larger sharks and in other regions of the Peruvian coastline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrionace glauca 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acoasts 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3alead 3amarine pollution 3amuscle tissues 3arisk 3aChile 3aPeru 0aPelagic shark 0aMetals 0aBioaccumulation 0aMeat 0aHealth risk 0aPeru1 aEspinoza, Pepe1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5149-83100 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2022 Apr., v. 177 p.113523-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.1135233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013400157300002000291520107500311592002801386650001101414650001101425650001101436650001201447650001601459650001901475700003101494773012301525856007401648852000901722655001201731IND60645887520221119185733.0190604e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064588752DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra01797f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabi, Muskan10aStudy of the magneto-electronic, optical, thermal and thermoelectric applications of double perovskites Ba₂MTaO₆ (M = Er, Tm)  ap. 15852-15867.  aThe structural, electronic, optical, thermodynamic and thermoelectric properties of double perovskites Ba₂MTaO₆ (M = Er, Tm) have been studied. These alloys stabilize in cubic structure with paramagnetic phases and structural parameters that are in good agreement with experimental results. The elastic parameters reveal both materials as being super hard and brittle in nature. The band profile displays the direct bandgap semiconducting behavior of both compounds in the spin-up channels. The optical coefficients, viz. optical conductivity, reflectivity and electron energy loss, are intended for a photon energy of up to 14 eV to perceive the optical response. The effects of temperature and pressure on the thermodynamic properties have also been evaluated via the quasi-harmonic Debye model. Post-DFT treatment was performed to explore the thermoelectric properties; both perovskites exhibit a colossal power factor of 90 × 10¹¹ W m⁻¹ K⁻² s⁻¹ and 5 × 85 × 10¹¹ W m⁻¹ K⁻² s⁻¹ for Ba₂TmTaO₆ and Ba₂ErTaO₆, respectively, at 800 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aenergy 3amodels 3aphotons 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aGupta, D.

Several species of apple snails (Ampullariidae: Pomacea) from South America have become widespread pests in Asia since their introduction in the early 1980s, but their taxonomic uncertainty has hindered our understanding of the invasive processes. We aim to determine the identity and distribution of Pomacea species in Hong Kong, which has been known as a stepping stone of species invasion. LOCATION: Hong Kong. METHODS: We collected 162 apple snails from five freshwater wetlands of Hong Kong, sequenced the mitochondrial COI, genotyped the nuclear EF1α and built a COI dataset of 1378 sequences of apple snails from mainland China, Malaysia, Argentina and Brazil. We identified the species, determine the introgression pattern and analysed their population structures. RESULTS: We found the co‐occurrence of P. canaliculata, P. maculata and P. occulta in Hong Kong for the first time. Pomacea canaliculata represented the dominant species (85% of collected specimens). The three Pomacea species from Hong Kong had low genetic diversity. High genetic similarity existed between P. canaliculata populations of Hong Kong and Malaysia, P. occulta populations of Hong Kong and mainland China and P. maculata populations of mainland China and Malaysia. Our samples contained a high proportion of hybrids. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Apple snails may have been introduced into Hong Kong multiple times: both P. canaliculata and P. occulta likely came from Argentina; P. maculata came from both Argentina and Brazil. Genetic drift largely explains the differentiation of Pomacea spp. among regions. Introgressive hybridization may have contributed to population fitness by increasing genetic variation to neutralize the founder effect. The knowledge on species identity, distribution and genetic diversity of apple snails from this study will contribute to better understanding their invasive mechanisms and prevention of their continued spread in Asia.  aPublisher supplied data  a31800462cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32171668cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aL20190005cSouthern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory  aGML2019ZD0404cSouthern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory  aGML2019ZD0409cSouthern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory  a2021YW06cFundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang 3aPomacea canaliculata 3aapples 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3adominant species 3afounder effect 3afreshwater 3agenetic drift 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic variation 3aintrogression 3ainvasive species 3amitochondria 3aspecies identification 3auncertainty 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aMalaysia1 aIp, Jack Chi‐Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4477-73511 aZhao, Xing‐Xing1 aLi, Jia‐Nan1 aJin, Yu‐Jie1 aYu, Xiao‐Ping1 aQiu, Jian‐Wen0 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.97-111dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.134433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245012300166520133000289592002801619650001701647650001901664650002201683650002501705650001301730650001401743650001601757651001101773700002701784700001801811700002201829700002901851700002201880773012701902856007402029852000902103655001202112IND60652778520221119180333.0190713e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065277852DNAL7 a10.3390/su110204332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarstens, Christoffer10aInsights from Testing a Modified Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways Approach for Spatial Planning at the Municipal Level  aThe Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach has successfully been used to manage uncertainties in large infrastructure projects. However, the viability of the DAPP approach for spatial planning in smaller municipal settings is not clear. This paper examines opportunities and constraints of using adaptive pathways approaches to help small municipalities plan for future sea-level rise. The methodology was based on developing a simplified DAPP-approach, which was tested in a multiple experimental case study of spatial planning projects in three municipalities in Sweden. The results show that the approach promoted vulnerability-based thinking among the end-users and generated new ideas on how to manage the uncertain long-term impacts of future sea-level rise. However, the increased understanding of uncertainties was used to justify static, rather than adaptive, solutions. This somewhat surprising outcome can be explained by perceived legal constraints, lack of experience of adaptive pathways, and unwillingness to prescribe actions that could prove difficult to enforce in the future. More research is needed to further understand at what planning phases dynamic policy pathway approaches work best and how current barriers in legislation, practices, mind-set, organization, and resources can be overcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3aplanning 3asea level 3auncertainty 3aSweden1 aSonnek, Karin Mossberg1 aRäty, Riitta1 aWikman-Svahn, Per1 aCarlsson-Kanyama, Annika1 aMetzger, Jonathan0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01893naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245011200128300001600240520093000256592002801186650002301214650001601237650002101253650001401274650000901288650001901297650002101316653001701337653002201354653001601376700001501392700002301407773011601430852000901546655001201555IND60717015220221118115033.0201107e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071701522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanitha, K.10aInfluence of brown planthopper Nilaparvava lugens (Stal.) feeding on nutritional biochemistry of rice plant  ap. 142-146.  aAmong the four rice varieties selected, viz., TN1, Basmati370, ASD16 and Ptb33, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and b, reducing sugars, protein and free amino acid content was more in susceptible varieties compared to resistant varieties.

However, upon BPH infestation increase in free amino acid content was observed in all four varieties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNilaparvata lugens 3achlorophyll 3afree amino acids 3apotassium 3arice 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 0abiochemistry 0abrown planthopper 0ainfestation1 aSuresh, S.1 aGunathilagaraj, K.0 tOryza.g2011 Apr., v. 48, no. 2 p.142-146dAssociation of Rice Research WorkerswJournal:22925x2249-52667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001500191245011400206300001600320520100900336592002801345650001501373650003801388650002001426700001401446700002501460773009501485856008401580990002301664852000901687655001201696IND60094777920221121005027.0141104e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009477792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2012.07.0162doi7 aPMC34821022pmcid7 a229212012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Ying10aPlanar Polarized Protrusions Break the Symmetry of EGFR Signaling during Drosophila Bract Cell Fate Induction  ap. 507-518.  aSecreted signaling molecules typically float in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or freely diffuse away from the signaling cell, suggesting that a signal should be sensed equally by all neighboring cells. However, we demonstrate that Spitz (Spi)-mediated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is spatially biased to selectively determine the induction of a single bract cell on the proximal side of each mechanosensory organ on the Drosophila leg. Dynamic and oriented cellular protrusions emanating from the socket cell, the source of Spi, robustly favor the Spi/EGFR signaling response in a particular cell among equally competent neighbors. We propose that these protrusive structures enhance signaling by increasing contact between the signaling and responding cells. The planar polarized direction of the protrusions determines the direction of the signaling outcome. This asymmetric cell signaling serves as a developmental mechanism to generate spatially patterned cell fates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aplasma membrane1 aHan, Chun1 aAxelrod, Jeffery D.0 tDevelopmental cell.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 23, no. 3 p.507-518dElsevier Inc.x1534-58077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2012.07.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245015700160300002000317520206900337592002802406596007002434650001902504650001602523650001602539650001802555650001802573650001902591650001802610650002202628650002602650650002402676650001202700650002302712650001002735650003002745650001102775650002602786650000702812650001402819650001302833650001902846650002202865650002102887651001002908700001402918700001302932700001902945700001902964700001202983700002002995773015503015856008303170852000903253655001203262IND60747260920221120233052.0220208e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074726092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13779-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yi14aThe preliminary evaluation of differential characteristics and factor evaluation of the microbial structure of rural household toilet excrement in China  ap. 43842-43852.  aRecent studies on the microbial community composition of human excrement after rural household toilet treatment are unclear regarding the effects and risks of using recycled products as fertilizers in agriculture. In this study, we used Illumina high-throughput sequencing to investigate the microbial community structure of the excrement from 50 Chinese rural household toilets on a spatial scale, and we evaluated the impact of select geochemical factors on the bacterial and fungal communities in the human excrement. Multivariate analysis showed that there was a significant spatial differentiation of the human excrement in microbial communities after all toilet treatments. Twenty dry toilet samples and thirty septic tank samples had similar bacterial (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and fungal phyla (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), differing only in the proportions of the microorganisms. For both dry toilet samples and septic tank samples, the pH and ammonium nitrogen were found to be the major driving forces affecting the changes in bacterial community structures (p<0.05), while there was no correlation found for the fungal community with environmental factors in China (p>0.05), except in the northern regions, where the total phosphorus was found to be significantly correlated with the fungal community (p<0.05). Network analysis confirmed that NH₄⁺-N had the most significant impact on the content of pathogens. Certain pathogens were still detected after toilet treatment, such as Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Aspergillus, and Chrysosporium, and the proportion of potential pathogenic bacteria in dry toilets was higher than that in septic tanks, suggesting that septic tanks were better than dry toilets in treating human excrement. These results provide an ecological perspective for understanding the large-scale geographic distribution of household excrement microbial communities in rural areas and for improving human excrement treatment technologies and avoiding the risks of agricultural applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC1901004cKey Technologies Research and Development Program 3aActinobacteria 3aAspergillus 3aBacteroides 3aBasidiomycota 3aChrysosporium 3aProteobacteria 3aStreptococcus 3aammonium nitrogen 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aexcreta 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3amultivariate analysis 3apH 3apollution 3aresearch 3aseptic systems 3aspatial variation 3atotal phosphorus 3aChina1 aLi, Houyu1 aYang, Bo1 aWei, Xiaocheng1 aZhang, Chunxue1 aXu, Yan1 aZheng, Xiangqun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 32 p.43842-43852dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13779-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008500161300001800246500001400264520166100278592002801939650001001967650001301977650001701990650001402007650000902021650001202030650001802042650002002060650001302080650001502093650001802108650001002126650001402136650001202150653001302162653001702175653001202192653001402204653001202218700001802230700001902248700001802267700002102285700001702306700001802323700001702341773011202358856007702470852000902547655001202556IND60726959520221120142947.0210209e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072695952DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.2013-038672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Tae-Jun10aMolecular cloning, characterization, and expression of pannexin genes in chicken  ap. 2253-2261.  aNAL-light  aPannexins (Panx) are a family of proteins that share sequences with the invertebrate gap junction proteins, innexins, and have a similar structure to that of the vertebrate gap junction proteins, connexins. To date, the Panx family consists of 3 members, but their genetic sequences have only been completely determined in a few vertebrate species. Moreover, expression of the Panx family has been reported in several rodent tissues: Panx1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammals, whereas Panx2 and Panx3 expressions are more restricted. Although members of the Panx family have been detected in mammals, their genetic sequences in avian species have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we obtained the full-length mRNA sequences of chicken PANX genes and evaluated the homology of the amino acids from these sequences with those of other species. Furthermore, PANX gene expression in several chicken tissues was investigated based on mRNA levels. PANX1 was detected in the brain, cochlea, chondrocytes, eye, lung, skin, and intestine, and PANX2 was expressed in the brain, eye, and intestine. PANX3 was observed in the cochlea, chondrocytes, and bone. In addition, expression of PANX3 was higher than PANX1 in the cochlea. Immunofluorescent staining revealed PANX1 in hair cells, as well as the supporting cells, ganglion neurons, and the tegmentum vasculosum in chickens, whereas PANX3 was only detected in the bone surrounding the cochlea. Overall, the results of this study provide the first identification and characterization of the sequence and expression of the PANX family in an avian species, and fundamental data for confirmation of Panx function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3achickens 3achondrocytes 3aconnexins 3aeyes 3aganglia 3agap junctions 3agene expression 3ainnexins 3aintestines 3ainvertebrates 3alungs 3apannexins 3arodents 0apannexin 0agap junction 0achicken 0ainner ear 0acloning1 aKim, Dong-Bin1 aBae, Jae Woong1 aSagong, Borum1 aCh'oe, Su-yŏng,1 aCho, Hyun-Ju1 aKim, Un-Kyung1 aLee, Kyu-Yup0 tPoultry science.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 93, no. 9 p.2253-2261dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2013-038673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007800139245013100217300001300348500002000361520178000381592002802161596008502189596009602274650001702370650001502387650002402402650003002426650002102456650001102477650002102488650001402509650001002523651002502533700007002558700005702628773012402685856007402809852000902883655001202892IND60761453220221122222228.0211229e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076145322DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.134132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández‐Agüero, Juan Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6584-577410aWhat feeds on Quercus ilex L.? A biogeographical approach to studying trophic interactions in a Mediterranean keystone species  ap. 4-24.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) is regarded as a keystone plant species. Trophic interactions may affect the distribution and abundance of phytophagous species, but the number of arthropod species that use holm oak as a food resource and their levels of host specificity are not yet known. Here, we aimed to quantify these species, their feeding strategies and conservation status, the taxonomic relatedness in each trophic guild and their degree of host specificity on holm oak. LOCATION: Our study covered the whole distribution area of Q. ilex in the central‐western Mediterranean Basin. METHODS: We reviewed the existing literature and compiled information about all arthropod species that feed on Q. ilex, as well as their feeding strategies and conservation status. We also investigated the relationships between trophic guilds and the taxonomic relatedness of species, and assessed the degree of climatic niche overlap with holm oak. RESULTS: We found that 605 species feed on seven different parts of the holm oak plant (i.e. feeding strategies). More than 90% of these species lack a conservation status assessment, and eight are threatened by human activities, either as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered. A significant phylogenetic relationship was found between taxonomic relatedness and groups of arthropods that feed on the same part of the plant (i.e. trophic guilds). Twenty per cent of the species had similar niches, thereby indicating the potentially high host dependence of these species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the significance of a keystone tree species for arthropod conservation and the need for further research into the distribution and conservation status of arthropod species in Mediterranean holm oak woodlands.  aPublisher supplied data  aREMEDINAL TE‐CM (S2018/EMT‐4338)cConsejería de Educación e Investigación  aPCIN‐2016‐150cMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España 3aQuercus ilex 3aarthropods 3aconservation status 3ageographical distribution 3ahost specificity 3ahumans 3akeystone species 3aphylogeny 3atrees 3aMediterranean region1 aRuiz‐Tapiador, Ildefonso1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9546-53931 aCayuela, Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3562-26620 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.4-24dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.134133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245007400206300001800280500001900298520175000317592002802067650003002095650001102125650001202136650001902148650001602167650001002183650001202193650001502205650001902220650001102239650001602250773013502266856008202401852000902483655001202492IND60701846420221118181620.0200716e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070184642DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-020-03238-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBostan, Pınar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8947-193810aAssessing variations in climate extremes over Euphrates Basin, Turkey  ap. 1461-1473.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe variation in climate extremes at different spatial and temporal scales can be conceived as an important indicator of climate change. The focus of this study is to reveal linear trends and observe space-time (ST) variation in extreme climate indices over the Euphrates Basin in Turkey. Extreme climate indices are calculated using daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures, including observations of daily precipitation measured from 41 meteorological stations from 1970 to 2017. Three precipitation indices, consecutive dry days (CDD), consecutive wet days (CWD), and precipitation intensity (SDII), together with three temperature indices, number of summer days (SU), number of frost days (FD), and growing season length (GSL), are analysed. Linear trends in these extreme indices are examined using the Mann-Kendall test. The ST distribution and variation in climate indices are examined through prediction maps for this study period. Ordinary kriging (OK), which has proven to be accurate and reliable in many studies, is used to obtain prediction maps on ST framework. Results indicated that there is an evident trend in the temperature-related indices. Regarding SU and GSL, about 66% and 34% of all stations, respectively, show a significant increasing trend. The downward trend (negative Z statistic) for the FD is observed at approximately 83% of all meteorological stations, of which 35% show a significant trend. The ST variation in temperature-related extremes is evident from prediction maps; the trend is not as dominant for precipitation-related indices. In terms of ST prediction maps, the most prominent variation is observed in the south and northeast parts of the basin in CDD and CWD prediction maps from 2013 to 2017.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3afrost 3akriging 3aprediction 3aspace and time 3asummer 3atemperature0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1461-1473dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03238-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245008400180300001600264500000900280520125700289592002801546650001301574650000901587650001401596650001401610650002601624650003101650650001701681650001501698650001101713650002601724650001301750650000901763650000901772700002201781773012101803856009701924852000902021655001202030IND60663313020221120200204.0191122e196705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066331302DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1967.00021962005900030002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassey, H.

The concentration of Zn in each of these kernel components varied widely among the 31 inbreds, however, and the concentration of Zn in the kernel could not be predicted from the relative size of the kernel components. In greenhouse experiments with 32 inbreds, Zn concentration in the kernel was not correlated with Zn uptake by plants or Zn concentration in plants grown on either Zn-deficient or Zn-fertilized soil. In field experiments, however, variation among inbred lines in their concentration of Zn in the kernel did appear to be related to the general level of Zn in the plant, but this factor was greatly modified by the extent to which the inbred was able to transfer Zn from the stalk and leaves to the ear. Inbreds Ky211 and Ky209 transferred approximately one-third of their stalk and leaf Zn to the ear during grain formation. Approximately one-fourth of die gain in ear Zn from tasseling to maturity by Ky209 × Ky21l could be accounted for by transfer from the stalk and a slight additional amount by transfer from the leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acorn ears 3aendosperm 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ainbred lines 3ainbreeding 3aleaves 3anutrient deficiencies 3apericarp 3asoil 3azinc1 aLoeffel, Frank A.0 tAgronomy journal.g1967 May, v. 59, no. 3 p.214-217dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1967.00021962005900030002x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007500163520124300238592002801481650001501509650002501524650001401549650001101563650002101574650002301595650001601618650001301634650001901647651001001666700002801676700002701704773012701731856007401858852000901932655001201941IND60652778720221119180423.0190713e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065277872DNAL7 a10.3390/su110204352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez, Víctor,12aA New Residential Role for the Rural Environment in Extremadura, Spain  aEuropean rural spaces are assuming a new residential role. In some such as Extremadura (Spain), the low population density and the practice of an extensive primary sector has allowed the survival of large areas and natural spaces that are desirable for urbanites. The residential growth caused by economic changes and tourist attractiveness has generated a new paradigm in which recreational use competes with agricultural and livestock use (until now the sustenance of the local economy). To record this change, it is essential to spatially determine what the rural environment means in this specific regional context and quantify the number of new existing homes. First, we resorted to the future competent legislation (born of experience and local knowledge) and territorial and urban planning, while second, we used the potentiality of all of the available free series of orthophotography and aerial photography including other tools such as Google Street View. This methodological process led us to discover a recent and important advancement of the recreational residential function. On balance, the data showed that recreational residential use is a leading actor in the change of the landscape and productive model of rural areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3alandscapes 3alaws and regulations 3alivestock 3amodels 3aorthophotography 3apopulation density 3arural areas 3atourists 3aurban planning 3aSpain1 aSánchez, José Manuel,1 aRengifo, Juan-Ignacio 0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245012900207300001600336500002000352520220900372592002802581596004602609650001102655650001702666650001002683650002202693650002102715650001502736650001502751650001102766650002102777651001002798700003202808700001902840700006802859700002202927700001902949700002602968700001802994773012703012856007403139852000903213655001203222IND60761453320221122190433.0211229e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076145332DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.134452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía‐Navas, Vicente1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9362-266310aPartitioning beta diversity to untangle mechanisms underlying the assembly of bird communities in Mediterranean olive groves  ap. 112-127.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: We investigated taxonomic and functional beta diversity of bird communities inhabiting Mediterranean olive groves subject to either intensive or low‐intensity management of the ground cover and located in landscapes with different degrees of complexity. LOCATION: Andalusia, southern Spain. METHODS: We partitioned taxonomic and functional beta diversity into its two additive components, turnover and nestedness. We also explored the contributions of single sites to overall beta diversity (LCBD) and separated the effects of species replacement (turnover) and richness difference (nestedness) in order to identify ecologically unique sites—keystone communities—within the metacommunity. In a further step, we employed abundance‐ and functional‐based indicator species analyses to characterize bird assemblages. RESULTS: Taxonomic beta diversity increased with landscape complexity. Although both taxonomic and functional differences among assemblages were driven mainly by species replacement (regardless of management or landscape type), the contribution of trait replacement to the total functional beta diversity was much lower, suggesting that species performing similar functions replace each other between sites. There were no differences in LCBD between management types or categories of landscape complexity, but the contributions of sites to beta diversity decreased as the percentage cover of olive groves increased. Species richness was also important in explaining variation in LCBD as species‐poor sites tended to contribute the most to the local‐to‐regional beta diversity. However, some farms displayed high values of LCBD due to the existence of a high replacement component, indicating that some species recorded in these sites were scarce elsewhere. The indicator species analyses revealed that the woodchat shrike Lanius senator may constitute an excellent indicator of biodiversity in this agro‐forestry system. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that agricultural expansion promotes biotic homogenization and exemplify how the identification of both keystone species and communities can represent a powerful tool for the management of anthropized landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data  aLIFE14 NAT/ES/001094cEuropean Commission 3aLanius 3aagroforestry 3abirds 3aindicator species 3akeystone species 3alandscapes 3anestedness 3aolives 3aspecies richness 3aSpain1 aMartínez‐Núñez, Carlos1 aTarifa, Rubén1 aMolina‐Pardo, José L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7270-366X1 aValera, Francisco1 aSalido, Teresa1 aCamacho, Francisco M.1 aRey, Pedro J.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.112-127dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.134453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03675naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009800169300001600267520227700283592002802560650001702588650001102605650001402616650001002630650002102640650001102661650002102672650002002693650000902713650001902722650002802741650001402769650001302783650003102796650001402827650002402841650001302865650001202878700001502890700001502905700001302920700001802933700001702951700001502968773009102983856008603074852000903160655001203169IND60084614020221118075444.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008461402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2011.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Xingui10aConstruction and characterization of human adenovirus serotype 3 packaged by serotype 7 hexon  ap. 214-220.  aHuman adenovirus serotype 3 (Ad3) and serotype 7 (Ad7) are important pathogens causing respiratory tract diseases such as acute respiratory disease in pediatric and adult patients, but the immunodominant targets of Ad3- and Ad7-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) remain unclear. A chimeric Ad vector, Ad3/H7, was constructed by replacing the Ad3 hexon gene (H3) with the hexon gene (H7) of Ad7. The chimeric viruses were successfully rescued in HEp-2 cells, and the Ad7 hexon was able to encapsidate the Ad3 genome, and functioned as efficiently as the Ad3 hexon. Furthermore, we tested the host neutralization responses against the viruses using BALB/C mice. Up to 97% of the NAbs produced by mice that were infected with these viruses were specific for the hexon protein in vitro. Preimmunization of mice with one of Ad7 and Ad3/H7 significantly prevented subsequent intranasal infection of the other type in vivo. In contrast, preimmunization of mice with one of Ad3 and Ad3/H7 did not remarkably prevent subsequent infection of the other type. We next evaluated the functional significance of hexon and other structural proteins specific NAbs to suppress the immunogenicity of Ad3/H3 and Ad3/H7 vectors expressing EGFP in mice preimmunized with wild type Ad. Preimmunization of mice with Ad7 evidently suppressed EGFP-specific humoral immune responses elicited by Ad3/H7, and did not exert suppressive effects on Ad3/H3. But contrary to the in vitro neutralization results, EGFP-specific humoral immune responses elicited by Ad3/H7 was remarkably inhibited in Ad3-preimmunization mice. The whole genome of the Ad7 strain was sequenced and aligned with Ad3. The major differences between Ad3 and Ad7 were only observed in the fiber and hexon among all structural proteins, and the variation between the hexons only located in four hypervariable regions (HVRs), HVR-1, -2, -5, and -7. These results thus suggest that Ad3- and Ad7-specific NAbs are directed primarily against the hexon proteins both in vitro and in vivo. But high titer Ad3 fiber-specific NAbs may also play an important role in blunting Ad3 immunogenicity in vivo. These studies contribute to a more profound understanding of Ad immunogenicity and have relevance for the design of novel Ad vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute course 3aadults 3achimerism 3agenes 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmune response 3amice 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apathogens 3apatients 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aserotypes 3astructural proteins 3avaccines 3aviruses1 aSu, Xiaobo1 aLi, Haitao1 aLi, Xiao1 aZhou, Zhichao1 aLiu, Wenkuan1 aZhou, Rong0 tVirus research.g2011 Sept., v. 160, no. 1-2 p.214-220dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006200169520145300231592002801684650002001712650001201732650001101744650001101755650002901766650002801795651001001823653003201833653006501865653003701930653003001967700001801997700001502015700001802030700001702048700001802065773011302083856008602196852000902282655001202291IND60688423620221117222316.0200601e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068842362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1215182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaohua10aEfficiency of tradable green certificate markets in China  aA nationwide green certificate trading mechanism has been launched in China for two years, yet the low transaction volume indicates inefficient operation of tradable green certificate (TGC) markets in China. An investigation of the operational efficiency of TGC markets would contribute toward the sustainable development of China’s TGC system and further facilitate the efficient consumption of renewable energy. This work innovatively proposes the definition of TGC market operational efficiency, and subsequently uses hierarchical clustering to establish an input-output efficiency evaluation indicator system for the TGC market operation. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and the DEA-Malmquist index are introduced to measure the operational efficiency of TGC markets in China’s seven representative provinces (autonomous regions) corresponding to the period of 2017–2018 as clarifying the obstacles of TGC market operation and proposing improvement measures. Results show that the current TGC markets in seven observed regions are not fully effective with a large room for improvement in various input-output factors. The reduced technology progress hinders the effective operation of the markets, which are specifically illustrated by the unreasonable quota standards, the high and volatile price of TGCs. According to the above problems, some implications of theory and practice are discussed for researchers and policymakers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy industry 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aTradable green certificates 0aOperational efficiency of tradable green certificate markets 0aHierarchical clustering analysis 0adata envelopment analysis1 aHan, Jingjing1 aShan, Yuqi1 aZhao, Caiping1 aLiu, Jinpeng1 aKou, Yingfang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 264 p.121518-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1215183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245010700156300001400263520146100277592002801738650001501766650001301781650001201794650001701806650001101823650001901834650001701853650001201870650001901882650001101901650001401912650001701926650001801943650001001961650001401971650001301985651001101998653001702009653001902026653002702045653001202072700002202084700002002106773008202126856007102208852000902279655001202288IND60568956920221118142820.0170522s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056895692DNAL7 a10.1071/SR152192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraújo, L. G.10aGypsum application increases the carbon stock in soil under sugar cane in the Cerrado region of Brazil  ap. 38-46.  aGypsum is widely used in agriculture in the Cerrado region of Brazil to increase root volume and distribution in the profile of predominantly acidic soils with high aluminium toxicity. The gypsum-induced increase in the root system may be an effective strategy to increase sequestration of atmospheric CO2. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the use of gypsum and carbon accumulation in the soil under sugar cane. In the present study, total carbon stock (TC) in the soil and its fractions were estimated after four growing seasons of sugar cane under gypsum application. The experiment was arranged in a randomised block design with four replicates and two treatments: control (0Mgha-1) and the technically recommended rate of gypsum application (5Mgha-1). Sugarcane stalk biomass and straw production were evaluated in plant cane and three ratoon crops. Soil samples were taken after evaluation of the third ratoon from seven layers (0–5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80 and 80–100cm) to determine organic carbon, TC, particulate carbon (PC) and bulk density. Gypsum increased TC by 5.4 and 4.4Mgha-1 in the 0–100 and 40–100cm layers respectively. The PC pool in the 40–100cm layer was increased by 18.4%, whereas the carbon stock associated with mineral increased by 6.8% with gypsum application. Of the total increase in C stocks resulting from gypsum application, 80% occurred in the 40–100cm layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3abiomass 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3acerrado 3agrowing season 3agypsum 3aratooning 3aroot systems 3asoil sampling 3astraw 3asugarcane 3atoxicity 3aBrazil 0acarbon pools 0aorganic carbon 0asoil microbial biomass 0atillage1 aFigueiredo, C.

The precipitation events are classified based on the consecutive days of precipitation into 1-to-3-, 4-to-7-, 8-to-14-, and over-14-day events. The contribution of 1-to-3-day events to climatological precipitation is larger than the other events over central Asia. Longer duration events contributed more than the shorter duration events to precipitation in tropical regions. The positive precipitation trend in northwestern and southern China is mainly due to 4-to-7-day and 8-to-14-day events, respectively; and the negative precipitation trend in North China is largely related to 4-to-7-day events. In general, the frequency change of precipitation events is a major reason for the precipitation change of these events in the concerned regions. The precipitation decrease in northern China around the mid-1960s is attributed to the reduction in 4-to-7-day events. The precipitation increase in northeastern and central China in the late 1970s is due to a combination of increases in 4-to-7-day and 8-to-14-day events. The precipitation increase in southern China around 1993 is mainly contributed by over-14-day events. The precipitation decrease in the mid-latitude Asia is due to the decrease in 4-to-7-day events. Most of the interdecadal precipitation changes are related to decrease or increase in the activity of anomalous cyclones. Results suggest that the frequency of occurrence of cyclonic perturbations is a major factor for interdecadal changes in summer precipitation over China.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFA0600603cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a41530425, 41775080 and 41721004cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aclimatology 3alatitude 3arain 3asummer 3aCentral Asia 3aChina1 aWu, Renguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4712-22511 aLiu, Ge1 aChai, Zhaoyang0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1493-1510dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03290-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245014800201300001600349500002000365520175000385592002802135596003002163596002002193650001502213650002702228650000902255650002202264651001202286700001702298700002202315700002302337700002102360773012702381856007402508852000902582655001202591IND60761453420221122190449.0211229e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076145342DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.134512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, Bede F.

Yet, ecosystem services and the associated benefits that they provide are rarely the motive for creating marine protected area (MPA). Therefore, many MPA monitoring projects do not explicitly study these functions and services or the underlying biological traits linked to them. LOCATION: Lyme Bay MPA, located in the SW of England, was established in 2008 to protect the reef biodiversity across a 206‐km² area, which includes rocky reef habitats, pebbly sand and soft muddy sediments. Mobile demersal fishing was excluded across the whole site to allow the recovery of the reef habitats. METHODS: Using a combination of towed underwater video and Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems changes in diversity (taxonomic and trait), and traits affected by mobile demersal fishing were assessed in Lyme Bay MPA over 10 years. RESULTS: There was a consistent increase in the number of taxa and the trait diversity they provide within the MPA as well as an increase in functional redundancy, which may increase community resilience to perturbations. Outside of the MPA there was an increase in the abundance of mobile species, while the MPA showed an increase in filter feeders. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The MPA showed a trend towards more diverse and potentially resilient rocky reef habitats. This study constitutes a novel MPA assessment using multiple sampling methods to encompass a wide range of taxa. It also reinforces the importance of effective MPA monitoring, which has demonstrated changes in trait diversity and trait composition driven by changes in taxonomic diversity.  aPublisher supplied data  a1388cEuropean Commission  cNatural England 3aecosystems 3amarine protected areas 3asand 3aspecies diversity 3aEngland1 aHolmes, Luke1 aBicknell, Anthony1 aAttrill, Martin J.1 aSheehan, Emma V.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2022 Jan., v. 28, no. 1 p.173-188dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.134513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01547naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245009500174300001800269500001900287520059700306592002800903650002800931650002500959650001700984700005501001773012101056856008301177852000901260655001201269IND60705889620221121193313.0200807e20200728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070588962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c021722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmehmadi, Yaseen A.12aA Mild Method for the Generation and Interception of 1,2-Cycloheptadienes with 1,3-Dipoles  ap. 6091-6095.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a1,2-Cycloheptadiene is a strained, transient species that has been underutilized as a synthetic building block. Seven-membered cyclic allenes are mostly known for their propensity to undergo rapid dimerization, and relatively little has been reported regarding their cycloaddition reactivity with 1,3-dienes or 1,3-dipoles. This work describes the trapping of 1-acetoxy-1,2-cycloheptadiene and its unsubstituted counterpart, generated via desilylative elimination, with a range of 1,3-dipolar trapping partners, affording complex polycyclic products with high regio- and diastereoselectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acycloaddition reactions 3adiastereoselectivity 3adimerization1 aWest, F.

Thus, changes in HWs under a warming climate have triggered extensive interests. In this study, the authors developed a new method to identify the HW events in China by double thresholds and further classified them into four categories (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, and extreme HWs) according to their magnitudes by using the daily maximum temperature data from 701 observation stations. On this basis, the spatiotemporal features of HWs with different severities in China from 1961 to 2015 were investigated. The results show that the high HW frequency mainly appears in Jianghuai, South China and western Northwest China. Moreover, the high frequencies of moderate, severe, and extreme HWs occur from June to August and reach the peak in July, while the mild HW frequency is compared from May to September. Since the 1960s, the frequencies of the mild, moderate, severe, and extreme HWs in China have increased significantly with rates of 7.5, 4.3, 1.4, and 1.8 events per year, respectively. The increases are the greatest in July for the moderate, severe, and extreme HWs while comparable during May to September for the mild HW. Besides, an interdecadal change is found to occur in the late 1990s. Compared with the former period (1961–1996), the occurrence of the extreme HWs during the latter period (1997–2015) has increased most significantly in eastern Northwest China and North China, while the frequency of the mild HWs increases most significantly in Jianghuai and South China.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFA0606301cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2016YFA0600701cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a41675069cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a41991280cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3aecosystems 3aheat 3ahumans 3atemperature 3aChina1 aZhou, Botao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5995-23781 aYou, Qinglong1 aZhang, Yuqing1 aUllah, Safi0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1529-1540dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03285-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011000171300001600281500001500297520149800312592002801810650002301838650002301861650001501884650002201899650001001921650002501931650002201956650001701978650001601995650001302011650001302024650001402037650001602051650001602067650002302083650001402106650001602120650001402136650001702150650002502167650002002192651001302212653001602225700002602241700001902267773009102286856008602377852000902463655001202472IND60084614220221118075506.0141101e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008461422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2011.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatima, Kaneez10aDevelopment of robust in vitro serine protease assay based on recombinant Pakistani HCV NS3–4A protease  ap. 230-237.  a2019-12-06  aHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious cause of chronic liver disease worldwide with more than 170 million infected individuals at risk of developing significant morbidity and mortality. Current interferon-based therapies are suboptimal especially in patients infected with HCV genotype 3 (predominant genotype in Pakistan) and they are poorly tolerated, highlighting the requirement of new therapeutics. HCV non-structural protein-3 (NS3) protease and helicase domains are essential for viral replication; they are highly conserved among various HCV strains. In the current study, we enrolled 56 HCV infected patients from various regions of Pakistan and determined their genotypes, ALT level and virus titer. We have cloned and sequenced NS3/NS4A from 4 of the HCV Serum samples. Nucleotide sequence alignment showed high level of identities among 3a genotypes. One of the samples (NCVI 01) showed unique amino acids substitutions, including R9Q, L332P, L354I, I605V and S622C. Three dimensional structures were determined and analyzed effect of substitutions on amino acids interactions. We further established fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based assays for detecting proteolytic activity of (NS3–4A) serine protease, using AnaSpec peptide, for high throughput screening (HTS) inhibitors against HCV. In future, this study could be of great interest in the development of HCV NS3 cell-based HTS FRET assay for genotype 3a and subsequent antiviral testing of drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3asequence alignment 3aviral load 3avirus replication 3adrugs 3aalanine transaminase 3aHepatitis C virus 3afluorescence 3aamino acids 3agenotype 3apatients 3ascreening 3ahepatitis C 3ablood serum 3aserine proteinases 3amorbidity 3aproteolysis 3amortality 3atherapeutics 3anucleotide sequences 3aenergy transfer 3aPakistan 0arisk groups1 aṬāhir, Muḥammad,1 aQadri, Ishtiaq0 tVirus research.g2011 Sept., v. 160, no. 1-2 p.230-237dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2011.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005500154245013600209300001600345520189700361592002802258650001902286650001302305650001302318650002502331650001502356650001002371650002202381650001502403650001902418650001602437650001002453650001202463650002302475650001602498650001702514650002302531650001302554650001302567651001002580653002102590653002502611653002002636653001002656653001902666700001502685700001402700773009502714856008902809852000902898655001202907IND60541720020221119112133.0190401e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054172002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7064-269610aDeterminants of cropland abandonment at the parcel, household and village levels in mountain areas of China: A multi-level analysis  ap. 186-192.  aCropland abandonment accompanying economic development has been observed worldwide. China has experienced a large amount of land abandonment in recent years. However, the reasons for it are not entirely clear. Although abandonment decisions are made by individual households, the underlying conditions reflect processes operating at multiple levels. Therefore, we aimed to detect the influences on land abandonment at the parcel, household and village levels. We developed and employed a multi-level statistical model using farm household survey data and geographical maps of Wulong County. Our model revealed that of the variance in occurrence of land parcel abandonment, 7% and 13% can be explained at the household and village levels, respectively, while the remnant 80% can be explained at the land parcel features itself. We found that land abandonment is more prone to occur on parcels that are on steep slopes, have poor quality soil, or are remote from the laborers’ residences. Households with less agricultural labor per unit land area showed a high probability of land abandonment. We also found a nonlinear influence of labor age on land abandonment, with households comprising middle-aged laborers having a low land abandonment probability. Parcels in villages with high elevation, far from the county administrative center or with low prevalence of leased land are inclined to abandonment. We also found, surprisingly, that the household proportion of males among its agricultural laborers did not significantly influence the occurrence of land abandonment at the parcel level, probably due to the male agricultural laborers being overwhelmingly old (average age greater than 56 years). To alleviate land abandonment, we suggest improving land tenure and transfer security to ensure stable access to the land rental market, and also improving infrastructure in remote regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3aaltitude 3acropland 3aeconomic development 3afarm labor 3afarms 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3ainfrastructure 3aland tenure 3amales 3amarkets 3amiddle-aged adults 3aprobability 3asoil quality 3astatistical models 3avariance 3avillages 3aChina 0aLand abandonment 0aMulti-level analysis 0aLabor migration 0aChina 0aMountain areas1 aLi, Xiubin1 aSong, Wei0 tLand use policy.g2014 Nov., v. 41 p.186-192dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001900162245011800181300001600299500000900315520144400324592002801768650002001796650002601816650001201842650001201854650001501866650000901881650001201890650001001902650001601912650001801928650002801946650001101974650001901985650000802004650002202012650001502034650002102049650001402070700001802084700001902102700001702121700001802138773012202156856009602278852000902374655001202383IND60663313320221120200009.0191122e196811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066331332DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1968.00021962006000060013x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlton, A.

Maximum accumulation of dry matter and crude protein occurred between 2 and 45% bloom for alfalfa and at 100% bloom for sainfoin on irrigated land. Dry matter and crude protein yield trends for both crops were similar on irrigated land and dryland. The maximum dry matter and crude protein contents for both sainfoin and alfalfa occurred at about the same calendar date on dryland but at different dates under irrigation. Decreases in the percentage of crude protein were similar in both species with time. At all sampling dates crude protein percentage of alfalfa was greater than for sainfoin. At similar stages of maturity alfalfa was consistently higher than sainfoin in crude protein, ash, calcium, and crude fiber; and with few exceptions it was lower in nitrogen-free extract, total digestible nutrients, and P. At the point of maximum yield for each species (10% bloom for alfalfa, 100% bloom for sainfoin) crude fiber and total digestible nutrient content was similar, but alfalfa contained 6% more protein and 9 to 10% less nitrogen-free extract than sainfoin. We concluded that sainfoin hay would supply adequate protein to meet the needs of beef animals, and that it would supply total available energy equal or superior to that of alfalfa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aOnobrychis viciifolia 3aalfalfa 3aanimals 3aarid lands 3abeef 3acalcium 3acrops 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3adry matter accumulation 3aenergy 3aforage quality 3ahay 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3anutrient content 3anutrients1 aCooper, C.

Experimentation in this field has been limited by the difficulty in investigating root elongation, since no nondestructive in situ method was available other than glass-sided boxes. The purpose of this study was to show that the neutron radiography is capable of supplying in situ root images permitting qualitative and quantitative interpretation so that comparative root and shoot growth may now be analyzed in a new way. The experiments consisted of shoot and root growth studies up to 21 days for two corn seeds sown at depths of 1 and 6 cm. The plants were grown in a growth chamber in a 2-cm-thick aluminum box containing coarse sand maintained at 8% volumetric water content. Daily neutron radiographs were made by the direct method using the 3.2° diverging thermal neutron beam of the MIRENE reactor at Valduc, France. The images obtained allowed a qualitative interpretation not only for seminal root but also for laterals. Root development was not harmed visibly by irradiation and repeated environmental changes due to neutron radiography experiments. The seminal root elongation rate was analysed vs. the plant age. Quantitative data show that the root growth was greater during the day than at night. Root and shoot lengths were related in a linear manner between 7 and 15 days after sowing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aaluminum 3acorn 3agrowth chambers 3airradiation 3aneutrons 3anondestructive methods 3aplant age 3aradiography 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asand 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asowing 3avolumetric water content 3aFrance1 aMoutonnet, P.1 aHouelle, M.1 aPicard, D.0 tAgronomy journal.g1980 Mar., v. 72, no. 2 p.321-324dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200020017x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011600169520154400285592002801829650001601857650001201873650001301885650001201898650001301910650001401923650001101937650002701948650001501975650001501990653002102005653002902026653002002055653002102075700002002096700001702116700001702133700001902150700001702169700002202186700001802208773011302226856008602339852000902425655001202434IND60688424020221117222335.0200523e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068842402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1215322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xinxing10aEffects of biochar on the chemical changes and phase separation of bio-asphalt under different aging conditions  aBio-asphalt replaced petroleum-asphalt for paving asphalt pavements, which is a technology with a wide range of application prospect. This work is aimed at improving the performance of aged bio-oil modified asphalt (bio-asphalt) for use in road pavement construction. Biochar and bio-oil are renewable resources and use in this research that are pyrolyzed from waste wood. The effects of different aging conditions on biochar-modified bio-asphalt and ordinary bio-asphalt were investigated in terms of their chemical functional groups, molecular formulas, radius distribution functions, rheological parameters, and phase separation. The aging conditions considered in this research are short-term aging, ultraviolet (UV) aging, pressure aging vessel (PAV), and low-temperature hardening. Biochar plays a significant role in the UV aging process. This study found that, with an increase in biochar modification, the alkyl group numbers increased and the sulfoxide and carbonyl numbers decreased during the aging process of bio-asphalt. It also shows that the inclusion of biochar improved the aging resistance of the bio-asphalt, but that biochar modification did not affect the bio-asphalt’s low-temperature hardening performance. Four asphalt components were studied: saturates, asphaltenes, resins, and aromatics (SARA). The effects of biochar on saturates and aromatics were significant, and the biochar was able to adsorb these components. This study also found that, with an increase in UV aging and PAV, the phase separation grows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphaltenes 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abitumen 3amoieties 3apavements 3aresins 3arheological properties 3aseparation 3awaste wood 0aAging properties 0aBio-oil modified asphalt 0aChemical change 0aPhase separation1 aZhao, Guangyuan1 aWu, Shaopeng1 aTighe, Susan1 aPickel, Daniel1 aChen, Meizhu1 aAdhikari, Sanjeev1 aGao, Yangming0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.121532-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1215323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01249naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245004600168300001600214520033700230592002800567650001600595650002800611650001800639650001200657650001500669650001800684700002300702773009400725856008400819990002300903852000900926655001200935IND60094775320221120060730.0141104e20120814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009477532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2012.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharif, Bedra10aWound Healing: GTPases Flux Their Muscles  ap. 236-238.  aActomyosin rings are transient organelles that execute cytokinesis, morphogenesis, and wound healing.

The TGA results showed that the conversion rate increased and the activation energy (ranged from 53.29 to 58.25 kJ/mol) decreased with a decrease in particle size. The experiments demonstrated that fuel gas yield (from 0.76 to 0.82 Nm³/kg at 900 °C) increased with a decrease in particle size while char and tar yield decreased. Smaller particle sizes resulted in higher H₂ (25.68%) and CO (27.36%) contents. Minimizing the size of raw materials is an alternative method to improve the gas quality of TR pyrolysis. The increase of gas yield was attributed to the decomposition of char and tar vapor as temperature increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3aparticle size 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atobacco 3avapors 0aPyrolysis 0aparticle size 0akinetic 0atobacco rob 0abiofuels1 aChen, Xun1 aWang, Dundun1 aCheng, Gang1 aLv, Dangzhen0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2019 Apr. 9, v. 16, no. 5 p.378-385dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2181x1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2019.15726083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245009700167520194000264592002802204650002102232650002802253650001602281650002102297650001502318650001702333650001102350650002902361650001702390650001702407650001902424650001102443650001502454700002102469700002102490700001902511773012702530856007402657852000902731655001202740IND60652776320221119180312.0190713e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065277632DNAL7 a10.3390/su110204142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMensah-Darkwa, Kwadwo 10aSupercapacitor Energy Storage Device Using Biowastes: A Sustainable Approach to Green Energy  aThe demand for renewable energy sources worldwide has gained tremendous research attention over the past decades. Technologies such as wind and solar have been widely researched and reported in the literature. However, economical use of these technologies has not been widespread due partly to cost and the inability for service during of-source periods. To make these technologies more competitive, research into energy storage systems has intensified over the last few decades. The idea is to devise an energy storage system that allows for storage of electricity during lean hours at a relatively cheaper value and delivery later. Energy storage and delivery technologies such as supercapacitors can store and deliver energy at a very fast rate, offering high current in a short duration. The past decade has witnessed a rapid growth in research and development in supercapacitor technology. Several electrochemical properties of the electrode material and electrolyte have been reported in the literature. Supercapacitor electrode materials such as carbon and carbon-based materials have received increasing attention because of their high specific surface area, good electrical conductivity and excellent stability in harsh environments etc. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in biomass-derived activated carbons as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The development of an alternative supercapacitor electrode material from biowaste serves two main purposes: (1) It helps with waste disposal; converting waste to a useful product, and (2) it provides an economic argument for the substantiality of supercapacitor technology. This article reviews recent developments in carbon and carbon-based materials derived from biowaste for supercapacitor technology. A comparison between the various storage mechanisms and electrochemical performance of electrodes derived from biowaste is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectricity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aresearch and development 3asolar energy 3asurface area 3awaste disposal 3awastes 3awind power1 aZequine, Camila 1 aKahol, Pawan  K.1 aGupta, Ram K.,0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011400173300001800287520144900305592002801754650001601782650001801798650001401816650002101830650001301851650002101864650001801885650000901903650001601912650002201928650001301950650003001963650001101993650002002004650001302024650001502037650002202052650004002074650001302114651001002127653002102137653002302158653001302181653001202194653001002206653002702216700001902243700001802262700003002280773013402310856008702444852000902531655001202540IND60568954520221118143016.0170522e20151106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056895452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b006572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Bodhisattwa10aMining Novel Allergens from Coconut Pollen Employing Manual De Novo Sequencing and Homology-Driven Proteomics  ap. 4823-4833.  aCoconut pollen, one of the major palm pollen grains is an important constituent among vectors of inhalant allergens in India and a major sensitizer for respiratory allergy in susceptible patients. To gain insight into its allergenic components, pollen proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, immunoblotted with coconut pollen sensitive patient sera, followed by mass spectrometry of IgE reactive proteins. Coconut being largely unsequenced, a proteomic workflow has been devised that combines the conventional database-dependent analysis of tandem mass spectral data and manual de novo sequencing followed by a homology-based search for identifying the allergenic proteins. N-terminal acetylation helped to distinguish “b” ions from others, facilitating reliable sequencing. This led to the identification of 12 allergenic proteins. Cluster analysis with individual patient sera recognized vicilin-like protein as a major allergen, which was purified to assess its in vitro allergenicity and then partially sequenced. Other IgE-sensitive spots showed significant homology with well-known allergenic proteins such as 11S globulin, enolase, and isoflavone reductase along with a few which are reported as novel allergens. The allergens identified can be used as potential candidates to develop hypoallergenic vaccines, to design specific immunotherapy trials, and to enrich the repertoire of existing IgE reactive proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylation 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3acluster analysis 3acoconuts 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunotherapy 3aions 3aisoflavones 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3apollen 3apollen proteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aspectral analysis 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3avaccines 3aIndia 0apollen allergens 0ade novo sequencing 0aMS BLAST 0avicilin 0aMALDI 0a2D gel electrophoresis1 aSircar, Gaurab1 aPandey, Naren1 aGupta Bhattacharya, Swati0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 Nov. 06, v. 14, no. 11 p.4823-4833dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b006573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245006000157300001600217520111200233592002801345650001701373650001501390650001101405650001401416650001701430650001901447650001101466650001501477650000901492650001201501650002401513650001101537650001201548700001501560700001301575773015001588856007701738852000901815655001201824IND60521236420221119153832.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052123642DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1964-07072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, H.10aLösliche und virusgebundene Adenovirus Hämagglutinine  ap. 587-592.  aPrototype adenoviruses and their hemagglutinins of ROSEN'S ¹ group II were studied by adsorption to rat and human red blood cells and by straight and cesium chloride density gradient ultracentrifugation.

During the present study the solid sludge and plants were collected from seven Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) viz. Howrah, Garulia, Bhatpara, Nabadwip, Srirampur, Kona, Chandannager, and from the Periurban areas viz. Nadia/Chakdaha/Ektapur (N/C/E), Pumlia (N/C/P), Sikarpur (N/C/S), Tatla (N/C/T). Around 6–10 individual samples were mixed together and one average sample was compiled for analysis. Comparative study of heavy metals concentration in the roots and shoots of Pudina (Mentha spicata) and Onion (Allium cepa) showed their high heavy metals scavenging capacity. The concentration of Cd, Pb, Cr, and Ni in the roots of pudina (Mentha spicata) and Allium cepa (onion), at STP ranged from 0.833 to 1.88, 6.84 to 7.96, 25.3 to 21.56, and <0.05 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. The concentration of Cd, Pb, Cr, and Ni in the shoots of plants at STPs ranged from 0.43 to 1.96, 6.20 to 32.6, 26.7 to 24.43, and <0.05 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. Therefore, above-mentioned plant species may be selected according to their scavenging capacity for heavy metals from soils and sludges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aMentha spicata 3acomparative study 3aheavy metals 3aonions 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3asoil 0aPhytoremediation 0aSewage1 aMandal, Biswapati1 aDwivedi, Padmanabh0 tMedicinal Plants.g2011 Dec., v. 3, no. 4 p.315-318dSociety for Conservation and Resource Development of Medicinal PlantswJournal:2108x0975-68927nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008400156300001800240520104800258592002801306650001101334650001901345650001201364650001901376773009901395856007501494852000901569655001201578IND60576920620221119134946.0170806e20140318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057692062DNAL7 a10.1021/la404518q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Weiqing10aWetting Transition on Patterned Surfaces: Transition States and Energy Barriers  ap. 2879-2885.  aWe study the wetting transition on microstructured hydrophobic surfaces. We use the string method [J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126, 164103; J. Chem. Phys. 2013, 138, 134105] to accurately compute the transition states, the energy barriers, and the minimum energy paths for the wetting transition from the Cassie–Baxter state to the Wenzel state. Numerical results are obtained for the wetting of a hydrophobic surface textured with a square lattice of pillars. It is found that the wetting of the solid substrate occurs via infiltration of the liquid in a single groove, followed by lateral propagation of the liquid front. The propagation of the liquid front proceeds in a stepwise manner, and a zipping mechanism is observed during the infiltration of each layer. The minimum energy path for the wetting transition goes through a sequence of intermediate metastable states, whose wetted areas reflect the microstructure of the patterned surface. We also study the dependence of the energy barrier on the drop size and the gap between the pillars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amicrostructure0 tLangmuir.g2014 Mar. 18, v. 30, no. 10 p.2879-2885dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla404518q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007000171300002000241500001100261520167900272592002801951596005401979650002502033650001502058650001202073650002102085650000902106650001502115650001402130650001802144650001202162650001502174650002002189650000902209650001402218650002902232650001302261650001502274650002502289700002102314700002402335700001802359700006202377773015502439856008302594852000902677655001202686IND60747258220221122231056.0220208e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074725822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14989-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, Faiz Ahmad10aImproving the feasibility of aquaculture feed by using microalgae  ap. 43234-43257.  aReview  aThe aquaculture industry is an efficient edible protein producer and grows faster than any other food sector. Therefore, it requires enormous amounts of fish feed. Fish feed directly affects the quality of produced fish, potential health benefits, and cost. Fish meal (FM), fis oil (FO), and plant-based supplements, predominantly used in fish feed, face challenges of low availability, low nutritional value, and high cost. The cost associated with aquaculture feed represents 40–75% of aquaculture production cost and one of the key market drivers for the thriving aquaculture industry. Microalgae are a primary producer in aquatic food chains. Microalgae are expanding continuously in renewable energy, pharmaceutical pigment, wastewater treatment, food, and feed industries. Major components of microalgal biomass are proteins with essential amino acids, lipids with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), carbohydrates, pigments, and other bioactive compounds. Thus, microalgae can be used as an essential, viable, and alternative feed ingredient in aquaculture feed. In recent times, live algae culture, whole algae, and lipid-extracted algae (LEA) have been tested in fish feed for growth, physiological activity, and nutritional value. The present review discusses the potential application of microalgae in aquaculture feed, its mode of application, nutritional value, and possible replacement of conventional feed ingredients, and disadvantages of plant-based feed. The review also focuses on integrated processes such as algae cultivation in aquaculture wastewater, aquaponics systems, challenges, and future prospects of using microalgae in the aquafeed industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aTBS13-00019-OCcTechnology Innovation Agency (ZA) 3aaquaculture industry 3aaquaponics 3abiomass 3afeed composition 3afish 3afish feeds 3afish meal 3afood industry 3amarkets 3amicroalgae 3anutritive value 3aoils 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3aresearch 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aGuldhe, Abhishek1 aGupta, Sanjay Kumar1 aRawat, Ismail1 aBux, F.q(Faizel),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8108-02380 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 32 p.43234-43257dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14989-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009700170520196100267592002802228650002302256650001202279650001702291650002402308650002502332650002502357650004102382650003502423650001402458650001802472650001602490650002502506653002602531653004102557653003702598700001802635700001202653700002102665773011302686856008602799852000902885655001202894IND60688420520221117222356.0200601e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068842052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiaoyan10aIncorporating uncertainty into life-cycle sustainability assessment of pavement alternatives  aCurrent life-cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) methodology for pavement alternatives is deterministic, which generally reduces the reliability of the results. This study proposed an uncertainty-based LCSA framework for pavement alternatives to capture the uncertainties associated with economic, environmental, and social pillars during the life cycle. After identifying and characterizing the uncertainties, the probabilistic LCSA results associated with eight impact categories were obtained using Monte Carlo simulation. Subsequently, an improved multi-criteria decision-making approach was presented to unify the random outcomes of the eight impact categories, where the probabilistic integrated sustainability degrees (ISDs) were obtained to represent the sustainability level for the alternatives. Meanwhile, the probability of being best option for each alternative was obtained. A case study was applied to perform the uncertainty analysis of LCSA including hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavement, warm mix asphalt (WMA) pavement, and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). The results showed the economic performance of RAP alternative was significantly less than that of HMA and WMA alternatives at confidence levels of 97% and 99%, respectively. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences among three alternatives with respect to relevant environmental impact categories. Three pavement alternatives denoted positive social impacts with 95% confidence interval. In addition, the satisfactory ISD was obtained for RAP alternative with 95% confidence interval, while RAP alternative was selected as the best option with a high probability of 91.71%. In addition, it was found that the ISDs were sensitive to the economic and social weights in the case study. This study extends the existing pavement LCSA framework by capturing the multivariate potential uncertainties, and thus represents a valuable, reliable tool for decision makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abitumen 3acase studies 3aconfidence interval 3aeconomic performance 3aenvironmental impact 3alife cycle sustainability assessment 3amulti-criteria decision making 3apavements 3asocial impact 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aPavement alternatives 0aLife-cycle sustainability assessment 0aIntegrated sustainability degree1 aEasa, Said M.1 aJi, Tao1 aJiang, Zhenliang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 264 p.121466-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01456naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011200161300001800273520045900291592002800750650002700778650003100805650001400836650001600850650001700866650000900883700001900892773011700911856008201028990002301110852000901133655001201142IND60091056220221121230413.0141103e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009105622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Li10aDesign, synthesis, and evaluation of a novel class of 2,3-disubstituted-tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives  ap. 3718-3722.  aSeveral novel tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives with amino acid residues at the 2-position and a glucosamine group at the 3-position of the tetrahydro-β-carboline nucleus were synthesized from a readily available starting material, tryptophane, and were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity in the present study.

Daily minimum and maximum temperature data retrieved from MPI-ESM-LR and ACCESS1-0 global climate model were used to predict future climate extreme events over the next three periods of 2026–2050, 2051–2075, and 2076–2100 based on IPCC scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 of studied area covering South Khorasan province and southern part of Razavi Khorasan province, located in east of Iran; furthermore, future saffron yield was predicted based on the yield-extreme indices model. Results showed an increasing trend of warm climate extreme indices and a decreasing trend in precipitation indices as important factors in the decrease of saffron yield. Considering multiple regression yield model of saffron based on climate extreme indices, it was concluded that saffron yield decreases in future periods over studied area with the highest reduction of 31% in period of 2076–2100 under RCP8.5 scenario. Results also confirmed that yield reduction in all three periods under RCP8.5 scenario was greater than the same periods under RCP 4.5 scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3acomputer software 3aregression analysis 3asaffron 3atemperature 3aIran1 aMousavi Baygi, Mohamad1 aBabaeian, Iman1 aKhashei-Siuki, Abbas0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1109-1118dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03241-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002100162245007500183300001600258500000900274520074800283592002801031650002101059650002301080650001101103650002301114650000901137773012301146856009601269852000901365655001201374IND60663310620221120200005.0191122e196909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066331062DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1969.00021962006100050016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodhouse, W.

There was a positive relationship between N/S ratio and rate of applied N with N/S at the higher rates of N substantially exceeding the presently considered normal value of 12–17. Many of the N/S values were also well above that considered optimum for ruminant nutrition, suggesting that high N/S is a possible factor in some cases of poor animal performance on this forage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aanimal performance 3aforage 3aruminant nutrition 3asand0 tAgronomy journal.g1969 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.705-708dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1969.00021962006100050016x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008900208300001800297500001900315520203900334592002802373650001902401650001602420650000902436650002102445650001602466650000902482650001602491651000902507700002202516700002002538700001802558700001902576700001902595773013502614856008202749852000902831655001202840IND60701844120221118184435.0200716e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070184412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-020-03269-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathian, Farshad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8205-378710aAssessment of changes in climate extremes of temperature and precipitation over Iran  ap. 1119-1133.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntense industrial activity has led to an increase in greenhouse gas concentration in the Earth’s atmosphere over the past few decades, whereby the climate change phenomenon has been recognized. Increasing greenhouse gases have been changing patterns and trends of extreme climate variables that are of great importance in agriculture, water resources, and environmental hazards. In the present study, the changes and trends in climate extremes of temperature and precipitation were evaluated based on various extreme-related indices over Iran. For this purpose, both daily temperature and precipitation data of 76 synoptic stations were selected for trend analysis throughout Iran during the period 1981–2010. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen’s slope estimator are used to investigate the trends in the selected data sets. The results of 11 extreme temperature-related indices showed, in general, warm indices such as the number of warm days (TX90p), warm nights (TN90p), and warm spell duration (WSDI) had an increasing trend whereas trends in cold indices such as the number of cool days (TX10p), cool nights (TN10p), and cold spell duration (CSDI) decreased. The monthly maximum value of daily maximum (TXx) and minimum (TNx) temperatures increased by 0.3 and 0.4 °C/decade on average, respectively; and the monthly minimum value of daily maximum (TXn) and minimum (TNn) temperatures increased by 0.1 and 0.3 °C/decade, respectively, on average during the study period. In the case of the extreme precipitation-related indices, the results indicated both a decreasing trend in precipitation amount and intensity, and an increasing trend in the number of consecutive dry days (CDD) at most of the selected stations. Surveys demonstrated that the western, northern, and northwestern regions of Iran were most affected by the risk of climate extremes. Thus, these extreme changes will make people more vulnerable to natural hazards and make proper management in the face of climate crises more necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3acold 3agreenhouse gases 3agreenhouses 3arisk 3atemperature 3aIran1 aGhadami, Mohammad1 aHaghighi, Parsa1 aAmini, Mohsen1 aNaderi, Sohrab1 aGhaedi, Zeinab0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1119-1133dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03269-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010900171300001600280520188500296592002802181650001602209650002202225650001202247650001802259650002002277650001102297650001002308650001402318650001602332650001002348650003102358650001202389653001102401653002402412653002602436653001402462653001902476653002302495700002002518700002502538773012602563856008602689852000902775655001202784IND60632625320221120035818.0190315e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063262532DNAL7 a10.1080/1745039X.2019.15756562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerlach, Katrin10aEffects of ethyl ester supplementation to forage on short-term dry matter intake and preference by goats  ap. 127-139.  aIn whole-crop maize silages with atypical smell and decreased acceptance by ruminants, high concentrations of the volatile organic compounds ethyl acetate (EA) and ethyl lactate (EL) were detected. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different concentrations of ethyl esters added to forage on preference and short-term feed intake of goats. In the first of three trials, whole-crop maize silage was supplemented with different concentrations of EA and EL and then vacuum-stored before use. Forages sampled during the preference trial showed a good recovery of EL with a high accordance of target (naturally formed + supplemented) and analysed concentrations. Supplemented EA was not recovered, making transient storage of substrates before use in feeding trials equivocal. However, four treatments with different concentrations of EL (approximately 330, 560, 920 and 1300 mg/kg dry matter (DM)) were used for the preference trial. In Trials 2 and 3, EA and EL (with and without ethanol, respectively) were added to grass hay directly before offering the feed, each in concentrations of 0, 600 and 1200 mg/kg DM to have six treatments each. In all trials, each possible combination of treatments was offered to Saanen-type wethers (n = 10, Trial 1; n = 5, Trials 2 and 3) as free choice in preference trials. In Trial 1, there was only a weak impact of EL on preference behaviour as goats avoided medium EL concentrations, but did not avoid silages with higher concentrations. In Trials 2 and 3, there was no influence of added volatiles on short-term DM intake and preference at all. It can be concluded that it is unlikely that ethyl esters as single substance or in combination with ethanol affect preference behaviour and feed intake of ruminants. Possibly a combination or still unidentified fermentation products cause avoidance instead of a single compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn silage 3adry matter intake 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afermented foods 3aforage 3agoats 3agrass hay 3alactic acid 3asmell 3avolatile organic compounds 3awethers 0aEsters 0afeeding preferences 0afermentation products 0aruminants 0asilage quality 0avolatile compounds1 aWeiss, Kirsten,1 aSüdekum, Karl-Heinz0 tArchives of animal nutrition.g2019 Mar. 4, v. 73, no. 2 p.127-139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000052x1477-28177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1745039X.2019.15756563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245008000127300001400207520139300221592002801614650001001642650002601652650001401678650001201692650001801704650001601722650001801738650001101756650001301767650000901780650001601789650001001805650001501815653002101830653001901851700002001870773011401890852000902004655001202013IND60717012820221118114943.0201107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071701282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, S.

The global use of agricultural plastic mulches has emerged as a widespread soil management practice due to its apparent economic benefits, especially in the dry croplands of China. However, the integrated effects of plastic mulching in China’s drylands on net primary productivity (NPP) of staple crops (i.e. maize, wheat, and potato), SOC stocks, and C emissions have rarely been assessed quantitatively. We conducted a meta‒analysis of nationwide dataset and found that compared with traditional non‒mulching farming, plastic mulching on average increased national aboveground NPP by 1.41 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹, while it led to rising soil CO₂ emissions (437 kg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ higher than non‒mulching) because of stimulated microbial metabolism, such as higher microbial biomass C and extracellular enzyme activities. Critically, plastic mulching not only enhanced crop‒sourced C inputs into the soil by 0.24 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ through improving belowground NPP, but also facilitated soil CH₄ absorption by 0.25 kg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹ across the entire dataset. As a result, a significant increase in SOC storage under plastic mulching was estimated as 0.012 Mg C ha⁻¹ y⁻¹, and crop types, N input, and precipitation seems to be the strongest predictors explaining variability in mulching‒driven SOC sequestration. These results suggest that plastic mulching in dry agroecosystems can have a distinct potential to curtail the anthropogenic emissions of C through significant increases in both SOC sequestration and crop C fixation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aagricultural plastics 3aagricultural soils 3aagroecosystems 3aarid lands 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn 3acropland 3adata collection 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3afarming systems 3afinancial economics 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolism 3amethane 3amicrobial biomass 3anet primary productivity 3aplastic film mulches 3apotatoes 3asoil organic carbon 3astaple crops 3awheat 3aChina 0aSoil carbon fluxes 0aPlastic mulching 0aDry croplands1 aYu, Kai-Liang1 aCrowther, Thomas W.1 aWang, Jian-Yong1 aZhao, Hong1 aXiong, You-Cai1 aLiao, Yun-Cheng0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.121470-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007100139245009600210300001600306500002000322520139000342592002801732650001501760650001901775650001001794650001501804650002201819650001001841650001001851650006601861650000901927650001901936650001001955650000901965650002301974650001101997650002202008650001102030700002302041700002802064700002302092700001802115700002002133700002102153700002202174700002902196700002102225700006102246700002302307773013202330856007402462852000902536655001202545IND60761451320221120173010.0211229e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076145132DNAL7 a10.1111/jam.152102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDell’Annunziata, Federica1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1654-850010aPostmortem interval assessment by MALDI‐TOF mass spectrometry analysis in murine cadavers  ap. 707-714.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: This study assessed the use of matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI‐TOF) mass spectrometry as an alternative method to identify species associated with the thanatomicrobiota and epinecrotic communities. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted on 10 murine cadavers, and microbiological swabs were collected from five external anatomical sites (eyes, ears, nose, mouth and rectum) and four internal organs (brain, spleen, liver, heart), during 16 and 30 days, for the thanatomicrobiota and epinecrotic communities, respectively. Our results revealed that the postmortem microbiota associated with the external cavities showed changes over time and reduced taxonomic diversity. The internal organs, initially sterile, showed signs of microbial invasion at 3 and 10 days postmortem for the liver‐spleen and heart‐brain, respectively. The postmortem microbiota was mainly dominated by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: MALDI‐TOF is a promising method for estimating postmortem interval (PMI), associated with rapid sample handling, good reproducibility and high productivity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study investigated microbial changes during the decomposition process and proposed a simple strategy for PMI estimation.

In total, 450 1-d-old male chicks were allotted into five groups in six replicates of 15 chicks each. Dietary treatments included: a control, control plus 500 or 1000 mg MEER per kg diet (MEER₅₀₀ and MEER₁₀₀₀) and control plus 500 or 1000 mg HEER per kg diet (HEER₅₀₀ and HEER₁₀₀₀). Broiler performance was not affected by dietary treatments during the starter and grower periods. However, in the finisher (25–42 d) and entire (1–42 d) periods, an increase in body weight gain and a corresponding decrease in feed conversion ratio was noticed when birds received Diets MEER₁₀₀₀ or HEER₁₀₀₀. Also, considering the entire trial, the growth-promoting action of MEER was found to be greater than HEER. When compared with the control, AID of dry matter, organic matter, ether extract (EE) and gross energy (GE) were increased by all treatments, while the AID of EE and GE were also improved by increased extract level. Additionally, HEER groups had significantly increased AID of crude protein. The counts of Escherichia coli and Clostridium spp. were suppressed while the number of Lactobacillus spp. increased in response to an elevated extract level. Meanwhile, the ileum of MEER groups contained lower numbers of Clostridium spp. and greater numbers of Lactobacillus spp. when compared with HEER groups. The duodenal and jejunal structures were not associated with dietary treatments. However, a decreased ileal crypt depth and an increased villus to crypt ratio were observed with addition of extracts, which was more intense with MEER. A lower malondialdehyde content and a higher activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were detected in duodenal and jejunal mucosa with increased extract level, and in jejunum, the antioxidant capability of MEER was found to be stronger than HEER. The antioxidant properties of the ileal mucosa were also improved in response to MEER, which was not observed after HEER inclusion. Overall, MEER seems to be a better choice of treatment owing to its more effective benefits on broiler performance, ileal microbiota, gut morphology and antioxidant ability of the intestinal mucosa.  aThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data  cnot receive any specific grant 3aClostridium 3aEscherichia coli 3aInula helenium 3aLactobacillus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3acarcass characteristics 3acatalase 3achicks 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3ahexane 3aileum 3aintestinal mucosa 3ajejunum 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amethanol 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3arhizomes 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avilli 0aAntioxidant status 0abroiler chicken 0adigestibility 0aelecampane extract 0agrowth performance 0agut microbiota 0aintestinal morphology1 aTabeidian, Sayed Ali1 aForoozandeh Shahraki, Amir Davar1 aTabatabaei, Sayed Nouredin1 aHabibian, Mahmood0 tArchives of animal nutrition.g2019 Mar. 4, v. 73, no. 2 p.88-110dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000052x1477-28177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1745039X.2019.15810273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245007000216300001600286520117100302592002801473650001301501650003001514650002701544650002001571650001401591650002901605650001901634700002201653700001501675700001601690700001601706700002301722773011001745856008401855990002301939852000901962655001201971IND60094776020221121041234.0141104e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009477602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2012.08.0032doi7 aPMC34708692pmcid7 a229401142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenry, Anastasia G.10aRegulation of Endocytic Clathrin Dynamics by Cargo Ubiquitination  ap. 519-532.  aSome endocytic cargoes control clathrin-coated pit (CCP) maturation, but it is not known how such regulation is communicated. We found that μ-opioid neuropeptide receptors signal to their enclosing CCPs by ubiquitination. Nonubiquitinated receptors delay CCPs at an intermediate stage of maturation, after clathrin lattice assembly is complete but before membrane scission. Receptor ubiquitination relieves this inhibition, effectively triggering CCP scission and producing a receptor-containing endocytic vesicle. The ubiquitin modification that conveys this endocytosis-promoting signal is added to the receptor’s first cytoplasmic loop, catalyzed by the Smurf2 ubiquitin ligase, and coordinated with activation-dependent receptor phosphorylation and clustering through Smurf2 recruitment by the endocytic adaptor beta-arrestin. Epsin1 detects the signal at the CCP and is required for ubiquitin-promoted scission. This cargo-to-coat communication system mediates a biochemical checkpoint that ensures appropriate receptor ubiquitination for later trafficking, and it controls specific receptor loading into CCPs by sensing when a sufficient quorum is reached.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclathrin 3acommunications technology 3aneuropeptide receptors 3aphosphorylation 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination1 aHislop, James N.1 aGrove, Joe1 aThorn, Kurt1 aMarsh, Mark1 avon Zastrow, Mark0 tDevelopmental cell.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 23, no. 3 p.519-532dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12082x1534-58077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2012.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245010400203500001900307520154000326592002801866650001501894650001301909650002401922650002801946650001501974650001201989653003202001653001202033653001502045653001802060653001902078653001002097700001202107773011402119856008402233852000902317655001202326IND60728383720221120061626.0210610e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072838372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1015752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Fanli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7149-455X10aAction, communication, and engagement: How parents “ACE” Children's pro-environmental behaviors  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aParents are important role models for directing children's learning toward pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs; Grønhøj & Thøgersen, 2017). However, how children learn from their parents about the environment is still relatively unexplored. The present study investigated the relationship by examining parents' and children's pro-environmental behaviors as well as parent-children interactions. A sample of 518 Chinese families (1036 participants total – one child and one primary caregiver in each family) from five Chinese cities participated in the study. Children and their parents filled out an online survey about their PEBs and interactions toward the environment separately. Overall PEBs and subcategories of PEBs were analyzed. It was found that the direct relationship between parents' and children's PEBs was fully mediated by children's perceptions of parental actions and marginally mediated by parent-child communication and parent-child engagement about protecting the environment, except in the subcategory of “Energy Conservation on AC/Heat/Air-Purifier.” The results revealed that parents' PEBs might not affect their children's PEBs unless these PEBs are directly observable by the children via discussing environmental issues, showing PEBs in front of their children, or engaging in pro-environmental activities with their children. Age and city differences between parents' and children's PEBs were explored. Implications were discussed regarding environmental education programs involving parents directly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaregivers 3achildren 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental education 3apsychology 3asurveys 0aPro-environmental behaviors 0aParents 0aEngagement 0aCommunication 0aParental norms 0aChina1 aYu, Hui0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2021 Apr., v. 74 p.101575-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.1015753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011800176300001800294500001900312520164200331592002801973650001202001650001902013650001602032650002002048650001602068651000902084700001802093700002202111700002502133773013502158856008202293852000902375655001202384IND60701844420221118184739.0200716e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070184442DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-020-03271-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaghanam, Aida Hosseini10aAssessing the impact of climate change over the northwest of Iran: an overview of statistical downscaling methods  ap. 1135-1150.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to the spatial-temporal inadequacy of large-scale general circulation models (GCMs), linking large-scale GCM data with small-scale local climatic data has found great interest. In this paper, in order to downscale minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation predictands, the performance of three statistical downscaling techniques including Long Ashton Research Station-Weather Generator (LARS-WG), statistical downscaling model (SDSM), and artificial neural network (ANN) was compared based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR5) in northwest Iran. For this purpose, a nonparametric test named Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation coefficient, and the root mean square error (RMSE) were utilized to assess the efficiency of downscaling models. To scrutinize the climate change impacts, periods of 1961–1990 and 1991–2005 were considered as the baseline and verification periods, respectively. The findings revealed the superior performance of the ANN model for minimum and maximum temperatures, while for precipitation predictand, the SDSM represented the best performance among the models. Simulation results for future temperature indicated an ascending trend as 0.1–1.3 °C, 0.3–1.7 °C, and 0.5–2.1 °C for LARS-WG, SDSM, and ANN techniques, respectively. On the other hand, simulation outputs for the precipitation indicated a descending trend of 10–30% in future precipitation of the region according to downscaling models under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) pessimistic scenario of Hadley Center Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3) GCM model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3aneural networks 3atemperature 3aIran1 aEslahi, Mehdi1 aSheikhbabaei, Ali1 aSeifi, Arshia Jedary0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1135-1150dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03271-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009500163300001800258520069600276592002800972650002601000650001601026650001401042650001601056650002101072650002501093650000901118700001301127700001801140700001701158700001601175700001701191773011701208856008201325990002301407852000901430655001201439IND60091056620221121230420.0141103e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009105662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hao10aSynthesis and biological evaluation of ticagrelor derivatives as novel antiplatelet agents  ap. 3598-3602.  aTicagrelor (1) is the first reversible P2Y12 receptor antagonist blocking adenine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation with rapid onset and offset of effects.

Substantial research has been conducted to estimate and map soil heavy metals in large areas using hyperspectral data and machine learning methods (such as neural network), however, lower estimation accuracy is often obtained. In order to improve the estimation accuracy, in this study, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) was combined with the particle swarm optimization (PSO), which led to an integrated PSO-BPNN method used to estimate the contents of soil heavy metals: Cd, Hg, and As. This study was conducted in Guangdong, China, based on the soil heavy metal contents and hyperspectral data collected from 90 soil samples. The prediction accuracies from BPNN and PSO-BPNN were compared using field observations. The results showed that, 1) the sample averages of Cd, Hg, and As were 0.174 mg/kg, 0.132 mg/kg, and 9.761 mg/kg, respectively, with the corresponding maximum values of 0.570 mg/kg, 0.310 mg/kg, and 68.600 mg/kg being higher than the environment baseline values; 2) the transformed and combined spectral variables had higher correlations with the contents of the soil heavy metals than the original spectral data; 3) PSO-BPNN significantly improved the estimation accuracy of the soil heavy metal contents, with the decrease in the mean relative error (MRE) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) by 68% to 71%, and 64% to 67%, respectively. This indicated that the PSO-BPNN provided great potential to estimate the soil heavy metal contents; and 4) with the PSO-BPNN, the Cd content could also be mapped using HuanJing-1A Hyperspectral Imager (HSI) data with a RRMSE value of 36%, implying that the PSO-BPNN method could be utilized to map the heavy metal content in soil, using both field spectral data and hyperspectral imagery for the large area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aarsenic 3aartificial intelligence 3acadmium 3adata collection 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amercury 3anormal values 3aprediction 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aChina1 aLiu, Zhenhua 1 aHu, Yueming 1 aShi, Zhou 1 aPan, Yuchun 1 aWang, Lu 1 aWang, Guangxing 0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010400207300001800311500001900329520164900348592002801997650002002025650001602045650001102061650001202072650001102084651001302095700001702108700002102125773013502146856008202281852000902363655001202372IND60701844520221118184740.0200716e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070184452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-020-03259-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, Mathew A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1565-726X10aNear real-time mapping of air temperature at high spatiotemporal resolutions in Tasmania, Australia  ap. 1181-1201.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface air temperature (Tₐ) is important for a wide variety of applications that require real-time monitoring of environmental change; yet, few studies have attempted to deliver such products at a resolution appropriate for local-scale analysis. We investigated the feasibility of producing hourly Tₐ maps in near real time at a spatial grid resolution of 80 m across the state of Tasmania (area: 68,401 km²), Australia. We first assimilate 267 non-telemetered logger recording sites for data recorded in the 1-year period from September 2013 to 2014 and statistically calibrate them to 43-telemetered Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) weather station sites for real-time application. This was evaluated in the following year using held back recordings in addition to evaluating regression trees (RT) and thin plate splines (TPS) to interpolate the hourly Tₐ estimates. For real-time operational mapping, the system was fully automated in the R programming language and hosted on a cloud-based computing platform to assess performance over a 7-day period in February 2020. The calibration procedure yielded accurate results with the root mean square error (RMSE) ranging between 1.33 °C in summer and 1.29 °C in winter. The TPS interpolation method was optimal in summer with an RMSE of 1.35 °C compared to RT with 1.39 °C; however, RT performed better in winter with an RMSE of 1.34 °C compared to 1.42 °C. The mapping system was capable of producing spatial outputs within the hour of the BoM observations becoming available with the TPS interpolation proving to be more efficient at producing outputs in a timelier manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aclimatology 3asummer 3aweather 3awinter 3aTasmania1 aKidd, Darren1 aMinasny, Budiman0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1181-1201dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03259-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013900173300001800312520146800330592002801798650002401826650001901850650001401869650002201883650002301905650004801928650002201976650002301998650001102021650001202032650001302044650002202057650001302079650001502092650001902107650002002126650001702146653001302163653002802176653002202204653001502226653001902241653002202260653001302282653001202295653001402307653001802321700001702339700002202356700002002378700001902398773011902417856008702536852000902623655001202632IND60568955220221118143007.0170522e20151106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056895522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b007202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshmukh, Atul S.10aSecretome Analysis of Lipid-Induced Insulin Resistance in Skeletal Muscle Cells by a Combined Experimental and Bioinformatics Workflow  ap. 4885-4895.  aSkeletal muscle has emerged as an important secretory organ that produces so-called myokines, regulating energy metabolism via autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine actions; however, the nature and extent of the muscle secretome has not been fully elucidated. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, in principle, allows an unbiased and comprehensive analysis of cellular secretomes; however, the distinction of bona fide secreted proteins from proteins released upon lysis of a small fraction of dying cells remains challenging. Here we applied highly sensitive MS and streamlined bioinformatics to analyze the secretome of lipid-induced insulin-resistant skeletal muscle cells. Our workflow identified 1073 putative secreted proteins including 32 growth factors, 25 cytokines, and 29 metalloproteinases. In addition to previously reported proteins, we report hundreds of novel ones. Intriguingly, ∼40% of the secreted proteins were regulated under insulin-resistant conditions, including a protein family with signal peptide and EGF-like domain structure that had not yet been associated with insulin resistance. Finally, we report that secretion of IGF and IGF-binding proteins was down-regulated under insulin-resistant conditions. Our study demonstrates an efficient combined experimental and bioinformatics workflow to identify putative secreted proteins from insulin-resistant skeletal muscle cells, which could easily be adapted to other cellular models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocrine signaling 3abioinformatics 3acytokines 3aenergy metabolism 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3amass spectrometry 3ametalloproteinases 3amodels 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3aprotein secretion 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asignal peptide 3askeletal muscle 3asomatomedins 0amyokines 0aquantitative proteomics 0amass spectrometry 0ametabolism 0aglucose uptake 0ainsulin signaling 0adiabetes 0aobesity 0asecretome 0apalmitic acid1 aCox, Juergen1 aJensen, Lars Juhl1 aMeissner, Felix1 aMann, Matthias0 tJournal of Proteome Research.g2015 Nov. 06, v. 14, no. 11 p.4885-4895dAmerican Chemical Societyx1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jproteome.5b007203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011300168300001800281520178600299592002802085650003502113650002002148650001602168650001102184650001202195650001502207650001602222650002002238650001002258650001702268650002102285650001402306650001302320650001302333650003702346700001902383700002402402773009502426856008102521852000902602655001202611IND60556091720221118031452.0170607e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055609172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-016-2587-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamás, Ladislav10aCadmium activates both diphenyleneiodonium- and rotenone-sensitive superoxide production in barley root tips  ap. 1277-1287.  aMAIN CONCLUSION : Mild Cd stress-activated diphenyleneiodonium-sensitive superoxide production is utilized in root morphogenic responses, while severe Cd stress-induced robust rotenone-sensitive superoxide generation may lead to cell and root death. In barley, even a few minute exposure of roots to Cd concentration higher than 10 µM evoked a strong superoxide generation in the root transition zone. This superoxide generation was strongly inhibited by the inhibition of mitochondrial electron flow into complex III in the presence of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone. Similarly, the superoxide generation induced by antimycin A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III, was considerably reduced by rotenone, suggesting the involvement of complex III also in the severe Cd stress-induced superoxide generation. This severe Cd stress-induced superoxide generation was followed by an extensive cell death in this part of the root tip, which similar to the superoxide generation, was eliminated by rotenone co-treatment. In turn, mild Cd stress-induced diphenyleneiodonium (DPI)-sensitive superoxide generation was observed only in the post-stressed roots, suggesting that it is not directly associated with Cd toxicity. Diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, markedly inhibited the mild Cd stress-induced radial expansion of root apex, indicating that enhanced DPI-sensitive superoxide production is required for rapid isotropic cell growth. Severe Cd stress, probably through the inhibition of complex III, caused a rapid and robust superoxide generation leading to cell and/or root death. By contrast, mild Cd stress did not evoke oxidative stress, and the enhanced DPI-sensitive superoxide generation is utilized in adaptive morphogenic responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aantimycin A 3abarley 3acadmium 3acell death 3acell growth 3acrop production 3adeath 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aroot tips 3arotenone 3atoxicity 3aubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase1 aMistrík, Igor1 aZelinová, Veronika0 tPlanta.g2016 Dec., v. 244, no. 6 p.1277-1287dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-016-2587-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03159naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012800165520180300293592002802096650001402124650001402138650001202152650002202164650001902186650001902205650001502224650002602239650002302265650001002288651001002298653002502308653002402333653002802357653001902385653001402404653001002418700001702428700001802445700001502463700001502478773011302493856008602606852000902692655001202701IND60688421220221117222317.0200809e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068842122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Hua,10aImpact of household land endowment and environmental cognition on the willingness to implement straw incorporation in China  aThe resource utilization of crop straw is related to the green development of agriculture and the development of the rural ecological environment. Given a background of tightening agricultural environmental constraints, realizing the effective utilization of straw resources has become a real-world problem in China urgently requiring a solution. Straw incorporation is an effective way to effectively utilize straw resources. This paper quantitatively analyzed the impact of household land endowment and environmental cognition on farmers’ willingness to implement straw incorporation (FWSI) by using household survey data from Jiangsu Province in China and an ordered logit model. The results reveal that straw incorporation not only needs to be considered at the technical level but also needs to start with household land endowment and environmental cognition. There is a close relationship between household environmental cognition and FWSI, and thus improving environmental cognitive ability can promote FWSI. In contrast to farm size, plot area is an important factor influencing FWSI, and scale farmers are also more concerned about straw incorporation cost than other farmers. The government should provide relevant training to clarify the positive effect of farmers’ environmental cognition on straw incorporation and enhance farmers’ cognition of the value of straw incorporation in China. Considering the plot area and cost, the government should also vigorously encourage the transfer and integration of adjacent plots, expand the plot area, reduce the cost of straw incorporation for a single plot, and guide social funds toward research on straw purchasing and storage technology. Attention should also be paid to the demonstration role of scale farmers in straw incorporation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3afarm size 3afarmers 3ahousehold surveys 3aland ownership 3alogit analysis 3apurchasing 3aquantitative analysis 3astorage technology 3astraw 3aChina 0aResource utilization 0aStraw incorporation 0aEnvironmental cognition 0aLand endowment 0aHousehold 0aChina1 aHu, Lingxiao1 aZheng, Weiwei1 aYao, Sheng1 aQian, Long0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 July 20, v. 262 p.121479-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245013000210300001600340520109600356592002801452650002101480650001401501650001901515650002801534650003801562650002101600650001601621650001901637650002001656650001301676700002001689700002201709700002801731700001801759700002101777700002501798700002601823700001801849773009501867856008401962990002302046852000902069655001202078IND60094776220221121053208.0141104e20120911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009477622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.devcel.2012.08.0012doi7 aPMC36571492pmcid7 a229753242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopkins, Sarah10aMig6 Is a Sensor of EGF Receptor Inactivation that Directly Activates c-Abl to Induce Apoptosis during Epithelial Homeostasis  ap. 547-559.  aA fundamental aspect of epithelial homeostasis is the dependence on specific growth factors for cell survival, yet the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We found an “inverse” mode of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling that directly links ErbB receptor inactivation to the induction of apoptosis. Upon ligand deprivation Mig6 dissociates from the ErbB receptor and binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase c-Abl to trigger p73-dependent apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells. Deletion of Errfi1 (encoding Mig6) and inhibition or RNAi silencing of c-Abl causes impaired apoptosis and luminal filling of mammary ducts. Mig6 activates c-Abl by binding to the kinase domain, which is prevented in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) by Src family kinase-mediated phosphorylation on c-Abl-Tyr488. These results reveal a receptor-proximal switch mechanism by which Mig6 actively senses EGF deprivation to directly activate proapoptotic c-Abl. Our findings challenge the common belief that deprivation of growth factors induces apoptosis passively by lack of mitogenic signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3aepidermal growth factor 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aepithelial cells 3ahomeostasis 3amammary glands 3aphosphorylation 3atyrosine1 aLinderoth, Emma1 aHantschel, Oliver1 aSuarez-Henriques, Paula1 aPilia, Giulia1 aKendrick, Howard1 aSmalley, Matthew J.1 aSuperti-Furga, Giulio1 aFerby, Ingvar0 tDevelopmental cell.g2012 Sept. 11, v. 23, no. 3 p.547-559dElsevier Inc.x1534-58077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008600166520097900252592002801231650001401259650001401273650001201287650001901299650001401318650002201332650001701354650001701371650001101388650001901399650001801418650002101436650001501457650001401472650001801486650002401504650001501528653000901543653003101552653001201583653001701595653001401612653001401626700001501640700001601655700001801671700002101689700001901710773011201729856008201841852000901923655001201932IND60728383920221120061553.0220606e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072838392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2021.1120632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Yuanyuan10aSignal transduction associated with lead-induced neurological disorders: A review  aLead is a heavy metal pollutant that is widely present in the environment. It affects every organ system, yet the nervous system appears to be the most sensitive and primary target. Although many countries have made significant strides in controlling Pb pollution, Pb poisoning continuous to be a major public health concern. Exposure to Pb causes neurotoxicity that ranges from neurodevelopmental disorders to severe neurodegenerative lesions, leading to impairments in learning, memory, and cognitive function. Studies on the mechanisms of Pb-induced nervous system injury have convincingly shown that this metal can affect a plethora of cellular pathways affecting on cell survival, altering calcium dyshomeostasis, and inducing apoptosis, inflammation, energy metabolism disorders, oxidative stress, autophagy and glial stress. This review summarizes recent knowledge on multiple signaling pathways associated with Pb-induced neurological disorders in vivo and in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acalcium 3acell viability 3acognition 3aenergy metabolism 3aheavy metals 3ainflammation 3amemory 3anervous system 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apollutants 3apollution 3apublic health 3asignal transduction 3atoxicology 0aLead 0aLead-induced neurotoxicity 0aCalcium 0aInflammation 0aAutophagy 0aApoptosis1 aLü, Lili,1 aLiang, Yuan1 aPeng, Dongjie1 aAschner, Michael1 aJiang, Yueming0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2021 Apr., v. 150 p.112063-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1120633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008400158520168500242592002801927650001101955650001201966650001101978650001501989650002202004650001602026650001502042650001402057650002802071650001702099651001002116700001202126700001502138700001802153700001802171700002002189773012702209856007402336852000902410655001202419IND60652777120221119180521.0190713e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065277712DNAL7 a10.3390/su110204202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Guoliang 10aBeyond Place Attachment: Land Attachment of Resettled Farmers in Jiangsu, China  aThis paper examines the concept of land attachment&mdash;a positive emotional relationship between a resettled farmer and his or her rural land&mdash;in the context of China&rsquo;s rapid urbanization and the resultant huge number of resettled and landless farmers. It explores the nature of resettled farmers&rsquo; emotional relationships to rural land to reveal the kinds of land that are meaningful to famers&rsquo; lives, and the differences among different groups. The study&rsquo;s conceptual framework was based on place attachment theory. Grounded theory was applied to analyze qualitative data obtained from in-depth interviews. The results show that land attachment can be divided into seven categories: landscape, lifestyle, land income, land rights, land rootedness, land culture, and villagers&rsquo; relationships. We also observed three categories of emotional relationships between resettled farmers and rural land: &ldquo;reluctant to give up rural land and with land attachment&rdquo;, &ldquo;willing to give up rural land but with land attachment&rdquo;, and &ldquo;willing to give up rural land and without land attachment&rdquo;. This study&rsquo;s exploration of the concept of land attachment revealed that rural land is not merely an objective asset but that it also has a multidimensional existence, and may be the focus of subjective loss. The study also observed that it would be helpful to deepen understandings of the subjective loss experienced by resettled farmers as a result of land-requisition policies. Drawing from its findings, the paper concludes with suggestions supportive of the sustainable development of future policies and communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3afarmers 3aincome 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aland rights 3alandscapes 3alifestyle 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aLi, Yi 1 aHay, Iain 1 aZou, Xiuqing 1 aTu, Xiaosong 1 aWang, Baoqiang 0 tSustainability.g2019 Jan. 15, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110204203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03772naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245021000181300001600391520193400407592002802341650003402369650002502403650002902428650001202457650002502469650001702494650002402511650001602535650001302551650001002564650002002574650002102594650002002615650001602635650001502651650001302666650001402679650001802693650000702711650000902718650001302727650002502740653002502765653002402790653002002814653001902834700002802853700002202881700002502903700003202928773014002960856008503100852000903185655001203194IND60632625820221120050105.0190314e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063262582DNAL7 a10.1080/19315260.2018.14874962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgadillo-Díaz, Mariana10aEvaluation of Physico-chemical Characteristics, Antioxidant Compounds and Antioxidant Capacity in Creole Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L. and S. pimpinellifolium L.) in an Aquaponic System or Organic Soil  ap. 124-137.  aTomatoes (Solanum spp.), could be produced in an aquaponic system with fertilizer supplementation to optimize tomato production, since the small amount of fine soil and nutrients from Yucatan soils limits tomato cultivation. It is necessary to investigate that farming system allows the production of tomatoes without affecting their composition and content of biologically active compounds. The work was undertaken to evaluate physico-chemical characteristics, content of antioxidant compounds and antioxidant capacity of genotypes of creole tomatoes cv. Costoluto Genovese (CG) (S. lycopersicum L.) and wild (S. pimpinellifolium L.) grown in an aquaponic system (inorganically fertilized) and in soil (organically fertilized). Physiologically ripe tomatoes were harvested, cleaned, washed, dried, and homogenized (skin, pulp, and seed). The chemical composition, hue angle, chromaticity, pH, acidity, total soluble solids (TSS) were determined as were total phenols (TP), flavonoids (TF), and carotenoids (TC). Antioxidant activity was assessed with 2,2ʹ-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods. There were no differences in TP (from 2756.06 ± 694.07 to 3369.06 ± 1267.85 mg GAE/100 g dm) and TF (from 551.30 ± 184.68 mg QE/100 g dm to 596.56 ± 121.75 mg QE/100 g dm) content between tomatoes harvested from aquaponic and soil systems. Acidity ranged from 0.27 to 0.29%. The TSS, TC, and antioxidant capacity properties were higher in aquaponic tomatoes (7.28 ± 0.74°Brix, 45.81 ± 9.13 mg β-carotene/100 g dm). No differences were due to cropping system and genotype for antioxidant capacity (DPPH = 4096.93 ± 519.65 μM TEAC/100 g dm). The aquaponic system could be an alternative to production of creole tomatoes since it does not affect their physico-chemical characteristics, antioxidant compounds and antioxidant capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3acleaning 3acolor 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3afarming systems 3afertilizers 3aflavonoids 3agenotype 3anutrients 3aorganic soils 3apH 3apulp 3atomatoes 3atotal soluble solids 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0abioactive compounds 0acropping system 0atomato quality1 aGullian-Klanian, Mariel1 aSosa-Moguel, Odri1 aSauri Duch, Enrique,1 aCuevas-Glory, Luis Fernando0 tInternational journal of vegetable science.g2019 Mar. 4, v. 25, no. 2 p.124-137dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4027179x1931-52797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19315260.2018.14874963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010200204300001600306500001900322520080500341592002801146650001701174650001601191650001201207650003401219650002701253650001201280650001501292650001401307650001101321650001801332700001601350700001401366773013301380856008201513852000901595655001201604IND60701844720221118184729.0200716e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070184472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-020-03234-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Junwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6389-360910aExperimental analysis of artificial lightning breakdown and ignition characteristics in grassland  ap. 817-825.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLightning fire is an important influencing factor of grassland ecology. It is one of the important ignition sources of grassland fire. The previous researches on lightning fires were mainly focused on forests, but researches on grassland were insufficient. In this paper, the impulse voltage generator was used to evaluate the breakdown characteristics of grass bed. The relationship of breakdown voltage to moisture content and bulk density was obtained. Based on the impulse current generator, an artificial lightning ignition prediction model of impulse current was derived. Results show that the breakdown voltage of grass bed decreases rapidly with the increase of moisture content. With the increase of peak current, the total lightning energy increases, while the heating efficiency decreases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclimatology 3aecology 3aelectric potential difference 3agenerators (equipment) 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3alightning 3amodels 3awater content1 aLiang, Dong1 aShen, Hao0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.817-825dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03234-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013200166300002000298520160000318592002801918596006301946650001802009650000802027650001802035650001102053650002002064650001102084650003302095650002002128650001302148651001002161700001702171700002302188700002002211700005702231773015502288856008302443852000902526655001202535IND60747259220221120104939.0220208e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074725922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13754-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Gaurav10aDevelopment and evaluation of air pollution–linked quality of life (AP-QOL) questionnaire: insight from two different cohorts  ap. 43459-43475.  aIn this study, the air pollution–related quality of life (AP-QOL) questionnaire was carried out in two geographically and economically different groups including New Delhi (Megacity) and Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh (town), and APE scores were linked with respiratory and cardiovascular illness. The APE-Score was developed by AP-QOL questionnaire responses using Delphi technique and further analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). For reliability of APE-Score and AP-QOL questionnaire, α-Cronbach’s test and basic statistics were performed. The linear mixed-effect model and odds ratios were used to evaluate air pollution exposure and health outcomes. Overall, 720 academicians and 276 security guards were invited to participate in the questionnaire. Cronbach’s α coefficients ranged from 0.70 to 0.84 indicated significant reliability in the AP-QOL questionnaire conducted in this study. Substantial variation in respiratory symptoms and their medical history were found − 76.9% ([95% confidential interval (CI)]: (− 83.8, − 66.9) (p < 0.05)) and − 28.6% (95% CI: (− 37.8, − 18.0) (p < 0.05)), respectively, with interquartile range (IQR) increase of APE score. The odds ratios (ORs) of respiratory medical history (MH Res.) showed a significant increase from 1.01 to 1.35 for low to high air pollution exposure in the academic group of IIT Delhi. Interestingly, for an academic group of NITH, the ORs for medical history of cardiovascular (MH Card.) showed an increase from 1.08 to 1.13 for low to high APE which was not the case for IIT Delhi academicians.  aPublisher supplied data  aSB/S3/CEE/061/2013cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aDelphi method 3aair 3aair pollution 3acities 3amedical history 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality of life 3aresearch 3aIndia1 aPrakash, Jai1 aRay, Sanjeev Kumar1 aYawar, Mohammad1 aHabib, Gazala1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3598-35480 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Aug., v. 28, no. 32 p.43459-43475dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13754-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003700139245012200176300001800298500001500316520150500331592002801836650002201864650002101886650001301907650001901920650002301939650002001962650001401982650002201996650004402018650002102062650001502083650001102098650001102109650001102120650001502131650001602146650002202162650002702184650004902211650000702260650001302267650001802280653000902298700003502307700002402342700002802366700003302394700003202427773009902459856007502558852000902633655001202642IND60576921420171220000000.0170806e20140318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057692142DNAL7 a10.1021/la404799t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombardo Lupano, Lucía

Chemically stable Co(II) and Cu(II) coordination complexes were prepared with this nonsoluble polyelectrolyte, poly(EGDE-DA), and studied by ss-NMR, FT-IR, thermogravimetry, and microscopy. Mesopores were found in all the samples, the thermal stability of the polymer matrix was highly affected by the presence of metal ions, and the ¹³C CP-MAS spectrum for the Cu(II)-complex evidenced a significant increase in the reticulation degree by Cu(II) ions. The catalytic activity of these materials on H₂O₂ activation was studied by electron spin resonance (ESR). The Co(II)-poly(EGDE-DA)/H₂O₂ heterogeneous system produced O₂, an anion superoxide (O₂•¯), and a hydroxyl radical (OH•), which diffused into the solution at the time that a decrease in pH was detected. In the same way, the Cu(II)-poly(EGDE-DA)/H₂O₂ heterogeneous system produced O₂ and OH•. H₂O₂ activation by the poly(EGDE-DA) complexes with Co(II) and Cu(II) were applied on the decolorization of solutions of the azo-dye methyl orange (MO). In the presence of 63 mM H₂O₂, 87% of MO was removed in 10 min with Cu(II)-poly(EGDE-DA) and in 110 min with Co(II)-poly(EGDE-DA). In addition, the pharmaceutical product epinephrine was partially oxidized to adrenochrome by the O₂•¯ released from the Co(II)-poly(EGDE-DA)/H₂O₂ heterogeneous system.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3acatalytic activity 3astable isotopes 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3asuperoxide anion 3ametal ions 3aoxygen 3acobalt 3acopper 3amicroscopy 3aepinephrine 3ahydroxyl radicals 3acoordination compounds 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3apolymers 3amethyl orange 0aions1 aLázaro Martínez, Juan Manuel1 aPiehl, Lidia Leonor1 aRubín

Transmission of the virus is normally by insect. The possibility of transmission by seed is less clear. Accessions collected from eight states in Nigeria were evaluated to determine seed transmissibility of CMV in Capsicum species. Ten percent of the accessions were seed infected with CMV. Eight plants from each of 22 accessions were artificially inoculated with sap prepared from CMV-infected pepper plants and seed from resulting fruit from the inoculated plants were extracted, planted, and the resulting seedlings tested after 8 weeks. The CMV was detected in all four accessions selected randomly from plants that fruited in which accessions NHCrB/09/059, NCr/AA/MAY/09/015, NCr/SA/01/09/050, and NCr/AA/MAY/09/051 had CMV transmission percentage of 73.33%, 66.67%, 66.67%, or 16.67%, respectively. In another experiment, 100 seed of the pepper cvs. Tatase, Rodo, and Sombo extracted from fresh fruit obtained from local markets were randomly selected and sown in a plastic tray. Germinating seed, and developing plants, were maintained in screenhouse and assayed for symptom development. Three young leaf samples were randomly selected from each stand at 7 weeks after planting and subjected to antigen-coated plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA). To evaluate the detection capacity of ELISA, and to prove its reliability, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay was performed for comparison. Natural seed transmission incidence of 57%, 86%, and 71% were determined for cvs. Tatase, Rodo, and Sombo, respectively. This implies that the ability to be transmitted by seed, and the rate of seed transmission of CMV, is cultivar dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3acultivars 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afruits 3ainsects 3aleaves 3amarkets 3apepper 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aplanting 3araw fruit 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asap 3aseedlings 3aviruses 3aNigeria 0aACP-ELISA 0aCMV 0aRT-PCR 0aseedlings 0ascreenhouse1 aBalogun, Olusegun Samuel1 aKumar, P.

Highest crude protein (CP) was detected in Mykachak (11.09 per cent) and Full Badam (11.06 per cent), while lowest found in Basmati 370 (6.87 per cent). CP content was found negatively associated with seed yield as well as most of the important yield attributing traits like, number of seeds panicle⁻¹. Therefore, more selection pressure for achieving more seed yield may negatively contribute to total seed protein. Genotypes were grouped under four clusters through D² analysis.

Based on a double-row rubber plantation established by using cordon rubber tree clone (CATAS 7-20-59) in 2002, a long-term field experiment was conducted to investigate whether land use efficiency could be increased by allowing intercropping with more crops in the lower strata. Although the double-row system produced significantly lower total rubber yield (12964 kg ha⁻¹) compared with the single-row system (14455 kg ha⁻¹) from 2010 to 2018, no difference in rubber yield per tree between the double-row and single-row systems was observed. Unlike single-row systems, the double-row system prevented the development of continuous heavy shade at tree maturity and permitted 2–4 h of direct sunlight to penetrate the lower strata, where companion crops were planted in 2014 and 2017. The photosynthetically active radiation ranged from 26 to 1815 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ in the intercropped area in the double-row system, whereas it ranged from 12 to 450 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ in the single-row system. Of the annual intercrops tested, yam bean produced the highest yield in comparison to its yield in monoculture (74.6% of that in monoculture), whereas peanut exhibited the lowest comparative yield potential (38.1% of that in monoculture). Compared with a typical yield of Robusta coffee in monocultures (1226.0 kg ha⁻¹), the yield of intercropped Robusta coffee plants was 35.3% lower. The yield of intercropped Arabica coffee (1319.8 kg ha⁻¹) was similar to that of monocultural Robusta coffee. Taken together, results demonstrate that double-row planting sufficiently improves soil-level light availability, thus allowing intercropping with more potential crops without loss in rubber yield per tree at maturity, as compared with single-row systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aPachyrhizus erosus 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abeans 3acase studies 3acompanion crops 3acrop yield 3afield experimentation 3aintercropping 3aland use 3apeanuts 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplantations 3aplanting 3arubber 3asolar radiation 3asoybeans 3atrees 3aChina 0aLight 0aSpatial arrangement 0aLong-term intercropping 0aYield potential1 aPan, Jian1 aZhou, Lijun1 aZheng, Dinghua1 aYuan, Suna1 aChen, Junmin1 aLi, Juan1 aGui, Qing1 aLin, Weifu0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.121493-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245012800161300001800289500001400307520168100321592002802002650001102030650002002041650001402061650001502075650000902090650002402099650001702123650001502140650001302155653003202168653002102200653001002221653001502231653001602246700001902262700001702281773011202298856007702410852000902487655001202496IND60726958420221120173402.0210209e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072695842DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.2014-038952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, K.E.10aEgg characteristics and hatch performance of Athens Canadian Random Bred 1955 meat-type chickens and 2013 Cobb 500 broilers  ap. 2151-2157.  aNAL-light  aAthens Canadian Random Bred (ACRB) chickens, a 1955 meat-type control strain, were incubated with the 2013 Cobb 500 broiler to determine differences in egg composition, conductance values, incubation duration, hatch performance, and yolk utilization. Unincubated ACRB eggs had greater percentage solids than Cobb 500 eggs. The ACRB eggs had a greater solid portion as yolk, whereas the Cobb 500 devoted more solid percentage to albumen. Percentage shell was not different between the strains, but ACRB eggs had 2.7% greater percentage moisture loss after 18 d of incubation than Cobb 500 eggs. Conductance, conductance constant, and conductance standardized to a 100 g egg weight basis were all higher for ACRB eggs than Cobb 500 eggs at 12 and 18 d of incubation. The Cobb 500 chicks hatched 6 h earlier than ACRB chicks. The Cobb 500 incubation duration was 498 h, and the ACRB incubation duration was 504 h. There was no difference between the strains for percentage infertile eggs, embryonic mortality, hatchability, or salable chicks. The ACRB chicks hatched with a smaller dried residual yolk sac as a percentage of chick weight compared with the Cobb 500. Both strains had an average relative yolk-free chick weight of 61% of average initial egg weight. Thus the Cobb 500 eggs had decreased gas exchange across the eggshell, which may have contributed to the earlier hatch and decreased yolk utilization. Modern Cobb 500 broiler embryonic metabolism appears to have either become more dependent on albumen rather than yolk or has become more efficient with yolk reserves during development. Broiler hatch performance does not appear to have changed over the past 58 yr.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicks 3aegg composition 3aegg shell 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aembryonic mortality 3agas exchange 3ametabolism 3ayolk sac 0aAthens Canadian Random Bred 0ayolk utilization 0ahatch 0aincubation 0aconductance1 aMcLendon, B.L.1 aWilson, J.L.0 tPoultry science.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 93, no. 9 p.2151-2157dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2014-038953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010300167300001800270500001900288520052300307592002800830650001700858650002800875650001300903650001400916700001700930700006600947700006301013773012101076856008301197852000901280655001201289IND60705888120221121221717.0200807e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070588812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c021162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yunfei10aSynthesis of 1,2-Dihydroquinolines via Hydrazine-Catalyzed Ring-Closing Carbonyl-Olefin Metathesis  ap. 6026-6030.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe synthesis of 1,2-dihydroquinolines by the hydrazine-catalyzed ring-closing carbonyl-olefin metathesis (RCCOM) of N-prenylated 2-aminobenzaldehydes is reported.

Converting the waste cooking oil to biodiesel can reduce environmental emissions and achieve economic value. As the recycling supply chain is not matured, the Chinese government is trialing various policies to improve the management of waste cooking oil. However, evidence shows that current policies have shortcomings, which reduce the efficiency and sustainability of the supply chain, recycling and biorefineries capacities. It is not trivial to quantify the impacts of policies and only limited amount of research has reported the supply and value chain of waste cooking oil to be used as biodiesel. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an optimization-based model to quantify the likely impacts from policy interventions, i.e. integrating and opening the third party take-back supply chains, motivation policies, subsidy policies and demand adjustments due to policy changes. A case study, which includes 63 stakeholders in Shandong Province, China, is selected to demonstrate the impacts such changes can have. The new research method and computational results of the economic and environmental assessments show that the integration of stakeholders and markets increase efficiency and sustainability. Whilst the opening markets option does make fairer profit allocations across the stakeholders, but does not increase efficencies to the same level. In addition, and to the best of authors’ knowledge for the first time, it is shown that unfair profit allocations will decrease the amount of recycled materials. This research has wider applications to policy developments and governmental interventions that aim to promote cleaner production of goods and services. For example, the optimization model can be applied to other circumstances such as electricity supplies, raw material extraction or the recycling of other materials like construction and demolition wastes or plastics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abiorefining 3acase studies 3acooking fats and oils 3aeconomic valuation 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3aissues and policy 3akitchen waste 3amarkets 3amodels 3amotivation 3aplastics 3apublic services and goods 3araw materials 3arecycled materials 3arecycling 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3aChina 0aWaste cooking oil 0aBiodiesel supply chain 0aGovernment policy 0aOptimization model 0aEfficiency 0aSustainability1 aWang, Bohong1 aRajaeifar, Mohammad Ali1 aHeidrich, Oliver1 aZheng, Jianqin1 aLiang, Yongtu1 aZhang, Haoran0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 263 p.121494-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1214943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245008900201300001800290500001900308520200300327592002802330596007402358596007502432596004202507596012302549650001702672650001902689650001902708650001602727650002002743650002902763650000902792650001602801650001802817650000902835650001402844650001602858700001702874700001402891700001902905700001902924700001802943700001902961773013502980856008203115852000903197655001203206IND60701845120221118181114.0200716e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070184512DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-020-03256-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7221-224610aImprovement of the CERES-Rice model using controlled experiments and a Meta-analysis  ap. 1271-1284.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExtreme heat has occurred more frequently in recent years and will intensify in the future, and this change has serious impacts on rice (Oryza sativa L.) yields. Thus, it was crucial to evaluate its influence on rice yield reductions. Recent papers have shown that a lack of experimental data makes it difficult for most crop models to capture the impacts of heat stress. Therefore, this paper explored how to improve the performance of crop models under extreme heat stress based on the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CERES-Rice model. This study primarily focused on (i) quantifying spikelet fertility based on daily temperature and durations derived from controlled experiments, (ii) improving the performance of the CERES-Rice model under extreme heat stress, and (iii) simulating historical and future rice yields using the improved model. Specifically, a meta-analysis method was utilized to build a new heat stress function between spikelet fertility and temperature and heat day duration with high realization. Subsequently, independent artificial controlled experiments at two sites were proposed to calibrate and validate the CERES-Rice model. The results showed a higher R² (> 0.739) and a lower RMSE that was reduced by 38~68% after incorporating the new heat stress function in the CERES-Rice model compared with that of the original model. Furthermore, a historical simulation (1980–2010) demonstrated that an improved CERES-Rice model could better capture rice yield in response to extreme heat. Using an ensemble of five climate model datasets and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), the analysis of the projected future (2020–2099) rice yield showed that the rice yield reduction caused by high temperature was considerable; however, the rice yields were overestimated by 34% and 18%, respectively, at the two sites. Some regions rarely affected by heat are likely to experience yield reductions in the future due to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFD100220cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2018YFC1505605cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2020Y003cBasic Research Fund of CAMS  a20603020004096004 AR1904cBasic Scientific Research Operating Expenses of the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping 3aOryza sativa 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3adecision support systems 3aheat 3aheat stress 3ameta-analysis 3arice 3aspikelets 3atemperature1 aZhao, Yanxia1 aZhang, Yi1 aChe, Xianghong1 aYang, Zaiqiang1 aSong, Yanling1 aZheng, Xiaohui0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2020 Aug., v. 141, no. 3-4 p.1271-1284dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl3932171x0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03256-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006900156300001800225520112800243592002801371650001601399650002201415650001201437650001101449700001901460700001901479700002601498700002701524700002001551700002501571700001901596700003601615700002001651700001901671773009901690856007501789852000901864655001201873IND60576921820171220000000.0170806e20140318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057692182DNAL7 a10.1021/la404918b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingbo10aMonolayer Properties of Asymmetrically Substituted Sexithiophene  ap. 2752-2760.  aWe present a structural comparison of monolayers on a SiO₂ substrate of two asymmetrically substituted sexithiophenes (6T). Molecule 1 consists of 6T with a branched alkyl chain at one end only and shows a crystalline structure. In molecule 2, the bifunctional 6T has in addition at the other end a linear alkyl chain. It displays thermotropic liquid crystalline (LC) behavior. Both compounds form readily single molecular layers from solution. Remarkably, full monolayer coverage can be achieved before multilayer growth starts. LC properties promote preordering near the interface as well as exchange of molecules between the growing domains, thus regulating the domain sizes. As a result, the LC compound 2 forms single-molecule islands with larger domain sizes compared to compound 1. Surface X-ray investigations indicate that the 6T cores are tilted relative to the layer normal. The tilt angle is as large as 54° for compound 2 compared to 28° for compound 1. For molecule 2, interfacial constraints and packing requirements because of the asymmetric substitution cause a rather loosely organized core structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acrystal structure 3aliquids 3asilica1 ade Jeu, Wim H.1 aZiener, Ulrich1 aPolinskaya, Marina

STEC strains were recovered from 53% of roe deer, 8.4% of wild boars, and 1.9% of foxes sampled in the northwest of Spain (Galicia). Of the 40 serotypes identified, 21 were classified as seropathotypes associated with human disease, accounting for 81.5% of the wildlife-carried STEC strains, including the enterohemorrhagic serotypes O157:H7-D-eae-γ1, O26:[H11]-B1-eae-β1, O121:H19-B1-eae-ε1, and O145:[H28]-D-eae-γ1. None of the wildlife-carried strains belonged to the highly pathogenic serotype O104:H4-B1 from the recent Germany outbreak. Forty percent of wildlife-carried STEC strains shared serotypes, phylogroups, intimin types, and Stx profiles with isolates from human patients from the same geographic area. Furthermore, wildlife-carried strains belonging to serotypes O5:HNM-A, O26:[H11]-B1, O76:H19-B1, O145:[H28]-D, O146:H21-B1, and O157:H7-D showed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles with >85% similarity to human-pathogenic STEC strains. We also found a high level of similarity among STEC strains of serotypes O5:HNM-A, O26:[H11]-B1, and O145:HNM-D of bovine (feces and beef) and wildlife origins. Interestingly, O146:H21-B1, the second most frequently detected serotype in this study, is commonly associated with human diarrhea and isolated from beef and vegetables sold in Galicia. Importantly, at least 3 STEC isolates from foxes (O5:HNM-A-eae-β1, O98:[H21]-B1-eae-ζ1, and O146:[H21]-B1) showed characteristics similar to those of human STEC strains. In conclusion, roe deer, wild boar, and fox in Galicia are confirmed to be carriers of STEC strains potentially pathogenic for humans and seem to play an important role in the maintenance of STEC.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3abeef 3acattle 3adiarrhea 3afeces 3afoxes 3ahuman diseases 3ahuman settlements 3ahumans 3aintimin 3apatients 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arisk 3aserotypes 3avegetables 3awild boars 3awildlife 2aAdhesins, Bacterialxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wildxmicrobiology 2aCluster Analysis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Typing 2aSerotyping 2aShiga Toxinsxgenetics 2aShiga-Toxigenic Escherichia colixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 3aGermany 3aSpain 0aSpain1 aLópez, Cecilia,1 aDhabi, Ghizlane1 aLópez-Beceiro, Ana M.1 aFidalgo, Luís E.1 aDíaz, Eduardo A.,1 aMartínez Carrasco, Carlos,1 aMamani, Rosalía1 aHerrera, Alexandra1 aBlanco, Jesús E.1 aBlanco, Miguel1 aBlanco, Jorge0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 78, no. 8 p.2578-2585dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.07520-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100005400157245008300211300001600294520099100310592002801301650002401329650001601353650001101369650002501380650001101405650001901416650002301435650001501458653001501473653001401488653001401502700001801516700001801534700001701552700001501569700001701584773011301601856009201714852000901806655001201815IND60755743220221120111517.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075574322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Fubin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7853-829810aAbility of anaerobic digestion to remove antibiotics contained in swine manure  ap. 175-184.  aAntibiotics in animal manure, which are used to treat animal diseases, have become a major concern due to human and ecological health risks. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is viable for treating manure because it generates energy. However, the ability of AD to completely eliminate antibiotics remains unclear. Therefore, the AD ability of swine manure containing 10 antibiotics was investigated. The results showed that the thresholds of complete antibiotic reduction were 25, 50, 50, 75, 75, and 75 mg (kg TS)⁻¹ for SD, CIP, SQ, SAR, DIF, and SA, respectively. At their thresholds, SD, CIP, and SA could increase methane production, but the opposite results were obtained for SQ, SAR, and DIF. The modified Gompertz model showed good application for AD with different antibiotic loads. Antibiotic reduction and methane production are strongly correlated for the antibiotics of SAR and ENR, so their reduction performance can be inferred simply by determining their methane production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aantibiotics 3aenergy 3aenvironmental health 3ahumans 3alogit analysis 3amethane production 3apig manure 0aAntibiotic 0aReduction 0aThreshold1 aDong, Hongmin1 aZhang, Wanqin1 aWang, Shunli1 aShang, Bin1 aZhu, Zhiping0 tBiosystems engineering.g2021 Dec., v. 212 p.175-184dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2021.10.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100006000184245006400244506007600308520144400384592002801828596005401856506003701910650001301947650002101960650002001981650001002001650002402011650002302035650001402058650001302072650001402085650001502099650001702114653001602131653001802147653002102165653002302186653001502209700002502224773011202249856007702361852000902438655001202447IND60673447420221207085400.0191018e20180809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067344742DNAL7 a10.1093/femspd/fty0652doi7 aPMC61344272pmcid7 a301075222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinecz, Antal1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6539-635810aEstimating treatment prolongation for persistent infections  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTreatment of infectious diseases is often long and requires patients to take drugs even after they have seemingly recovered. This is because of a phenomenon called persistence, which allows small fractions of the bacterial population to survive treatment despite being genetically susceptible. The surviving subpopulation is often below detection limit and therefore is empirically inaccessible but can cause treatment failure when treatment is terminated prematurely. Mathematical models could aid in predicting bacterial survival and thereby determine sufficient treatment length. However, the mechanisms of persistence are hotly debated, necessitating the development of multiple mechanistic models. Here we develop a generalized mathematical framework that can accommodate various persistence mechanisms from measurable heterogeneities in pathogen populations. It allows the estimation of the relative increase in treatment length necessary to eradicate persisters compared to the majority population. To simplify and generalize, we separate the model into two parts: the distribution of the molecular mechanism of persistence in the bacterial population (e.g. number of efflux pumps or target molecules, growth rates) and the elimination rate of single bacteria as a function of that phenotype. Thereby, we obtain an estimate of the required treatment length for each phenotypic subpopulation depending on its size and susceptibility.  aPublisher supplied data  a271176cNorwegian Research Council Young Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3achronic diseases 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3ainfectious diseases 3amechanistic models 3apathogens 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3atransporters 0apersistence 0aantimicrobial 0atreatment length 0amathematical model 0aantibiotic1 aAbel zur Wiesch, Pia0 tPathogens and disease.g2018 Aug. 09, v. 76, no. 6dOxford University PresswJournal:27056x2049-632X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femspd/fty0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008100187300001600268500001500284520074900299592002801048650000901076650003801085650001801123650002301141650001901164650001601183650001701199650001601216650002201232650002401254650003901278650001401317650002701331650002101358650001801379650002001397650002001417650001601437650002101453650001201474650001101486650004601497650001301543650005701556650002201613650004101635650001701676650001001693650004501703650001001748650004501758651001101803651001901814651003901833653001501872773011901887856005502006852000902061655001202070IND4467748220221120115147.0120706e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446774822DNAL7 a221518952pmid7 a10.1111/j.1865-1682.2011.01277.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwallow, R.10aRisk of Foot‐and‐Mouth Disease for the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region  ap. 344-352.  a2019-12-06  aThe paper discusses the risk for an outbreak of foot‐and‐mouth disease (FMD) in the Pacific NortWest Economic Region (PNWER).

These topics will identify a number of challenges that region will face if an outbreak were to occur including illegal trade, movement of people, livestock movements, vaccination, and zoning. There is also a discussion in these topics around potential strategies that could be used on both sides of the border to minimize the impact of an outbreak both from an animal welfare perspective and from a trade and economic perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3ainternational policy and programs 3ahealth policy 3adisease prevention 3aanimal welfare 3aimmigration 3atrade policy 3avaccination 3adisease outbreaks 3ainternational trade 3agovernmental programs and projects 3alivestock 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3aanimal transport 3asocial impact 3aeconomic policy 3aeconomic impact 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aCommerce 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aFood Microbiology 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseasexepidemiology 2aRisk Factors 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxeconomicsxepidemiology. 3aCanada 3aPacific States 0aNorthwestern Statesxepidemiology. 0aimmigrants0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2012 Aug., v. 59, no. 4 p.344-352dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2011.01277.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245010300170300001400273520110200287592002801389650001201417650001501429650001401444650001301458650001101471650001901482650002001501650001601521650002101537650001601558700002301574700001701597700002401614773009801638856008601736852000901822655001201831IND4445460920221123005656.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444546092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereda, Mariana10aStructure and properties of nanocomposite films based on sodium caseinate and nanocellulose fibers  ap. 76-83.  aFilms made from sodium caseinate and nanocellulose were prepared by dispersing the fibrils into film forming solutions, casting and drying. Composite films were less transparent and had a more hydrophilic surface than neat sodium caseinate ones. However, the global moisture uptake was almost not affected by filler concentration. Addition of nanocellulose to the neat sodium caseinate films produced an initial increase in the barrier properties to water vapor, and then, it decreases as filler content increased. This was explained in terms of additional detrimental changes (cracks and bubble formation) induced in the morphological structure of the film by the reinforcement. The tensile modulus and strength of composite films increased significantly with increasing cellulose concentrations, while the values of elongation decreased. In the same way it was found that the storage modulus increases considerably with filler addition in the low temperature range (<60°C), though the effect of temperature on the films performance is even more dramatic, as expected in protein-based materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abubbles 3acaseinates 3acellulose 3acracking 3adrying 3ananocomposites 3astorage modulus 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3awater vapor1 aAmica, Guillermina1 aRácz, Ilona1 aMarcovich, Norma E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2011 Mar., v. 103, no. 1 p.76-83dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245017100164300001600335506010400351506007600455520157400531592002802105506003702133650001302170650001502183650002802198650001602226650001402242650002002256650001102276650000902287700001502296700001602311700001502327700001502342700001802357773014102375856007902516852000902595655001202604IND60777900820221207091340.0220719e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077790082DNAL7 a10.3168/jdsc.2021-01982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiddleton, E.L.10aDairy heifers have an earlier increase in serum pregnancy-specific protein B compared with lactating dairy cows.

Weekly cohorts of lactating Holstein cows (n = 56) averaging 122 ± 7 d in milk at AI and nulliparous Holstein heifers (n = 23) averaging 16 ± 0.24 mo old at AI were used in this study. Lactating cows received AI to either Ovsynch (n = 38) or at ~12 h following observed standing estrus (n = 18). All heifers were inseminated ~12 h after observed standing estrus. Blood samples for measurement of PSPB were collected daily from d 15 through d 35 postovulation. Nulliparous heifers had increases in serum PSPB earlier compared with both primiparous and multiparous cows. Day of increase in serum PSPB was defined as the day serum PSPB optical density levels initially increased ≥10% from baseline and continued to increase from baseline of ≥10% the following 2 d. Average PSPB were greater in pregnant heifers compared pregnant cows from d 23 through 29. Early lactation nonpregnant cows maintained greater average optical density of serum PSPB from 15 to 35 d postovulation compared with nonpregnant heifers (n = 38). In summary, fertility differences in heifers versus lactating cows may be due to the differences in timing of increases in serum PSPB. This appears to be one of the first publications that used daily PSPB sampling to investigate possible differences in fertility in heifers versus lactating cows.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aabsorbance 3aartificial insemination 3ablood serum 3aconceptus 3aearly lactation 3aestrus 3amilk1 aMinela, T.1 aAhearne, M.1 aArnold, H.1 aSantos, A.1 aPursley, J.R.0 tJDS communications.g2022 July, v. 3, no. 4 p.291-295dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:27587x2666-91027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jdsc.2021-01983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013100171520173700302592002802039650001202067650001302079650001202092650001602104650002102120650001302141650002402154650001802178650001302196650001102209653001702220653001702237653001202254653002402266653002002290653002502310700001502335700001602350700002102366700001702387773010502404856008502509852000902594655001202603IND60653705720221120033241.0190725e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065370572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKent, Timothy R.10aMechanistic understanding of the NOB suppression by free ammonia inhibition in continuous flow aerobic granulation bioreactors  aA partial nitritation continuous flow reactor (CFR) was operated for eight months demonstrating that partial nitritation granular sludge can remain stable under continuous flow conditions. The ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB)-to-nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) activity ratios were determined for a series of granule sizes to understand the impact of mass diffusion limitation on the free ammonia (FA) inhibition of NOB. When dissolved oxygen (DO) limitation is the only mechanism for NOB suppression, the AOB:NOB ratio was usually found to increase with the granule size. However, the trend is reversed when FA has an inhibitory effect on NOB, as was observed in this study. The decrease in AOB:NOB ratio indicates that smaller granules, e.g. diameter <150 μm, are preferred for nitrite accumulation when high FA concentration is present, as in the partial nitritation process. The trend was further verified by observing the increase in the apparent inhibition coefficient as granule size increased. Indeed, this study for the first time quantified the effect of diffusion limitation on the apparent inhibition coefficient of NOB in aerobic granules. A mathematical model was then utilized to interpret the observed suppression of NOB and predicted that NOB suppression was only complete at the granule surface. The NOB that did survive in larger granules was forced to dwell within the granule interior, where the AOB growth declines due to DO diffusion limitation. This means FA inhibition can be taken advantage of as an effective means for NOB suppression in small granules or thin biofilms. Further, both FA inhibition and DO limitation were found to be required for the suppression of NOB in mainstream aerobic granules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3adissolved oxygen 3agranules 3amathematical models 3anitrification 3anitrites 3asludge 0aFree ammonia 0aGranule size 0aAOB:NOB 0aPartial nitritation 0aContinuous flow 0aDiffusion limitation1 aSun, Yewei1 aAn, Zhaohui1 aBott, Charles B.1 aWang, Zhi-Wu0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Oct., v. 131 p.105005-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008700161300001800248520154000266592002801806650001501834650001301849650001401862650000801876650002401884650001001908650001901918650001901937650002501956650002801981650002002009650001802029650002502047700002102072700002702093700002002120773012002140856007402260852000902334655001202343IND60118039120221116221254.0141126e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011803912DNAL7 a10.1093/icb/icu0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStark, Alyssa Y.10aReduction of Water Surface Tension Significantly Impacts Gecko Adhesion Underwater  ap. 1026-1033.  aThe gecko adhesive system is dependent on weak van der Waals interactions that are multiplied across thousands of fine hair-like structures (setae) on geckos’ toe pads. Due to the requirements of van der Waals forces, we expect that any interruption between the setae and substrate, such as a water layer, will compromise adhesion. Our recent results suggest, however, that the air layer (plastron) surrounding the superhydrophobic toe pads aid in expelling water at the contact interface and create strong shear adhesion in water when in contact with hydrophobic surfaces. To test the function of the air plastron, we reduced the surface tension of water using two surfactants, a charged anionic surfactant and a neutral nonionic surfactant. We tested geckos on three substrates: hydrophilic glass and two hydrophobic surfaces, glass with a octadecyl trichlorosilane self-assembled monolayer (OTS-SAM) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). We found that the anionic surfactant inhibited the formation of the air plastron layer and significantly reduced shear adhesion to all three substrates. Interestingly, the air plastron was more stable in the nonionic surfactant treatments than the anionic surfactant treatments and we found that geckos adhered better in the nonionic surfactant than in the anionic surfactant on OTS-SAM and PTFE but not on glass. Our results have implications for the evolution of a superhydrophobic toe pad and highlight some of the challenges faced in designing synthetic adhesives that mimic geckos’ toes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGekkonidae 3aadhesion 3aadhesives 3aair 3aanionic surfactants 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3anonionic surfactants 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3asurface tension 3asurface water 3avan der Waals forces1 aMcClung, Brandon1 aNiewiarowski, Peter H.1 aDhinojwala, Ali0 tIntegrative and comparative biology.g2014 Dec., v. 54, no. 6 p.1026-1033dOxford University Pressx1540-70637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icu0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002800172245008000200300001600280520104200296592002801338650002201366650002201388650002301410650001501433650001401448650001301462650001301475650000901488650002901497650001901526650001801545650002001563650001601583650002501599650004601624650002501670650006801695650002601763650002301789650000901812650001201821650002001833650004101853651001001894653001401904653001201918653001901930653001401949653002201963700003101985700003002016700002702046700003102073700002702104773010702131856008702238852000902325655001202334IND50068296020221121095935.0160902e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006829602DNAL7 a237389842pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBermúdez-Couso, Alipio10aPollution of surface waters by metalaxyl and nitrate from non-point sources  ap. 282-289.  aThe mobility of contaminants in soil is highly dependent upon the characteristics of the contaminant chemical and the properties of the soil. In order to explore these relationships, the district of A Limia (Galicia, NW Spain) was selected as the study area—a cropland devoted to growing potatoes, where the soil had been managed intensively over the last 50years. The soil was characterised by low slopes with the water table located very close to the soil surface. Our aim was to study the influence of high and intensive crop production on the water bodies and non-point source contamination, with a particular focus on metalaxyl and nitrate. The highest concentrations of metalaxyl occurred when rainfalls were low and in zones of the study area where natural hydrology was significantly altered by numerous drainage canals. The spatial and temporal distributions of the nitrate also showed a high variability, with the interaction between seasons and sampling area being the most significant factor in explaining the levels found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adrainage channels 3aintensive cropping 3airrigation 3ametalaxyl 3anitrates 3apotatoes 3arain 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil pollution 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3awater table 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAlaninexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aGroundwaterxanalysis 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSoilxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aSpain 0aMetalaxyl 0aNitrate 0aSurface waters 0aPollution 0aNon-point sources1 aFernández-Calviño, David1 aÁlvarez-Enjo, Manuel Ali1 aSimal-Gándara, Jesús1 aNóvoa-Muñoz, Juan Carlos1 aArias-Estévez, Manuel0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 461-462 p.282-289dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01879naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011500164300001600279520070800295592002801003650002501031650001601056650002001072650002001092650001701112650002401129650001101153650001301164650002401177700002001201700002901221700001601250700001801266773013001284856008201414852000901496655001201505IND60769300420221122063013.0220306e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076930042DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348220201132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShengda Qi, 10aDNA-Templated Gold Nanoclusters for Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer-Based Human Serum Albumin Detection  ap. 216-223.  aA new method for the determination of human serum albumin (HSA) was developed using gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) as a probe. DNA-templated gold nanoclusters with single-stranded DNA as a template were successfully synthesized as a target probe for HSA. The mechanism studies showed that the fluorescence of AuNCs produced a clear enhanced fluorescent signal in the presence of HSA via fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Under optimal conditions, the linear range was 0.05–10 μM with the limit of detection of 13 nM. AuNCs were successfully applied to recognize and quantify HSA in human serum samples.

The consortium was able to produce 3.3 g L−1 of biomass, measured as suspended solids. Microbial growth was detectable, even substrate depletion, after 8 days of cultivation. The emulsifier activity and its influence on the droplet size were also evaluated: it was observed that droplet diameter decreases as emulsifier activity increases. The bubble column bioreactor system proposed in this research could be used as a biotechnological process for the remediation of a contaminated body in important petrochemical regions, for example, Veracruz, México, where some points of sea and fresh-water bodies were analysed to find nonane and hexadecane in all sample water. It is important due to a lack of information, regarding hydrocarbon pollution in this port area, is filled.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlcanivorax 3aMarinobacter 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3afreshwater 3ahexadecane 3amarine sediments 3amicrobial growth 3apollution 3aremediation 3asurface water 3atotal suspended solids 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMexico 0aDiesel uptake 0aIndigenous microbial consortium 0aGulf of Mexico 0aDroplet size1 aValdivia-Rivera, S.1 aNarciso-Ortiz, L.1 aGarcía-Maldonado, J.Q.1 aUribe-Flores, M.M.1 aAguirre-Macedo, M.L.1 aLizardi-Jiménez, M.A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 July, v. 250 p.849-855dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04431naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005900144245012700203300001600330506010400346506007600450520262000526592002803146506003703174650003003211650002903241650001303270650002403283650001703307650001903324650001603343650000903359650001503368650002203383650001103405650002003416650002003436650000903456650002103465650001503486650002403501650001603525700005203541700001603593700001703609700005803626773014103684856007903825852000903904655001203913IND60777901020221207094039.0220719e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077790102DNAL7 a10.3168/jdsc.2022-02102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickerson, A.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3557-780610aFeeding native rumen microbial supplements increases energy-corrected milk production and feed efficiency by Holstein cows  ap. 239-244.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 2 novel native microbial feed supplements (MFS) on milk yield, milk composition, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), and efficiency. A total of 73 lactating Holstein cows were enrolled over 4 mo. During a 2-wk covariate period, baseline data were collected. Using a randomized complete block design, cows were blocked in groups of 3 by days in milk (DIM), production, and parity. Within blocks cows were randomly assigned to a basal diet with a 150 g/d ground corn topdress and no MFS (control), the basal diet supplemented with a 5 g/d dose of Clostridium beijerinckii ASCUSDY20 and Pichia kudriavzevii ASCUSDY21 in a carrier mixed with a 150 g/d ground corn topdress (MFS1), or the basal diet with a 5 g/d dose of Ruminococcus bovis ASCUSDY10, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ASCUSDY19, Clostridium beijerinckii ASCUSDY20, and Pichia kudriavzevii ASCUSDY21 in a carrier mixed in a 150 g/d ground corn topdress (MFS2) for 140 d. Cows were fed the diets as a total mixed ration (TMR) for ad libitum DMI once daily. Analysis showed numerical increases in performance variables such as milk yield and fat and protein contents in both MFS1 and MFS2, although the differences were not significant over time. For energy-corrected milk (ECM), other solids percentage, and BW there were significant treatment by time interactions. Cows fed MFS1 and MFS2 produced 1.4 kg/d and 1.6 kg/d more ECM than control cows, respectively (time-dependent treatment significance). Up to wk 13 of treatment, both MFS groups had higher ECM production than the control group but after this point MFS1 rapidly decreased to the same level as control. All cows displayed a gradual decrease in ECM after wk 13 but the MFS2 group remained greater than both control and MFS1. A similar trend in the content of other milk solids was observed. Cow BW was affected over time; both control and MFS2 cows gained weight at a similar rate throughout the study, whereas the weight gain of MFS1 cows decreased briefly from wk 13 to 17 before increasing again. Feed efficiency tended to be improved by MFS, with greater improvement by MFS2 than by MFS1. The DIM when the supplementation began had a significant impact on MFS2 efficacy, where the supplementation of native rumen microbes at an earlier DIM resulted in a greater gain in ECM over the 140-d trial. A similar trend was observed for MFS1, although the effect was not significant. Our results suggest that dairy cow lactation stage and energy requirements also play an important role in product efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aButyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aHolstein 3aPichia kudriavzevii 3aRuminococcus 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acorn 3adairy cows 3adry matter intake 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3alactation stage 3amilk 3amilk composition 3amilk yield 3atotal mixed rations 3aweight gain1 aYang, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2442-70981 aGreen, H.B.1 aEmbree, M.M.1 aDrackley, J.K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4560-55940 tJDS communications.g2022 July, v. 3, no. 4 p.239-244dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:27587x2666-91027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jdsc.2022-02103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010300168300001800271520173900289592002802028650001002056650001402066650002502080650002202105650001302127650001202140650001202152700002002164700002202184773011202206856004802318852000902366655001202375IND4476033020221122222802.0121003e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447603302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-011-1164-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvilés, Jesús M.10aParental favouritism strategies in the asynchronously hatching European Roller (Coracias garrulus)  ap. 1549-1557.  aIn altricial birds, resource allocation during early developmental stages is the result of an interaction between parental feeding decisions and scramble competition between nestmates. Hatching asynchrony in birds leads to a pronounced age hierarchy among their offspring. Therefore, whenever parents exert control over resource allocation parents feeding asynchronous broods should simultaneously assess individual offspring internal condition and age. In this study, we first studied whether the highly ultraviolet (UV) reflective body skin of nestlings in the asynchronous European Roller (Coracias garrulus; roller hereafter) relates to nestling quality. In a second stage, we experimentally studied parental biases in food allocation towards senior and junior sibling rollers in relation to a manipulation of UV reflectance of the skin of their offspring. Heavier roller nestlings had less brilliant and less UV saturated skins than weaker nestlings. In our experiment, we found that parents with large broods preferentially fed nestlings presenting skin coloration revealing small body size (i.e. control nestlings) over nestlings presenting skin coloration revealing large body size (i.e. UV-blocked nestlings). Within the brood, we found that parental food allocation strategy depended on nestling age: parents preferentially fed senior nestlings signalling small body size, but did not show preference between control and UV-blocked junior nestlings. These results emphasise that parent rollers use UV cues of offspring quality while balancing the age of their offspring to adjust their feeding strategies, and suggest that parents may adopt finely tuned strategies of control over resource allocation in asynchronous broods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abody size 3adevelopmental stages 3aearly development 3ahatching 3aparents 3aprogeny1 aParejo, Deseada1 aRodríguez, Juan,0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2011 Aug., v. 65, no. 8 p.1549-1557dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-011-1164-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016000169520137000329592002801699650001801727650001301745650001801758650001301776650001701789650001401806650001101820650001301831650001401844650002201858650001401880650001401894650001401908650001301922650001601935650001301951653000901964653000901973653000801982653001101990653000902001653000902010653000902019653000902028653000902037653001502046653000902061653002602070700001902096700002302115700002502138700002502163773011502188856008502303852000902388655001202397IND60755743620221120111447.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075574362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2021.1051292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Hedayet10aImmunoinformatic identification of the epitope-based vaccine candidates from Maltoporin, FepA and OmpW of Shigella Spp, with molecular docking confirmation  aShigella is a bacterial pathogen that causes shigellosis, fatal bacillary dysentery, responsible for a higher level of mortality worldwide. We adopted a number of computational approaches to predict potential epitope-based vaccine candidates of immunogenic proteins of Shigella spp. We selected three cell surface proteins of the bacterium according to their antigenicity using the VaxiJen server, including, FepA, Maltoporin, and OmpW. The sequence analyses by the IEDB server resulted in three 15-mer peptides of the core epitope, FTAEHTQSV, FLVNQTLTL, and MRAGSATVR from FepA, Maltoporin, and OmpW, respectively, as the most potential epitopes that have an affinity with both cytotoxic and helper T-cells. Moreover, the epitopes showed 73.76%, 99.0%, and 93.07% world population coverage, along with 100% conservancy among the Shigella subspecies. The molecular docking simulation studies were performed to verify the interactions between the peptides and the respective HLAs. Docking analyses showed that the Epitope-MHC complexes had a higher level of global energy score dictating strong binding. We have also predicted B-cell epitopes from the sequences of these three proteins. In vivo study of the proposed epitope might contribute to the development of a functional and efficient vaccine, which might be an effective way to elude dysentery from the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aShigella 3aT-lymphocytes 3abacteria 3acytotoxicity 3adysentery 3aenergy 3aepitopes 3aevolution 3aimmunoinformatics 3ainfection 3amortality 3apathogens 3apeptides 3ashigellosis 3avaccines 0aOmpW 0aFepA 0aMHC 0aIFN-γ 0aIEDB 0aRCSB 0aNCBI 0aRMSD 0aFepA 0aMaltoporin 0aOmpW 0aEpitope based vaccine1 aMahmud, Shahin1 aHossain, Md.

The renewable energy industry possesses considerable potential, and has recently become the centre of the global energy landscape. Therefore, this article refers to the rolling-window Granger causality test, in order to explore the role of renewable energy (RE) in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. By studying the interactions that take place between RE consumption and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, we find that the negative impact of RE on CO₂ indicates that the replacement role of RE has become increasingly prominent, for it to effectively contribute towards the realization of carbon emission reduction. The results in this regard are consistent with the energy-environment model, suggesting that RE has an excellent performance in achieving carbon neutrality. In fact, CO₂ usually exhibits a negative effect on RE, which indicates towards the predictability of environmental quality to the development potential of renewable energy. Carbon emission reduction has become a game of interest among the countries around the world. And hence, in relation to these turn of events in the last few decades, RE is now expected to usher in the required acceleration. While eventually it is believed that the green energy competition will reshape the geopolitics of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative energy industry 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aenvironmental management 3aenvironmental quality 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3apolitics 3awind 0aRenewable energy 0aCarbon neutrality 0aCarbon emission reduction 0aCausal relationship1 aSu, Chi-Wei1 aUmar, Muhammad1 aShao, Xuefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4267-96001 aLOBONŢ, Oana-Ramona0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 308 p.114648-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1146483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011000166506011700276506007600393520131900469592002801788506003701816650002501853650001901878650001801897650000901915650001801924650002001942650001201962650001401974650003601988650002302024650001402047650001102061653002502072653001402097653001902111653001402130700001502144700001602159700001202175700001402187700001502201700001402216773011602230856008502346852000902431655001202440IND60777901220221207094130.0220529e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077790122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsirep.2022.1000572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Biao12aA novel chemerin receptor 1 (Chemerin1) takes part in the immune response of cobia (Rachycentron canadum)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChemerin receptor 1 (Chemerin₁) plays a critical role in innate and adaptive immune systems.

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the RcChemerin₁ was clustered together with homologous proteins from other fish species. RcChemerin₁ was constitutively expressed in a wide range of tissues (especially in immune-related tissues) with different expression levels, which suggests that the RcChemerin₁ plays different roles in un-stimulated tissues. RcChemerin₁ expression showed up-regulation in the head kidney after Vibrio harveyi challenge. Up-regulation in the head kidney and spleen was also observed after polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I: C) challenge, which suggests that RcChemerin₁ may play vital roles during bacterial and viral infection. The differential responses of immune organs to bacteria and poly I: C imply the differences in defense mechanisms against viruses and bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRachycentron canadum 3aVibrio harveyi 3adynein ATPase 3afish 3aglycosylation 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3aphylogeny 3apolyinosinic-polycytidylic acid 3asequence alignment 3ashellfish 3aspleen 0aRachycentron canadum 0aChemerin1 0aVibrio harveyi 0apoly I: C1 aWen, Caiyi1 aSun, Yanxin1 aLi, Wei1 aLiu, Chun1 aFeng, Juan1 aSu, Youlu0 tFish and shellfish immunology reports.g2022 Dec., v. 3 p.100057-dElsevier LtdwJournal:27647x2667-01197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsirep.2022.1000573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03827naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012300163500001900286520231700305592002802622650001202650650002602662650002602688650002002714650001602734650003202750650001202782650002602794650001902820650001502839650001102854650001102865650002402876650001502900650001102915650001802926650001702944651001502961700005902976700002203035700001903057700003003076700002103106773011503127856008203242852000903324655001203333IND60696192620221119140817.0200907e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069619262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Sam10aDisentangling fractional vegetation cover: Regression-based unmixing of simulated spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe next generation of spaceborne imaging spectrometers will enable hyperspectral analysis of vegetation cover across large spatial extents. Spectral unmixing provides a means to assess subpixel vegetation composition in such imagery. Here we implement a regression-based unmixing approach to generate fractional vegetation cover on a regional scale from a simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite scene derived from Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery acquired over the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA, an area with a mixture of temperate and Mediterranean climate forests, woodlands and shrublands. A hierarchical classification scheme was implemented that considered fractional cover of vegetation as a whole (vegetation vs non-vegetation), vegetation life forms (woody vs non-woody vegetation; tree vs shrub vs grass), and tree leaf type (needleleaf vs broadleaf). A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was trained using synthetically-mixed training data generated from an endmember library, and mapping accuracy was assessed using an independent validation dataset across four ecoregions. Our approach was able to effectively model landscape patterns at all levels of the class hierarchy. Site-wide map accuracy was highest when mapping generic vegetation fractions (MAE = 3.8%) and expectedly decreased at more complex hierarchy levels, with highest errors observed when separating tree and shrub fractions. Still, fraction estimates of needleleaf trees (MAE = 10.6%), broadleaf trees (MAE = 13.1%) and shrubs (MAE = 15.3%) were mapped with low overall error. Using Landsat imagery led to an average decrease in map accuracy of 1.9% when compared to hyperspectral image analysis and a maximum decrease of 3.5% when separating broadleaf and needleleaf trees across all sites. Further, a single regional model was shown to yield comparable results to multiple local ecoregion-based models, facilitating the analysis of large regions without creating a separate model for each region. Our results highlight the utility of regression-based approaches for quantitative vegetation mapping, which is of particular interest for future spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions operating across large areas at moderate spatial resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aMediterranean climate 3abotanical composition 3adata collection 3aenvironment 3afractional vegetation cover 3agrasses 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3amodels 3anormal distribution 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3aspectrometers 3aspectroscopy 3aCalifornia1 aOkujeni, Akpona1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4558-58851 aJänicke, Clemens1 aClark, Matthew1 avan der Linden, Sebastian1 aHostert, Patrick0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 246 p.111856-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245015000162520133200312592002801644650001801672650001801690650002601708650001301734650001601747650001301763650001401776650002401790650002401814650001301838650001401851650002001865650002001885650001301905650000901918650002901927650001401956653002801970653003301998653002202031653001602053700001902069700002102088700001702109700002002126700002102146700001902167700002102186773011302207856007702320852000902397655001202406IND60673448020221117010231.0191018e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067344802DNAL7 a10.1093/femspd/fty0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRishi, Praveen10aEfficacy of designer K11 antimicrobial peptide (a hybrid of melittin, cecropin A1 and magainin 2) against Acinetobacter baumannii-infected wounds  aDue to emergence of multidrug resistance in pathogens, the attention of the scientific community is now directed towards strengthening the reservoir of antimicrobial compounds. Prior to in vivo studies, the interaction and penetration of a hybrid peptide K11 in bacterial cells using confocal microscopy was assessed which was observed as early as 10 min after incubation with the peptide. Cell lysis along with leakage of cytoplasmic content was confirmed by electron microscopy. To evaluate the in vivo performance of the peptide, it was contained in carbopol hydrogel. Efficacy of the hydrogel formulation was then evaluated against Acinetobacter baumannii-infected wounds using a murine excision model. Treatment resulted in restoration of body weight, complete clearance of infection from the wound by day 7 and 99% wound enclosure by day 21, in contrast to the persistence of infection and 70% wound enclosure in the infected group. Further, this treatment resulted in a 2.6-fold decrease in the levels of malondialdehyde along with a 4.5-fold increase in the levels of catalase on day 3. Appearance of normal histo-architecture was observed in the treatment group. Based on these results, the peptide hydrogel can be exploited in future as one of the strategies for developing a topical anti-infective therapeutic agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aanimal models 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteria 3abody weight 3acatalase 3acecropins 3aconfocal microscopy 3aelectron microscopy 3aexcision 3ahydrogels 3ain vivo studies 3amalondialdehyde 3amelittin 3amice 3amultiple drug resistance 3apathogens 0aAcinetobacter baumannii 0ahybrid antimicrobial peptide 0ahydrogel dressing 0awound model1 aVashist, Tanvi1 aSharma, Avantika1 aKaur, Amrita1 aKaur, Arashdeep1 aNawanīta Kaura,1 aKaur, Indu Pal1 aTewari, Rupinder0 tPathogens and disease.g2018 Sept. 03, v. 76, no. 7dOxford University PresswJournal:27056x2049-632X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femspd/fty0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012000167300001600287500002000303520149500323592002801818650001301846650002501859650001501884650001601899650001701915650002301932650003301955650002101988650002102009650001902030650002102049650001302070650001602083650002002099650001502119650002902134650002602163700002402189700002002213700001402233700001802247700001402265700001902279700001902298700002002317700001902337700002102356773012802377856007902505852000902584655001202593IND60588529920221117233201.0180118e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058852992DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.139722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Jin‐Long10aUV‐B induced biosynthesis of a novel sunscreen compound in solar radiation and desiccation tolerant cyanobacteria  ap. 200-213.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe small‐molecule sunscreen compounds, mycosporine‐like amino acids (MAAs), have strong ultraviolet (UV) absorption and can protect cyanobacteria against UV‐B damage. However, the molecular mechanism underlying UV‐B signaling and MAA chemical diversity remain largely unclear. Here, we identified a five‐gene cluster for MAA biosynthesis in the solar radiation and desiccation tolerant cyanobacterium Nostoc flagelliforme. A LuxR family protein OrrA was identified as a positive UV‐B responsive regulator binding to the promoter region of this gene cluster. OrrA functions as an activator mediating the UV‐B induced MAA biosynthesis. Overexpression of orrA strengthened its UV‐B tolerance during desiccation, and enhanced the photosynthetic recovery upon rehydration. Heterologous expression of this gene cluster in Anabaena PCC 7120 produces the same MAA as that in field samples of N. flagelliforme. The MAA structure is assigned as mycosporine‐2‐(4‐deoxygadusolyl‐ornithine) with a molecular weight of 756 Da, the structurally unique MAA compound reported to date. This MAA was catalyzed by mysD‐mysC2‐mysC1 encoding proteins from 4‐deoxygadusol, which was synthesized through the catalysis of mysA‐mysB products. Thus, we elucidated the transcriptional mechanism for a novel type MAA biosynthesis in solar radiation and desiccation tolerant cyanobacteria, which shed light on the identification of other components for UV‐B signaling in cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aNostoc flagelliforme 3aabsorption 3aamino acids 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3aheterologous gene expression 3amolecular weight 3amultigene family 3aphotosynthesis 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3arehydration 3asolar radiation 3asunscreens 3atranscription (genetics) 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhang, Zhong‐Chun1 aYin, Xiao‐Yue1 aChen, Min1 aHao, Fu‐Hua1 aWang, Kai1 aFeng, Jun‐Li1 aXu, Hai‐Feng1 aYin, Yan‐Chao1 aTang, Hui‐Ru1 aQiu, Bao‐Sheng0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2018 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.200-213dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.139723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04114naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245010500202500001900307520228500326592002802611650002002639650004702659650002002706650001202726650001602738650001802754650000902772650001402781650001602795650001902811650001502830653001802845653001102863653001902874653000902893653000902902653004502911653003302956653002202989653000803011653001703019653002203036653002103058700005303079700002003132700006103152700002203213700002603235700005403261700001503315773011503330856008203445852000903527655001203536IND60696192920221119140710.0200907e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069619292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadri, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2910-439112aA global near-real-time soil moisture index monitor for food security using integrated SMOS and SMAP  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil Moisture (SM) is a direct measure of agricultural drought. While there are several global SM indices, none of them directly use SM observations in a near-real-time capacity and as an operational tool. This paper presents a near-real-time global SM index monitor based on integrated SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) remote sensing data. We make use of the short period (2015–2018) of SMAP datasets in combination with two approaches—Cumulative Distribution Function Mapping (CDFM) and Bayesian conditional process—and integrate them with SMOS data in a way that SMOS data is consistent with SMAP. The integrated SMOS and SMAP (SMOS/SMAP) has an increased global revisit frequency and a period of record from 2010 to the present. A four-parameter Beta distribution was fitted to the SMOS/SMAP dataset for each calendar month of each grid cell at ~36 km resolution for the period from 2010 to 2018. We used an asymptotic method that guarantees the values of the bounding parameters of the Beta distribution will envelop both the smallest and largest observed values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test showed that more grids globally will pass if the integrated dataset is from the Bayesian conditional approach. A daily global SM index map is generated and posted online based on translating each grid's integrated SM value for that day to a corresponding probability percentile relevant to the particular calendar month from 2010 to 2018. For validation, we use the Canadian Prairies Ecozone (CPE). We compare the integrated SM with the SMAP core validation and RISMA sites from ISMN, compare our indices with other models (VIC, ESA's CCI SM v04.4 integrated satellite data, and SPI-1), and make a two-by-two comparison of candidate indices using heat maps and summary CDF statistics. Furthermore, we visually compare our global SM-based index maps with those produced by other organizations. Our Global SM Index Monitor (GSMIM) performed, in many tests, similarly to the CCI's product SM index but with the advantage of being a near-real-time tool, which has applications for identifying evolving drought for food security conditions, insurance, policymaking, and crop planning especially for the remote parts of the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3adata collection 3adrought 3aenvironment 3afood security 3aheat 3ainsurance 3aprobability 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 0aSoil moisture 0aGlobal 0aNear-real-time 0aSMAP 0aSMOS 0aCumulative distribution function mapping 0aBayesian conditional process 0aCanadian prairies 0aVIC 0aESA's CCI SM 0aBeta distribution 0aData integration1 aPan, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3350-87191 aWada, Yoshihide1 aVergopolan, Noemi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7298-05091 aSheffield, Justin1 aFamiglietti, James S.1 aKerr, Yann1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6352-17171 aWood, Eric0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 246 p.111864-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245008900166300001600255520229600271592002802567650002302595650001402618650001502632650001902647650002302666650001802689650001502707650002302722650001102745650003002756650001502786651001702801700001902818773010002837856008502937852000903022655001203031IND4466824820221122223340.0141110e20110930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446682482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, Asim10aScales and locations of time stability of soil water storage in a hummocky landscape  ap. 100-112.  aDifferent factors and processes operating in different intensities and at different space–time scales result in strong spatio-temporal variability in soil water storage. However, there is similarity between the overall spatial patterns of soil water storage measured at different times, which has been identified as time stability. The objective of this study was to examine the scales and locations of time stability of soil-water storage spatial patterns at different seasons and depths in a hummocky landscape. Soil water storage was measured up to 140cm depth over a 4-year period using time domain reflectometry and a neutron probe along a transect in the St. Denis National Wildlife Area, Saskatchewan, Canada. The transect was 576m long with 128 sampling points (4.5m sampling interval) and traversed several knolls and depressions. There were high Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between any two-measurement series, indicating strong time stability of the spatial pattern of soil water storage. The spatial patterns of soil-water storage from the same season (intra-season) had stronger time stability than those from different seasons (inter-season). Strong time stability was also observed between the measurement series from a season of 1year and a measurement series from the same season of another year (inter-annual). Wavelet coherency analysis indicated that the large-scale (>72m) spatial pattern was time stable irrespective of seasons due to the alternating knolls and depressions in the study area. There were also near replica spatial patterns at small (<18m) and medium (18–72m) scales during summer and fall, possibly resulting from evapotranspiration of vegetation established in mid-summer. The inter-season time stability was only present within large depressions with long slopes and fewer landform elements. However, intra-season and inter-annual time stability was observed at all scales and locations. The time stability of surface soil water storage was different from that of the whole soil profile, indicating a depth dependence of time stability. The change in the scales and locations of spatial pattern of soil water storage indicates the change in the hydrological processes, which can be used to identify the change in the sampling domain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevapotranspiration 3alandforms 3alandscapes 3aneutron probes 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3asummer 3atime domain reflectometry 3avegetation 3aSaskatchewan1 aSi, Bing Cheng0 tJournal of hydrology.g2011 Sept. 30, v. 408, no. 1-2 p.100-112dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2011.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010400168300001600272520126400288592002801552650001001580650001501590650001101605650002401616650001601640650001001656650002501666653001901691653000801710653001901718653002101737700002301758700002101781700001701802700002101819700002001840700002301860700002401883700002101907700001901928773012401947856008202071852000902153655001202162IND4476403320221122222703.0200513e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447640332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-010-0234-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Kazukiyo10aEstimation of mean tree height using small-footprint airborne LiDAR without a digital terrain model  ap. 425-431.  aIn order to estimate mean tree height using small-footprint airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, a digital terrain model (DTM), which is a continuous elevation model of the ground surface, is usually required. However, generating accurate DTMs in mountainous forests using only the LiDAR data is laborious and time consuming, because it requires human-assisted methods, especially in the forests with poor laser penetration rates. Based on our previous finding that a hypothetical continuous surface model passing through the predominant tree tops (hereafter, called the “top surface model” or TSM) might be nearly parallel to a DTM, we assumed that the vertical difference between the TSM and the ground return was the mean tree height. According to this assumption, we propose a new methodology that does not require a DTM to estimate mean tree height. This method completely, automatically, and directly estimates mean tree height (MTHE) from the LiDAR data without requiring a regression analysis using reference data. From the relationships between the MTHE and the observed mean tree height (MTHO) in different hinoki cypress forests, we demonstrate that this method effectively estimates the mean tree height with nearly 1-m accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3alidar 3atree crown 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3amethodology 3atrees 3aChamaecyparis obtusa 0aAirborne LiDAR 0aDTM 0aHinoki cypress 0aMean tree height1 aTakahashi, Tomoaki1 aMiyachi, Yousuke1 aKondo, Naoto1 aMorita, Shinichi1 aNakao, Motohiko1 aShibayama, Takashi1 aTakaichi, Yoshiyuki1 aTsuzuku, Masashi1 aMurate, Naoaki0 tJournal of forest research.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 16, no. 6 p.425-431dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-010-0234-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015800165520205900323592002802382650002802410650002302438650001002461650001602471650001202487650001802499650001602517650001502533650001502548650001402563650001202577650001902589650002402608653003202632653001602664653002302680700001402703700002102717700001802738773010802756856008202864852000902946655001202955IND60745837620221121110735.0211029e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074583762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2021.1013912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBafundo, K.W.14aThe effects of a quillaja and yucca combination on performance and carcass traits of coccidia-vaccinated broilers exposed to an enteric disease challenge  aA series of 6 floor pen trials was conducted to determine the effects of a quillaja and yucca combination product on the performance and carcass traits of growing broiler chickens vaccinated for coccidiosis at the hatchery. In each of the trials graded levels (0, 250, and 500 ppm) of a quillaja and yucca combination (QY) were fed to Ross 708 broilers for the duration of each 42 d test. Trials were arranged in completely randomized block designs involving a minimum of 11 blocks per trial. At the start of each trial, pens contained 55 broilers. In order to provide each bird with an enteric disease challenge, 5 kg commercial broiler litter containing 10⁴ CFU Clostridium perfringens per gram was placed in each pen. In addition, the sporulated oocysts of Eimeria acervulina and E. maxima were added to each pen at the outset of each test. At d 21 of the trials, coccidial lesion scores, mortality and performance were determined; final performance and total mortality were assessed at 42 d. At the completion of each test, 10 birds of average body weight per pen were selected for carcass evaluations; whole and chilled carcass yield were determined, and pre- and post-chill breast measurements were made. A combined analysis of the results of the 6 trials (75 replications per treatment) was used to determine treatment effects and each variable was assessed by linear regression analysis. Results indicated that QY significantly reduced mortality and coccidial lesions scores at d 21 (P < 0.05). Performance was significantly improved by both levels of QY at 21 and 42 d, and significant linear effects were observed for these variables (P < 0.05). All carcass characteristics were significantly improved by QY administration and significant linear responses were observed for each carcass variable (P < 0.05). These results indicate that by reducing intestinal disease challenge, QY provided linear improvements in performance. In addition, QY positively affected carcass parameters as each variable responded linearly to QY feeding (P < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3aEimeria acervulina 3aYucca 3abody weight 3abreasts 3acarcass yield 3acoccidiosis 3ahatcheries 3aintestines 3amortality 3aoocysts 3apoultry manure 3aregression analysis 0aquillaja and yucca saponins 0aperformance 0anecrotic enteritis1 aDuerr, I.1 aMcNaughton, J.L.1 aJohnson, A.B.0 tPoultry science.g2021 Oct., v. 100, no. 10 p.101391-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2021.1013913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245004600173300001600219520126600235592002801501650001501529650002101544650001401565650002101579650001701600650002001617650001201637650001701649650001301666653001501679653002001694653002301714700002501737700002601762700002601788700003001814773010101844856008501945852000902030655001202039IND60653706520221120023631.0200712e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065370652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2019.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTortajada, Agustin14aThe role of complement in IgA nephropathy  ap. 123-132.  aIgA nephropathy (IgAN) is common and often progresses to end stage renal disease. IgAN encompasses a wide range of histology and clinical features. IgAN pathogenesis is incompletely understood; the current multi-hit hypothesis of IgAN pathogenesis does not explain the range of glomerular inflammation and renal injury associated with mesangial IgA deposition. Although associations between IgAN and glomerular and circulating markers of complement activation are established, the mechanism of complement activation and contribution to glomerular inflammation and injury are not defined. Recent identification of specific complement pathways and proteins in severe IgAN cases had advanced our understanding of complement in IgAN pathogenesis. In particular, a growing body of evidence implicates the complement factor H related proteins 1 and 5 and lectin pathway as pathogenic in a subset of patients with severe disease. These data suggest complement deregulation and activity may be dominant drivers of renal injury in IgAN. Thereby, markers of complement activation may identify IgAN patients likely to progress to significant renal impairment and complement inhibition may emerge as an effective method of preventing and reducing glomerular injury in IgAN.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplement 3adisease severity 3ahistology 3aimmunoglobulin A 3ainflammation 3akidney diseases 3alectins 3apathogenesis 3apatients 0aComplement 0aIgA nephropathy 0aGlomerulonephritis1 aGutiérrez, Eduardo,1 aPickering, Matthew C.1 aPraga Terente, Manuel1 aMedjeral-Thomas, Nicholas0 tMolecular immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 114 p.123-132dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024002800113040001800141100002300159245011300182300001600295520219700311592002802508650002202536650003002558650002502588650002702613650001502640650001102655650002102666650001802687650001402705653001502719653001302734653002602747653002502773653001302798653001402811653001402825700002002839700002002859700002502879700002202904700002002926773010402946856011203050856007603162961001303238852000903251655001203260IND4373578920221121041437.0151127e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437357892DNAL7 a10113/171762hdl7 a10.1614/WS-05-010R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoger, Clifford H.10aAssessment of two nondestructive assays for detecting glyphosate resistance in horseweed (Conyza canadensis)  ap. 438-445.  aTwo rapid, nondestructive assays were developed and tested for their potential in differentiating glyphosate-resistant from glyphosate-susceptible biotypes of horseweed. In one assay, leaves of glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible corn, cotton, and soybean plants, as well as glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible horseweed plants, were dipped in solutions of 0, 300, 600, and 1,200 mg ae L⁻⁻¹ glyphosate for 3 d, and subsequent injury was evaluated. In the second assay, plant sensitivity to glyphosate was evaluated in vivo by incubating excised leaf disc tissue from the same plants used in the first assay in 0.7, 1.3, 2.6, 5.3, 10.6, 21.1, 42.3, and 84.5 mg ae L⁻⁻¹ glyphosate solutions for 16 h and measuring shikimate levels with a spectrophotometer. The leaf dip assay differentiated between glyphosate-resistant and -susceptible crops and horseweed biotypes. The 600 mg L⁻⁻¹ rate of glyphosate was more consistent in differentiating resistant and susceptible plants compared with the 300 and 1,200 mg L⁻⁻¹ rates. The in vivo assay detected significant differences between susceptible and glyphosate-resistant plants of all species. Shikimate accumulated in a glyphosate dose––dependent manner in leaf discs from susceptible crops, but shikimate did not accumulate in leaf discs from resistant crops, and levels were similar to nontreated leaf discs. Shikimate accumulated at high (≥≥ 21.1 mg ae L⁻⁻¹) concentrations of glyphosate in leaf discs from all horseweed biotypes. Shikimate accumulated at low glyphosate concentrations (≤≤ 10.6 mg L⁻⁻¹) in leaf discs from susceptible horseweed biotypes but not in resistant biotypes. Both assays were able to differentiate resistant from susceptible biotypes of horseweed and could have utility for screening other weed populations for resistance to glyphosate.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; horseweed, Conyza canadensis (L.)

Biological nitrogen fixation is performed by a diverse guild of bacteria and archaea (diazotrophs), which can be free‐living or symbionts. Free‐living diazotrophs are widely distributed in the environment, yet our knowledge about their identity and ecophysiology is still limited. A major challenge in investigating this guild is inferring activity from genetic data as this process is highly regulated. To address this challenge, we evaluated and improved several ¹⁵N‐based methods for detecting N₂ fixation activity (with a focus on soil samples) and studying active diazotrophs. We compared the acetylene reduction assay and the ¹⁵N₂ tracer method and demonstrated that the latter is more sensitive in samples with low activity. Additionally, tracing ¹⁵N into microbial RNA provides much higher sensitivity compared to bulk soil analysis. Active soil diazotrophs were identified with a ¹⁵N‐RNA‐SIP approach optimized for environmental samples and benchmarked to ¹⁵N‐DNA‐SIP. Lastly, we investigated the feasibility of using SIP‐Raman microspectroscopy for detecting ¹⁵N‐labelled cells. Taken together, these tools allow identifying and investigating active free‐living diazotrophs in a highly sensitive manner in diverse environments, from bulk to the single‐cell level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aRNA 3aacetylene reduction 3aecophysiology 3alabeling techniques 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3astable isotopes 3asymbionts1 aPanhölzl, Christopher1 aGabriel, Raphael1 aHerbold, Craig1 aWanek, Wolfgang1 aRichter, Andreas1 aEichorst, Stephanie A.1 aWoebken, Dagmar0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2018 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.44-61dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.139543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012100165300001600286520112000302592002801422650002501450650002301475650001501498650002101513650001201534653002301546653001601569653001601585653002201601653001301623700006101636773011401697856008401811852000901895655001201904IND60639362720221123030419.0190620e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063936272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSever, Ivan10aAssessing recreational values of a peri-urban nature park by synthesizing perceptions and preferences of trail users  ap. 101-108.  aOutdoor recreation in natural areas generally contributes to physiological and psychological restoration, but the increasing popularity of urban green spaces raises concerns for the benefits they provide. To assess trail users' preferences for recreational conditions in a peri-urban nature park, a stated preference approach in the form of the discrete choice experiment was applied, and accompanied with a best-worst scaling experiment that assessed the perception of crowding, i.e. the relative impact of recreational setting attributes on the sense of crowding. The two experiments were linked to investigate the influence of crowding perceptions on the sensitivity to crowding. Trail users' perception of ‘trail use level’, ‘hut occupancy’ and ‘noise from road traffic’ significantly influenced their sensitivity to ‘crowding on the trail’ and ‘intensity of road traffic’. Trail use and traffic noise were identified as sensitive recreational conditions, and should be given a priority when managing recreational use pressure in the park and maintaining or improving its recreational value.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreen infrastructure 3aoutdoor recreation 3apsychology 3arecreation areas 3atraffic 0aOutdoor recreation 0aPerceptions 0aPreferences 0aChoice experiment 0aCrowding1 aVerbič, Miroslav1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5506-09730 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2019 June, v. 63 p.101-108dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2019.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245010400162300001800266520100100284592002801285650001601313650001501329650002601344650001601370650002101386650000901407650002601416650001701442650001901459650002201478650002101500700001601521700001401537700005201551773017001603856008001773852000901853655001201862IND60601933020221121120101.0180709e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060193302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b049202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Yanbei10aPreparation of Metal–Organic Frameworks and Their Application as Flame Retardants for Polystyrene  ap. 2036-2045.  aIn this work, iron-based and cobalt-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. The obtained MOFs were added into polystyrene (PS) as flame retardants for the first time. The results of thermal gravimetric analysis and cone calorimetry indicated the addition of MOFs significantly enhanced the thermostability and flame retardancy of the PS composites. Compared with that of neat PS, greater than 14% and 28% decreases in the peak heat release rate were observed for PS/Fe-MOF and PS/Co-MOF, respectively, suggesting a flame retardant effect of MOFs. Based on thermogravimetric analysis–infrared spectrometry results and the analysis of combustion residues, the possible mechanism of the enhanced thermostability and flame retardancy of the PS composites was proposed as the combination of thermal barrier effect and catalytic effect of MOFs, which would allow promising application in the development of fire safety polymer materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3acombustion 3acoordination polymers 3afire safety 3aflame retardants 3aheat 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3apolystyrenes 3aprocess design 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aHu, Weizhao1 aGui, Zhou1 aHu, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0753-54300 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 56, no. 8 p.2036-2045dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.6b049203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245019500164300001400359500002000373520149600393592002801889650002701917650001901944650001501963650001201978650002901990650001502019650001202034650000902046650001102055650002102066650001102087650001402098650001402112650001302126650002202139700001802161700001902179700002302198700001702221700002002238700001802258700002202276700003302298700002002331773012602351856007902477852000902556655001202565IND60588530220221117233036.0180118e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058853022DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.139942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbers, Pieter10aCatabolic task division between two near‐isogenic subpopulations co‐existing in a herbicide‐degrading bacterial consortium: consequences for the interspecies consortium metabolic model  ap. 85-96.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVariovorax sp. WDL1 mediates hydrolysis of the herbicide linuron into 3,4‐dichloroaniline (DCA) and N,O‐dimethylhydroxylamine in a tripartite bacterial consortium with Comamonas testosteroni WDL7 and Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL6. Although strain WDL1 contains the dcaQTA1A2B operon for DCA oxidation, this conversion is mainly performed by WDL7. Phenotypic diversification observed in WDL1 cultures and scrutiny of the WDL1 genome suggest that WDL1 cultures consist of two dedicated subpopulations, i.e., a linuron‐hydrolysing subpopulation (Lin + DCA‐) and a DCA‐oxidizing subpopulation (Lin‐DCA+). Whole genome analysis of strains representing the respective subpopulations revealed that they are identical, aside from the presence of hylA (in Lin + DCA‐ cells) and the dcaQTA1A2B gene cluster (in Lin‐DCA+ cells), and that these catabolic gene modules replace each other at exactly the same locus on a 1380 kb extra‐chromosomal element that shows plasmid gene functions including genes for transferability by conjugation. Both subpopulations proliferate in consortium biofilms fed with linuron, but Lin + DCA‐ cells compose the main WDL1 subpopulation. Our observations instigated revisiting the interactions within the consortium and suggest that the physical separation of two essential linuron catabolic gene clusters in WDL1 by mutually exclusive integration in the same mobile genetic element is key to the existence of WDL1 in a consortium mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aComamonas testosteroni 3aHyphomicrobium 3aVariovorax 3abiofilm 3agene regulatory networks 3ahydrolysis 3alinuron 3aloci 3amodels 3amultigene family 3aoperon 3aoxidation 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 3asequence analysis1 aLood, Cédric1 aÖzturk, Basak1 aHoremans, Benjamin1 aLavigne, Rob1 avan Noort, Vera1 aDe Mot, René1 aMarchal, Kathleen1 aSanchez‐Rodriguez, Aminael1 aSpringael, Dirk0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2018 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.85-96dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.139943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015600166520125000322592002801572650002901600650001401629650001701643650001401660650000701674650001301681650001601694650001501710653002101725653003101746653001501777653002201792653000701814653002601821700001501847700001701862700001901879700001701898700001801915700002001933773011801953856008602071852000902157655001202166IND60766353420221122221535.0221004e20220415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076635342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1146642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xingyu10aApplication of sulfate radicals-based advanced oxidation technology in degradation of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs): Recent advances and prospects  aThe large amount of trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) in wastewater has caused serious impacts on human health. In the past few years, Sulfate radical (SO₄•⁻) based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) are widely recognized for their high removal rates of recalcitrant TrOCs from water. Peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and persulfate (PS) are stable and non-toxic strong oxidizing oxidants and can act as excellent SO₄•⁻ precursors. Compared with hydroxyl radicals(·OH)-based methods, SR-AOPs have a series of advantages, such as long half-life and wide pH range, the oxidation capacity of SO₄•⁻ approaches or even exceeds that of ·OH under suitable conditions. In this review, we present the progress of activating PS/PMS to remove TrOCs by different methods. These methods include activation by transition metal, ultrasound, UV, etc. Possible activation mechanisms and influencing factors such as pH during the activation are discussed. Finally, future activation studies of PS/PMS are summarized and prospected. This review summarizes previous experiences and presents the current status of SR-AOPs application for TrOCs removal. Misconceptions in research are avoided and a research basis for the removal of TrOCs is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental management 3ahalf life 3ahuman health 3aoxidation 3apH 3asulfates 3aultrasonics 3awastewater 0aSulfate radicals 0aTrace organic contaminants 0aPersulfate 0aTransition metals 0apH 0aDegradation mechanism1 aJie, Borui1 aLin, Huidong1 aDeng, Zhongpei1 aQian, Junyao1 aYang, Yiqiong1 aZhang, Xiaodong0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Apr. 15, v. 308 p.114664-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1146643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014200169520125100311592002801562650003501590650001101625650001001636650002301646651001201669653001801681653002201699653002401721653001901745653001701764700002001781700002901801700003001830700002801860773011701888856008202005852000902087655001202096IND60755744620221120112113.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075574462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1260882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDang Vu, Hoai Nam14aThe impact of a legal trade in farmed tigers on consumer preferences for tiger bone glue – Evidence from a choice experiment in Vietnam  aDemand for tiger parts and products has fuelled the poaching of wild tigers. As the supply of wild tigers has become scarce, tiger farming has emerged as an alternative source and proliferated in several Asian countries with unclear implications of a legalized trade in farmed tigers on wild tiger demand. We conducted a choice experiment with 228 Vietnamese tiger bone glue consumers investigating their preferences and trade-offs for different attributes of their purchase choice, including legality, source, purity, and price. We calculated consumers' willingness to pay for each attribute level under the current trade ban and in a hypothetical legal trade. Consumers preferred and were willing to pay more for wild than farmed tiger glue and a higher proportion of tiger bone in the glue. Consumers also preferred legal over illegal sufficiently for most to switch from illegal wild to legal farmed tiger. Hence, a legal trade will shift preferences significantly towards farmed tiger glue from legal sources but will not eradicate demand for wild tigers, likely leading to the parallel operation of legal and illegal markets. We discuss the implications of the results for conserving wild tigers through efforts to manage demand in Vietnam.  aPublisher supplied data 3anatural resources conservation 3aprices 3atrade 3awillingness to pay 3aVietnam 0aTiger farming 0aChoice experiment 0aTiger glue consumer 0aWildlife trade 0aConservation1 aGadbert, Kasper1 aVikkelsø Nielsen, Julie1 aReinhardt Nielsen, Martin1 aBredahl Jacobsen, Jette0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2022 Feb., v. 65 p.126088-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1260883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245010700216500001900323520133500342592002801677650001601705650001001721650001901731650001301750650001501763650002901778653002101807653002801828653002701856653002601883653003301909700002201942700002201964700002501986700002302011700002502034700002502059700002902084700002102113700002102134700002602155700002702181773011502208856008202323852000902405655001202414IND60696193220221119140548.0200907e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069619322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchultz-Fellenz, Emily S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8181-500310aHigh-resolution surface topographic change analyses to characterize a series of underground explosions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe understanding of subsurface events that cannot be directly observed is dependent on the ability to relate surface-based observations to subsurface processes. This is particularly important for nuclear explosion monitoring, as any future clandestine tests will likely be underground. We collected ground-based lidar and optical imagery using remote, very-low-altitude unmanned aerial system platforms, before and after several underground high explosive experiments. For the lidar collections, we used a terrestrial lidar scanner to obtain high-resolution point clouds and create digital elevation models (DEMs). For the imagery collections, we used structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques and a dense grid of surveyed ground control points to create high-resolution DEMs. Comparisons between the pre- and post-experiment DEMs indicate changes in surface topography that vary between explosive experiments with varying yield and depth parameters. Our work shows that the relationship between explosive yield and the extent of observable surface change differs from the standard scaled-depth-of-burial model. This suggests that the surface morphological change from underground high explosive experiments can help constrain the experiments' yield and depth, and may impact how such activities are monitored and verified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3alidar 3aphotogrammetry 3ascanners 3atopography 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aChange detection 0aUnmanned aerial systems 0aUnderground explosions 0aStructure-from-motion 0aNuclear explosion monitoring1 aSwanson, Erika M.1 aSussman, Aviva J.1 aCoppersmith, Ryan T.1 aKelley, Richard E.1 aMiller, Elizabeth D.1 aCrawford, Brandon M.1 aLavadie-Bulnes, Anita F.1 aCooley, James R.1 aVigil, Steven R.1 aTownsend, Margaret J.1 aLarotonda, Jennifer M.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Sept. 01, v. 246 p.111871-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1118713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002800192245007400220300001800294506007600312520117400388592002801562506003701590650001501627650001901642650001401661650001001675650001101685650001101696650002501707650001501732650001501747650001901762700001901781700001901800700002001819700001801839773012001857856008501977852000902062655001202071IND60624711620221207120822.0181206e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062471162DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw0152doi7 aPMC48665212pmcid7 a267876662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrăgan, Monica-Andreea10aGeneValidator: identify problems with protein-coding gene predictions  ap. 1559-1561.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSummary: Genomes of emerging model organisms are now being sequenced at very low cost. However, obtaining accurate gene predictions remains challenging: even the best gene prediction algorithms make substantial errors and can jeopardize subsequent analyses. Therefore, many predicted genes must be time-consumingly visually inspected and manually curated. We developed GeneValidator (GV) to automatically identify problematic gene predictions and to aid manual curation. For each gene, GV performs multiple analyses based on comparisons to gene sequences from large databases. The resulting report identifies problematic gene predictions and includes extensive statistics and graphs for each prediction to guide manual curation efforts. GV thus accelerates and enhances the work of biocurators and researchers who need accurate gene predictions from newly sequenced genomes. Availability and implementation: GV can be used through a web interface or in the command-line. GV is open-source (AGPL), available at https://wurmlab.github.io/tools/genevalidator.

Furthermore, there are a restricted arsenal of antifungals available and an increase in the development of resistance to antifungal drugs. Because of these disadvantages, the search for new antifungal agents in natural sources has increased. The development of these new antifungal drugs involves various steps and methodologies. The evaluation of the in vitro antifungal activity and cytotoxicity are the first steps in the screening. There is also the possibility of antifungal combinations to improve the therapy and reduce toxicity. Despite that, the application of the new antifungal candidate could be used in association with photodynamic therapy or using nanotechnology as an ally. In vivo tests can be performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity using conventional and alternative animal models. In this work, we review the methods available for the evaluation of the antifungal activity and safety of natural products, as well as the recent advances of new technology in the application of natural products for antifungal therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantifungal agents 3aantifungal properties 3acytotoxicity 3afungi 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ananotechnology 3apatients 3ascreening 3atherapeutics 0aFungi 0aNatural compounds 0aAntifungal activity 0aEfficacy 0aMethods1 aSangalli-Leite, Fernanda1 ade Lacorte Singulani, Junya1 ade Paula e Silva, Ana Carolina Alves1 aCosta-Orlandi, Caroline Barcelos1 aFusco-Almeida, Ana Marisa1 aMendes-Giannini, Maria José Soares0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2016 Apr., v. 123 p.68-78dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03900naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011500176300001600291520266300307592002802970650001202998650001503010650000803025650001503033650001103048650001203059650002303071650001403094650001403108651001103122653003603133653001003169653001103179653002203190653002403212653001003236700002303246700001903269773008303288856008603371852000903457655001203466IND60563250020221119093728.0170719e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056325002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRydningen, Tom Arne10aSeabed morphology and sedimentary processes on high-gradient trough mouth fans offshore Troms, northern Norway  ap. 205-219.  aTrough mouth fans (TMF) situated at the mouths of formerly glaciated cross-shelf troughs are important paleoclimatic archives. Whereas the sedimentary processes of large, low-gradient TMFs have received considerable interest, little attention has been paid to the other end member of this landform class, i.e. TMFs with higher slope gradients. Detailed swath-bathymetric data and seismic profiles from the continental margin offshore Troms, northern Norway cover three high-gradient TMFs (the Andfjorden, Malangsdjupet and Rebbenesdjupet TMFs; slope gradients generally between 1° and 15°), as well as inter-fan areas, which include two submarine canyons (the Andøya and Senja Canyon) and the Malangsgrunnen inter-fan slope. The present-day morphologies of the Andfjorden and Malangsdjupet TMFs have evolved from sediment transport and distribution through gully-channel complexes. The Andfjorden TMF has later been affected by a large submarine landslide that remobilized much of these complexes. The Rebbenesdjupet TMF is dominated by a number of small and relatively shallow slide scars, which are inferred to be related to small-scale sediment failure of glaciomarine and/or contouritic sediments. The canyons cut into the adjacent TMFs, and turbidity currents originating on the fans widened and deepened the canyons during downslope flow. The Malangsgrunnen shelf break and inter-fan slope acted as a funnel for turbidity currents originating on the upper slope, forming a dendritic pattern of gullies. A conceptual model for the high-gradient TMFs on the Troms margin has been compiled. The main sediment input onto the TMFs has occurred during peak glacials when the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet reached the shelf edge. The overall convex fan form and progradational seismic facies show that these glacigenic deposits were repeatedly distributed onto the fan. On the Andfjorden and Malangsdjupet TMFs, gully-channel complexes occur within such deposits. It is thus inferred that the steep slope of these TMFs promoted rapid transformation from small-scale slumps and debris flows on the upper slope, into partly erosive turbidity currents. These flows continued into the deep sea, thus promoting efficient sediment by-pass across the TMFs. This model can be applied to other TMFs situated at the mouths of other glaciated cross-shelf troughs. In contrast, low-gradient TMFs are found to be dominated by glacigenic debris flow deposits. Furthermore, gully-channel complexes demonstrating the presence of erosive turbidity currents on high-gradient TMFs are rare on low-gradient TMFs. Large submarine landslides occur at both high- and low-gradient TMFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanyons 3ageophysics 3aice 3alandslides 3amodels 3aravines 3asediment transport 3asediments 3aturbidity 3aNorway 0aHigh-gradient trough mouth fans 0aGully 0aCanyon 0aContinental slope 0aSubmarine landslide 0aTroms1 aLaberg, Jan Sverre1 aKolstad, Vidar0 tGeomorphology.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 246 p.205-219dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245013500198500002000333520118100353592002801534650001601562650001101578650001401589650001401603650001201617650001101629650001001640650002401650650002201674650002001696700002301716700002401739773012301763856007301886852000901959655001201968IND60686233720221122094901.0200313e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068623372DNAL7 a10.1111/ivb.122782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil, Damián G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8084-218110aSex‐specific differences in gonopore and gonadal growth trajectories in the brooding sea urchin, Abatus cavernosus (Spatangoida)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe heart urchin Abatus cavernosus shows sexual dimorphism characterized by the development of external brood pouches and the enlargement of gonopores in brooding females. Relationships between body size, gonopore size, and gonadal maturation in each sex were examined for inflection points using piecewise regression models (PRM). Opening of the gonopore occurred at 15.5 mm test length. Inflection points in the gonadal growth and gonopore diameter trajectories were clustered at smaller sizes in males (23 and 24.2 mm, respectively) than in females (25.1 and 25.9 mm), indicating sex‐specific differences in sexual maturation. Gonopore growth showed positive allometry at pre‐adult stages of development in both sexes, but isometry and negative allometry in adult females and males, respectively. Gonadal growth was initiated at smaller sizes and proceeded at a higher rate with increasing body size in males than in females. Identification of inflection points in gonopore and gonadal growth trajectories, using objective PRM, allows the determination of life stages and sexual maturation for individuals, thus providing a complementary tool for population studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpatangoida 3aadults 3aallometry 3abody size 3afemales 3agonads 3amales 3aregression analysis 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual maturity1 aZaixso, Héctor E.1 aTolosano, Javier A.0 tInvertebrate biology.g2020 Mar., v. 139, no. 1 p.e12278-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867081x1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.122783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245010500197300001800302500002000320520133900340592002801679596006601707596008501773596007701858596006601935596006602001596006602067596006602133650001302199650001902212650001102231650001302242650001302255650001402268650001402282700005702296700001802353700001702371700001502388700005702403773013202460856007702592852000902669655001202678IND60789842920221118063037.0220822e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078984292DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JB0142442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7888-224010aPressure and Fluid Effect on Frequency‐Dependent Elastic Moduli in Fully Saturated Tight Sandstone  ap. 8925-8942.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe developed a system to explore the effects of pressure and fluid viscosity on the dispersion and attenuation of fully saturated tight sandstones, especially at seismic frequencies. Calibration of the new system revealed that the system can operate reliably at frequencies of [2–200, 10⁶] Hz. Tight sandstone with a “crack–pore” microstructure was tested under nitrogen gas (dry), brine, and glycerin saturation. A frequency‐dependent effect was not found for the dry case. However, apparent dispersion and attenuation for the undrained/unrelaxed transition was clearly observed for sample under brine or glycerin saturation, the magnitude of which was largely suppressed by increasing effective pressure. The measurement results illustrated that increasing the fluid viscosity or the effective pressure will shift the dispersion curve to the lower frequency range. A simple squirt‐flow model with dual‐porosity scheme was used to compare with the measurement results. Although the estimated values deviated slightly from the data, the trend fitted the saturated data relatively well, especially at low effective pressures. Therefore, considering the crack–pore microstructure of the tight sandstone, dispersion and attenuation are induced predominantly by the squirt‐flow stiffening effect from cracks to pores.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013CB228600cNational Key Basic Research Development Program  aKYJJ2012‐05‐02cScience Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing  aZX20150095cScience Foundation of China University of Petroleum, Beijing  a41274138cNation Natural Science Foundation of China Research  a41574103cNation Natural Science Foundation of China Research  a41330319cNation Natural Science Foundation of China Research  a41774143cNation Natural Science Foundation of China Research 3aglycerol 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aresearch 3asandstone 3aviscosity1 aZhao, Jianguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6361-59321 aTang, Genyang1 aZhao, Liming1 aMa, Xiaoyi1 aWang, Shangxu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0265-56790 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Nov., v. 122, no. 11 p.8925-8942dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JB0142443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006400152245007800216300001600294520138400310592002801694650001601722650001601738650002001754650001301774650001701787650003801804650001901842650001901861650001101880650002401891650003301915650001301948650001801961653003101979653002102010653001902031653002702050653002102077653001402098700002202112700002202134773010602156856008702262852000902349655001202358IND60611249920221119005338.0200712e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061124992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDüregger, Katharina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5563-212610aDevelopment and evaluation of a spray applicator for platelet-rich plasma  ap. 214-223.  aAutologous platelet-rich blood derivatives are used in a variety of medical fields in which the enhancement of wound healing by applying growth factors released from platelets is an especially promising application. Treatment of the whole surface of large-area wounds with a small volume of blood derivatives is best achieved by spraying. In this study, we present a compact and self-contained spraying device without external connections such as a power supply or compressor. The biocompatible propellant R134a is used to aspirate and atomize the blood derivatives. A 3D-printed, two-substance nozzle functions as the operating unit, throttle, mixing zone and atomization unit. The spray characteristics were evaluated via experimental flow volume, cone and droplet size measurements. Biological evaluation was performed by flow cytometry comparing platelet activation in the blood derivatives before and after spraying, and PDGF ELISA comparing growth factor release, respectively. Homogeneity and morphology of the sprayed blood cells were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the developed spraying device has excellent spray characteristics with low mechanical impact on the cellular components of the blood derivatives. Our spraying device is a promising tool for applying evenly distributed platelet-rich blood derivatives to treatment sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplicators 3aatomization 3ablood platelets 3acolloids 3adroplet size 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3agrowth factors 3amixing 3aplatelet activation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspraying 3atissue repair 0aPlatelet-rich plasma (PRP) 0aSpray applicator 0aGrowth factors 0aAdditive manufacturing 0aTwo-fluid nozzle 0aPlatelets1 aGäble, Alexander1 aEblenkamp, Markus0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 171 p.214-223dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03755naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245018800160300001800348520216800366592002802534596005902562596005902621596007502680596007902755650001302834650002202847650003002869650001902899650001302918650002402931650001502955650002102970650001002991650001603001651001003017700001803027700005603045700001803101773011103119856008203230852000903312655001203321IND60671438820221118203852.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067143882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-019-01871-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hao10aSensitivity of seed germination to temperature of a relict tree species from different origins along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients: implications for response to climate change  ap. 1435-1445.  aKEY MESSAGE: Seeds of a relict tree species collected from high latitudes were more sensitive to temperature and warming could accelerate germination. Seed germination is a crucial process in a plant life cycle and is highly vulnerable to environmental change. Studying among-population variation in seed germination in response to environmental and geographic gradients is an important tool, allowing us to understand how plants adapt to different environmental conditions and to predict population dynamics under future climate change. Here, we collected seeds of Euptelea pleiospermum, a relict broad-leaved tree species, from six provenances along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients across its distribution in China. We investigated variation in seed germination percentage and germination timing of seeds from these different origins (low, middle, and high latitudes/altitudes) at three incubation temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C and 25 °C). The key results were as follows: first, seeds collected from high latitudes were more sensitive to temperature and was likely to benefit from the higher incubation temperature with increasing germination percentage and shorter germination timing; second, for seeds across latitudes, germination percentage of central populations was lower than that of marginal populations; seed origin and its interaction with temperature were the major drivers of germination percentage variation; germination timing was significantly affected by incubation temperature, and warming could accelerate germination; third, for seeds across altitudes, both germination percentage and germination timing were not significantly affected by seed origin, incubation temperature, or their interaction. Our results indicate that climate warming may influence the population dynamics of relict tree species by altering their seed germination patterns, especially for the leading-edge populations along latitudinal gradient. It is vital to take inter-population variation across species’ geographic distribution into account when estimating the impact of environmental changes on plant species’ distribution and population persistence.  aPublisher supplied data  a31570528cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31770572cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC0503105cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aLVEC-2016kfxxcState Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change 3aaltitude 3abroadleaved trees 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal warming 3alatitude 3apopulation dynamics 3aprovenance 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3atemperature 3aChina1 aWang, Shitong1 aWei, Xinzeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5084-93901 aJiang, Mingxi0 tTrees.g2019 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.1435-1445dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-019-01871-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245004500170300002000215520076700235592002801002650002301030650002301053650001301076650001501089700002801104773013401132856007501266852000901341655001201350IND60538984720221120235635.0160815e20131030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053898472DNAL7 a10.1021/ja408308g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPriyakumari, Chakkingal
P.10aP3F92–: An All-Pseudo-π* 2π-Aromatic  ap. 16026-16029.  aA qualitative MO analysis suggests (PH₃)₃²– as a candidate for an all-pseudo-π* 2π-aromatic; however computational studies rule out its existence. Fluorine substitution which increases the contribution of p orbitals on P in the pseudo-π* MO makes (PF₃)₃²– a minimum and an aromatic. The 2π aromaticity arising from the bonding combination of the three pseudo-π* fragment MOs is comparable to that in C₃O₃²– and is another example for the analogy between CO and PF₃. The dianion (PF₃)₃²– forms the first example of a three-membered ring with all the vertices constituted by pentacoordinate phosphorus. The ability of PF₃ to form the all-pseudo-π* 2π-aromatic system is not shared by the heavier analogues, AsF₃ and SbF₃.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3achemical reactions 3afluorine 3aphosphorus1 aJemmis, Eluvathingal D.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Oct. 30, v. 135, no. 43 p.16026-16029dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja408308g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01385naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016000172300001800332520044600350592002800796650001300824650002000837650002000857700001600877700002100893773010000914856008401014852000901098655001201107IND60085595120221119170319.0141101e20110906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008559512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2011.04.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaragics, Katalin10aSome observations on the reductive ring opening of 4,6-O-benzylidene acetals of hexopyranosides with the borane trimethylamine–aluminium chloride reagent  ap. 1633-1637.  aReductive ring openings of 3-O-benzoyl-4,6-O-benzylidene-d-glucopyranosides with BH₃·NMe₃–AlCl₃ are accompanied by side reactions, such as debenzoylation and reduction of the benzoate to benzyl ether.

The nucleolytic activity of mycoplasmas is an important factor in their pathogenicity. Bacterial ribonucleases (RNases) may produce a broad spectrum of biological effects, including antiviral and antitumor activity. Mycoplasma RNases are therefore of interest. In the present work, the capacity of Acholeplasma laidlawii and Mycoplasma hominis for RNase synthesis and secretion was studied. During the stationary growth phase, these organisms were found to synthesize Mg²⁺-dependent RNases, with their highest activity detected outside the cells. Localization of A. laidlawii RNases was determined: almost 90% of the RNase activity was found to be associated with the membrane vesicles. Bioinformational analysis revealed homology between the nucleotide sequences of 14 Bacillus subtilis genes encoding the products with RNase activity and the genes of the mycoplasmas under study. Amino acid sequences of 4 A. laidlawii proteins with ribonuclease activity and the Bsn RNase were also established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcholeplasma laidlawii 3aBacillus subtilis 3aMycoplasma hominis 3aamino acid sequences 3aantineoplastic agents 3agenes 3anucleic acids 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3apathogenicity 3aproteins 3aribonucleases 3asecretion1 aSokurenko, Yu.

A wide range of regenerative studies have been conducted on different vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms. Annelids are known for their regenerative capacities, and because of their relatively complex organ systems, they are an ideal organism for regeneration study. Our present work focused on the freshwater annelid Aeolosoma viride, an asexually reproducing annelid capable of regenerating both anteriorly and posteriorly. Even though regenerative ability has been documented in this animal in previous studies, detailed characterization of the process is still unavailable. The objective of this study was to evaluate the regenerative ability of A. viride. We described the sequential morphological events during the process of regeneration, such as wound healing and the formation of blastema, mouth, and pygidium. In order to clarify the capacity and type of regeneration, we conducted a series of observations and experiments using a cell proliferation assay. Massive proliferation and the absence of cell migration indicated that the animal regenerates primarily through epimorphosis. Our study of the epimorphic regenerative process of A. viride provides a clearer picture of the evolutionary origin of regeneration in annelids.  aPublisher supplied data  a103‐2311‐B‐002‐017‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology 3aAnnelida 3aasexual reproduction 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3ainvertebrates 3amouth 3atissue repair 3atissues 3avertebrates1 aFok, Sheridan Ke-Wing1 aHsieh, Yu‐Wen1 aChen, Cheng‐Yi1 aHsu, Fei‐Man1 aChang, Yao‐Hsiang1 aChen, Jiun‐Hong0 tInvertebrate biology.g2020 Mar., v. 139, no. 1 p.e12277-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867081x1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.122773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245009800214300001800312506007600330520100900406592002801415506003701443650001501480650001901495650002201514650003401536650001301570650002001583700002401603700002201627700002001649700002001669700001901689773012001708856008501828852000901913655001201922IND60624711920221207120830.0181206e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062471192DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw0182doi7 aPMC48665222pmcid7 a267731312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenner, Christian10aFINEMAP: efficient variable selection using summary data from genome-wide association studies  ap. 1493-1501.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMotivation: The goal of fine-mapping in genomic regions associated with complex diseases and traits is to identify causal variants that point to molecular mechanisms behind the associations. Recent fine-mapping methods using summary data from genome-wide association studies rely on exhaustive search through all possible causal configurations, which is computationally expensive. Results: We introduce FINEMAP, a software package to efficiently explore a set of the most important causal configurations of the region via a shotgun stochastic search algorithm. We show that FINEMAP produces accurate results in a fraction of processing time of existing approaches and is therefore a promising tool for analyzing growing amounts of data produced in genome-wide association studies and emerging sequencing projects.

G.10aRole of mitochondria in the operation of calcium signaling system in heat-stressed plants  ap. 141-153.  aMild heat stress induces the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that protect plants from death during damaging heat treatments. It was assumed that the appearance in the cell of denatured proteins triggers the expression of HSP; however, recent results show that protein denaturation is not a prerequisite for this process. In this work we discuss a hypothetical mechanism for activation under heat stress of HSP expression promoted by short-term elevation of cytosolic Ca²⁺ level. According to our hypothesis, a prolonged elevation of Ca²⁺ has a negative influence on HSP expression. Therefore, calcium is transported from the cytosol into intracellular compartments, including mitochondria. The Ca²⁺ entry into mitochondria is accompanied by hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane and by the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The increased ROS production contributes to the activation of HSP expression under mild heat stress but leads to plant death under severe heat shock. Thus, mitochondria and, possibly, other organelles play the crucial role in determining life or death fate of heat-treated plant cells by controlling the cytosolic Ca²⁺ content and ROS production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adeath 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3amitochondria 3areactive oxygen species1 aFedoseeva, I.

The study used data for 12 hydrographic basins from 1975 to 2005. The seasonal distribution of these precipitation indices in Brazil is summarized concerning the main atmospheric systems acting in South America. The austral summer and autumn present the maximum PRCPTOT, Rmm, and Rx1day, related to the South American Monsoon System and Intertropical Convergence Zone. However, in the winter, the extreme northern and eastern coast also present high Rx1day. Maximum values of SDII occur during the four seasons in southwestern Brazil, related to mesoscale convective complexes. Precipitation anomalies are also affected by the sea surface temperature of the Tropical Southern Atlantic and Equatorial Pacific Oceans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aclimatology 3acoasts 3ahydrology 3amonsoon season 3aspace and time 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awinter 3aBrazil 0ameteorological systems 0aprecipitation 0aseasonal variability 0awatershed1 aOscar Júnior, Antonio Carlos,1 aCavalcanti, Iracema Fonseca Albuquerque1 aTreistman, Felipe0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2021 Jan. 25, v. 66, no. 2 p.289-308dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2020.18639693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03901naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007100139245007600210300001600286500001900302500002000321520208900341592002802430596002002458596007102478596007002549596007602619596008302695650001402778650001402792650001102806650002402817650001102841650001402852650001602866650001602882650001602898650001002914650002502924650001702949651001202966700006202978700001903040700006303059700006203122773012903184856007303313852000903386655001203395IND60686234120221120091407.0200313e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068623412DNAL7 a10.1111/jvs.128402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía‐Cervigón, Ana I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6651-244510aClimate seasonality and tree growth strategies in a tropical dry forest  ap. 266-280.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTIONS: Do tree species in seasonally dry tropical forests differ in the timing of their secondary growth? And in their growth rates between consecutive years? If so, how are these contrasting patterns linked to seasonality in climatic variables (temperature, precipitation)? Which is the role of leaf phenology and functional traits as drivers of stem radial increment responses to climate? LOCATION: A Tumbesian tropical dry forest in southern Ecuador. METHODS: We used a 12‐year database of stem radial increments to characterize intra‐ and inter‐annual patterns of secondary growth in 13 co‐existing dominant tree species. For each species, we adjusted an additive model to describe intra‐annual increment patterns and created a mean series of annual increments to describe inter‐annual changes. Adjusted increments were then correlated with monthly temperature and rainfall data over the study period, and also with the crown percentage covered by leaves. The role of functional traits (leaf area, wood density, maximum tree height, seed dry mass) was explored using average trait values per species. RESULTS: We observed continuous variation in the seasonality of radial increments, ranging from species that started incrementing their diameter as early as first rains occurred in the season to species that showed delayed responses. Variability in intra‐ and inter‐annual increment patterns was explained by functional traits (leaf area and seed dry mass, and maximum height and wood density, respectively) and leaf phenology, but this variation was not clearly matched with any functional trait configuration. This, combined with the absence of homogeneous responses of annual growth rates to climate, suggests the existence of contrasting strategies that virtually vary in a species‐specific fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Co‐existing tree species in seasonally dry tropical forests show different growth strategies to face intra‐ and inter‐annual climate variations, which may increase the resilience of these forests against projected climatic variations.  aPublisher supplied data  cFundación BBVA  cAgencia Española de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo  aCOOPB20113‐ICOOPB2014cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aIJCI‐2017‐34052cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aPGC2918‐099115‐B‐100cMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades 3adatabases 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aphenology 3atemperature 3atree growth 3atree height 3atrees 3atropical dry forests 3awood density 3aEcuador1 aCamarero, J.

We herein report transfer stamping of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) patches using thermally expandable hydrogels with tunable cell-adhesive properties. The hydrogels were prepared from functionalized four arm copolymer of Tetronic®, and the cell adhesion on the hydrogel was modulated by incorporation of fibronectin (FN) or cell-adhesive peptide (RGD). The resulting hydrogels showed spontaneous expansion in size within 10 min in response to the temperature reduction from 37 to 4°C. The adhesion and proliferation of hMSCs on FN-hydrogels were positively tunable in proportion to the amount of FN within hydrogels with complete monolayer of hMSCs (hMSC patch) being successfully achieved. The hMSC patch on the hydrogel was faced to the target substrate, which was then easily detached and re-attached to the target when the temperature was reduced from 37°C up to 4°C. We found that the transfer stamping of cell patch was facilitated at lower temperature of 4°C relative to 25°C, with the use of thinner hydrogels (0.5 mm in thickness relatively to 1.0 or 1.5 mm) and longer transfer time (>15 min). Notably, the hMSC patch was simply transferred from the hydrogel to the subcutaneous mouse skin tissue within 15 min with cold saline solution being dropped to the hydrogel. The hMSC patch following osteogenic or adipogenic commitment was also achieved with long-term culture of hMSCs on the hydrogel, which was successfully detached to the target surface. These results suggest that the hydrogels with thermally expandable and tunable cell-adhesive properties may serve as a universal substrate to harvest hMSC patch in a reliable and effective manner, which could potentially be utilized in many cell-sheet based therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acell adhesion 3acomposite polymers 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3amedicine 3amice 3asodium chloride 3astem cells 3atemperature 3atherapeutics 0aThermally responsive material 0aECM (extracellular matrix) 0aFibronectin 0aHydrogel 0aMesenchymal stem cell1 aLee, Yu Bin1 aChoi, Yu Suk1 aEngler, Adam J.1 aPark, Hansoo1 aShin, Heungsoo0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 54 p.44-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013700169300001500306520192400321592002802245650002202273650001202295650001002307650001202317650001402329650001602343650001002359650001302369650000902382650000902391650001302400650001002413650001802423651001402441653001002455653001802465653002102483653002002504653001602524653001502540653001302555653001802568653001602586653001302602653001402615700001802629700002002647700001902667773008202686856008602768852000902854655001202863IND60563250620221119093804.0170719e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056325062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipar, Matej14aThe genesis of solution pipes: Evidence from the Middle–Late Pleistocene Bridgewater Formation calcarenite, southeastern Australia  ap. 90-103.  aSolution pipes are abundant in Late Pleistocene aeolian calcarenites at Cape Bridgewater in southwestern Victoria, and were studied using field work, morphometric analysis, thin sections, mineralogical and chemical analyses, and OSL dating. The solution pipes are vertical tubes formed in aeolian limestone with matrix porosity. They are typically 0.1–1m wide and 1–5m deep, with rounded terminations and cemented rims up to 10cm thick. They are overlain by palaeosols and filled mostly with palaeosol material; rhizoliths are commonly present in the solution pipe fills and the surrounding calcarenite. The solution pipes have formed by focused dissolution of aeolianite, relatively quickly after the sand deposition, and concurrently filled with soil as they developed. They most likely formed beneath trees (as a result of focused infiltration due to stemflow) or due to fingered flow (unstable wetting front that breaks into fingers as it moves downwards). Solution pipe formation was strongly dependent on climate; periods of solution pipe formation followed the deposition of aeolianites at the end of interglacials MIS 7, 9 and 11, when the dunes were stabilised by vegetation and there was sufficient rainfall for substantial subsoil dissolution. The cemented rims formed in the following drier glacial climates. Solution pipes are most abundant in the youngest aeolianite, probably reflecting the wetter climate at the end of MIS 7 that allowed a dense forest to cover the dunes. From MIS 5 to MIS 2 no deposition of calcareous sand occurred on Cape Bridgewater, and combined with a very wet interglacial period MIS 5e, resulted in additional karstification, allowing the pipes in the MIS 7 aeolianite to extend deeper and drill down into the underlying member. A well-developed calcrete layer drapes over these solution pipes, and probably formed during the dry, windy climate of the Last Glacial Maximum.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical analysis 3aclimate 3adunes 3aforests 3alimestone 3amorphometry 3apipes 3aporosity 3arain 3asand 3astemflow 3atrees 3awetting front 3aAustralia 0aKarst 0aSolution pipe 0aSyngenetic karst 0aEogenetic karst 0aCalcarenite 0aAeolianite 0aCalcrete 0aPalaeoclimate 0aPleistocene 0aVictoria 0aAustralia1 aWebb, John A.1 aWhite, Susan Q.1 aGrimes, Ken G.0 tGeomorphology.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 246 p.90-103dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009500167300001600262520086900278592002801147650001801175650001401193650002301207650001001230650000901240650001201249650000901261650001001270650001101280653002001291653001701311653002501328653001001353653002101363700002101384700002001405700002401425700001701449700002301466700002401489773011301513856008101626852000901707655001201716IND60623965220221120032428.0181204e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062396522DNAL7 a10.1177/00236772156107082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPikhovych, Anton10aTranscranial direct current stimulation in the male mouse to promote recovery after stroke  ap. 212-216.  aTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) constitutes a promising approach for promoting recovery of function after stroke, although the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. To conduct translational research in animal models, stimulation parameters should not lead to neuronal lesions. Liebetanz et al. recommend charge densities for cathodal stimulation in rats, but parameters for mice are not established. We established tDCS in the wild-type mouse, enabling studies with genetically-engineered mice (GEM). tDCS equipment was adapted to fit the mouse skull. Using different polarities and charge densities, tDCS was safe to apply in the mouse where the charge density was below 198 kC/m² for single or repeated stimulations. These findings are crucial for future investigations of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying tDCS using GEM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aequipment 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amice 3aneurons 3arats 3askull 3astroke 0aneuromodulation 0astroke model 0aelectric stimulation 0abrain 0alesion threshold1 aWalter, Helene L1 aMahabir, Esther1 aFink, Gereon Rudolf1 aGraf, Rudolf1 aSchroeter, Michael1 aRueger, Maria Adele0 tLaboratory animals.g2016 June, v. 50, no. 3 p.212-216dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772156107083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009400168300001800262520089900280592002801179653001501207653001301222653001101235653002201246653001401268773016901282856008101451852000901532655001201541IND60651139420221119175243.0190711e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065113942DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154170011262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeesing, John K.10aRate of natural mortality in the sea star Archaster angulatus (Echinodermata: Asteroidea)  ap. 1689-1693.  aThe population size structure from a total of 876 individuals, together with published values of growth rate, maximum size and size at age were used to estimate an instantaneous rate of natural mortality (M) of 0.46–0.59 year⁻¹ in a population of the sea star Archaster angulatus from south-western Australia. Peak abundance (17%) of all animals sampled was 105–109 mm arm radius (means of 4.2–4.8 years of age) and only one per cent of sea stars are predicted to live beyond 8 years in the population studied. There are few comparable studies on sea stars but when compared with rates of natural mortality in other echinoderms (sea urchins), A. angulatus is intermediate among species which exhibit the extremes of life history strategies, that is, those which grow very rapidly and may live just two years or less and those with very slow growth rates and which may live for decades.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEchinoderm 0aasteroid 0agrowth 0anatural mortality 0alongevity0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 Nov., v. 98, no. 7 p.1689-1693dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154170011263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016500171300001600336520114200352592002801494650002701522650003001549650002501579650002901604650001701633650001401650650001301664650001901677650001301696650001801709650001401727650002101741650001001762650001901772650000901791650002101800650002101821653002501842653002601867653001201893653001601905653002501921700002201946700002201968700002201990700001602012700001902028700006402047700002602111700002502137700001602162700002202178700001802200700002502218773010602243856008702349852000902436655001202445IND60611250220221119003542.0200712e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061125022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManconi, Maria10aThymus essential oil extraction, characterization and incorporation in phospholipid vesicles for the antioxidant/antibacterial treatment of oral cavity diseases  ap. 115-122.  aThe aim of the work was to extract, characterize, and formulate Thymus capitatus (Tymbra capitata) essential oil in phospholipid vesicles: liposomes, glycerosomes and Penetration Enhancer-containing Vesicles (PEVs).The steam-distilled essential oil was mainly composed of carvacrol. The oil was mixed with lecithin and water to produce liposomes, or different ratios of water/glycerol or water/propylene glycol (PG) to produce glycerosomes and PG-PEVs, respectively. Cryo-TEM showed the formation of unilamellar, spherical vesicles, and light scattering disclosed that their size increased in the presence of glycerol or PG, which improved long-term stability. The formulations were highly biocompatible, and capable of counteracting oxidative stress and favouring wound repair in keratinocytes, thanks to enhanced uptake. The antibacterial activity of the oil was demonstrated against cariogenic Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and commensal Streptococcus sanguinis.The combination of antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Thymus essential oil formulations may be useful for the treatment of oral cavity diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoridothymus capitatus 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidants 3acarvacrol 3acolloids 3aessential oils 3aglycerol 3akeratinocytes 3alecithins 3alight scattering 3amouth 3amouth diseases 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3apropylene glycol 0aThymus essential oil 0aPhospholipid vesicles 0aGlycols 0aOral mucosa 0aOral cavity bacteria1 aPetretto, Giacomo1 aD’hallewin, Guy1 aEscribano, Elvira1 aMilia, Egle1 aPinna, Roberto1 aPalmieri, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9202-78891 aFiroznezhad, Mohammad1 aPeris, Josè Esteban1 aUsach, Iris1 aFadda, Anna Maria1 aCaddeo, Carla1 aManca, Maria Letizia0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 171 p.115-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01409naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245007500160300001600235520045400251592002800705653001700733653001600750653002600766653002400792700001600816700001600832700001600848700001800864700001400882773009800896856008000994852000901074655001201083IND60520195020160516000000.0160516e20130521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052019502DNAL7 a10.2478/v10161-012-022-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArina, D.10aCharacterization of Ash from the Organic Part of Municipal Solid Waste  ap. 363-368.  aThe article presents the results of ash quantity and composition investigation in municipal solid waste in Latvia.

Mice are commonly housed at 22℃, which is significantly lower than their thermoneutral zone. But, when given a choice, mice often seem to prefer higher ambient temperatures. In the current study we investigated the effect of higher ambient temperature on the production of transgenic mice, with emphasis on embryo and sperm yield and quality. Mice (C57BL/6JOlaHsd) were housed under four different ambient temperatures (22, 25, 28 and 30℃). Female mice were superovulated, and mated with males. As indicators for reproductive fitness, the success of the mating was observed, including embryo yield and quality, as well as sperm count, motility and progressivity. Female mice were found to produce high amounts of high quality embryos from 22 to 28℃. Sperm count dropped continuously from 22 to 30℃, but sperm motility and progressivity remained high from 22 to 28℃. We conclude that mice can be housed at significantly higher temperatures than is commonly recommended without compromising embryo production and quality, or sperm quality. These results could lead to fundamental changes in how mouse facilities are built and operated – especially in warmer climates whereby energy consumption and therefore costs could be significantly reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acages 3aembryo (animal) 3aenergy 3afemales 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3amice 3areproductive fitness 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 3asuperovulation 3atransgenic animals 0aenvironmental tolerance 0atemperature 0asexual behaviour 0aGM models 0aembryo1 aSchreier, D1 aNaumann, R1 aZierau, O0 tLaboratory animals.g2016 Aug., v. 50, no. 4 p.254-263dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl45492x1758-11177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00236772156115643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015500171300001400326500001900340520088600359592002801245650002101273650001101294650001201305650001201317651001201329651002001341651001601361653002401377653001001401653001901411653001601430653001501446700001901461700002601480773011701506856008601623852000901709655001201718IND60728137520221121054101.0210223e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072813752DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2020.18656632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhorozyan, Igor10aNo longer regionally extinct: a review of Pallas’s Cat Otocolobus manul records from the Caucasus with a new record from Armenia (Mammalia: Felidae)  ap. 12-18.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Pallas’s Cat Otocolobus manul is among the rarest mammals of the Caucasus, being recorded only in the 1920–1930s in south-western Armenia and once observed (skin) in 1996 in the neighbouring areas of the Arax basin. For this reason, so far it was considered as regionally extinct in the Caucasus. In this paper we present a recent (January 2020) record of this species in north-eastern Armenia about 140 km away from the nearest historical sites. We provide details of this record and associated habitats, and discuss all published information known so far on the historical occurrence of the species in the Caucasus. We show that only five small areas are suitable for the existence of this species in Armenia. The western limits of Khosrov Forest State Reserve hold the largest tract of suitable habitats. Protected areas play a minor role in Pallas’s Cat conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOtocolobus manul 3abasins 3aforests 3azoology 3aArmenia 3aCaucasus region 3aMiddle East 0aHabitat suitability 0amanul 0aprotected area 0arediscovery 0asmall cats1 aAnanian, Vasil1 aMalkhasyan, Alexander0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2021 Jan. 2, v. 67, no. 1 p.12-18dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19697x2326-26807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2020.18656633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245020400172300001800376520121600394592002801610650001601638650001201654650001801666650001301684650002001697650001301717700003001730700003301760700003301793773010101826856008401927852000902011655001202020IND60085595820221119171910.0141101e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008559582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2011.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumaran, Elumalai10aMontmorillonite K-10 clay-catalyzed Ferrier rearrangement of 2-C-hydroxymethyl-d-glycals, 3,4,6-tri-O-alkyl-d-glycals, and 3,4-(dihydro-2H-pyran-5-yl)methanol: a few unexpected domino transformations  ap. 1654-1661.  aMontmorillonite K-10 clay-catalyzed substitution reactions of 3,4,6-tri-O-alkyl-2-C-hydroxymethyl-d-glycals, 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-d-glycals, 3,4,6-tri-O-alkyl-d-glycals, and 3,4-(dihydro-2H-pyran-5-yl)methanol with a few alcohols and phenols are described. The reactions of 2-C-hydroxymethyl-d-glycals with phenols were similar to those of 2-C-acetoxymethyl-d-glycals and afforded pyrano[2,3-b]benzopyrans. This montmorillonite K-10 clay-catalyzed transformation is facile both under ambient (Method 1) and microwave conditions (Method 2). Ferrier rearrangement of 3,4-(dihydro-2H-pyran-5-yl)methanol with p-cresol, 2,6-xylenol, and ethanol led to totally unexpected transformations. Reaction of 2-C-hydroxymethyl-d-galactal with 2,6-dimethylphenol in the presence of montmorillonite K-10 led to a novel domino transformation affording 4-(5′,6′-dihydro-4H-pyran-3′-ylmethyl)-2,6-dimethylphenol. In contrast, 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-d-glucal furnished the Ferrier rearrangement product, 2,6-dimethylphenyl 4,6-di-O-acetyl-2,3-dideoxy-α-d-erythro-hex-2-enopyranoside. Also, isomerization of 3,4,6-tri-O-alkyl-d-glycals to products of allylic rearrangement, 2,3-unsaturated-O-glycosides in good yields is reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzopyrans 3aethanol 3aisomerization 3amethanol 3amontmorillonite 3ap-cresol1 aSanthi, Meenakshisundaram1 aBalasubramanian, Kalpattu K.1 aBhagavathy, Shanmugasundaram0 tCarbohydrate research.g2011 Sept. 27, v. 346, no. 13 p.1654-1661dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2011.03.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245010000171520143200271592002801703650002901731650001601760650003501776650001501811650002001826650001701846651001001863700002301873700002401896700002401920700002301944700002101967700002301988700002202011700002402033700002202057700002102079773016002100856007602260852000902336655001202345IND60745471120221119022048.0210723e20210706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074547112DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100704612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiovinazzi, S.q(Sonia),10aAssessing Earthquake Impacts and Monitoring Resilience of Historic Areas: Methods for GIS Tools  aHistoric areas (HAs) are highly vulnerable to natural hazards, including earthquakes, that can cause severe damage, if not total destruction. This paper proposes methods that can be implemented through a geographical information system to assess earthquake-induced physical damages and the resulting impacts on the functions of HAs and to monitor their resilience. For the assessment of damages, making reference to the universally recognised procedure of convoluting hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, this paper proposes (a) a framework for assessing hazard maps of both real and end-user defined earthquakes; (b) a classification of the exposed elements of the built environment; and (c) an index-based seismic vulnerability assessment method for heritage buildings. Moving towards the continuous monitoring of resilience, an index-based assessment method is proposed to quantify how the functions of HAs recover over time. The implementation of the proposed methods in an ad hoc customized WebGIS Decision Support System, referred to as ARCH DSS, is demonstrated in this paper with reference to the historic area of Camerino-San Severino (Italy). Our conclusions show how ARCH DSS can inform and contribute to increasing awareness of the vulnerabilities of HAs and of the severity of the potential impacts, thus supporting effective decision making on mitigation strategies, post-disaster response, and build back better.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision support systems 3aearthquakes 3ageographic information systems 3ageophysics 3arisk assessment 3aspatial data 3aItaly1 aMarchili, Corinna 1 aDi Pietro, Antonio 1 aGiordano, Ludovica 1 aCostanzo, Antonio 1 aLa Porta, Luigi 1 aPollino, Maurizio 1 aRosato, Vittorio 1 aLückerath, Daniel 1 aMilde, Katharina 1 aUllrich, Oliver 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 July 06, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100704613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007700162300001800239520075900257592002801016650002101044650002101065650002201086650001401108650002001122650001801142650002701160650001601187650001101203650001401214650001301228650001101241650001101252700002801263700002101291700002301312700002601335700002101361773012601382856007401508852000901582655001201591IND60677318120221120043815.0191126e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067731812DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc02055a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFournier, Antoine13aAn electrochemical process to prepare and recycle biobased ionic liquids  ap. 6290-6298.  aThis manuscript describes the first electrosynthesis of biobased ionic liquids from l-valine, oxalic acid and glyoxal, which is energy-efficient, does not emit toxic waste and avoids the formation of inorganic waste. These ionic liquids were then used in the development of our electro-recycling process. While their recycling yields are still moderated due to recombination and disproportionation reactions, this unprecedented recycling technology is very promising in terms of environmental and economic gains. Indeed, it has a high energy efficiency, requires low cost equipment, allows a strong decrease of the price of such ionic solvents, limits the use of non-renewable resources and solves the end-of-life problem of dirty biobased ionic liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrosynthesis 3aenergy efficiency 3aequipment 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3anonrenewable resources 3aoxalic acid 3aprices 3arecycling 3atoxicity 3avaline 3awastes1 ade Robillard, Guillaume1 aBousfiha, Jihane1 aSaid Ahmed, Mahado1 aDevillers, Charles H.1 aAndrieu, Jacques0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 21, no. 23 p.6290-6298dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9gc02055a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01794naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007100171300001400242500001900256520072600275592002801001650001701029650001101046650001601057650001501073650001601088650001401104650001601118651000901134651001601143651001301159653001501172700002101187773011701208856008601325852000901411655001201420IND60728137720221121054134.0210223e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072813772DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2021.18773822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamani, Alireza10aNew taxa of six families of spiders (Arachnida: Araneae) from Iran  ap. 81-91.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new genus (Ecurobius gen. n.) and six new species of spiders are described from Iran: Aituaria iranica sp. n.

In this paper, a cloud and snow segmentation method based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with enhanced encoder–decoder architecture—ED-CNN—is proposed. In this method, the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module is used to enhance the encoder, while the decoder is enhanced with the fusion of features from different stages of the encoder, which improves the segmentation accuracy. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method is superior to DeepLabV3+ with Xception and ResNet50. Additionally, a rough-labeled dataset containing 23,520 images and fine-labeled data consisting of 310 images from the TH-1 satellite are created, where we studied the relationship between the quality and quantity of labels and the performance of cloud and snow segmentation. Through experiments on the same network with different datasets, we found that the cloud and snow segmentation performance is related more closely to the quantity of labels rather than their quality. Namely, under the same labeling consumption, using rough-labeled images only performs better than rough-labeled images plus 10% fine-labeled images.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aneural networks 3asatellites 3asnow 3aspatial data1 aLi, Jiansheng 1 aDing, Lei 1 aYang, Jianfeng 1 aZhang, Xucheng 1 aZhang, Xun 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 July 06, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100704623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245011800130300001600248500001400264520111600278592002801394650002001422650001401442650002601456650001301482650001901495650001401514650002201528650002401550650002601574650001801600650001501618650001501633650001101648651001001659653001301669653001401682653002101696653001001717700002201727773013001749852000901879655001201888IND60709991120221119231217.0200908e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070999112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Gaurav10aEffect of fertility levels and biofertilizers on the productivity and profitability of chickpea (Cicer arietinum)  ap. 138-141.  aNAL-light  aA field experiment was conducted during winter (rabi) season of 2016–17 at Chandra Sekhar Azad University of Agriculture & Technology, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh to evaluate the effect of fertility levels and biofertilizers on productivity and profitability of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). The treatments comprised of 4 fertility levels of [F₁ (control), F₂ (RDF 100%), F₃ (75% RDF), F₄ (50% RDF)] in the main-plots and 3 bio-fertilizer levels of [B₁ (Rhizobium + PSB), B₂ (Rhizobium + PGPR) and B₃ (Rhizobium + PSB + PGPR)] in sub-plots 3 times replicated split-plot design. The results showed that application of 100% RDF significantly enhanced the yield attributes, yield and net returns over the other treatments. Among the biofertilizer treatments application of Rhizobium + PSB + PGPR recorded significantly higher yield attributes, yield, net returns and benefit: cost ratio compared to other treatments. The combined application of 100% RDF with Rhizobium + PSB + PGPR resulted in significantly higher seed yield, gross return, net return and B: C ratio of chickpea over other combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aRhizobium 3aagricultural colleges 3aagronomy 3abiofertilizers 3achickpeas 3acosts and returns 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3aprofitability 3aseed yield 3atechnology 3awinter 3aIndia 0aChickpea 0aEconomics 0aFertility levels 0aYield1 aYadav, Deen Dayal0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2019 Mar., v. 64, no. 1 p.138-141dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245008200210300001400292520113600306592002801442650002301470650002501493650002601518650001701544650001401561650001001575650002501585650001901610650001501629650003101644650001401675650004501689650001401734653001701748653002301765653002501788653001901813653000901832653000901841653001401850653002901864700002501893700002301918700002201941700002301963700002301986700002402009773009902033856008302132961001302215852000902228655001202237IND60524438320221120071338.0160717e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052443832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2016.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte, Alexandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6189-315110aDiscriminative power of Campylobacter phenotypic and genotypic typing methods  ap. 33-39.  aThe aim of this study was to compare different typing methods, individually and combined, for use in the monitoring of Campylobacter in food. Campylobacter jejuni (n=94) and Campylobacter coli (n=52) isolated from different broiler meat carcasses were characterized using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), flagellin gene A restriction fragment length polymorphism typing (flaA-RFLP), antimicrobial resistance profiling (AMRp), the presence/absence of 5 putative virulence genes; and, exclusively for C. jejuni, the determination of lipooligosaccharide (LOS) class. Discriminatory power was calculated by the Simpson's index of diversity (SID) and the congruence was measured by the adjusted Rand index and adjusted Wallace coefficient. MLST was individually the most discriminative typing method for both C. jejuni (SID=0.981) and C. coli (SID=0.957). The most discriminative combination with a SID of 0.992 for both C. jejuni and C. coli was obtained by combining MLST with flaA-RFLP. The combination of MLST with flaA-RFLP is an easy and feasible typing method for short-term monitoring of Campylobacter in broiler meat carcass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aantibiotic resistance 3achicken meat 3aflagellin 3agenes 3alipooligosaccharides 3ameat carcasses 3amonitoring 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aphenotype 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3avirulence 0aBroiler meat 0aCampylobacter coli 0aCampylobacter jejuni 0aTyping methods 0aFood 0aMLST 0aflaA-RFLP 0aAntimicrobial resistance1 aSeliwiorstow, Tomasz1 aMiller, William G.1 aDe Zutter, Lieven1 aUyttendaele, Mieke1 aDierick, Katelijne1 aBotteldoorn, Nadine0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2016 June, v. 125 p.33-39dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245016600175300001400341500001900355520051900374592002800893650001600921650001100937650001600948650001900964650001200983651001600995651000901011651001601020653001401036653001401050653001301064653003301077653001901110773011701129856008601246852000901332655001201341IND60728137920221121054142.0210223e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072813792DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2021.18773842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNassirkhani, Mahrad10aDescription of a new pseudoscorpion, Nudochernes limusensis sp. n.

Although vegetation recruitment and survival is possible on all bar types, it is easier for trees to survive on nonmigrating bars developed from a change in channel geometry or to the presence of a steady perturbation. This field study details the first stages of development of a vegetated mid-channel, nonmigrating (or forced) bar and its evolution toward an island form. Over six years, analysis of bed topographical changes, vegetation density and roughness, scour and fill depths, sediment grain size and architecture, and excess bed shear stress highlighted a specific signature of trees on topography and grain size segregation. Two depositional processes combining the formation of obstacle marks and upstream-shifting deposition of sediments led to the vertical accretion of the vegetated bar. During the first stage of the bar accretion, bedload sediment supply coming from surrounding channels during floods was identified as a key process modulated by the presence of woody vegetation and a deflection effect induced by the preexisting topography. Grain size segregation between vegetated and bare areas was also highlighted and interpreted as an important process affecting the development of surrounding channels and the degree of disconnection (and hence the speed of development) of a growing island. The heterogeneity of bedload supply can explain why sediment deposition and density of trees are not strictly related. A general conceptual model detailing the first stages of evolution from a bar to an established island is proposed for relatively large lowland rivers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedload 3afloods 3ageometry 3aislands 3amodels 3apioneer species 3arivers 3aroughness 3asediment deposition 3asediments 3ashear stress 3atopography 3atrees 3avegetation 0aPopulus nigra 0aBars 0aIsland 0aSandy–gravelly rivers1 aRodrigues, Stéphane,1 aBréhéret, Jean-Gabriel,1 aVillar, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0557-62040 tGeomorphology.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 246 p.305-320dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009200178300001600270520130400286536012301590592002801713596000801741650001901749650002301768650001201791650001001803650002501813650001501838650001001853650001001863650002601873650000701899650001301906650001201919651001101931653001601942653001301958653001601971653001801987653001302005700001802018700003102036700003802067700002802105700001902133700003302152700001802185773012502203856008502328852000902413655001202422IND60710965620221121032143.0200915e20201019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071096562DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2020.17357602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRizelio, Viviane Maria10aPhysicochemical and bioactive properties of Southern Brazilian Apis mellifera L. honeys  ap. 910-916.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of fifty Apis mellifera L. honey samples from southern Brazil in terms of the physicochemical composition, color characteristics, phenolic content, flavanol content, and antioxidant capacity. All of the physicochemical characteristics (moisture, free acidity, pH, sugars, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and diastatic activity) of 40 samples (80%) were within the limits established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Ten honey samples showed values outside the limits defined by legislation free acidity, moisture and sucrose content. The color of the samples analyzed was very variable and ranged from extra white to dark amber, according to the Pfund’s scale. The phenolic and flavanol compounds content, as well as the antioxidant capacity of samples, showed significant variation, with the darker samples having the highest values. Correlations between the parameters analyzed were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and, antioxidant capacity seemed to be associated with the total phenolic content and honey color. The results demonstrated the importance of evaluating the physicochemical parameters to best guarantee the consumers’ safety. In addition, these honeys samples, especially the darker, present relevant bioactive properties.  aThis work was supported by Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) (Finance Code 001).  aPublisher supplied data  a001 3aApis mellifera 3aCodex Alimentarius 3aacidity 3aamber 3aantioxidant activity 3aapiculture 3acolor 3ahoney 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3apH 3aresearch 3asucrose 3aBrazil 0aAntioxidant 0aflavonol 0ahoney color 0ahoney quality 0aphenolic1 aTenfen, Laura1 aGonzaga, Luciano Valdemiro1 aBorges, Graciele da Silva Campelo1 aBiluca, Fabíola Carina1 aSchulz, Mayara1 aCosta, Ana Carolina Oliveira1 aFett, Roseane0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2020 Oct. 19, v. 59, no. 5 p.910-916dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2020.17357603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245017200161520168700333592002802020650001302048650002202061650001102083650001502094650003302109650001602142650001702158651001002175700001602185700001702201700001402218700001602232773016002248856007602408852000902484655001202493IND60745471520221119021737.0210723e20210707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074547152DNAL7 a10.3390/ijgi100704642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jiansong 10aCharacterizing the Up-To-Date Land-Use and Land-Cover Change in Xiong’an New Area from 2017 to 2020 Using the Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Images on Google Earth Engine  aLand use and land cover (LULC) are fundamental units of human activities. Therefore, it is of significance to accurately and in a timely manner obtain the LULC maps where dramatic LULC changes are undergoing. Since 2017 April, a new state-level area, Xiong’an New Area, was established in China. In order to better characterize the LULC changes in Xiong’an New Area, this study makes full use of the multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images, the cloud-computing Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and the powerful classification capability of random forest (RF) models to generate the continuous LULC maps from 2017 to 2020. To do so, a novel multiple RF-based classification framework is adopted by outputting the classification probability based on each monthly composite and aggregating the multiple probability maps to generate the final classification map. Based on the obtained LULC maps, this study analyzes the spatio-temporal changes of LULC types in the last four years and the different change patterns in three counties. Experimental results indicate that the derived LULC maps achieve high accuracy for each year, with the overall accuracy and Kappa values no less than 0.95. It is also found that the changed areas account for nearly 36%, and the dry farmland, impervious surface, and other land-cover types have changed dramatically and present varying change patterns in three counties, which might be caused by the latest planning of Xiong’an New Area. The obtained 10-m four-year LULC maps in this study are supposed to provide some valuable information on the monitoring and understanding of what kinds of LULC changes have taken place in Xiong’an New Area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aagricultural land 3ahumans 3aland cover 3aland use and land cover maps 3aprobability 3aspatial data 3aChina1 aMa, Xinwen 1 aChu, Qifeng 1 aXie, Min 1 aCao, Yujia 0 tISPRS international journal of geo-information.g2021 July 07, v. 10, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21619x2220-99647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi100704643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013500161300001800296520147600314592002801790596008301818596008801901650002201989650001702011650002102028650002002049650003102069650002402100650001302124650001302137650001602150650001102166650002602177650001802203650002002221650001302241651001002254700001702264700001502281700002002296700001602316700001302332700001502345773011102360856008202471852000902553655001202562IND60671439920221118203825.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067143992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-019-01865-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Jing10aComparative transcriptome analysis to identify candidate genes related to chlorogenic acid biosynthesis in Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.  ap. 1373-1384.  aKEY MESSAGE: We performed a comparative transcriptome between two different concentrations of CGA from leaves in E. ulmoides. The key genes in the biosynthesis of CGA were identified by differential expression analysis. Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. is native to China and famous for its extensive medicinal value, such as anti-fatigue, anti-aging, and enhanced immunity, etc. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is the main medicinal ingredient of E. ulmoides. In E. ulmoides, the gene functions related to CGA biosynthesis are not fully understood. In this study, we conducted Illumina transcriptome sequencing and digital gene expression (DGE) for E. ulmoides with high content of CGA (H01, H02, and H03) and low content of CGA (L01, L02, and L03) to explore the potential genes involved in CGA biosynthesis. A total of 82,065 unigenes were generated. Of these unigenes, 28 were involved in CGA biosynthesis pathways and 116 regulated the CGA biosynthesis. Furthermore, by gene expression profiling and differential expression analysis, three functional genes including two PALs (c133625.graph_c5 and c133625.graph_c7), one 4CL (c139078.graph_c0), and three transcription factors (TFs), including one ERF2 (c139016.graph_c3) and two WRKY (c139022.graph_c3 and c139022.graph_c0) were different expressed, these genes may play key roles in CGA biosynthesis. This study will provide useful genomic resources for the investigation of CGA biosynthesis and genetic improvements of E. ulmoides.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013KTCL02-03cShaanxi Science & Technology Co-ordination & Innovation Project  a2018M633594cGeneral Financial Grant from the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aEucommia ulmoides 3abiosynthesis 3achlorogenic acid 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic improvement 3agenomics 3aimmunity 3aingredients 3aleaves 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 3aChina1 aHan, Wenjing1 aDeng, Peng1 aJiang, Yangyang1 aLiu, Minhao1 aLi, Long1 aLi, Zhouqi0 tTrees.g2019 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.1373-1384dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl43090x0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-019-01865-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011100172300001800283520124600301592002801547650001601575650001401591650001801605650001001623650001101633650001301644650001301657650001201670650004401682650001101726650002201737650002001759650001101779700002001790773010101810856008401911852000901995655001202004IND60085596320221119170225.0141101e20110927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008559632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2011.05.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulten, Johanna10aDibutylsilylene–pentose bis-chelates: on the glycoses’ binding sites for strongly Lewis-acidic centres  ap. 1767-1775.  aExcess di(tert-butyl)silylene (DTBS) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate) formed bis-DTBS derivatives with the four aldopentoses (arabinose, lyxose, ribose and xylose). The structure of the bis-chelates was affected by the bulk of the DTBS groups and the requirement of flat silacycles in the case of five-membered chelate rings. These restrictions resulted in unusual cyclic bis-chelates for ribofuranose (κO¹,⁵,κO²,³ bis-chelate) and lyxopyranose (κO¹,⁴,κO²,³ bis-chelate of a twisted boat conformation). Most importantly, all aldopentoses formed bis-chelates of their open-chain aldehydo isomers. The bis-chelates of aldehydo-arabinose and -xylose were κO²,³,κO⁴,⁵-bonded and thus exhibited five-membered chelate rings. The bis-chelates of aldehydo-lyxose and -ribose were κO²,⁴,κO³,⁵-bonded and resembled six-membered chelate rings. For lyxose, the aldehydo bis-chelate was isolated as a solid. The molecular structures were assigned by a combined ¹H, ¹³C, and ²⁹Si NMR spectroscopic approach, which was supported by X-ray analyses on crystals of the bis-DTBS chelates of κO¹,²,κO³,⁵-bonded rac-xylofuranose, κO¹,⁵,κO²,³-bonded d-ribofuranose, and κO²,⁴,κO³,⁵-bonded aldehydo-d-lyxose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aarabinose 3abinding sites 3aboats 3acarbon 3achelates 3acrystals 3aisomers 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aribose 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes 3axylose1 aKlüfers, Peter0 tCarbohydrate research.g2011 Sept. 27, v. 346, no. 13 p.1767-1775dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2011.05.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04180naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245018300134300001600317500001400333520262400347592002802971650001502999650002703014650001703041650002503058650001903083650002203102650001303124650001203137650002203149650002103171650002603192650001603218650002503234650001503259650001103274650001303285650001803298650000903316650002003325650001103345650001003356651001003366653001403376653001603390653001903406653001203425653001703437700001703454700001603471773013003487852000903617655001203626IND60709991520221119231357.0200908e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070999152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Dharam Bir10aImpact of long-term green manuring and herbicides on weed biomass, crop productivity and profitability in rice (Oryza sativa)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) cropping system in Haryana  ap. 172-179.  aNAL-light  aA long-term field experiment was conducted from 1999–2000 to 2015–16 at Karnal, Haryana, to study the effect of green manuring (GM) and continuous or rotational use of herbicides on weed pressure, crop productivity and soil properties in rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system. Based on data from 2008–09 onward (results from 1999–2000 to 2007–08 published elsewhere), the dry-weight of grassy weeds in rice was lower or similar under GM (103–407 g/m²) as compared to without green manuring (WGM) (153–472 g/m²) except higher dry-weights during 2011 and 2014. The dry-weight of broad leaf weeds (BLW) and sedges under weedy check remained lower or similar under GM (1.5–9.8 g/m²) than WGM (0.3–15.5 g/m²), except being higher during 2013. Continuous and rotational use of herbicides being excellent and as good as weed-free checks in rice provided similar reductions in the dry weights of weeds irrespective of GM and WGM over the years. The dry-weight of small canary grass (Phalaris minor Retz.) in wheat was higher or similar under GM (42–216 g/m²) to WGM (26–156 g/m²) except being lower in 2010–11. The fixed herbicide (Clodinafop) being similar to weed-free was also similar (0.0–13.8 g/m²) to the rotational use of herbicides (0.0–25.4 g/m²) in respect of dry weight of grassy weeds over the years. The dry weights of BLW in wheat were equal to or lower under GM (2.9–35.9 g/m²) than WGM (4.4–44.0 g/m²) in the plots treated with Clodinafop over the years. The rotational use of herbicides resulted invariably in lower dry weights of BLW (0.1–25.8 g/m²) than the fixed herbicide (2.9–35.9 g/m²) in wheat with few exceptions. There were no envisaged signs of herbicide resistance development in the dominant weed barnyard grass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.] in rice and Phalaris minor in wheat. Grain yields of rice were better under green manuring (6.38–8.30 t/ha under weed-free situations) than without green manuring (5.59–7.63 t/ha). Similarly, the grain yields of wheat were higher under GM (5.25–5.99 t/ha) than WGM (5.08–5.54 t/ha). The productivity of rice-wheat cropping system was higher under GM than WGM by 0.4–1.1 t/ha over the years. The economic returns from rice-wheat system were also more under GM than WGM. The study indicated the long-term sustainability of green manuring and use of herbicides (continuous or rotational) in rice-wheat cropping system. Moreover, there were no signs of development of herbicide resistance in weeds, and it might be avoided or delayed by proper use of recommended herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperaceae 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aOryza sativa 3aPhalaris canariensis 3aPhalaris minor 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3acosts and returns 3acropping systems 3afield experimentation 3agrass weeds 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3apressure 3aprofitability 3arice 3asoil properties 3aweight 3awheat 3aIndia 0aEconomics 0aGrain yield 0aGreen manuring 0aHaryana 0aWeed biomass1 aYadav, Ashok1 aPunia, S.S.0 tIndian journal of agronomy.g2019 June, v. 64, no. 2 p.172-179dThe Indian Society of AgronomywJournal:2040x0974-44607nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01400naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300001800260520036400278592002800642650001100670650001400681650002700695650002000722650001400742650001300756700002100769700002500790700002200815700001600837773012600853856007400979852000901053655001201062IND60677318520221120060152.0191126e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067731852DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc02593f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoole, Hailey10aUse of a switchable-hydrophilicity solvent as both a solvent and a catalyst in aldol condensation  ap. 6263-6267.  aA switchable-hydrophilicity solvent, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, was used as a recyclable catalyst and solvent for aldol condensation, giving >97% pure product in 94% isolated yield without the need for purification or additional solvents.

A possible solution is the incorporation of legumes in rice because legumes are a source of nitrogen. There is actually little knowledge on the impact of legumes on rotation, soil fertility, and nitrogen loss. Therefore, we studied the effect of five rice-based rotations, including rice-wheat, rice-rape, rice-fallow, rice-bean, and rice-vetch, on soil nitrogen, rice yield, and runoff loss. A field experiment was conducted in the Tai Lake region from 2009 to 2012. Crop residues from rape, bean, and vetch were used to partially replace chemical fertilizer in rice. Results show that replacing 9.5–21.4 % of mineral nitrogen fertilizer by residues maintained rice yields of rice-rape, rice-bean, and rice-vetch rotations, compared to the rice-wheat reference. Moreover, using legumes as a winter crop in rice-bean and rice-vetch combinations increased rice grain yield over 5 %, and increased rice residue nitrogen content by 9.7–20.5 %. Nitrogen runoff decreased 30–60 % in rice-rape, rice-bean, and rice-vetch compared with rice-wheat. Soil mineral nitrogen and microbial biomass nitrogen content were also improved by application of leguminous residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia 3abeans 3acrop residues 3acrop rotation 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3alakes 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arice 3arunoff 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil minerals 3aChina1 aXue, Lihong1 aYang, Linzhang0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2014 July, v. 34, no. 3 p.633-640dSpringer-Verlagx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-013-0173-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245015500182300001800337520135100355536027301706592002801979650001902007650002102026650001502047650002502062650001402087650001702101650001602118650001302134650003302147650002002180650001902200653001002219653002202229653002002251700003602271700002702307700003102334700003302365700002602398700002702424773012702451856008502578852000902663655001202672IND60710965720221121032044.0200915e20201019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071096572DNAL7 a10.1080/00218839.2020.17367812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamargos, Alice Figueiredo10aMorphology and chemical composition of the Koschewnikow gland of the honey bee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers engaged in different tasks  ap. 1037-1048.  aThe Koschewnikow gland is associated with the sting apparatus in the honey bee Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, as a potential source of compounds used as an alarm pheromone. This study describes the histology, morphometry and ultrastructure, and chemical composition of the Koschewnikow gland in workers performing different tasks in the A. mellifera colony. The Koschewnikow gland shows well-developed globular secretory cells of class III with those of the nurse and foragers larger and in greater numbers than those of guard bees. At the ultrastructural level, the secretory cells of all worker bees are rich in mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria had different ultrastructure among workers with membrane electron-dense granules in nurse and the electron-lucent halo surrounding the organelle in guard bees. Mitochondria in forager workers show degenerative features such as the disappearance of cristae, electron-lucent matrix, and accumulation of electron-dense aggregates. The chemical analyses of the Koschewnikow gland extract showed that of 23 compounds, 13 had different abundances between workers and of these, 10 were found in higher abundance in guard workers. These results suggest that the Koschewnikow gland has a different structure and chemical composition in honey bee workers engaged in different tasks.  aThis research was supported by Brazilian research agencies Conselho Nacional de Pesquuisa (CNPq), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), and Financiadora de Projetos (FINEP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aalarm pheromones 3aapiculture 3achemical composition 3ahistology 3amitochondria 3amorphometry 3aresearch 3asmooth endoplasmic reticulum 3asting apparatus 3aultrastructure 0aalarm 0adivision of labor 0apheromone gland1 aCossolin, Jamile Fernanda Silva1 aMartínez, Luis Carlos1 aGonçalves, Wagner Gonzaga1 ados Santos, Marcelo Henrique1 aZanuncio, José Cola,1 aSerrão, José Eduardo0 tJournal of apicultural research.g2020 Oct. 19, v. 59, no. 5 p.1037-1048dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12840x2078-69137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00218839.2020.17367813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001300156245013700169300001600306520140000322592002801722650001801750650001201768650001401780650002001794650001901814650001301833650001801846650001901864650002201883650001701905650001201922650002201934650001301956653001601969653001201985653001801997653001902015653002102034700001902055700001902074700001602093700001502109700001802124700001402142700001302156700001702169773009202186856009002278852000902368655001202377IND60603498120221120230512.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chao10aAllogenic dendritic cell and tumor cell fused vaccine for targeted imaging and enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy of gastric cancer  ap. 177-187.  aDendritic cells (DCs) have displayed the promising potential in cancer immunity. How to enhance DCs immunotherapeutic effect in cancer targeted immunotherapy and prevention is still a great challenge. Herein, we report for the first time the allogenic DCs and tumor cell fused vaccine combined with cytokine induced killing cells (CIKs) for targeted imaging and enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy of gastric cancer (GC). The fused vaccine was prepared by PEG mediated fusion between mature DCs and inactive gastric cancer MGC803 cells. The immunotherapeutic and prophylactic potential of the fused cells (FCs) were evaluated in tumor-bearing, post-surgery and tumor free mice models. The migration and homing process of near infrared region quantum dots (NIR-QDs) labeled FCs were investigated by real-time animal imaging system. Results showed that the FCs and FC + CIKs could trigger the tumor-specific CTLs against GC cells, target the tumor tissue initiatively and enhance the prophylactic effects, suppress the tumor growth remarkably in vivo. The potential mechanism is also investigated. In conclusion, allogenic DCs and tumor cell fused vaccine can be used for targeted imaging and enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy of GC, and the FC + CIKs strategy own great potential in clinical applications such as early therapy and prevention of tumor-metastasis and relapse in near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanimals 3acytokines 3adendritic cells 3aimage analysis 3aimmunity 3aimmunotherapy 3aneoplasm cells 3aprotective effect 3aquantum dots 3arelapse 3astomach neoplasms 3avaccines 0aFusion cell 0aVaccine 0aImmunotherapy 0aGastric cancer 0aTargeted imaging1 aLiang, Shujing1 aZhang, Chunlei1 aLiu, Yanlei1 aYang, Meng1 aZhang, Jingpu1 aZhi, Xiao1 aPan, Fei1 aCui, Daxiang0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 54 p.177-187dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010600158300001800264520121100282592002801493650001501521650002301536650001101559650002201570650004601592650001501638650002001653650001101673650001801684650001301702650001901715650001601734700001701750700002201767700002001789773012601809856007401935852000902009655001202018IND60677318620221120060111.0191126e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067731862DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc02647a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChahal, Manoj10aBinding enabled catalytic activation of SO₂ by copper koneramine complexes under ambient conditions  ap. 6372-6380.  aReported is an unprecedented, simple and sustainable strategy to catalytically convert SO₂ gas into sulfate dianions under ambient conditions utilizing ferrocene (SO₂ + 2Fc + aerial O₂ → Fc₂SO₄) and aerial oxygen, whereby ferrocenium sulfate was formed without any unwanted byproducts. The frequent urban haze and increase in respiratory health issues connected to the atmospheric SO₂ concentration attracted interest in the sequestration and valorization of SO₂. Even though a number of methods have been reported in the past decade for the stoichiometric sequestration and activation of SO₂, effective catalytic activation of SO₂ through homogeneous catalysis has not been realized before. The copper(ii) koneramine complex [Cu(L-H)Cl₂] was designed to have exclusive basic sites for SO₂ binding, which complemented efficient electron transfer from ferrocene to SO₂ that underwent S-oxygenation to yield sulfate dianions. In this proof of concept study, SO₂ binding coupled electron transfer (SOCET) from ferrocene was established with the assistance of control experiments, electronic absorption spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aferrocenes 3agreen chemistry 3aoxygen 3astoichiometry 3asulfates 3asulfur dioxide 3avoltammetry1 aRaje, Sakthi1 aKotana, Gopichand1 aAngamuthu, Raja0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 21, no. 23 p.6372-6380dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9gc02647a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145242008200165245007700247300001600324520166900340592002802009650002102037650001802058650001102076650001402087650001902101650001602120650001002136650001602146650000902162700002002171700002102191700001702212773011802229856004802347852000902395655001202404IND4472731420221120184712.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447273142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-012-0609-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutnar, Andreja10aThermodynamische Eigenschaften von oberflächenverdichtetem Kiefernmassivholz10aThermodynamic characteristics of surface densified solid Scots pine wood  ap. 727-734.  aWetting phenomena of surface densified solid wood and its surface energetic behavior were investigated. The specimens of three different initial thicknesses (22 mm, 20 mm, and 18 mm) were surface densified to a target thickness of 15 mm in order to obtain three different degrees of surface densification. After surface densification one third of the specimens was heat treated at 200 °C in the presence of steam, and one third of the specimens was oil treated with linseed oil. The sessile drop technique was used to estimate the apparent contact angle of water, diiodomethane, and formamide on control and surface densified wood. The contact angle data were used to determine the surface free energies of the control and surface densified wood by the Owens Wendt Rabel and Kaelble (OWRK) method. The results of contact angle measurements revealed that surface densification process affects surface wettability. The apparent contact angles of test liquids were higher in the case of surface densified wood compared to the control undensified wood. Heat treatment and oil treatment of the surface densified wood additionally increased the contact angle of tested liquids. Furthermore, a larger reduction in the void spaces of the wood due to higher degree of densification did not affect the apparent contact angles of tested liquids and consequently the surface free energy. The surface densification process lowered the surface energetics and the polarity of wood. Furthermore, heat treatment and oil treatment additionally increased the hydrophobic character of the examined surfaces and lowered the dispersive and polar components of surface free energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3afuel oils 3aheat treatment 3alinseed oil 3asteam 3awettability 3awood1 aRautkari, Lauri1 aLaine, Kristiina1 aHughes, Mark0 tEuropean Journal of Wood and Wood Products.g2012 Sept., v. 70, no. 5 p.727-734dSpringer-Verlagx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-012-0609-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008300169300001600252520131700268592002801585650001101613650001901624650002101643650001101664650002401675650001101699650001301710651001001723653002401733653001901757653001501776653002101791653002001812700001601832700005501848773011301903856008602016852000902102655001202111IND60561350820221118040011.0180831e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056135082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jianhua10aLow-carbon city logistics distribution network design with resource deployment  ap. 223-228.  aThe Chinese government has now published its emission reduction goal of carbon dioxide by 2020 and any industrial player is obliged to take effective initiatives to decrease its carbon footprint. For the city logistics distribution system, as a significant energy-consuming and pollutant-emitting sector, energy saving and emission reduction are very meaningful especially for megacities like Beijing. With rational hypotheses and parameter design, meanwhile considering the deployment of low-carbon resources, a novel carbon tax-constrained city logistics distribution network planning model is proposed. The model is a bilinear non-convex mixed integer programming and is reduced to a pure linear mixed integer programming through proper linearization. To verify the effectiveness of the model, an empirical study is conducted on a city logistics operator in Beijing and the popular commercial optimization suite IBM ILOG CPLEX is adopted for optimization purpose. Through analysis of the optimization results and comparison with traditional optimization models, it is found that the proposed model can help the city logistics distribution operator save up to 9.2% of operational cost during a full service cycle, and meanwhile cut down its carbon dioxide discharge by around 54.5% or 2135 metric tons at most.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acities 3aenergy conservation 3amodels 3aplanning 3aChina 0aResource deployment 0aCity logistics 0aCarbon tax 0aNetwork planning 0aCarbon emission1 aGuo, Jidong1 aMa, Shugang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5268-62220 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 119 p.223-228dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010000167300001600267520112300283592002801406650002101434650004401455650002701499650002701526650002601553650002201579650002901601650001201630650001801642650002701660650001501687650003701702650001901739650003301758650001201791650000901803653003001812653002701842653002501869653001101894700001701905700003101922700001501953700001901968773011301987856008602100852000902186655001202195IND60088054920221122213926.0190318e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008805492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoakhan, S.10aInfluence of sericin/TiO2 nanocomposite on cotton fabric: Part 1.

The prepared finishing agents with and without polycarboxylic acid cross-linking agents were treated on cotton fabric using pad-dry-cure. Presence of sericin, nano-TiO2, and cross-linking agents on cotton fabric was confirmed by at least one of the following experimental FTIR, SEM, EDX, and XRD. The antibacterial activity and the durability of modified cotton fabrics were investigated against one Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus) and one Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli). The finishing treatment on the cotton fabric was more effective against S. aureus than E. coli. The fabrics treated with nano-TiO2 were possessed more activity against bacteria as compared to sericin and also considerably improved with given nanocomposite. The antibacterial activity of treated fabrics with cross-linking agents has not been considerably changed after 20 and 40 launderings. The fabrics treated with given nanocomposites did not dramatically affect the breaking strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3aboiling 3acotton fabric 3across-linking reagents 3adurability 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ananocomposites 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asericin 3asilk 0aSercin/TiO2 nanocomposite 0aAntibacterial activity 0aPolycarboxylic acids 0aCotton1 aMontazer, M.1 aRashīdī, ʻAlī Riz̤ā,1 aMoniri, R.1 aMoghadam, M.B.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 May 15, v. 94, no. 2 p.737-748dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245006100161300001800222520149200240592002801732650000801760650001701768650002701785650001101812650001701823650003101840650002501871650001901896650001401915650001801929650002201947650000901969651001601978700001801994700002102012700001902033700002002052700002502072700001902097700001802116773017902134856007802313852000902391655001202400IND60120343120221120050037.0150202e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012034312DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.063610-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jun-Muk10aNocardioides daecheongensis sp. nov., isolated from soil  ap. 4109-4114.  aStrain KIS2-16 ᵀ was isolated from a soil sample collected from Daecheong Island of Incheon region, South Korea.

The aqueous phase inside the thylakoid known as the thylakoid lumen plays an essential role in the photosynthetic electron transport. The presence and significance of thiol‐disulfide exchange in this compartment have been recognized but remain poorly understood. All proteins found free in the thylakoid lumen and some proteins associated to the thylakoid membrane require an N‐terminal targeting signal, which is removed in the lumen by a membrane‐bound serine protease called thylakoidal processing peptidase (TPP). TPP is homologous to Escherichia coli type I signal peptidase (SPI) called LepB. Genetic data indicate that plastidic SPI 1 (Plsp1) is the main TPP in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) although biochemical evidence had been lacking. Here we demonstrate catalytic activity of bacterially produced Arabidopsis Plsp1. Recombinant Plsp1 showed processing activity against various TPP substrates at a level comparable to that of LepB. Plsp1 and LepB were also similar in the pH optima, sensitivity to arylomycin variants and a preference for the residue at −3 to the cleavage site within a substrate. Plsp1 orthologs found in angiosperms contain two unique Cys residues located in the lumen. Results of processing assays suggested that these residues were redox active and formation of a disulfide bond between them was necessary for the activity of recombinant Arabidopsis Plsp1. Furthermore, Plsp1 in Arabidopsis and pea thylakoids migrated faster under non‐reducing conditions than under reducing conditions on SDS‐PAGE. These results underpin the notion that Plsp1 is a redox‐dependent signal peptidase in the thylakoid lumen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aEscherichia coli 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron transfer 3apH 3apeas 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3aserine proteinases 3athylakoids1 aEndow, Joshua K.1 aDufour, Jeremy1 aZhu, Jieping1 aInoue, Kentaro0 tplant journal.g2014 Nov., v. 80, no. 4 p.592-603dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.126553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245012100211300001600332500001500348520142000363592002801783650001301811650004401824650002201868650001101890650002201901650001201923650001201935650001901947650001501966650002601981650001202007650001702019650001602036650002302052653002602075700001802101700002102119700002402140700002502164700001802189773009502207856008102302990002302383852000902406655001202415IND60091263020221120080738.0141103e20110105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009126302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2010.10.0502doi7 aPMC30108422pmcid7 a211906742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarangoni, Roberto10aIn Vivo NMR Metabolic Profiling of Fabrea salina Reveals Sequential Defense Mechanisms against Ultraviolet Radiation  ap. 215-224.  a2019-12-06  aFabrea salina is a hypersaline ciliate that is known to be among the strongest ultraviolet (UV)-resistant microorganisms; however, the molecular mechanisms of this resistance are almost unknown. By means of in vivo NMR spectroscopy, we determined the metabolic profile of living F. salina cells exposed to visible light and to polychromatic UV-B + UV-A + Vis radiation for several different exposure times. We used unsupervised pattern-recognition analysis to compare these profiles and discovered some metabolites whose concentration changed specifically upon UV exposure and in a dose-dependent manner. This variation was interpreted in terms of a two-phase cell reaction involving at least two different pathways: an early response consisting of degradation processes, followed by a late response activating osmoprotection mechanisms. The first step alters the concentration of formate, acetate, and saturated fatty-acid metabolites, whereas the osmoprotection modifies the activity of betaine moieties and other functionally related metabolites. In the latter pathway, alanine, proline, and sugars suggest a possible incipient protein synthesis as defense and/or degeneration mechanisms. We conclude that NMR spectroscopy on in vivo cells is an optimal approach for investigating the effect of UV-induced stress on the whole metabolome of F. salina because it minimizes the invasiveness of the measurement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein synthesis 3asugars 3aexposure duration 3aalanine 3aproline 3amicroorganisms 3ametabolome 3aultraviolet radiation 3abetaine 3ametabolomics 3ametabolites 3adefense mechanisms 0aresistance mechanisms1 aParis, Debora1 aMelck, Dominique1 aFulgentini, Lorenzo1 aColombetti, Giuliano1 aMotta, Andrea0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 Jan. 5, v. 100, no. 1 p.215-224dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2010.10.0503Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010900174300001600283520103500299592002801334650002201362650002301384650003801407650001401445650003301459650001901492650001501511650002201526650002101548653001701569653003201586653002101618653002201639653002001661653003801681653002201719700002101741700003101762700001901793700003001812700002801842700003101870773011301901856008602014852000902100655001202109IND60088055120221122213932.0190318e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008805512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.01.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerrada, María L.10aAmphiphilic polymers bearing gluconolactone moieties: Synthesis and long side-chain crystalline behavior  ap. 755-764.  aThe synthesis and characterization of amphiphilic polymers bearing gluconolactone moieties has been described. In a first step, an unprotected glycomonomer 2-[({[4-(d-gluconamid-N-yl)butyl]amino}carbonyl)oxy]ethyl acrylate, HEAG, has been synthesized. Posterior, this glycomonomer has been copolymerized with methyl methacrylate at different compositions and the kinetic behavior has been also studied calculating the monomer reactivity ratios by Kelen–Tüdös extended equation. In addition, the long side-chain crystalline behavior of these carbohydrate-based copolymers with high composition of glycomonomer has been examined by using conventional and modulated differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction measurements. At the same time, the phase separation behavior of carbohydrate-based copolymers with lower HEAG content has been determined by their glass transition temperature measurements. Finally, the thermal stability of all these amphiphilic copolymers has been evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aequations 3aglass transition temperature 3agluconolactone 3aseparation 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aGlycomonomer 0aCarbohydrate-based polymers 0aCopolymerization 0aReactivity ratios 0aCrystallization 0aDifferential scanning calorimetry 0aX-ray diffraction1 aBordegé, Vanesa1 aMuñoz-Bonilla, Alexandra,1 aLeón, Orietta1 aCuervo-Rodríguez, Rocío1 aSánchez-Chaves, Manuel1 aFernández-García, Marta,0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 May 15, v. 94, no. 2 p.755-764dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.01.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011800168300001600286520125300302592002801555653001401583653001501597653001601612653002901628700001201657700001801669700001701687773016601704856008401870852000901954655001201963IND60530644220221119033110.0160721e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053064422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pharep.2015.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Xiao-Yue14aThe inhibitory effects of nifedipine on outward voltage-gated potassium currents in mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells  ap. 631-637.  aVoltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels have a pivotal role in tuning the action potential duration and excitability in neuronal cells. Although Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine exhibited an inhibitory effect on cardiac Kv currents, a possible action of nifedipine on neuronal Kv currents has not been fully investigated.The effects of nifedipine on elicited Kv currents were characterized using whole-cell recording in mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells.Exposure to nifedipine induced a dose-dependent inhibition of Kv currents with an IC50 value of 22.3±4.2μM and prolonged the time course of activation. The half-maximum activation potential was 1.6±1.7mV in control conditions and became 13.5±1.5mV in 50μM nifedipine. In addition, the decay rate of Kv currents was substantially accelerated by 39.5% at +60mV. For the voltage-dependent inactivation, the half-maximum inactivation potential was −13.8±0.8mV and strongly shifted to the left following treatment with 50μM nifedipine.Treatment with nifedipine exerted a strong influence on the activation and inactivation rate of Kv currents as well as an obvious leftward shift in the inactivation curve. These data indicated that nifedipine exerted an inhibitory effect on Kv currents in N2A cells.  aPublisher supplied data 0aN2A cells 0aNifedipine 0aKv currents 0aVoltage-dependent manner1 aLi, Kai1 aLi, Xiao-Qing1 aLi, Xian-Tao0 tPharmacological Reports.g2016 June, v. 68 p.631-637dElsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.aInstitute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciencesx1734-11407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharep.2015.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245009100171300001600262520130300278536004101581592002801622650001501650650001401665650001301679650002001692650002401712650002301736650001001759650001701769650001201786650001401798650002001812650001301832653001501845653004601860653002101906653002101927653002101948773011601969856008002085852000902165655001202174IND60624285520221116143615.0181202e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062428552DNAL7 a10.1177/08845336145536382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuarez, Michelle Ann10aMulticomponent Treatment for Food Selectivity in ChildrenbDescription and Case Report  ap. 425-431.  aBackground: Food selectivity is common in children with and without developmental disabilities and can have negative implications for nutrition intake and family quality of life. The evidence base for effective treatment protocols is still developing. Methods: The purpose of this study was to describe a pilot, multicomponent treatment protocol for food selectivity and present several case examples using a retrospective chart review. Elements in the treatment manual included sensory integration and behavioral modification strategies, including systematic desensitization. Also, parents were educated on factors associated with food selectivity and strategies for increasing food acceptance during family meals. Results: Four children with food selectivity demonstrated increased food acceptance of previously refused foods. Incidence of negative behaviors, including gagging, vomiting, and aggressive behavior (eg, hitting, batting away spoon), during clinical meals was also evaluated. No aggressive behavior or vomiting was observed during treatment sessions, and gagging on foods at initial introduction was minimal. Conclusions: This descriptive study and case review provides information to inform treatment of food selectivity and may provide a catalyst for larger scale clinical trials.  aFinancial disclosure: None declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3acatalysts 3achildren 3aclinical trials 3adescriptive studies 3afood acceptability 3afoods 3ameals (menu) 3aparents 3aprotocols 3aquality of life 3avomiting 0apediatrics 0afeeding and eating disorders of childhood 0afeeding behavior 0afood preferences 0afood selectivity0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 30, no. 3 p.425-431dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336145536383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245016100181500001900342520115300361592002801514650001401542650001301556650002301569650001901592650001301611650001601624653002001640653002701660653002101687653002301708653001701731700002401748700002701772700002901799700001901828700001801847700003001865773009101895856009001986852000902076655001202085IND60730774820221118024247.0210603e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073077482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1063352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Sabat, Guillem10aDevelopment of a highly efficient extrinsic and autonomous self-healing polymeric system at low and ultra-low temperatures for high-performance applications  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is a growing demand of self-healing materials to overcome the costs derived from repairing and substituting pieces and components due continuous damages. Among the pursued strategies, the development of self-healing systems capable of operate at real low temperatures remains unsolved. In this study, we report the development of an extrinsic self-healing system for composite materials that has demonstrated an efficiency above 100% at low/ultra-low temperatures. This mechanism is based on the Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) of a blend of 5-ethylidenenorbornene/dicyclopentadiene (ENB/DCPD) monomers in the presence of ruthenium-based 3rd generation Grubbs’ catalyst (G3). The blend was microencapsulated in formaldehyde-free polyurea vessels and dispersed into three different commercial epoxy resins. Tapered Double Cantilever Beam (TDCB) specimens of the modified resins were manufactured, tested and healed at low/ultra-low temperature conditions completely autonomously. All samples showed high self-healing efficiency, demonstrating the potential incorporation in real composite materials for high performance fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aepoxides 3amicroencapsulation 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atemperature 0aSmart materials 0aParticle-reinforcement 0aDamage tolerance 0aMechanical testing 0aSelf-healing1 aGago-Benedí, Elena1 aRoa Rovira, Joan Josep1 aGonzález-Gálvez, David1 aMateo, Antonio1 aMedel, Sandra1 aTolentino Chivite, Ainhoa0 tComposites.g2021 June, v. 145 p.106335-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1063353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010500168300001600273520104100289592002801330650001601358650001701374650001601391650001301407650001701420650002201437650001301459650001101472650001601483650001801499650001601517653001101533653001601544653001801560653001401578653002101592653001701613700002601630700002101656700002201677773011301699856008601812852000901898655001201907IND60088055220221122213837.0190318e20130515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008805522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsson, Erik10aInfluence of citric acid and curing on moisture sorption, diffusion and permeability of starch films  ap. 765-772.  aStarch films with different amounts of citric acid produced by solution casting were subjected to different curing temperatures and compared with films plasticized with glycerol. The films were tested in a controlled moisture generator, which enabled the moisture sorption to be measured and the diffusion coefficient and water vapor permeability to be calculated. It was shown that increasing the amount of citric acid added led to a reduction in the equilibrium moisture content, diffusion coefficient and water vapor permeability of the films, the values of which were all considerably lower than the values obtained for the films plasticized by glycerol. It was also seen that curing the film with 30pph citric acid at 150°C led to a significant reduction in the equilibrium moisture content, the diffusion coefficient and the water vapor permeability at high relative humidity which suggests that crosslinking occurred. The calculated water vapor permeability data were comparable with the value obtained with direct measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitric acid 3acrosslinking 3adiffusivity 3aglycerol 3apermeability 3arelative humidity 3asorption 3astarch 3atemperature 3awater content 3awater vapor 0aStarch 0aCitric acid 0aCross-linking 0aDiffusion 0aMoisture content 0aPermeability1 aHedenqvist, Mikael S.1 aJohansson, Caisa1 aJärnström, Lars0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 May 15, v. 94, no. 2 p.765-772dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009200173300001600265520094200281536009101223592002801314596011501342650002501457650002301482650001201505650001101517650001201528650001001540650001801550650001201568650001101580650001001591650001301601653002501614653002101639653001601660653001201676653001601688700003401704773014001738856008601878852000901964655001201973IND60619812120221119022335.0190219e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061981212DNAL7 a10.1080/19315260.2018.14582652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaboko, Martin M.10aResponse of Field-Grown Indeterminate Tomato to Plant Density and Stem Pruning on Yield  ap. 612-621.  aPlant density and stem pruning are factors affecting production of field-grown indeterminate tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Plants were established at plant densities of 16,000, 20,000, or 30,000 plants ha⁻¹ and pruning treatments were no stem pruning (0S), prune side shoots below the first flower truss (1F), or prune plants to 1 stem (1S) or 2 stems (2S). Increased plant density resulted in fewer fruit, marketable yield, and total yield per plant. Plant density did not affect marketable and total yield per hectare. Plants subjected to no pruning, or pruning of side shoots below the first flower truss, had the highest marketable yield per plant and per hectare. The lowest plant density, and no pruning, tended toward increased total yield per hectare. A plant density of 16,000 plants ha⁻¹, without stem pruning, is recommended based on cost saving of hybrid seed, due to use of fewer plants, and labor for pruning.  aThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation [Grant Number UID 110184].  aPublisher supplied data  aUID 110184cSouth African Agency for Science and Technology Advancementdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006312 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acost effectiveness 3aflowers 3afruits 3ahybrids 3alabor 3aplant density 3apruning 3ashoots 3astems 3atomatoes 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0amarketable yield 0aside shoots 0aspacing 0atotal yield1 aDu Plooy, Christian Phillipus0 tInternational journal of vegetable science.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 24, no. 6 p.612-621dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4027179x1931-52797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19315260.2018.14582653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245011900163300001600282520131100298592002801609650001201637650002501649650002001674650001201694650001501706650001101721650001101732650001801743650002401761650001501785650002001800650002301820651001101843700002201854700001501876700001401891773013001905856007502035852000902110655001202119IND60693456620221120124603.0200506e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069345662DNAL7 a10.4296/cwrj22021852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRollins, Kimberly10aResource valuation and public policy: consumers’ willingness to pay for improving water servicing infrastructure  ap. 185-195.  aIn many Canadian municipalities the infrastructure that helps to deliver quality water to households, and transports the waste water produced is in need of major capital re-investment. Estimates made by Environment Canada show that some $4.59 billion per year, over the next 10 years, will be required in order to maintain existing levels of water supply and quality, and to meet future needs. Governments at all levels will have to make decisions concerning the funding of such undertakings. One of the options available to municipal officials will be to pass on some or all of these costs to the consumer. One interesting question concerning this policy alternative relates to the willingness of consumers to pay increased water charges. This paper reports on the results of a study to probe this question, carried out jointly by Environment Canada and the University of Guelph. The study, which employed a contingent valuation methodology, found that the average willingness-to-pay to ensure adequate water servicing was just over $26.00 per month above current water servicing prices. At this level, the municipal water industry would generate an additional $3.5 billion annually, a large portion of the extra revenue required. The public policy implications of this finding are discussed in the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acontingent valuation 3adecision making 3afunding 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aprices 3apublic policy 3apublic water supply 3awastewater 3awater utilities 3awillingness to pay 3aCanada1 aZachariah, Oswald1 aFrehs, Jim1 aTate, Don0 tCanadian water resources journal.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 22, no. 2 p.185-195dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:2043x1918-18177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj22021853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245005300160300001800213520176100231592002801992650001802020650000802038650003302046650000902079650001602088650001102104650001302115650001102128650001602139650001202155650001402167650001702181650003102198650002502229650003002254650001802284650000902302650002202311650001102333700001802344700001902362773017902381856007802560852000902638655001202647IND60120343420221120045953.0150202e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012034342DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.066225-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubhash, Y.10aHymenobacter roseus sp. nov., isolated from sand  ap. 4129-4133.  aStrain JC245 ᵀ was isolated from a sand sample, and appeared as dark pink colonies on agar plates with cells staining Gram-negative. Catalase and oxidase activities were positive. Casein was hydrolysed while chitin, gelatin and starch were not. Major (>5 %) fatty acids were iso-C ₁₅ : ₀, iso-C ₁₅ : ₀ 3-OH, C ₁₆ : ₁ω5 c , C ₁₆ : ₁ω6 c /C ₁₆ : ₁ω7 c , anteiso-C ₁₇ : ₁ B/iso-C ₁₇ : ₁ I and iso-C ₁₇ : ₀ 3-OH. Strain JC245 ᵀ contained phosphatidylethanolamine and two unidentified lipids as the major polar lipids, with minor amounts of four unidentified lipids and an unidentified amino lipid. Bacterial hopane derivatives and adenosylhopane were the major hopanoids. Hydroxyflexixanthin was identified as one of the major carotenoids of strain JC245 ᵀ along with five unidentified carotenoids. The genomic DNA G+C content was 52.5 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain JC245 ᵀ represents a member of the genus Hymenobacter within the family Cytophagaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes . Strain JC245 ᵀ shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Hymenobacter roseosalivarius AA-718 ᵀ (98.3 %) and other members of the genus Hymenobacter (<95.1 %). However, strain JC245 ᵀ showed 21±2 % relatedness (based on DNA–DNA hybridization) with H. roseosalivarius DSM 11622 ᵀ. Distinct morphological, physiological and genotypic differences from previously described taxa support the classification of strain JC245 ᵀ as a representative of a novel species in the genus Hymenobacter , for which the name Hymenobacter roseus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JC245 ᵀ (= KCTC 42090 ᵀ = LMG 28260 ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCytophagaceae 3aDNA 3aHymenobacter roseosalivarius 3aagar 3acarotenoids 3acasein 3acatalase 3achitin 3afatty acids 3agelatin 3ahopanoids 3amicrobiology 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aribosomal RNA 3asand 3asequence homology 3astarch1 aSasikala, Ch.1 aRamana, Ch.

In this study we examined the effect of chokeberry juice on the hepatic and mammary gland carcinogen metabolizing enzyme expression altered by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Sprague–Dawley rats were gavaged with chokeberry juice (8ml/kg b.w.) for 28 consecutive days. DMBA was administered i.p. on the 27th and the 28th days. Pretreatment with chokeberry juice reduced the activity of CYP1A1 and increased that of CYP2B involved in metabolic activation/detoxication of DMBA in rat liver, as well as expression and activity of phase II enzymes. Chokeberry juice had no effect on these parameters in the mammary gland and DMBA induced DNA damage in rat blood cells. These results together with our earlier observations indicate that metabolic alterations induced by chokeberry feeding are tissue specific and depend on the class of carcinogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAronia melanocarpa 3aDNA damage 3aanthracenes 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3ablood cells 3acarcinogens 3aenzymes 3afemales 3ajuices 3aliver 3amammary glands 3amodels 3aprocyanidins 3arats1 aKrajka-Kuźniak, Violetta1 aIgnatowicz, Ewa1 aAdamska, Teresa1 aBaer-Dubowska, Wanda0 tEnvironmental toxicology and pharmacology.g2011 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.339-346dElsevier B.V.x1382-66897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2010.12.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245011400158300001600272520104500288592002801333650001001361650001301371650001501384650001201399650001301411650002201424650001901446650001901465650001501484650002101499650002601520650001101546650001401557650001601571651001701587700001501604700001501619700002101634773013001655856007501785852000901860655001201869IND60693456920221120124550.0200506e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069345692DNAL7 a10.4296/cwrj22032372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCessna, A.J.10aPotential for contamination of the south saskatchewan river with herbicides applied in an irrigation district  ap. 237-248.  aHerbicide inputs to the South Saskatchewan River in irrigation return flow water from a major drainage ditch within the South Saskatchewan River Irrigation District #1 were monitored over a growing season in relation to herbicide use on flood-irrigated fields drained by this ditch.

The expression of the failure criteria is a quadratic polynomial, in which the variables are the normal and shear stress components (σn,τnl,τnt) on the potential failure plane. The coefficients of the quadratic polynomial are independent of empirical parameters and calibrated only by four basic strengths of a UD composite, i.e. transverse tensile and compressive strengths, Yt and Yc, as well as transverse and longitudinal shear strengths, S23 and S21. It avoids some deficiencies of the previous criteria for IFF in which some parameters may need to be determined by multiaxial stress tests or by empirical data-fitting operation. Compared with the theoretical prediction results and the experimental data of various UD composites, the present IFF criteria show good prediction accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3acompression strength 3aexhibitions 3aprediction 3ashear strength 3ashear stress 3atensile strength 0aA.

Oil palm shell (OPS) is a solid waste material from the palm oil industry that has been successfully used to produce high strength durable lightweight concrete. However, this concrete is very sensitive to a poor curing environment. Therefore, to produce a cleaner and greener concrete, this study used two waste materials from the palm oil industry as coarse aggregate; OPS aggregates were partially replaced with oil-palm-boiler clinker (OPBC) aggregates from 0 to 50% in OPS lightweight aggregate concrete. Properties including workability, density, compressive strength under eight different curing conditions, splitting tensile and flexural strengths, modulus of elasticity and water absorption of green lightweight concrete were measured and discussed. The results show that it is possible to produce environmentally-friendly and high strength structural lightweight aggregate concrete by incorporating high volume waste lightweight aggregates from the palm oil industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3aabsorption 3aconcrete 3aconstruction materials 3afats and oils industry 3aindustrial wastes 3amodulus of elasticity 3asolid wastes 0aOil palm shell 0aOil-palm-boiler clinker 0aLightweight aggregate concrete 0aHigh strength lightweight concrete 0aCuring 0aMechanical properties1 aShafigh, Payam1 aJumaat, Mohd Zamin1 aLachemi, Mohamed0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 119 p.108-117dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.01.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01860naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011600167300001300283520081000296592002801106650001901134650001901153650002801172650001901200650001401219653001601233653001901249653002101268700002101289700002301310773009801333856008201431852000901513655001201522IND60519760220221118130923.0180620e20080301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051976022DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-007-0044-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuba-Surma, Ewa10a“Decoding the Dots”: The ImageStream system (ISS) as a novel and powerful tool for flow cytometric analysis  ap. 1-10.  aThe aim of this article is to provide a brief review of the ImageStream system (ISS).

The recommended indicators include z scores for weight-for-height/length, body mass index-for-age, or length/height-for-age or mid–upper arm circumference when a single data point is available. When 2 or more data points are available, indicators may also include weight gain velocity (<2 years of age), weight loss (2–20 years of age), deceleration in weight for length/height z score, and inadequate nutrient intake. The purpose of this consensus statement is to identify a basic set of indicators that can be used to diagnose and document undernutrition in the pediatric population ages 1 month to 18 years. The indicators are intended for use in multiple settings (eg, acute, ambulatory care/outpatient, residential care). Several screening tools have been developed for use in hospitalized children. However, identifying criteria for use in screening for nutritional risk is not the purpose of this paper. Clinicians should use as many data points as available to identify and document the presence of malnutrition. The universal use of a single set of diagnostic parameters will expedite the recognition of pediatric undernutrition, lead to the development of more accurate estimates of its prevalence and incidence, direct interventions, and promote improved outcomes. A standardized diagnostic approach will also inform the prediction of the human and financial responsibilities and costs associated with the prevention and treatment of undernutrition in this vulnerable population and help to further ensure the provision of high-quality, cost-effective nutritional care.  aFinancial disclosure: None declared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarm circumference 3aat-risk population 3achildren 3acost effectiveness 3adietetics 3aenteral feeding 3ahumans 3amalnutrition 3anutrient intake 3anutrition risk assessment 3aprediction 3ascreening 3aweight gain 3aweight loss 0anutritional assessment 0apediatrics 0amalnutrition 0achild nutrition disorders 0agrowth1 aCarney, Liesje Nieman1 aCorkins, Mark R.1 aMonczka, Jessica1 aSmith, Elizabeth1 aSmith, Susan E.1 aSpear, Bonnie A.1 aWhite, Jane V.1 a, 1 a, 0 tNutrition in clinical practice.g, v. 30, no. 1 p.147-161dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl39209x1941-24527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/08845336145576423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245010400185300001600289520135200305592002801657650002101685650001501706650002001721650002101741650001901762650002201781650002401803650002301827650001001850650002401860650002301884650003501907650001401942650001101956650001801967650001401985650001201999650001902011650005202030650003702082650003002119650003302149650003802182650006602220650004202286650005802328650002302386650005502409650002902464700001702493773010802510856004802618852000902666655001202675IND50061095620221120095255.0130318e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006109562DNAL7 a230531992pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-012-0298-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasavirama, K.10aIncreased resistance to late leaf spot disease in transgenic peanut using a combination of PR genes  ap. 625-634.  aPeanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is the sixth most important oil seed crop in the world. Yield loss due to Cercospora leaf spot (early and late leaf spots) is a serious problem in cultivating this crop. Non-availability of resistant genes within crossable germplasms of peanut necessitates the use of a genetic engineering strategy to develop genetic resistance against various biotic stresses. The pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are a group of plant proteins that are toxic to invading fungal pathogens, but are present in trace amounts in plants. The PR proteins, PR-5 and defensins, are potent antifungal proteins. A double gene construct with SniOLP (Solanum nigrum osmotin-like protein) and Rs-AFP2 (Raphanus sativus antifungal protein-2) genes under separate constitutive 35S promoters was used to transform peanut plants. Transgenic peanut plants expressing the SniOLP and Rs-AFP2 genes showed enhanced disease resistance to late leaf spot based on a reduction in number and size of lesions on leaves and delay in the onset of Phaeoisariopsis personata leaf spot disease. PCR, RT–PCR, and Southern hybridization analyses confirmed stable integration and expression of these genes in peanut transgenics. The results demonstrate the potential of SniOLP and Rs-AFP2 genes in developing late leaf spot disease resistance in transgenic peanut.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aCercospora 3aPhaeoisariopsis 3aRaphanus sativus 3aSolanum nigrum 3aSouthern blotting 3aantifungal proteins 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic resistance 3agenetically modified organisms 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3aoilseed crops 3apathogens 3apeanuts 3aplant proteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 2aArachisxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aAscomycotaxpathogenicity 2aDisease Resistancexgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aRaphanusxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolanum nigrumxgenetics1 aKirti, P.

Excitation in the Q-band at 630 nm initiates dynamics characterized by three time constants: τ₁ = 3.6 ± 0.2, τ₂ = 38 ± 2, and τ₃ = 215 ± 8 ps. As indicated by the C13′=O carbonyl stretching mode in the electronic ground state at 1686 cm⁻¹, showing partial ground-state recovery, and in the excited electronic state at 1625 cm⁻¹, showing excited-state decay, τ₂ describes the formation of a state with a strong change in electronic structure, and τ₃ represents the partial recovery of the PChlide electronic ground state. Furthermore, τ₁ corresponds with vibrational energy relaxation. The observed kinetics strongly suggest a branched reaction scheme with a branching ratio of 0.5 for the path leading to the PChlide ground state on the 200 ps timescale and the path leading to a long-lived state (>>700 ps). The results clearly support a branched reaction scheme, as proposed previously, featuring the formation of an intramolecular charge transfer state with ∼25 ps, its decay into the PChlide ground state with 200 ps, and a parallel reaction path to the long-lived PChlide triplet state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3ainfrared spectroscopy1 aWolf, Matthias M.N.1 aGross, Ruth,1 aSeidel, Sonja1 aDietzek, Benjamin1 aSchmitt, Michael1 aPopp, Jürgen,1 aHermann, Gudrun1 aDiller, Rolf0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 Jan. 5, v. 100, no. 1 p.260-267dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2010.11.0543Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013200168300001600300520093600316592002801252650000801280650001401288650001201302650001401314650001201328650001001340650002001350653002101370653002101391653002101412653001801433653002001451653002301471653002601494700002401520700002401544773008901568856008101657852000901738655001201747IND60619812820221119022446.0181102s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061981282DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000035102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTina, Fahmida W.10aReceiver female body size and distances affect the claw-waving rate of signaller males in fiddler crabs (Brachyura, Ocypodidae)  ap. 905-914.  aWe tested for the first time how Austruca bengali Crane, 1975 signaller males adjusted their waving rates based on receiver female body sizes and their distances.

Our results indicate that males are able to measure distances and female sizes, and adjust their waving display by actively reducing waving rate (1) towards small females, as usually small females have lower fecundity compared to large ones and (2) towards females at very close distance because at this point, the females would make their mating decision, and thus males start to lead/hit the females towards their burrow rather than waving vigorously.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUca 3abody size 3aburrows 3afecundity 3afemales 3amales 3amating behavior 0aAustruca bengali 0aclaw-waving rate 0afemale receivers 0afiddler crabs 0amale signallers 0areceiver distances 0awaving costs/benefits1 aJaroensutasinee, M.1 aJaroensutasinee, K.0 tBehaviour.g2018, v. 155, no. 10-12 p.905-914dBrillwJournal:11664x1568-539X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-000035103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148242015300164245013200317300001600449500001900465520125400484592002801738650002001766650002401786650001201810650001501822650001101837650001201848650002401860650001101884650001001895650000901905650002201914700001701936773011901953856008202072852000902154655001202163IND60656311920221119132759.0190812e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065631192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-019-00426-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelik, Ali,10aUntersuchung der genetischen Diversität von Apfelschorf-Isolaten (Venturia inaequalis) aus zwei geographisch unterschiedlichen Regionen der Türkei10aInvestigation of Genetic Diversity in Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis) Isolated from Two Different Geographical Areas of Turkey  ap. 263-266.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aApple (Malus domestica) is a widely grown fruit in various climate types of the world and is exposed to the attack of many fungal disease agents during the growing period. One of them is Venturia inaequalis, which is probably the most important in terms of economic loss worldwide, which makes apple scab disease important in apple growing areas. In this study, the genetic diversity of apple scab in Bingöl and Isparta provinces has been examined, which represent the two extremes of Turkey in terms of apple production. The 18 isolates obtained from these regions and were amplified by PCR using 7 RAPD primers. Polymorphic bands of the isolates were obtained by subjecting to agarose gel imaging. The average number of bands per primer was determined to be 3.91, with the highest polymorphic bands obtained from OPF04 encoded primer and the least polymorphic bands from OPG15 encoded primer. According to the clustering analysis, the total isolate population belongs to 5 different groups. Significant privileges were not observed between the two regions’s isolates It is thought that RAPD primers have a certain level to determine the diversity but not high levels of intra- and interregional variation in the isolates of V. inaequalis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aagarose 3aapple scab 3aapples 3aclimate 3afinancial economics 3afruits 3afungi 3agels 3agenetic variation1 aKavak, Hamit0 tErwerbsobstbau.g2019 Sept., v. 61, no. 3 p.263-266dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl29949x0014-03097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10341-019-00426-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03859naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014900165520226000314592002802574650002502602650001402627650002002641650002102661650002102682650002502703650002902728650002002757650000902777650004202786650002102828650001102849650001402860650001102874650002002885653001402905653001802919653001702937653002202954653001102976653000802987700001702995700001903012700002303031700001903054700002203073700001903095773012403114856008203238852000903320655001203329IND60690479920221122233145.0210320e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069047992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2020.1083832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStucki, David10aEffects of frequently applied carbon monoxide releasing molecules (CORMs) in typical CO-sensitive model systems – A comparative in vitro study  aIntracellular carbon monoxide (CO) is a gaseous signaling molecule and is generated enzymatically by heme oxygenases upon degradation of heme to billiverdin. Target structures for intracellular produced CO are heme proteins including cytochrome c oxidase of the respiratory chain, cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases, or myoglobin. For studies on CO signaling, CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) of different structure are available. Here, three frequently used CORMs (CORM-2, CORM-3 and CORM-401) were studied for their properties to provide CO in biological test systems and address susceptible heme proteins. CO release was investigated in the myoglobin binding assay and found to be rapid (<5 min) with CORM-2- and CORM-3, whereas CORM-401 continuously provided CO (>50 min). Storage stability of CORM stock solutions was also assessed with the myoglobin assay. Only CORM-401 stock solutions were stable over a period of 7 days. Incubation of CORMs with recombinant cytochrome P450 led to an inhibition of enzyme activity. However, only CORM-3 and CORM-401 proved to be suitable in this test system because controls with the inactivated CORM-2 (iCORM-2) also led to a loss of enzyme activity. The impact of CORMs on the respiratory chain was investigated with high resolution respirometry and extracellular flux technology. In the first approach interferences of CORM-2 and CORM-3 with oxygen measurement occurred, since a rapid depletion of oxygen was detected in the medium even when no cells were present. However, CORM-401 did not interfere with oxygen measurement and the expected inhibition of cellular respiration was observed. CORM-2 was not suitable for use in oxygen measurements with the extracellular flux technology and CORM-3 application did not show any effect in this system. However, CO-dependent inhibition of cellular respiration was observed with CORM-401. Based on the present experiments it is concluded, that CORM-401 produced most reliable CO-specific results for the modulation of typical CO targets. For studies on CO-dependent biological effects on intracellular heme groups, CORM-2 and CORM-3 were less suitable. Depending on the experimental setting, data achieved with these compounds should be evaluated with caution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abioassays 3acarbon monoxide 3acell respiration 3acytochrome P-450 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aelectron transport chain 3aenzyme activity 3aheme 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ain vitro studies 3amodels 3amyoglobin 3aoxygen 3astorage quality 0aMyoglobin 0aHeme proteins 0aMitochondria 0aRespiratory chain 0aOxygen 0aCYP1 aKrahl, Heide1 aWalter, Moritz1 aSteinhausen, Julia1 aHommel, Katrin1 aBrenneisen, Peter1 aStahl, Wilhelm0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2020 July 15, v. 687 p.108383-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2020.1083833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245010700188300001600295520087400311592002801185650001801213650002401231650002101255650002101276650001301297650001001310650001801320650002201338650001801360650001701378650002401395650002201419650002401441650002401465650001201489650002101501650001401522650002301536650001501559650001501574650001101589650003201600650001701632650001101649650002401660650003201684650004401716650001201760650000901772650002801781650002301809650003001832650001401862650005201876650005201928650002401980650003302004650003802037650002002075700002202095700002302117700002502140700002202165773011402187856008202301852000902383655001202392IND4461729520221122204445.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446172952DNAL7 a217420312pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVuerinckx, Kristel10aCharacterization of an allatotropin-like peptide receptor in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum  ap. 815-822.  aFollowing a reverse pharmacology approach, we identified an allatotropin-like peptide receptor in Tribolium castaneum. Allatotropins are multifunctional neuropeptides initially isolated from the tabacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. They have been shown to be myoactive, to be cardio-acceleratory, to inhibit active ion transport, to stimulate juvenile hormone production and release and to be involved in the photic entrainment of the circadian clock. A tissue distribution analysis of the T. castaneum allatotropin-like peptide receptor by means of qRT-PCR revealed a prominent sexual dimorphism, the transcript levels being significantly higher in the male fat body and reproductive system. The endogenous ligand of the receptor, Trica-ATL, is able to increase the frequency and tonus of contractions in the gut and in the reproductive tract of mature red flour beetles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManduca sexta 3aTribolium castaneum 3acircadian rhythm 3adigestive system 3afat body 3aflour 3aion transport 3ajuvenile hormones 3aneuropeptides 3apharmacology 3areproductive system 3asexual dimorphism 3atissue distribution 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aCHO Cells 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aFemale 2aGenitalia, Malexmetabolism 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInsect Hormonesxmetabolism 2aInsect Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLigands 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMuscle Contraction 2aNeuropeptidesxmetabolism 2aPhylogeny 2aReceptors, Neuropeptidexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSex Characteristics 2aStructural Homology, Protein 2aTriboliumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aVideo Recording1 aVerlinden, Heleen1 aLindemans, Marleen1 aBroeck, Jozef Vanden1 aHuybrechts, Roger0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2011 Oct., v. 41, no. 10 p.815-822dElsevier Ltdx0965-17487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2011.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245005000171300001400221520098100235592002801216650002201244650001101266650001201277650001901289650001301308650001301321650002701334650000901361651002801370651001301398653003101411653004001442653001701482653000901499653002601508700001501534700002001549700002201569773009901591856008201690852000901772655001201781IND60519760720221118130944.0180620e20080301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051976072DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-007-0051-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrebunova, Marianna10aACE I/D polymorphism in Alzheimer’s disease  ap. 49-54.  aAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been reported to show altered activity in patients with neurological diseases. The recent studies found that a 287 bp insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene may be associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the results have been heterogenous between studies in Europe. In the present study we examined for the first time the association of ACE I/D polymorphism along with APOE genotype in 70 sporadic AD and 126 control subjects in Slovak Caucasians (Central Europe). An increased risk for AD was observed in subjects with at least one APOE*E4 allele (OR=3.99, 95% CI=1.97–8.08). No significant differences for the genotype distribution or the allele frequency were revealed comparing controls and patients for ACE gene. Gene-gene interaction analysis showed increase of the risk to develop AD in subjects carrying both the ACE DD genotype and the APOE*E4 allele (OR=10.32, 95% C.I. 2.67–39.81).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aWhites 3aalleles 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3apatients 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arisk 3aCentral European region 3aSlovakia 0aAlzheimer’s disease (AD) 0aAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 0aPolymorphism 0aAPOE 0aGene-gene interaction1 aSlaba, Eva1 aHabalova, Viera1 aGdovinova, Zuzana0 tOpen life sciences.g2008 Mar. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.49-54dVersitawJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-007-0051-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011700170300001100287520171300298592002802011596004502039596005002084650001702134650002702151650001702178650002302195650001602218650002302234650002002257650002002277650001202297650001102309650001502320650001102335650001902346650001202365650001302377650002402390651001402414700001802428700002702446700002002473700001802493773014102511856008202652852000902734655001202743IND60656312120221119132907.0200313e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065631212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-019-1307-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdullah, Abdullah10aPeople’s perceptions of elephant conservation and the human-elephant conflict in Aceh Jaya, Sumatra, Indonesia  ap. 69.  aHuman-elephant conflict (HEC) poses a major threat to elephants in many parts of Asia, including Indonesia. This paper presents data from a case study on HEC in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia. The area consists of a mosaic of settlements, agriculture, and forested areas that are used both by elephants and humans. Questionnaire survey data were used to examine villagers “attitudes towards elephant conservation”, “forest protection”, and “wildlife authorities”. While 36% of the respondents expressed a positive attitude and accepted the need to protect elephants, a majority of the respondents (64%) indicated that they would not support conservation where crop damage by wildlife, particularly elephants, was threatening livelihoods. Nevertheless, 86% of respondents had a positive view of protected forests, either for personal benefits such as hunting and collection of non-timber forest produce or to act as wildlife refuges. Although the wildlife management authorities respond to crop raiding incidences by elephants, which had some positive influence on perceptions of people towards the authorities, overall the majority of respondents (83%) perceived the wildlife authorities negatively and claimed that they did not provide support when crop raiding took place. The main factors identified as reasons for the observed conservation attitudes were proximity to forest boundary, occupation, and education level. Further education and conservation awareness programs, and conflict mitigation should become a priority to gain local communities’ support for conservation and change people’s attitudes towards elephant conservation so they can share resources with elephants, where possible.  aPublisher supplied data  a17904-2cRufford Small Grants for Nature  aNAcInternational Elephant Project, Australia 3aElephantidae 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3acrop damage 3aeducational status 3aforest products 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3ahumans 3alivelihood 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aIndonesia1 aSayuti, Arman1 aHasanuddin, Hasanuddin1 aAffan, Muzailin1 aWilson, Gaius0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2019 Oct., v. 65, no. 5 p.69-69dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-019-1307-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245020300160300001800363520135700381592002801738650000801766650001901774650001601793650001501809650001701824650002501841650003001866650001401896650001801910650002201928650001201950651002101962700001901983700001802002700001702020773017902037856007802216852000902294655001202303IND60120344120221117175637.0150202e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012034412DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.066480-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Haneul10aFlavobacterium gyeonganense sp. nov., isolated from freshwater, and emended descriptions of Flavobacterium chungangense, Flavobacterium aquidurense, Flavobacterium tructae and Flavobacterium granuli  ap. 4173-4178.  aA Gram-stain-negative, aerobic and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated HME7524 ᵀ, was isolated from freshwater of Gyeong-an stream in Korea.

The physicochemical properties of 20% of coconut and/or C. inophyllum biodiesel–diesel blend (B20), 0.03 wt% of PMA with B20 (B20P), and diesel fuel were measured and compared to ASTM D6751, D7467, and EN 14214 standard. The test results showed that the addition of PMA additive with B20 significantly improves the cold-flow properties such as pour point (PP), cloud point (CP), and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). The addition of PMA additives reduced the engine’s brake-specific energy consumption of all tested fuels. Engine emission results showed that the additive-added fuel reduce PM concentration than B20 and diesel, whereas the PM size and NOX emission both increased than B20 fuel and baseline diesel fuel. Also, the effect of adding PMA into B20 reduced Carbon (C), Aluminum (Al), Potassium (K), and volatile materials in the soot, whereas it increased Oxygen (O), Fluorine (F), Zinc (Zn), Barium (Ba), Chlorine (Cl), Sodium (Na), and fixed carbon. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) results for B20P showed the lower agglomeration than B20 and diesel fuel. Therefore, B20P fuel can be used as an alternative to diesel fuel in diesel engines to lower the harmful emissions without compromising the fuel quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalophyllum inophyllum 3aadditives 3aaluminum 3abarium 3acarbon 3achlorine 3acoconuts 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afluid mechanics 3afluorine 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3aparticulates 3apotassium 3apour point 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium 3asoot 3azinc1 aMasjuki, Haji Hassan1 aKalam, Mohammad Abdul1 aZulkifli, Nurin Wahidah Mohd1 aShancita, Islam0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 22 p.18479-18493dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9333-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245009000184300001800274500001500292520146900307592002801776650001801804650002001822650000801842650002801850650001501878650001601893650002901909650007701938650002902015650006702044650003802111650001102149650002502160650002002185651001502205653003602220700002002256700001902276700002502295773011702320856004802437852000902485655001202494IND50072328620221118193859.0140130e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007232862DNAL7 a243624962pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-013-3507-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegawa, Randy10aCommunity air monitoring for pesticides. Part 1: selecting pesticides and a community  ap. 1327-1341.  a2019-12-06  aThe CA Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) developed methods to select pesticides and a community to fulfill criteria for an ambient air monitoring study it conducted as part of the CA Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Justice Action Plan. Using a scoring system, CDPR evaluated 100 pesticides based on statewide-reported pesticide use, volatility, and priority in CDPR's risk assessment process (indicators of exposure and toxicity) to produce a list of pesticides to consider as candidates for monitoring. The CDPR also evaluated and scored 83 communities based on demographics and health factors, availability of cumulative impacts data, and reported pesticide use to create a list of community candidates. The scores provide relative rankings to distinguish more highly impacted communities from less impacted ones and to identify which pesticides might contribute most to potential adverse health effects. These methods use criteria that can be quantified, validated, and verified in order to provide a transparent and fair selection process. Based on public comments and highest scores, CDPR recommended 40 pesticides (including some of their degradation products) and one community for its yearlong monitoring study. The CDPR then further refined its list of pesticides by soliciting input from local and technical advisory groups. The CDPR plans to use these methods to select pesticides and communities in future monitoring activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3apesticide law 3aadverse effects 3aair 3arisk assessment process 3apesticides 2aAgriculture 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aAir Pollutionxlegislation & jurisprudencexstatistics & numerical data. 2aCommunity Participation. 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHumans 2aPesticidesxanalysis 2aRisk Assessment 0aCalifornia 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aLevine, Johanna1 aNeal, Rosemary1 aBrattesani, Madeline0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 Mar., v. 186, no. 3 p.1327-1341dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3507-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245009900160300001600259520137100275592002801646650001501674650001701689650002501706650001501731650002601746650001101772650001401783650001801797650001301815651001201828773013001840856007501970852000902045655001202054IND60693457520221120124511.0200506e19970101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069345752DNAL7 a10.4296/cwrj22043772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Kevin R.10aReduction of sedimentation through flow manipulation: martindale pond, st. catharines, ontario  ap. 377-394.  aThis paper summarizes the results of a three-dimensional moveable-bed, physical-hydraulic model study for proposed engineering improvements, implemented as part of an ecosystem management plan for Martindale Pond, St. Catharines, Ontario. The ecosystem management plan is being undertaken in conjunction with improvements to the Henley Rowing Course, which recently was awarded the 1999 World Rowing Championships. The ecosystem management plan consists of improving water quality, sedimentation regimes and bank stability in Martindale Pond, and bringing an existing rowing course up to current international standards for the world championships. The model study was undertaken at a distorted scale (1:100 horizontal; 1:25 vertical). The model demonstrated that improvements to the flow regime along the rowing course will provide a number of benefits including decreasing the potential for incoming sediment to be re-deposited on the floor of the course, decreasing local bank erosion (thus reducing sediment loading in Martindale Pond), providing a uniform flow distribution across the rowing lanes, and increasing the ecological quality of the pond. Enhancement of the ecosystem will improve water quality, improve environmental conditions for the wetland areas, increase the bio-diversity of the pond ecosystem, and provide recreational and aesthetic benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3abank erosion 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3asediments 3awater quality 3awetlands 3aOntario0 tCanadian water resources journal.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 22, no. 4 p.377-394dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:2043x1918-18177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4296/cwrj22043773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01786naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245004300165300001400208520069200222592002800914650003200942650002100974650002000995650001001015650001801025650002501043650002901068650002601097653002301123653001201146653002201158653002201180700002001202773009901222856008201321852000901403655001201412IND60519760820221118130931.0180620e20080301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051976082DNAL7 a10.2478/s11535-008-0001-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrody, Yehuda10aVisualizing transcription in real-time  ap. 11-18.  aThe transcriptional process is at the center of the gene expression pathway.

A series of biochemical and structural modifications render the polymerase transcriptionally active so that it can proceed from an initiation state into a functional elongating phase. Recent experimental efforts have attempted to visualize these processes as they take place on genes in living cells and to quantify the kinetics of in vivo transcription.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0amRNA transcription 0aNucleus 0aLive-cell imaging 0aCellular dynamics1 aShav-Tal, Yaron0 tOpen life sciences.g2008 Mar. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.11-18dVersitawJournal:23145x2391-54127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-008-0001-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245009300205300001100298520168800309592002801997650001102025650001602036650002002052650002602072650001602098650002902114650001102143650001302154650001802167650002002185650002202205650001302227650002402240700002002264700001902284700001802303773014102321856008202462852000902544655001202553IND60656312320221119132607.0200313e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065631232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-019-1309-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonda, Takeshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3465-190710aSensitization to human decreases human-wildlife conflict: empirical and simulation study  ap. 71.  aFor resolving human-wildlife conflict, traditional wildlife management often uses population control. However, recent studies suggest that in some cases, there is a weak relationship between conflicts and population size. This is because some problem animals cause most of conflicts and other non-problem animals cause little conflicts. For resolving human-wildlife conflict, managing animal behavior could be effective. This study conducted hazing experiments for managing the sensitivity of wildlife (i.e., habituation and sensitization to humans), because sensitized wildlife should reduce conflicts. Behavioral studies predict this causal relationship, but little critical evaluation of the relationship has been tested in a wildlife management study. Therefore, practical and logical evaluation is needed. A hazing experiment and path analysis revealed that macaques which were frequently hazed using airsoft guns were sensitized and sensitized macaques had reduced conflicts with humans (i.e., crop damage and open land usage). In addition, using flight initiation distance, we developed simulation models which examined the effects of habituation and sensitization on conflicts. The simulation showed that a habituated population had increased conflicts and a sensitized population had reduced conflicts. These results supported the results of our hazing experiment. Both the field experiment and simulation showed the effectiveness of managing wildlife sensitivity practically and logically. Managing sensitivity could be another measure against human-wildlife conflicts. It should be noted that effective hazing did not need intense stimuli but did require high rate hazing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca 3acrop damage 3aescape behavior 3afield experimentation 3ahabituation 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3ahumans 3aland use 3apath analysis 3apopulation size 3asimulation models 3awildlife 3awildlife management1 aYamabata, Naoto1 aIijima, Hayato1 aUchida, Kenta0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2019 Oct., v. 65, no. 5 p.71-71dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-019-1309-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002200158245011900180300001600299520107600315592002801391650002101419650001601440650001901456650001101475650002001486650002001506650001301526650002601539700001301565700001601578700002001594700002201614773019201636856007301828852000901901655001201910IND60082586920221119022709.0141029e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008258692DNAL7 a252276352pmid7 a10.1111/tpj.126622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHam, Byung‐Kook10aSystemic delivery of siRNA in pumpkin by a plant PHLOEM SMALL RNA‐BINDING PROTEIN 1–ribonucleoprotein complex  ap. 683-694.  aIn plants, the vascular system, specifically the phloem, functions in delivery of small RNA (sRNA) to exert epigenetic control over developmental and defense‐related processes. Although the importance of systemic sRNA delivery has been established, information is currently lacking concerning the nature of the protein machinery involved in this process. Here, we show that a PHLOEM SMALL‐RNA BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PSRP1) serves as the basis for formation of an sRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (sRNPC) that delivers sRNA (primarily 24 nt) to sink organs. Assembly of this complex is facilitated through PSRP1 phosphorylation by a phloem‐localized protein kinase, PSRPK1. During long‐distance transport, PSRP1–sRNPC is stable against phloem phosphatase activity. Within target tissues, phosphatase activity results in disassembly of PSRP1–sRNPC, a process that is probably required for unloading cargo sRNA into surrounding cells. These findings provide an insight into the mechanism involved in delivery of sRNA associated with systemic gene silencing in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3aepigenetics 3agene silencing 3aphloem 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinases 3apumpkins 3asmall interfering RNA1 aLi, Gang1 aJia, Weitao1 aLeary, Julie A.1 aLucas, William J.0 tplant journal.g2014 Nov., v. 80, no. 4 p.683-694dBlackwell Scientific Publishers and BIOS Scientific Publishers in association with the Society for Experimental Biologyx0960-74127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.126623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009400173300001800267520101000285592002801295650003701323650001501360650001501375650001101390650001901401650002101420650001301441650001301454650001201467650002301479650001701502650002101519700002301540773008101563856008401644852000901728655001201737IND60092293820221118011213.0141103e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009229382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2012.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrondein, Aurélie10aCovalent grafting of aminated compounds on Vulcan XC72R by melamine in situ diazotization  ap. 4335-4342.  aThe immobilization of 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine on carbon Vulcan XC72R surface was achieved through the in situ diazotization of melamine. The resulting grafted species represent 2.3wt.% of the modified material and are thermally stable up to 265°C. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms show that the carbon microporosity decreased after modification translating in a 25% decrease of the BET surface area. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data suggest the presence of 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine groups at the surface by bonding through a carbon–carbon bond and/or by an azo bridge. These materials were evaluated as CO₂ sorbents by thermal swing adsorption in a thermogravimetric analyzer. At 40°C, the modified powders displayed a maximal adsorption capacity of 0.23mmol/g that is smaller than the initial unmodified material. Nonetheless adsorption capacity of the grafting groups helps to improve the selectivity of the materials although physisorption seems to be the main mechanism for CO₂ capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical bonding 3amelamine 3anitrogen 3apowders 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3athermogravimetry1 aBélanger, Daniel,0 tCarbon.g2012 Oct., v. 50, no. 12 p.4335-4342dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2012.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007900166300001600245520109900261592002801360596006301388650001501451650000801466650001201474650001101486650001601497650001101513650001201524650001301536650001401549650001801563650002201581650001701603650001001620650003001630650002201660650001701682700001901699700001801718700002301736700002401759700002601783700002201809700002301831773014301854856008201997852000902079655001202088IND60656312420221119132645.0190812e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065631242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-019-00399-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianco, Carlo10aDemodicosis in a captive African straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum)  ap. 547-554.  aDemodicosis is most frequently observed in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), but it has rarely been reported in bats (Chiroptera). The overpopulation of Demodex spp. that causes dermatological changes is generally associated with a compromised immune system. We describe the gross and histological features of generalized demodicosis in an adult female African straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) drawn from a captive research colony. The histology of the lesions revealed comedones and follicular infundubular cysts harbouring numerous Demodex spp. mites, eliciting a minimal inflammatory response in the adjacent dermis. The histological examination of a full set of tissues did not reveal clear evidence of immunosuppression, although a clinical history of recent abortion and possible stressors due to captivity could be considered risk factors for the demodicosis.

Forty Comisana male lambs, on average weighing 13.75±1.90kg, were divided into four homogenous groups of ten and called, in relation to the diet: group T those grazing on T. subterraneum; Group L on L. multiflorum; Group TL on adjacent monocultures of T. subterraneum and L. multiflorum (66.6 and 33.3% of surface, respectively); Group LT on adjacent monocultures of T. subterraneum and L. multiflorum (33.3 and 66.6% of surface, respectively). Every 10 days, samples of forage species ingested by grazing lambs were collected and analysed. At 90 days of age, with an average live weight of 25.44, 23.44, 24.69 and 24.75kg for T, L, TL and LT group, respectively, all lambs were slaughtered and a sample of Longissimus dorsi muscle for each animal was collected to study the chemical and acidic composition. No significant differences among the groups were observed for the growth performance and for the chemical composition of the meat. As regards the fatty acid classes, significant differences (P<0.05) were observed for the monounsaturated fatty acids, which were lower in the group T (35.46%) than those of the groups L (38.24%), TL (38.63%) and LT (38.59%), whereas, significant higher values for the group T were observed for the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n-3 (4.49%) and n-6 (8.26%) series than those of the n-6 series for group L (6.79%; P<0.05) and than those of both series for group LT (n-3=3.64%; P<0.05 and n-6=6.43%; P<0.05). The fatty acids that have significantly determined the modifications of the acidic classes were: oleic acid, which showed significant (P<0.05) lower values in the group T (26.70%) than the levels observed in the groups L (30.33%), TL (30.39%) and LT (30.63%) and the linoleic, linolenic and rumenic acids which were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the groups T (linoleic=5.13%; linolenic=1.97%; rumenic=0.46%) and TL (linoleic=4.75%; linolenic=1.82%; rumenic=0.41%) than those of the groups L (linoleic=4.10%; linolenic=1.52%; rumenic=0.26%) and LT (linoleic=3.95%; linolenic=1.42%; rumenic=0.33%). These differences could be due to the different dynamic activity of the cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen, related to the different levels of fibrous fractions of the diets. No significant difference was observed for saturated fatty acid, unsaturated/saturated fatty acids ratio and Atherogenic and Thrombogenic indices among the groups, whereas, PUFA/SFA ratio showed significant (P<0.05) higher value in group T than that in the group LT. T. subterraneum monoculture grazed as monoculture (T) and in mixture with L. multiflorum (66/33, TL) increased the linoleic, linolenic and rumenic acids improving the dietetic-nutritional characteristics of the lamb meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aTrifolium subterraneum 3abody weight 3afatty acid composition 3agrazing 3agrowth performance 3alamb meat 3alambs 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat composition 3aoleic acid 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arumen bacteria 3asaturated fatty acids1 aSimonella, Stefano1 aDi Grigoli, Antonino1 aLiotta, Luigi1 aFrenda, Alfonso Salvatore1 aPresti, Vittorio Lo1 aBonanno, Adriana1 aChiofalo, Vincenzo0 tSmall ruminant research.g2010 Feb., v. 88, no. 2-3 p.89-96dElsevier B.V.x0921-44887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2009.12.015  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245006600210300001600276500001900292520124100311592002801552650003401580650001901614650001101633650001501644650001401659650002601673650001201699650002201711650001701733650001301750653001701763653002101780653001601801700006101817700001901878700001701897700005801914700002301972700002001995700001902015773014502034856008202179852000902261655001202270IND60690480420221118100638.0200427e20200521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069048042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsutsuki, Hiroyasu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6258-631310a8-Nitro-cGMP modulates exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells  ap. 225-230.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNitric oxide (NO)-mediated production of cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) is a crucial signaling pathway that controls a wide array of neuronal functions, including exocytotic neurotransmitter release. A novel nitrated derivative of cGMP, 8-nitro-cGMP, not only activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), but also has membrane permeability and redox activity to produce superoxide and S-guanylated protein. To date, no studies have addressed the effects of 8-nitro-cGMP on exocytotic kinetics. Here, we aimed to assess the 8-nitro-cGMP-mediated modulation of the depolarization-evoked catecholamine release from bovine chromaffin cells. 8-Nitro-cGMP was produced in bovine chromaffin cells dependent on NO donor. Amperometric analysis revealed that 8-nitro-cGMP modulated the kinetic parameters of secretory spikes from chromaffin cells, particularly decreased the speed of individual spikes, resulting in a reduced amperometric spike height, slope β, and absolute value of slope γ. The modulatory effects were independent of the PKG signal and superoxide production. This is the first study to demonstrate that 8-nitro-cGMP modulates exocytosis and provide insights into a novel regulatory mechanism of exocytosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acGMP-dependent protein kinase 3acatecholamines 3acattle 3aexocytosis 3aguanosine 3amembrane permeability 3aneurons 3aneurotransmitters 3anitric oxide 3aresearch 0a8-Nitro-cGMP 0aChromaffin cells 0aAmperometry1 aKasamatsu, Shingo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3094-85431 aKunieda, Kohei1 aIda, Tomoaki1 aSawa, Tomohiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7949-73091 aSasakawa, Nobuyuki1 aAkaike, Takaaki1 aIhara, Hideshi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 May 21, v. 526, no. 1 p.225-230dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013700177300001600314500001900330520152600349536010001875592002801975596004602003650003202049650002102081650002802102650002502130650001202155650002502167650001702192650002602209650002802235650001702263650001802280650001902298650001802317650001702335650002302352650001802375653002202393653001902415653001302434653000902447700003002456700001602486700002402502700001702526700002402543773011702567856008502684852000902769655001202778IND60728134920221121034154.0210217e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072813492DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2020.17563512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabrielson, Denise K.10aEvaluation of Nutritional, Inflammatory, and Fatty Acid Status in Patients with Gastric and Colorectal Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy  ap. 420-432.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMalnutrition is prevalent in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients, possibly due to inflammation and altered fatty acids (FA). There is a lack of research describing nutritional decline in these patients during chemotherapy. We described changes in nutritional, inflammatory, and FA status over time and factors relating to change in nutritional status according to tumor presence in 41 GI cancer patients undergoing first-line treatment over four chemotherapy visits, using linear mixed effects models. At baseline, 53% of patients were malnourished. Over time, there was a decrease in the proportion of malnourished vs. well-nourished individuals (β= −0.564, p < 0.01). Median concentrations of plasma linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, total n-3, total n-6 and total plasma phospholipid FA increased over time. Changes over time in nutritional status based on weight (p < 0.001), fat free mass (FFM) measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA, p = 0.02), and skinfold anthropometry (FSA, p = 0.04) were significantly dependent on tumor presence. There were positive associations between weight and total n-3 (β = 0.02, p < 0.01), FFM and IL-6 (BIA, β = 0.028, p = 0.02; FSA, β = 0.03, p = 0.02), and FFM and total n-6 (BIA, β = 0.003, p = 0.01). Changes in nutritional status during chemotherapy were negatively impacted by tumor presence, and were associated with increasing concentrations of cytokines and FA.  aThis work was supported by a research grant from the Canadian Foundation for Dietetic Research.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanadian Foundation for Dietetic Research 3aanthropometric measurements 3aarachidonic acid 3abioelectrical impedance 3acolorectal neoplasms 3adecline 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adrug therapy 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3agastrointestinal system 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alean body mass 3alinoleic acid 3amalnutrition 3anutritional status 3aphospholipids 0aColorectal cancer 0agastric cancer 0acachexia 0adiet1 aBrezden-Masley, Christine1 aKeith, Mary1 aBazinet, Richard P.1 aSykes, Jenna1 aDarling, Pauline B.0 tNutrition and cancer.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 73, no. 3 p.420-432dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.17563513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04151naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006000141245010800201300001600309520226800325592002802593650002302621650002102644650001602665650001702681650001602698650001202714650001702726650001302743650002702756650001102783650001202794650002102806650002302827650000902850650002302859650001902882650001302901650001602914650001202930650001702942650001002959651001602969651001302985653005202998653003303050653002403083700006003107700002103167700002003188700002403208700002203232700001903254700002203273700002403295773012203319856007503441852000903516655001203525IND60710962620221121031916.0200915e20200113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071096262DNAL7 a10.1017/wet.2020.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranca, Lucas X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6063-671910aEvaluation of optimal droplet size for control of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) with acifluorfen  ap. 511-519.  aAcifluorfen is a nonsystemic PPO-inhibiting herbicide commonly used for POST Palmer amaranth control in soybean, peanut, and rice across the southern United States. Concerns have been raised regarding herbicide selection pressure and particle drift, increasing the need for application practices that optimize herbicide efficacy while mitigating spray drift. Field research was conducted in 2016, 2017, and 2018 in Mississippi and Nebraska to evaluate the influence of a range of spray droplet sizes [150 µm (Fine) to 900 µm (Ultra Coarse)], using acifluorfen to create a novel Palmer amaranth management recommendation using pulse width modulation (PWM) technology. A pooled site-year generalized additive model (GAM) analysis suggested that 150-µm (Fine) droplets should be used to obtain the greatest Palmer amaranth control and dry biomass reduction. Nevertheless, GAM models indicated that only 7.2% of the variability observed in Palmer amaranth control was due to differences in spray droplet size. Therefore, location-specific GAM analyses were performed to account for geographical differences to increase the accuracy of prediction models. GAM models suggested that 250-µm (Medium) droplets optimize acifluorfen efficacy on Palmer amaranth in Dundee, MS, and 310-µm (Medium) droplets could sustain 90% of maximum weed control. Specific models for Beaver City, NE, indicated that 150-µm (Fine) droplets provide maximum Palmer amaranth control, and 340-µm (Medium) droplets could maintain 90% of greatest weed control. For Robinsonville, MS, optimal Palmer amaranth control could be obtained with 370-µm (Coarse) droplets, and 90% maximum control could be sustained with 680 µm (Ultra Coarse) droplets. Differences in optimal droplet size across location could be a result of convoluted interactions between droplet size, weather conditions, population density, plant morphology, and soil fertility levels. Future research should adopt a holistic approach to identify and investigate the influence of environmental and application parameters to optimize droplet size recommendations.

In the present study, a total of 69 BNR isolates were recovered from cankered subterraneous stems of potato collected from 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of China. Based on the morphological characteristics and sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal DNA, 48 isolates were classified as anastomosis group (AG)-A with a ratio of 69.56 %, 15 isolates (21.74 %) were AG-K, four isolates (5.80 %) were AG-F, one isolate (1.45 %) was AG-I and one isolate (1.45 %) was AG-U. Pathogenicity tests under glasshouse conditions revealed that all BNR isolates, except for the AG-I isolate, could induce symptoms of stem canker on potato plants with disease incidence ranging from 5.26 to 55.56 % and disease index ranging from 1.32 to 13.89, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report about BNR AGs causing stem canker on potato plants in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizoctonia 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3adisease incidence 3agreenhouses 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogenicity 3apotatoes 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3astem cankers 3astems 3aChina1 aZhao, Can1 aGuo, Zejian1 aWu, Xuehong0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2014 July, v. 139, no. 3 p.535-544dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0409-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002000162245008500182300001600267500001900283500000900302520083500311592002801146650001401174650001301188650001701201650001101218650001801229650001701247650002401264650001501288700001701303700001801320773012201338856009701460852000901557655001201566IND60663594420221121062720.0191122e196707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066359442DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1967.00021962005900040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, J.

Continuous cotton resulted in a lower organic matter content in the surface soil than continuous lespedeza, while the soil bulk density under cotton was considerably higher than lespedeza at the 12.7 to 20.3-cm depth. The maximum compaction that could be given the Norge loam, a Reddish Prairie soil, when subjected to a constant load, was directly related to the amount of organic matter present in the soil. Maximum compaction was extremely sensitive to small changes in organic matter caused by different cropping practices. Data also shows maximum compaction occurs on a Norge loam at a soilwater pressure of 1/3-bar, or at what is frequently called “field capacity”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLespedeza 3aagronomy 3abulk density 3acotton 3aprairie soils 3asoil density 3asoil organic matter 3asoil water1 aGray, Fenton1 aPinson, D.

Water contact angles for these brushes measured at different temperatures reveal that the polymer brushes collapse and dehydrate around 13°C and 25°C (TTs), respectively, upon elevating the temperature. At 37°C, seeded fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) adhere to and spread well onto these brush surfaces although the copolymer brush of P(NAAMe-co-NAGMe) depresses the number of adherent cells less than half of that for the homopolymer of PNAAMe after 24h of cell culture due to increment in hydrophilicity. To prepare the cell-sheet, the cells are seeded on both polymer brushes and cultured at 37°C in the presence of serum. After 4days, the cells proliferated confluently on these brush surfaces. Lowering the temperature to 4°C and 20°C below TT of each brush led to the cell-sheet detachment as a monolayer form from the polymer brushes accompanying with the switching of surface affinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3ablood serum 3acell culture 3acolloids 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3afibroblasts 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3apolymerization 3atemperature 0aAmino acid-derived vinyl polymer 0aThermo-responsive polymer brush 0aSurface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization 0aCollapse temperature (TT) 0aFibroblasts culture 0aCell sheet engineering1 aHirata, Ayaha1 aNishimura, Shin-nosuke1 aKoga, Tomoyuki0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 159 p.39-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2017.07.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006400176300001300240520189400253592002802147650001302175650001402188650001802202650001502220650001602235653001402251653001602265653001502281653001202296653002502308653001802333773008102351856008602432852000902518655001202527IND60563248020221119125305.0170719e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056324802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIverson, Richard M.10aScaling and design of landslide and debris-flow experiments  ap. 9-20.  aScaling plays a crucial role in designing experiments aimed at understanding the behavior of landslides, debris flows, and other geomorphic phenomena involving grain-fluid mixtures. Scaling can be addressed by using dimensional analysis or – more rigorously – by normalizing differential equations that describe the evolving dynamics of the system. Both of these approaches show that, relative to full-scale natural events, miniaturized landslides and debris flows exhibit disproportionately large effects of viscous shear resistance and cohesion as well as disproportionately small effects of excess pore-fluid pressure that is generated by debris dilation or contraction. This behavioral divergence grows in proportion to H3, where H is the thickness of a moving mass. Therefore, to maximize geomorphological relevance, experiments with wet landslides and debris flows must be conducted at the largest feasible scales. Another important consideration is that, unlike stream flows, landslides and debris flows accelerate from statically balanced initial states. Thus, no characteristic macroscopic velocity exists to guide experiment scaling and design. On the other hand, macroscopic gravity-driven motion of landslides and debris flows evolves over a characteristic time scale (L/g)1/2, where g is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration and L is the characteristic length of the moving mass. Grain-scale stress generation within the mass occurs on a shorter time scale, H/(gL)1/2, which is inversely proportional to the depth-averaged material shear rate. A separation of these two time scales exists if the criterion H/L<<1 is satisfied, as is commonly the case. This time scale separation indicates that steady-state experiments can be used to study some details of landslide and debris-flow behavior but cannot be used to study macroscopic landslide or debris-flow dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3aequations 3ageomorphology 3alandslides 3astream flow 0aLandslide 0aDebris flow 0aExperiment 0aScaling 0aDimensional analysis 0aNormalization0 tGeomorphology.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 244 p.9-20dElsevier B.V.x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010000163300001600263520134300279592002801622650002801650650000901678650001301687650001901700650002501719650002001744650001701764650002701781650000901808650001301817650001201830650001401842650002001856650001201876650004701888700001201935773011101947856004802058852000902106655001202115IND50090047420221117234820.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009004742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-014-0410-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jiahuai10aInheritance of mefenoxam resistance in Phytophthora nicotianae populations from a plant nursery  ap. 545-555.  aThree sexual crosses involving isolates of P. nicotianae with differing sensitivity to mefenoxam were established to study the inheritance of mefenoxam resistance. Mefenoxam sensitivity was determined by measuring the mycelial growth on both mefenoxam-amended clarified V8 agar and non-amended agar and then calculating the relative growth. When both parents had the same phenotype (both were resistant or both were sensitive), all F ₁ progeny had the parental phenotype and no segregation for a major effect gene was observed in sensitivity to mefenoxam. However, variations in the mycelial growth of progeny indicated the segregation of minor-effect genes. When the cross involving the mefenoxam-resistant isolate 3A4 and a sensitive parent, the F ₁ progeny segregated for mefenoxam resistance in a ratio of 1:1 (resistant: sensitive), indicating that the mefenoxam resistance is controled by a single dominant gene. Mating type was not linked to the mefenoxam-resistance gene locus. One RAPD marker linked in trans to the MEX locus was obtained by bulked segregant analysis using RAPD markers and was converted to a sequence characterized amplified region marker (SCAR). The SCAR maker identified in this study is a limited but useful tool for differentiating homozygous resistant isolates from sensitive isolates of P. nicotianae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3aagar 3acrossing 3adominant genes 3afungicide resistance 3agenetic markers 3ahomozygosity 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aloci 3amycelium 3aparents 3aphenotype 3aplant nurseries 3aprogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique1 aLi, Yao0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2014 July, v. 139, no. 3 p.545-555dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-014-0410-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245010300177300001600280520167500296592002801971650001701999650003102016650003102047650002002078650001402098650002802112650002002140650002102160650002002181650001702201650002002218650002102238650000902259650002302268650001902291650001102310650001902321650001102340650001702351650001202368650003502380653001802415653004002433653003902473653001502512700001902527700001402546700001402560700001402574700001902588700001802607700002002625700001902645700005902664773009202723856009002815852000902905655001202914IND60603495520221123021118.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Feng-ying10aMicroencapsulation of tumor lysates and live cell engineering with MIP-3α as an effective vaccine  ap. 554-565.  aThe combination of several potential strategies so as to develop new tumor vaccines is an attractive field of translational medicine. Pulsing tumor lysates with dendritic cells (DCs), in-vivo attraction of DCs by macrophage inflammatory protein 3α (MIP-3α), and reversion of the tumor suppressive microenvironment have been tested as strategies to develop tumor vaccines. In this study, we generated an alginate microsphere (named PaLtTcAdMIP3α) that encapsulated tumor lysates, live tumor cells engineering with a recombinant MIP-3α adenovirus and BCG. We used PaLtTcAdMIP3α as a model vaccine to test its antitumor activities. Our results showed that PaLtTcAdMIP3α expressed and excreted MIP-3α, which effectively attracted DCs ex vivo and in vivo. Injection of PaLtTcAdMIP3α into tumor-bearing mice effectively induced both therapeutic and prophylactic antitumor immunities in CT26, Meth A, B16-F10 and H22 models, but without any ensuing increase in adverse effects. Both tumor-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, especially the CD8⁺ T cell-dependent cytotoxic T immunity, were found in the mice injected with PaLtTcAdMIP3α. The anti-tumor activity was abrogated completely by depletion of CD8⁺ and partially by CD4⁺ T lymphocytes. In addition, the number of IFN-γ-producing CD8⁺ T cells in spleen and tumor tissues was significantly increased; but the number of CD4⁺CD25⁺FOXP3⁺ regulatory T cells (Treg) in tumor tissues was decreased. These data strongly suggest that a combination of multi-current-using strategies such as the novel approach of using our PaLtTcAdMIP3α microspheres could be an effective tumor model vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aadverse effects 3aalginates 3aantineoplastic activity 3acancer vaccines 3acell engineering 3achemokine CCL20 3acytotoxicity 3adendritic cells 3ahumoral immunity 3amice 3amicroencapsulation 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aspleen 3atherapeutics 3atissues 3atranslational medical research 0aTumor vaccine 0aMacrophage inflammatory protein 3α 0aTumor suppressive microenvironment 0aDC vaccine1 aHuang, Feng-ru1 aChen, Bin1 aLiu, Quan1 aWang, Hua1 aZhou, Song-lin1 aZhao, Huan-ge1 aHuang, Yong-hao1 aLin, Ying-ying1 aTan, Guang-hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6406-03310 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.554-565dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008500162300001600247520055000263592002800813653001400841653003600855653001800891653002800909700001800937700001900955700001900974773010100993856008101094852000901175655001201184IND60520192420160516000000.0160516e20120131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052019242DNAL7 a10.2478/v10161-011-0066-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, R.10aSynthesis of Some New Thiazolidine Derivatives and Their Biological Significance  ap. 296-307.  aAn efficient route for the synthesis of new series of N-[3-(1H-1,2,3-benzotriazol-1-yl)-propyl]-2-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxo-5-(substituted benzylidene)-1,3-thiazolidine carboxamide, compounds 5 (a-j) has been elaborated.

Results revealed that total phenolic contents and radical scavenging activity decreased significantly at the initial stages and were stable in frying oil, indicating stability of frying oil. A significant increase occurred in chlorophylls of watercress leaves and frying oil. HPLC chromatograms showed a total of 12 phenolic compounds containing caftaric acid (17.3–31.8 µg/g), sinapic acid derivative (11.2–14.4 µg/g), 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (9.98–12.8 µg/g), 4-O-feruloyl quinic acid (8.47–13.4 µg/g), caffeoyl feruloyl quinic acid (7.31–11.7 µg/g) and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3.73–6.51 µg/g) as major compounds. A significant increase in the caffeic acid, caffeoyl hexose, chlorogenic acid, caftaric acid, coumaric acid derivatives and 3, 4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid was observed, while a decrease occurred in Sinapic acid derivative, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4-O-feruloyl quinic acid and caffeoyl feruloyl quinic acid. Frying of watercress leaves increase the bioavailability of medicinally important phenolic compounds and also help to stabilise the frying oil.  aPublisher supplied data  a2344cHigher Education Commision, Pakistan 3aNasturtium officinale 3aantioxidant activity 3abioavailability 3acaffeic acid 3acaftaric acid 3achlorogenic acid 3achlorophyll 3adiodes 3afrying 3afrying oil 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aquinic acid 3asinapic acid 3asunflower oil 3awatercress1 aHabib, Asia0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2018 Dec., v. 12, no. 4 p.2677-2684dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-018-9885-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245011300175300001600288520111700304592002801421650001701449650001801466650002601484650001601510650001201526650001901538650001701557650001401574650002101588650001501609650001401624650001401638650001401652653001701666653001701683653000801700653001301708653001201721653001901733700001901752700001801771700002101789700002101810700002601831700002701857773009201884856009001976852000902066655001202075IND60603495620221123032507.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBray, Laura J.10aMulti-parametric hydrogels support 3D in vitro bioengineered microenvironment models of tumour angiogenesis  ap. 609-620.  aTumour microenvironment greatly influences the development and metastasis of cancer progression. The development of three dimensional (3D) culture models which mimic that displayed in vivo can improve cancer biology studies and accelerate novel anticancer drug screening. Inspired by a systems biology approach, we have formed 3D in vitro bioengineered tumour angiogenesis microenvironments within a glycosaminoglycan-based hydrogel culture system. This microenvironment model can routinely recreate breast and prostate tumour vascularisation. The multiple cell types cultured within this model were less sensitive to chemotherapy when compared with two dimensional (2D) cultures, and displayed comparative tumour regression to that displayed in vivo. These features highlight the use of our in vitro culture model as a complementary testing platform in conjunction with animal models, addressing key reduction and replacement goals of the future. We anticipate that this biomimetic model will provide a platform for the in-depth analysis of cancer development and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiomimetics 3abreasts 3acarcinogenesis 3adrug therapy 3ahydrogels 3ain vitro culture 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3aremission 3ascreening 0aAngiogenesis 0aCell culture 0aECM 0aHydrogel 0aHeparin 0aCarcinogenesis1 aBinner, Marcus1 aHolzheu, Anja1 aFriedrichs, Jens1 aFreudenberg, Uwe1 aHutmacher, Dietmar W.1 aWerner, C.q(Carsten),0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.609-620dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.1243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245009500180300001600275500001900291500000900310520182500319592002802144650002202172650001302194650002802207650002702235650002602262650000902288650001402297650001302311650001102324650001702335651001102352700001902363773012202382856009702504852000902601655001202610IND60663594820221121042126.0191122e198003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066359482DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1980.00021962007200020008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarlen, D.

Therefore, we established an experiment to study the growth and development pattern of ‘Centurk’ wheat in eastern Kansas and to measure changes in the N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations in various plant parts collected throughout the growing season. Total dry matter accumulation was measured by collecting all above ground plant material. Plant samples were fractionated into living leaves, senescing leaves, stems, heads, head parts, grain, and crowns which were dried, ground, wet-digested, and analyzed. Regression analyses were computed to identify significant trends. Total dry matter accumulation averaged 0.8 metric tons/ha in the fall, and reached a maximum of 13.0 metric tons/ha at physiological maturity. Nitrogen, P, K, Ca, and Cu concentrations in whole plant samples collected during the fall decreased gradually, while Mg and Zn concentrations remained relatively constant. The S and Mn concentrations were extremely variable and showed no significant statistical trends. Nitrogen, P, K, Cat Cu, Mn, and Zn concentrations decreased in whole plants as they approached physiological maturity. Magnesium concentrations were relatively constant at approximately 0.18% during the spring. Analysis of individual plant fractions showed nutrient changes similar to those found in the whole plant samples. Grain yields from these experiments were similar to those reported for ‘Centurk’ wheat in performance trials. We feel that this information is useful in identifying the pattern of dry matter accumulation and in illustrating changes in nutrient concentrations during the life cycle of hard red winter wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomy 3adry matter accumulation 3agrowth and development 3ahard red winter wheat 3ahead 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3aspring 3awinter wheat 3aKansas1 aWhitney, D.

Thus, the ability to visualize cycling hypoxia in cells and in vivo is of great significance. To address this critical need, we have developed ruthenium(II) anthraquinone complexes as reversible two-photon luminescent probes; these probes are well suited for selectively and dynamically monitoring cycling hypoxia in live cells. Moreover, the probes can conveniently visualize inner hypoxia in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids and detect repeated cycles of hypoxia-reoxygenation in living zebrafish via two-photon luminescent imaging. The present study provides a powerful luminescent imaging tool for dynamically sensing of cycling hypoxia in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aanthraquinones 3adrug therapy 3ahypoxia 3aimage analysis 3aluminescence 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aradiotherapy 3aruthenium 0aHypoxia 0aCycling 0aTwo-photon 0aRu(II) complex 0aAnthraquinone1 aHuang, Huaiyi1 aChen, Yu1 aWang, Jinquan1 aJi, Liangnian1 aChao, Hui0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 53 p.522-531dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.02.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014600181300001600327500001900343520151800362536017801880592002802058650001102086650001602097650001702113650001302130650002402143650001802167650001602185650001102201650001302212650001902225650001702244700004602261700003702307700003102344700002602375700002902401700002302430700003002453773011702483856008502600852000902685655001202694IND60728135520221121034208.0210217e20210316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072813552DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2020.17581702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaccio, Adilson Aparecido10aOral Nutritional Supplementation in Cancer Patients Who Were Receiving Chemo/Chemoradiation Therapy: A Multicenter, Randomized Phase II Study  ap. 442-449.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntroduction: Oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) in cancer patients is justified by the low food intake caused by several factors. However, ONS can be affected by adverse events (AEs) correlated to treatment. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of ONS (whey protein isolated, leucin, zinc-IMMAX®) during oncologic treatment. Methods: Patients in chemo/chemoradiotherapy were randomly assigned to receive IMMAX®+nutritional counseling (NC) according to daily requirements (S arm) or NC alone (C arm) for 4 weeks. Body weight (BW), %fat-free mass (%FFM) and nutrition intake were assessed before and after. In S arm, calories from IMMAX met the energy requirements. AEs were classified according to CTC-AE-NCI. Results: Eighty-five patients were included (51 females). After 4 weeks, the median of caloric intake, BW and %FFM were not statistically different in C arm. In S arm, median ONS intake was 81 g/332 kcal/day, protein intake was higher (pre: 66.75 ± 31.57 g; post: 88.57 ± 35.11 g; p < 0.01) and calories as well (pre: 1,549 ± 596 kcal; post: 1,756 ± 614 kcal; p = 0.02). The most common treatment related AEs were anemia, nausea/vomiting, not different between the arms. AEs supplement related were constipation and diarrhea (2 patients/4.6% each). Conclusion: IMMAX was safe, well tolerated, it did not interfere with oncologic treatment and provided significant amount of protein intake in this patient population, with few related AEs.  aThis study was sponsored by Prodiet Clinical Nutrition, producer of IMMAX, which provided the supplement and financial support to the centers that participated in the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3abody weight 3aconstipation 3adiarrhea 3adietary supplements 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3anausea 3apatients 3aprotein intake 3atherapeutics1 aMattos, Cecilia Helena Peinado de Sampaio1 aSantos, Evandro Airton Sordi dos1 aNeto, Natael Ribeiro Malta1 aMoreira, Raquel Pedro1 a, Luciara Tonelo Batella1 aSantos, Hellin dos1 aCeles, Ana Paula Monnerat0 tNutrition and cancer.g2021 Mar. 16, v. 73, no. 3 p.442-449dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.17581703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245010700176300001500283520144100298592002801739650002201767650001201789650002201801650001701823650002501840650001901865650001401884650002101898650001901919650001501938650001301953650002301966650001501989653002102004653001602025653001802041653001402059653002302073700001802096700002202114700002102136700002302157700001902180700002102199700001802220700002102238700002002259700002302279700001702302700001602319700001902335773009102354856009002445852000902535655001202544IND60603495920221123004027.0180716e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060349592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob, Reeba S.10aSelf healing hydrogels composed of amyloid nano fibrils for cell culture and stem cell differentiation  ap. 97-105.  aAmyloids are highly ordered protein/peptide aggregates associated with human diseases as well as various native biological functions. Given the diverse range of physiochemical properties of amyloids, we hypothesized that higher order amyloid self-assembly could be used for fabricating novel hydrogels for biomaterial applications. For proof of concept, we designed a series of peptides based on the high aggregation prone C-terminus of Aβ42, which is associated with Alzheimer's disease. These Fmoc protected peptides self assemble to β sheet rich nanofibrils, forming hydrogels that are thermoreversible, non-toxic and thixotropic. Mechanistic studies indicate that while hydrophobic, π–π interactions and hydrogen bonding drive amyloid network formation to form supramolecular gel structure, the exposed hydrophobic surface of amyloid fibrils may render thixotropicity to these gels. We have demonstrated the utility of these hydrogels in supporting cell attachment and spreading across a diverse range of cell types. Finally, by tuning the stiffness of these gels through modulation of peptide concentration and salt concentration these hydrogels could be used as scaffolds that can drive differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Taken together, our results indicate that small size, ease of custom synthesis, thixotropic nature makes these amyloid-based hydrogels ideally suited for biomaterial/nanotechnology applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3abiobased products 3acell culture 3acell differentiation 3ahuman diseases 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3ananofibers 3apeptides 3asalt concentration 3astem cells 0aAmyloid hydrogel 0aNanofibrils 0aSelf-assembly 0aStem cell 0aTissue engineering1 aGhosh, Dhiman1 aSingh, Pradeep K.1 aBasu, Santanu K.1 aJha, Narendra Nath1 aDas, Subhadeep1 aSukul, Pradip K.1 aPatil, Sachin1 aSathaye, Sadhana1 aKumar, Ashutosh1 aChowdhury, Arindam1 aMalik, Sudip1 aSen, Shamik1 aMaji, Samir K.0 tBiomaterials.g2015 June, v. 54 p.97-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2015.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014000182300001300322500001500335520184300350592002802193650002802221650002302249650001602272650001402288650001202302650001502314650001102329650002102340650001102361650001202372650001502384650002502399650001202424650003802436650004102474650003802515650002202553650003602575650002202611650002302633650003502656653002302691700002302714700001902737700001502756700002602771700003102797700002202828700002002850773009902870856008102969852000903050655001203059IND4393039120221119213232.0151024e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439303912DNAL7 a170803052pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-006-9201-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhn, Jürgen10aSequestration of Plant-Derived Phenolglucosides by Larvae of the Leaf Beetle Chrysomela lapponica: Thioglucosides as Mechanistic Probes  ap. 5-24.  a2019-12-06  aFeeding larvae of Chrysomela lapponica (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) acquire characteristic O-glucosides from the leaves of their food plants. The glucosides are selectively channeled from the gut to the defensive gland. Subsequent enzymatic transformations generate a blend of different defensive compounds, e.g., salicylaldehyde and two series of 2-methylbutyl and isobutyryl esters. By using systematically modified and hydrolysis-resistant thioglucosides as structural mimics of the plant-derived glucosides, e.g., salicin and its o-, m-, and p-isomers 1, 2, and 3; o-, m-, and p-cresols 5, 6, 7; along with thioglucosides of 2-phenylethanol 9 and (3Z)-hexenol 10, we demonstrated that the larvae of C. lapponica are able to sequester a broad range of structurally different thioglucosides with comparable efficiency. This sharply contrasts with the sequestration habitus previously observed in Chrysomela populi and Phratora vitellinae, which secrete almost pure salicylaldehyde and posses a highly specific transport mechanism for salicin (Kuhn et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:13808–13813, 2004). Also, neither C. lapponica nor C. populi sequester in their gland the thioglucoside of 8-hydroxygeraniol, the mimic of the glucoside specifically transported by larvae secreting iridoid monoterpenes (Phaedon cochleariae, Gastrophysa viridula). Accordingly, leaf beetle larvae possess selective membrane carriers in their gut and their defensive systems that match the orientation of the functional groups of glucosides from their food plants probably by embedding the substrate in a network of hydrogen bonds inside the membrane carriers. The synthesis and the spectroscopic properties of the test compounds along with a comparative evaluation of the transport capabilities of larvae of C. populi and C. lapponica are described.  aPublisher supplied data 3ametabolic sequestration 3atransport proteins 3afood plants 3aaldehydes 3aisomers 3aglucosides 3aesters 3aactive transport 3alarvae 3acresols 3aChrysomela 3adefensive secretions 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxgrowth & development. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aGlucosidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 0aphenolic compounds1 aPettersson, Eva M.1 aFeld, Birte K.1 aNie, Lihua1 aTolzin-Banasch, Karla1 aM’Rabet, Salima Machkour1 aPasteels, Jacques1 aBoland, Wilhelm0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2007 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.5-24dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-006-9201-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245016500169520208700334592002802421650001602449650001702465650001902482650002302501650002202524650002002546650002702566650001602593650001502609650000902624650001002633650001602643650002302659650001702682650002502699650001702724650001002741653003002751653003302781653002902814653002502843700002702868700002402895773011602919856008403035852000903119655001203128IND60755111120221118233110.0211206e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075511112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1072162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Pascual10aTowards a sustainable viticulture: The combination of deficit irrigation strategies and agroecological practices in Mediterranean vineyards. A review and update  aIn this study we review the state of the art of different physiologically-based water-saving irrigation strategies and methods used to improve productive water use efficiency (WUEyᵢₑₗd) and berry and wine quality in vineyards. We also show how these irrigation practices, combined with more sustainable soil management and other agroecological practices, can help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on wine grapes cultivation and make irrigated Mediterranean vineyards more resilient and sustainable. We analyse the deficit irrigation (DI) strategies used most often for different varieties and edaphoclimatic conditions. We review the latest advances in the application of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and partial root zone drying irrigation (PRI) strategies in grapevines (red and white grapes), as well as other irrigation methods used less frequently in vineyards to improve WUEyᵢₑₗd, berry quality and irrigation efficiency, such as subsurface drip irrigation. We also analyze recent findings concerning the physiological response of the vine to water stress with more holistic approaches such as, hydraulic safety marging and stress distance, and discuss how to translate these physiological approaches into the practical application of RDI management in field conditions, according to the genotypic characteristics and degree of drought tolerance of the variety/rootstock combination. We review optimum vine water status ranges and the thresholds proposed for better deficit irrigation scheduling in vineyards. In addition, we consider sustainable soil management practices - such as cover crops, mulching, composting, reduced tillage, mutualistic plant-microorganisms interactions, and agroforestry - and their potential as beneficial agroecological practices to improve WUE, soil/vine performance, and other ecological services in RDI vineyards within a more sustainable farming system (organic farming). The idea is to design sustainable and climate-change-resilient agricultural systems (e.g. vineyards) in Mediterranean semi-arid areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3aagroforestry 3aclimate change 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought tolerance 3amicroirrigation 3aphysiological response 3arhizosphere 3arootstocks 3asoil 3avines 3aviticulture 3awater conservation 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awine quality 3awines 0aClimate change adaptation 0aRegulated deficit irrigation 0aPartial root zone drying 0aSustainable soil use1 aNavarro, Josefa María1 aOrdaz, Pablo Botía0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 259 p.107216-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1072163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010400170300001400274520153000288592002801818650001701846650004401863650002201907650002801929650001501957650002401972650001101996650002102007650001502028650003702043650001302080650001002093650001202103650001902115650001902134650003102153650002502184650003302209650001402242650002402256650003702280650003702317650001502354653002302369653001502392653003102407653001702438653002202455653002202477653002902499700001702528700002002545773010902565856008302674852000902757655001202766IND60570735620221120090123.0180831e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057073562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinghal, Chaitali12aA genosensor for detection of consensus DNA sequence of Dengue virus using ZnO/Pt-Pd nanocomposites  ap. 75-82.  aAn electrochemical genosensor based on Zinc oxide/platinum-palladium (ZnO/Pt-Pd) modified fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plate was fabricated for detection of consensus DNA sequence of Dengue virus (DENV) using methylene blue (MB) as an intercalating agent. To achieve it, probe DNA (PDNA) was immobilized on the surface of ZnO/Pt-Pd nanocomposites modified FTO electrode. The synthesized nano-composites were characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV–Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy. This PDNA modified electrode (PDNA/ZnO/Pt-Pd/FTO) served as a signal amplification platform for the detection of the target hybridized DNA (TDNA). The hybridization between PDNA and TDNA was detected by reduction in current, generated by interaction of anionic mediator, i.e., methylene blue (MB) with free guanine (3′G) of ssDNA. The sensor showed a dynamic linear range of 1 × 10⁻⁶M to 100 × 10⁻⁶M with LOD as 4.3 × 10⁻⁵ M and LOQ as 9.5 × 10⁻⁵ M. Till date, majorly serotype specific biosensors for dengue detection have been developed. The genosensor reported here eliminates the possibility of false result as in case of serotype specific DNA sensor. This is the report where conserved sequences present in all the serotypes of Dengue virus has been employed for fabrication of a genosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDengue virus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiosensors 3aconserved sequences 3adengue 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afluorine 3aglass 3aguanine 3amethylene blue 3ananocomposites 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aserotypes 3asingle-stranded DNA 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc oxide 0aConserved sequence 0aGenosensor 0aElectrochemical DNA sensor 0aDengue virus 0aPt-Pd nanoflowers 0aZnO nanoparticles 0aZnO/Pt-Pd nanocomposites1 aPundir, C.S.1 aNarang, Jagriti0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 97 p.75-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245010700183300001800290520217500308592002802483650001802511650001602529650001602545650001702561650001102578650001102589650004402600650002002644650002302664650001502687650001802702650001302720651001002733700002302743700001902766773011802785856008102903852000902984655001202993IND60574706420221120071411.0170728e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057470642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-017-1663-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Murillo, Juan Carlos10aHumic acid composition and humification processes in wetland soils of a Mediterranean semiarid wetland  ap. 2104-2115.  aPURPOSE: The present study focuses on a compositional characterization of the humic acid (HA) fraction of several wetland soils using solid-state ¹³C NMR spectroscopy. The data were analysed using the molecular mixing model (MMM), based on an empirical approach by Nelson and Baldock. The compositional data from HAs obtained with this model were used to obtain a wider assessment of the process of humification from comparison of total soil wetland organic matter composition and HA composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty samples of humic acids (HAs) isolated from a Mediterranean semiarid wetland (‘Tablas de Daimiel’, central Spain) were studied using elemental analysis and cross polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS)¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR data were analysed with the molecular mixing model (MMM) considering up to six generic components (carbohydrate, protein, lignin, lipid, char and ‘carbonyl’). HAs are considered a conceptual mixture of these model components, and the MMM determines the proportions of the characteristic biomolecules contributing to HA composition. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The composition of the HAs under study depends on local factors such as site vegetation and occurrence of fire. Correlations between the proportions of the six generic components and further comparison with those determined for the unfractionated OM (whole sample, WS), gave information on HA origin and humification mechanisms. In particular, the proportions of char and carbohydrate (R ² 0.637) and contents of lignin and protein (R ² 0.471) in the HAs were negatively correlated (P < 0.05). Significant correlations (R ² 0.439) also existed for char contents in whole sample (WS) compared to HA, and for carbohydrates in WS compared to HA (R ² 0.558). Char proportion grew in HA with respect to the WS, and carbohydrates dropped to a half on average in HA compared to WS. CONCLUSIONS: Two different humification mechanisms could be identified for no-fire and fire areas. In the former, HA-char was preserved selectively from char in the sample, whereas in the latter, char was newly formed by fire effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3acorrelation 3ahumic acids 3ahumification 3alignin 3alipids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3astatistical models 3avegetation 3awetland soils 3awetlands 3aSpain1 aAlmendros, Gonzalo1 aKnicker, Heike0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2017 Aug., v. 17, no. 8 p.2104-2115dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-017-1663-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013500168520108100303592002801384650001101412650002201423650001601445650001101461650002701472650001701499650001901516650002101535650001201556650003901568650001501607650002401622653002401646653001101670653001401681653002201695653001401717653001501731653002501746700001701771700001601788700001601804700001601820700005401836700005701890773010001947856008702047852000902134655001202143IND60666139020221121205323.0200320e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066613902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1255012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaobin10aComparison of citrus pectin and apple pectin in conjugation with soy protein isolate (SPI) under controlled dry-heating conditions  aIn this study, we selected two most commonly-available commercial pectin, i.e. citrus pectin and apple pectin as the grafting polysaccharides to prepare soy protein isolate-pectin conjugates. Despite the similar degrees of methoxylation and acetylation for two pectin samples, apple pectin showed much more complex structures compared to citrus pectin, with a 2.20-fold higher molecular weight and large numbers of side chains. The conjugates were prepared under controlled dry-heating conditions and achieved the degree of graft of 25.00% and 21.85% for citrus and apple pectin, respectively. Formation of the conjugates was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and IR spectra. Attributed to the strong steric-hindrance effect of pectin, the fluorescence intensity and surface hydrophobicity of the soy protein isolate were significantly decreased after Maillard reaction. However, both solubility and emulsifying properties of the conjugates were significantly improved. Results indicated that both pectin samples played favorable roles in protein modification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aMaillard reaction 3aacetylation 3aapples 3aemulsifying properties 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3apectins 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asolubility 3asoy protein isolate 0aSoy protein isolate 0aPectin 0aConjugate 0aMaillard reaction 0aStructure 0aSolubility 0aEmulsifying property1 aChen, Weijun1 aYan, Tianyi1 aWang, Danli1 aHou, Furong1 aMiao, Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8385-35131 aLiu, Donghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-76780 tFood chemistry.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 309 p.125501-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1255013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011000163300001400273520197800287592002802265653003202293653003102325653002202356653002202378653001702400700002702417773012102444856007702565852000902642655001202651IND60480500020221121032353.0160128e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048050002DNAL7 a10.1515/bog-2015-00362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombard, Andrea14aThe spatial distribution of renewable energy infrastructure in three particular provinces of South Africa  ap. 71-86.  aRenewed interest is being shown in South Africa in the promotion of infrastructure for renewable energy (RE) to supplement the country’s current energy- generation capacity and to break loose from its dependency on an unsustainable fossil-fuel-based energy-provision system. The latter system not only has unfavourable consequences for the environment, but is managed by a state-owned institution which since 2008 has been incapable of providing reliable electricity. RE infrastructure - especially for the generation of solar and wind energy - is a relatively new feature in the South African landscape. This paper examines the spatial distribution of the newly commissioned infrastructures for wind and solar energy (operational and under construction) and the role they can play in the diversification of the rural economies of parts of the country’s Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. First, literature on evolutionary economic geography, path dependence and new path creation is reviewed. Second, the role of a single energy provider - embedded in a monopolistic energy policy -in inhibiting the transition from a mainly fossil-fuel-based energy-provision system to a multi-source (multi-owner) provision system is discussed. Third, the reasoning behind the siting of the infrastructures for solar and wind energy in three particular provinces is explained. Fourth, the possible roles these new infrastructures can play in the diversification of the rural economies where they occur are advanced. The paper concludes that solar- and wind-energy projects have the ability to transform the South African energy context and that these projects present some positive socio-economic impacts for rural economies in the three particular provinces. The paper also recommends that future research efforts should be aimed at the evolution of this socio-economic transformation by taking into account the pre-development context of the areas under study.  aPublisher supplied data 0asolar-energy infrastructure 0awind-energy infrastructure 0aspatial diffusion 0arural development 0aSouth Africa1 aFerreira, Sanette L.A.0 tBulletin of Geography.

Methods: Cohort including all patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a single, large university hospital in Northeast France from 25 February to 30 April 2020. Results: 479 patients were admitted with COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 128 died (26.7%). Among the 351 survivors, 111 were referred to rehabilitation units, including 63 (17.9%) referred to physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) units. The median age of patients referred to rehabilitation units was 72 years. Patients who had been in intensive care, or who had had a long hospital stay, required referral to PRM units. Two biomarkers were associated with referral to rehabilitation units, namely, elevated troponin (p = 0.03) and impaired renal function (p = 0.03). Age was associated with referral to PRM units (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Almost one-third of COVID-19 patients required post-acute care, but only one-fifth had access to PRM units. The optimal strategy for post-acute management of COVID-19 patients remains to be determined. The need for rehabilitation wards during a pandemic is a primary concern in enabling the long-term functioning of infected patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3abiomarkers 3acohort studies 3ahospitals 3amedicine 3apandemic 3arenal function 3aFrance1 aNoujaim, Peter-Joe 1 aTaiar, Redha 1 aCarazo-Mendez, Sandy 1 aDeslee, Gaetan 1 aJolly, Damien 1 aBoyer, François Constant0 tBiology.g2022 June 20, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110609373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005000140245015200190300001400342520037200356592002800728650002300756650002000779650001100799650001300810700001300823700001500836700001600851700002000867700001400887700001300901773012900914856007401043852000901117655001201126IND60626230720221120062724.0181220e20181218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062623072DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc08590k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKongThese authors contributed equally., Weifu10aAmorphous-to-crystalline transformation toward controllable synthesis of fibrous covalent organic frameworks enabling promotion of proton transport  ap. 75-78.  aReversible imine exchange is adopted to molecularly re-arrange polyazomethine-based amorphous fibers into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) retaining pristine fibrous characters with periodic and oriented micropore channels.

Thus, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity satellite technology is applied to estimate large-scale groundwater drought condition, which can provide a new data source for drought investigation. However, the dynamic variations of GRACE-based groundwater drought were still unclear across China. In this study, the evolutions of groundwater drought were investigated from a high-resolution GRACE mass concentration (mascon) model perspective. The spatio-temporal variations and gridded trend characteristics of groundwater drought were comprehensively identified across China during 2003–2018. Subsequently, the relationships between groundwater and meteorological drought were quantitatively revealed. The results indicated that: (1) the verification results of GRACE were credible and reliable for groundwater drought evaluation; (2) the most serious groundwater drought occurred in April 2011, with an average groundwater drought index (GDI) value of –0.86; (3) the gridded drought trend characteristic showed that groundwater drought presented an upward trend during 2003–2018; and (4) the propagation dynamics from meteorological to groundwater drought were shorter in summer (5–6 months), and longer in winter (14–15 months) across China. This study sheds new viewpoints into groundwater drought variations from a perspective of high-resolution GRACE mascon model, which can also be applied in other areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adrought 3agravity 3agroundwater 3amodels 3asatellites 3asummer 3awater management 3awinter 3aChina 0aGroundwater drought 0aMeteorological drought 0aGRACE mascon model 0aPropagation dynamics1 aLai, Hexin1 aLi, Yanbin1 aFeng, Kai1 aZhang, Zezhong1 aTian, Qingqing1 aZhu, Xiaomeng1 aYang, Haibo0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 260 p.107251-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1072513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01524naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006900140245015000209300001600359520038200375592002800757650002300785650002300808650000900831650002100840650001700861700001800878700001500896700001900911700002000930700002200950773013100972856007401103852000901177655001201186IND60626230820221120052632.0181220e20181218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062623082DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc08662a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahooThese authors contributed equally to this work., Dhananjaya10aSynthesis of highly-soluble push–pull perylenemonoimide derivatives by regioselective peri-functionalization for switchable memory applications  ap. 103-106.  aA regioselective synthetic protocol is developed via tetrabromination of perylenemonoimide (PMI) which leads to a series of PMI derivatives.

The procedure focuses on the assessment of the mechanical behavior of a bone stabilized with a dynamic compression plate (DCP) in a neutralization function, associated to a lag screw, fastened with surgical screws. The non-linear behavior of cortical bone tissue was revealed through four-point bending tests, from which damage initiation and propagation occurred. Since screw loosening was visible during the loading process, damage parameters were measured experimentally in independent pull-out tests. A realistic numerical model of the DCP-femur setup was constructed, combining the evaluated damage parameters and contact pairs. A mixed-mode (I+II) trapezoidal damage law was employed to mimic the mechanical behavior of both the screw–bone interface and bone fractures. The numerical model replicated the global behavior observed experimentally, which was visible by the initial stiffness and the ability to preview the first loading peak, and bone crack satisfactorily.  aPublisher supplied data 3abones 3afracture fixation 3amathematical models 3amechanical properties 3aneutralization1 aFertuzinhos, Aureliano 1 aCampos, Teresa D.1 aDias, Isabel R.1 aViegas, Carlos A.1 aPereira, Fábio A.

It reduces the effective spatial interaction between different locations. To mitigate traffic congestion, not only the actual status of different routes needs to be known but also it is imperative to determine network congestion in different spatial zones associated with distinct land use classes. In the present paper, a new formula is proposed to quantify traffic congestion in the different spatial zones of a study area characterized by distinct land use classes. The proposed formula is termed the Traffic Congestability Value (TCV). The formula considers three major influencing factors: congestion index value, pedestrian movement and road surface conditions; since these parameters are significantly related to land use in a region. The different traffic congestion parameters, i.e. travel time, average speed and the proportion of time stopped, were collected in real time. Lower values of TCV correspond to a higher degree of congestion in the respective spatial zones and vice-versa and the results were validated in the field. TCV differs from the previous approaches to quantifying traffic congestion since it focuses on the causes of network congestion while in previous works the focus was generally on link flow congestion.  aPublisher supplied data 0acongestion 0aTraffic Congestability Value 0aCongestion Index Value 0aspatial zones1 aMukherjee, Alok Bhushan0 tBulletin of Geography.

NTMRs are expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in fish biomass by allowing a buildup of biomass inside their borders while fishing pressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may lead to biased estimates of biomass. Simulation modeling is used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment configurations to estimate current biomass after the implementation of a single, large NTMR. Age-structured spatial operating models with three patterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the “true” population dynamics. Results show that assessing populations as a single stock with use of fishery catch-rate data and without accounting for the NTMR results in severe underestimation of biomass for two of the movement patterns. Omitting fishery catch-rate data or allowing time-varying dome-shaped selectivity after NTMR implementation leads to improved estimates of current biomass, but severe bias in estimated trends in biomass over time. Performing separate assessments for fished areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence of movement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment with estimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movement patterns were unknown. However, future work should explore the performance of spatial assessments when catchability varies among areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3afish 3afisheries 3aontogeny 3apopulation dynamics 3asimulation models1 aPunt, A.

The present study was carried out with an aim to compare and evaluate growth and biochemical characteristics in three genotypes of maize, GSF-2 and two quality protein maize (QPM) inbred lines, CM-137 and CM-138. Germination rate, root and shoot length regarded as growth parameters have shown to be significantly higher in CM-137 and CM-138 genotypes than the GSF-2. Protein and RNA contents were found higher in the leaves of GSF-2 than the quality protein maize genotypes, indicating high metabolic activity of the former. Total protein content and amino acid lysine and tryptophan contents in the seed flour of CM-137 and CM-138 were higher than GSF-2 genotype. Higher proline content was noted in QPM varieties than the GSF-2; however, the total phenolic content was higher and same for CM-137 and GSF-2. Quality protein maize varieties indicated more resistance towards drought and heavy metals, which could be correlated with higher proline levels in seed. Salinity had no significant effect on all the three genotypes.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the individual and combined effects of calcium (Ca) and B on morphological and physiological attributes of radish (Raphanus sativus L.) under normal and boron-toxicity conditions. The application of 30 mM Ca and 0.5 mM B, alone and in combination, enhanced plant growth, physiological and biochemical attributes. However, 5 mM B was detrimental to most growth and physiological parameters. The application of 30 mM Ca was most effective in alleviating the harmful effects of B toxicity by decreasing malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide levels and electrolyte leakage and by enhancing the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and ascorbate peroxidase.

Tropical grasses require substantial nitrogen inputs to maintain water productivity and forage quality. Perennial legumes offer a potential nitrogen source for these perennial grasses when sown in a mixed sward. Lucerne (Medicago sativa) is the perennial legume most widely sown in grazing systems in south-eastern Australia. In this study, conducted over the period 2014–2018, we compared the soil water dynamics and rainwater productivity of pure stands of digit grass (fertilized with applied nitrogen), lucerne, desmanthus (Desmanthus virgatus) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala) and binary mixtures of digit grass (not fertilized with applied nitrogen) with each legume. We found that often growing season actual evapotranspiration (ETₐ) was similar among the treatments (P > 0.05), but rainwater productivity (kg DM/ha.mm) and proportion (%) of legume herbage mass were not (P < 0.05). Our results showed that the lucerne-digit grass mix was equally productive and efficient as fertilized digit grass (P > 0.05), particularly in the latter three seasons. However, lucerne dominated the herbage mass (c. > 67% legume). Leucaena production was delayed by frost and severely impacted by competition with digit grass, and generally underperformed both lucerne and desmanthus. This observation did always not hold when alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) impacted desmanthus in specific seasons. Our experiment has shown that a mixed sward of lucerne-digit grass is highly productive and offered high rainwater productivity. Both desmanthus and leucaena, in mixes with digit grass, provided useful contributions of legume herbage mass, in specific seasons and under specific conditions, but both underperformed overall compared with lucerne.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfalfa mosaic virus 3aDesmanthus virgatus 3aDigitaria eriantha 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aevapotranspiration 3aforage quality 3afrost 3alivestock 3anitrogen 3apastures 3arain 3asoil water 3asummer 3asward 3awater management 3aAustralia 0aRoot depth 0aWater balance 0aWater use efficiency1 aBoschma, Suzanne P.1 aHarden, Steven0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 259 p.107266-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1072663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02995naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006400153245011700217300001300334520184300347592002802190653001502218653001302233653001802246653002502264653001302289653002002302700002002322700001602342700001502358700002102373700003402394773012102428856008702549852000902636655001202645IND60596324520221120135732.0180618e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059632452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Jacob T.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4329-420010aReconciling marine and terrestrial evidence for post LGM ice sheet retreat in southern McMurdo Sound, Antarctica  ap. 1-13.  aRetreat of the Antarctic ice sheets since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) contributed to sea-level rise, but the location, amount, and timing of ice mass loss has been controversial. This paper presents new ¹⁰Be exposure ages from glacially transported erratics which record post LGM retreat of grounded ice in the western Ross Sea. Ice elevation in southern McMurdo Sound was ≥520 m above present day sea level on the eastern side of Mount Discovery during the LGM, and the onset of major deglaciation in the region was after 14 ka. The ice surface lowered from ∼520 to 234 m above present day sea level between 14.0 ka and 10.3 ka and from 234 m to ∼30 m between 10.3 ka and 7.4 ka. This late-glacial and Holocene deglaciation chronology from southern McMurdo Sound is consistent with other records on the margins of the Ross Embayment, and implies that the western margins of the Ross Sea Ice Sheet (RSIS) experienced most mass loss during the early to middle Holocene. These ¹⁰Be exposure ages coupled with sediment provenance define a two-stage ice flow scenario for McMurdo Sound subdividing differing reconstructions into an early and late phase. Prior to Termination I, an expanded Koettlitz Glacier flowed north and northeast between Brown Peninsula and Mount Discovery and coalesced with northward flowing ice fed from the Skelton and Mulock Glaciers. Thinning and retreat of the Koettlitz Glacier and perhaps other outlet glaciers flowing through the Royal Society Range allowed ice grounded in the Ross Sea to flow westward and northward, north of Brown Peninsula. Grounding-line recession in the Ross Sea during the late-glacial and Holocene was likely driven by Southern Ocean warming and sea-level rise from the retreat of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and the outer margins of the Antarctic ice sheets.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAntarctica 0aRoss sea 0aMcMurdo Sound 0aLast Glacial Maximum 0aHolocene 0aExposure dating1 aWilson, Gary S.1 aFink, David1 aLilly, Kat1 aLevy, Richard H.1 aTownsend, D.

Cells of the probiotic strains were enumerated over 48 h of cultivation in broths containing each honey (JJ, JU, JBJ or JBU) as a sole carbon source. The metabolic activities of probiotic strains in these media were assessed by measuring changes in pH values and sugars, organic acids and phenolics contents. All honeys (20 or 30 g/L) exerted growth promoting effects and displayed positive prebiotic activity scores (0.94–1.22) on tested probiotics. JJ showed the highest (p < 0.05) stimulatory effects on probiotics growth and prebiotic scores. At the end of the cultivation period, counts of L. acidophilus LA-05 and B. lactis BB-12 increased (p < 0.05) more than 2 log in broths regardless the monofloral honey added. The pH values and sugars contents decreased (p < 0.05), while the organic acids contents increased (p < 0.05) during cultivation of probiotics in broths containing JJ, JU, JBJ or JBU as carbon source. After 48 h of cultivation, contents of gallic, caftaric and caffeic acid, catechin and procyanidins (B1 and B2) decreased (p < 0.05) in media containing JJ, JU, JBJ or JBU despite of the inoculated probiotic. JJ honey presented overall the better stimulatory effects on the growth and metabolism of L. acidophilus LA-05 and B. lactis BB-12. These results showed for the first time the potential prebiotic properties of four monofloral honeys produced by stingless bees in the Brazilian Northeastern semi-arid region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aMelipona scutellaris 3aMimosa 3aZiziphus joazeiro 3abiochemical pathways 3abroths 3acaffeic acid 3acarbon 3acatechin 3ahoney 3ametabolism 3apH 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aprocyanidins 3asemiarid zones 3astingless bees 3asugars 0aNative bees 0aPrebiotic score 0aPhenolics1 aMenezes, Francisca Nayara Dantas Duarte1 ade Sousa, Janaína Maria Batista1 ados Santos Lima, Marcos1 ada Silva Campelo Borges, Graciele1 ade Souza, Evandro Leite1 aMagnani, Marciane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3412-33270 tFood research international.g2020 Feb., v. 128 p.108809-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.1088093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245018800186300001600374520139000390592002801780650002401808650000901832650001501841650001501856650001001871650002201881650001201903650001001915650001201925650001001937650001201947650001801959650001701977650001201994650002402006650001702030650001002047700002402057700002302081700002202104700002102126700002402147700002102171700002202192773010702214856008102321852000902402655001202411IND50073751120221119214043.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007375112DNAL7 a240267692pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9862-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurashita, Koji10aHomologue gene of bile acid transporters ntcp, asbt, and ost-alpha in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss: tissue expression, effect of fasting, and response to bile acid administration  ap. 511-525.  aBile acid transporters belonging to the SLC10A protein family, Na+ taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP or SLC10A1), apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT or SLC10A2), and organic solute transporter alpha (Ost-alpha) have been known to play critical roles in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids in mammals. In this study, ntcp, asbt, and ost-alpha-1/-2 cDNA were cloned, their tissue distributions were characterized, and the effects of fasting and bile acid administration on their expression were examined in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The structural characteristics of Ntcp, Asbt, and Ost-alpha were well conserved in trout, and three-dimensional structure analysis showed that Ntcp and Asbt were similar to each other. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that trout asbt was primarily expressed in the hindgut, while ntcp expression occurred in the brain, and ost-alpha-1/-2 was mainly expressed in the liver or ovary. Although asbt and ost-alpha-1 mRNA levels in the gut increased in response to fasting for 4 days, ost-alpha-1 expression in the liver decreased. Similarly, bile acid administration increased asbt and ost-alpha-1 expression levels in the gut, while those of ntcp and ost-alpha-2 in the liver decreased. These results suggested that the genes asbt, ntcp, and ost-alpha are involved in bile acid transport in rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abile 3abile acids 3abile salts 3abrain 3acomplementary DNA 3afasting 3agenes 3ahindgut 3aliver 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3apolypeptides 3asolutes 3atissue distribution 3atransporters 3atrout1 aYoshiura, Yasutoshi1 aChisada, Shin-ichi1 aFuruita, Hirofumi1 aSugita, Tsuyoshi1 aMatsunari, Hiroyuki1 aIwashita, Yasuro1 aYamamoto, Takeshi0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.511-525dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-013-9862-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245011700169500001900286520197400305592002802279650001402307650001902321650001602340650001502356650001602371650001202387650001402399650001402413650001102427650001502438650001602453650000902469650002002478650001802498653000802516653001602524653001502540700001602555700001602571700001802587700001302605700001502618700001402633700001802647700001802665700005902683773011902742856008802861852000902949655001202958IND60708756720221122102232.0210624e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070875672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1420702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongxia14aThe degradation and metabolism of chlorfluazuron and flonicamid in tea: A risk assessment from tea garden to cup  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDegradation and metabolism of chlorfluazuron and flonicamid from tea garden to cup were simultaneously investigated by a modified QuEChERS method coupled with UPLC-MS/MS quantification. The dissipation half-lives of chlorfluazuron, flonicamid, and total flonicamid (the sum of flonicamid and its metabolites TFNG, TFNA, and TFNA-AM) in fresh tea leaves during tea growth were 6.0 d, 4.8 d, and 8.1 d, respectively. TFNG and TFNA were generated during tea growth. After tea processing, the residues of chlorfluazuron, flonicamid, and its metabolites in black tea were higher than those in green tea. The average processing factors of chlorfluazuron, flonicamid, and total flonicamid in black tea were 2.54, 3.02, and 2.87, respectively, while in green tea they were 2.40, 2.93, and 2.79, respectively. TFNG, TFNA, and TFNA-AM were formed rapidly during the drying step. Considering the influence of water content at various processing steps, the average loss rates of chlorfluazuron, flonicamid, and total flonicamid residue from fresh tea leaves to black tea were 16.7%, 33.8%, and 20.7%, respectively, and 29.6%, 14.0% and 18.2%, respectively, in the case of green tea. The highest leaching rates of chlorfluazuron, flonicamid, and total flonicamid during tea brewing were 6.8%, 97.0%, and 97.4%, respectively, in black tea infusion, and 6.0%, 98.9%, and 98.6%, respectively, in green tea infusion. The metabolites, especially TFNG, had a higher leaching rate during tea brewing. The migration of chlorfluazuron from fresh leaves to tea infusion was low, and the migration of flonicamid was high. The RQc and RQa of chlorfluazuron and total flonicamid were less than 1. This result indicates that the potential dietary intake risk of chlorfluazuron from tea is negligible. However, the risk of total flonicamid intake is three times higher than that of chlorfluazuron. There is a potential risk of intake of flonicamid and its metabolites in tea for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablack tea 3achlorfluazuron 3aenvironment 3aflonicamid 3afood intake 3agardens 3agreen tea 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3awater content 0aTea 0aDegradation 0aMetabolite1 aZhong, Qing1 aWang, Xinru1 aLuo, Fengjian1 aZhou, Li1 aSun, Hezhi1 aYang, Mei1 aLou, Zhengyun1 aChen, Zongmao1 aZhang, Xinzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7369-57610 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 754 p.142070-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1420703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008700170300001600257520150800273592002801781650002601809650001201835650001001847650001201857650001501869650001301884650001901897650002301916650001501939650001801954650001901972650002201991650001402013650001702027651001002044653001802054653001202072653002002084653001402104653001802118653001002136653001002146700002102156700002002177773009202197856008102289852000902370655001202379IND60480500720221121025613.0160128e20121031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048050072DNAL7 a10.2478/v10184-011-0064-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilibeck, Goffredo10aFloristic analysis of a high-speed railway embankment in a Mediterranean landscape  ap. 229-248.  a- We analyzed the floristic composition of a 4.5 km-long segment of a high- -speed railway in Lazio, central Italy, which travels on an artificial embankment through an intensively-farmed landscape. In total, 287 vascular plant species were recorded. The life-form distribution was found to be similar to that of the regional species pool, with high percentages of therophytes (38%) and phanerophytes (13%). In the chorological spectrum the Mediterranean floristic element prevailed (44%), while alien species were 8% of the flora. The phytosociological spectrum showed a high diversity of characteristic species from the class Stellarietea mediae or its subordinate syntaxa (26%), and in particular from the order Thero-Brometalia (Mediterranean, sub-nitrophilous annual communities). Species from forest syntaxa had a relatively high diversity (9%). These results suggest that the ecological filtering provided by the Mediterranean regional climate controlled species assemblage even in a completely artificial habitat, preventing floristic homogenization: the flora of the studied railway section is only partially »ruderalized«, while it keeps strong links with the regional (semi-) natural plant communities. However, in contrast to what is observed in central and north Europe, the railway sides studied in the present paper do not seem to represent a refugial habitat for rare species from grassland communities, mainly because in Italy semi-natural dry grasslands are still widely represented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotanical composition 3aclimate 3aflora 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahomogenization 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3aphanerophytes 3aphytosociology 3aplant communities 3arailroads 3arare species 3aItaly 0aanthropogenic 0ahabitat 0aartificial soil 0alife-form 0arailway flora 0aLazio 0aItaly1 aCornelini, Paolo1 aPetrella, Paolo0 tActa botanica Croatica.g2012 Oct. 31, v. 71, no. 2 p.229-248dVersitax0365-05887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10184-011-0064-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245014700167520135500314592002801669650001501697650001001712650001301722650001201735650001601747650001201763650002301775650001101798650001701809650001401826650003101840650002001871650001201891650002001903700002101923773012101944856008002065852000902145655001202154IND60780861220221118214825.0220623e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078086122DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110609432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalizzi, Giacoma 10aInsulin and Its Key Role for Mitochondrial Function/Dysfunction and Quality Control: A Shared Link between Dysmetabolism and Neurodegeneration  aInsulin was discovered and isolated from the beta cells of pancreatic islets of dogs and is associated with the regulation of peripheral glucose homeostasis. Insulin produced in the brain is related to synaptic plasticity and memory. Defective insulin signaling plays a role in brain dysfunction, such as neurodegenerative disease. Growing evidence suggests a link between metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This association is due to a common state of insulin resistance (IR) and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review takes a journey into the past to summarize what was known about the physiological and pathological role of insulin in peripheral tissues and the brain. Then, it will land in the present to analyze the insulin role on mitochondrial health and the effects on insulin resistance and neurodegenerative diseases that are IR-dependent. Specifically, we will focus our attention on the quality control of mitochondria (MQC), such as mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis, and selective autophagy (mitophagy), in healthy and altered cases. Finally, this review will be projected toward the future by examining the most promising treatments that target the mitochondria to cure neurodegenerative diseases associated with metabolic disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3abrain 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3amemory 3amitochondria 3amitophagy 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroplasticity 3aobesity 3aquality control1 aDi Carlo, Marta 0 tBiology.g2022 June 20, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110609433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245017200189300001600361520172200377592002802099650001602127650002202143650001802165650001302183650002002196650000902216650001102225650001602236700002402252773010702276856008102383852000902464655001202473IND50073751220221119213906.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007375122DNAL7 a240458642pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9863-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIversen, Martin H.14aThe effect of allostatic load on hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal (HPI) axis before and after secondary vaccination in Atlantic salmon postsmolts (Salmo salar L.)  ap. 527-538.  aThe experiment consisted of three experimental groups: (1) “vaccine and stress”, (2) “stress and vaccine” and (3) control. All groups have previously been vaccinated 6 months prior to the start of the experiment. At the start of the experiment, the “vaccine and stress” group was vaccinated with Pentium Forte Plus for the second time (25.02.2008) and then given a daily stressor (confinement stressor 267 kg m-3 in 15 min) for a period of 4 weeks. The “stress and vaccine” group was given a similar daily stressor for 4 weeks and then vaccinated for the second time. The control group was neither stressed nor vaccinated a second time. The results indicates that fish in the “stress and vaccine” group may have entered an allostatic overload type 2 due to oversensitivity to ACTH, a reduced efficient negative feedback system with elevated baseline levels of plasma cortisol and reduced immune response with pronounced effects on the well-being of the animal. The “vaccine and stress” group may likewise have entered an allostatic overload type 1 response, with oversensitivity to ACTH and transient reduced efficient negative feedback system. This study shows that if plasma cortisol becomes elevated prior to vaccination, it could perhaps instigate an allostatic overload type 2 with dire consequences on animal welfare. To reduce the risk of compromising the animal welfare during commercial vaccination of salmon, one propose to grade the fish minimum a week prior to vaccination or grade simultaneously with vaccination. This could reduce the overall allostatic load during handling and vaccination and secure a healthy fish with intact immune response and improved animal welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aanimal well-being 3acorticotropin 3acortisol 3aimmune response 3arisk 3asalmon 3avaccination1 aEliassen, Robert A.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.527-538dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-013-9863-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015000167300002000317520128400337592002801621650001901649650001701668650001701685650001501702650001701717650001601734650002301750650001101773650001601784650002301800650001201823650001201835650002701847650001501874650001501889650002301904650001801927650001601945651001001961700002201971700001701993700001902010700002902029700001802058700002002076700001702096700001802113773014902131856008102280852000902361655001202370IND60574707320221122121629.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057470732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9287-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFosu, Paul Osei10aSurveillance of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables from Accra Metropolis markets, Ghana, 2010–2012: a case study in Sub-Saharan Africa  ap. 17187-17205.  aMonitoring of pesticide residues in food commodities of plant origin is part of the regular controls on food to safeguard consumer’s health. This study reports for the first time in Ghana a 3-year (2010–2012) monitoring of pesticide contamination of fruits and vegetables and their health implications. A total of 3483 samples were purchased in notable markets within Accra Metropolis and analysed for pesticide residues, employing the modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe analytical procedure. The results indicated that almost all the fruits and vegetables studied had residues above maximum residue limits (MRLs). The commodities with the greatest concentrations exceeding the European Union (EU) MRLs were long green beans (60.6%) and lettuce (57.1%) with watermelon (10%) and green pepper (8.6%) having the least. The relative occurrence of the pesticides was fenvalerate 11.3%, fenitrothion 5.6%, lambda-cyhalothrin 3.6%, dimethoate 3.2%, permethrin 2.7% and deltamethrin 2.2%. These results will serve as a baseline on which annual or other long-term studies could be compared with, thus emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring programmes to regulate trends of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables to safeguard the consumers’ health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3adeltamethrin 3adimethoate 3afenitrothion 3afenvalerate 3afood contamination 3afruits 3agreen beans 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3alettuce 3amarkets 3amaximum residue limits 3amonitoring 3apermethrin 3apesticide residues 3asweet peppers 3awatermelons 3aGhana1 aDonkor, Augustine1 aZiwu, Cephas1 aDubey, Brajesh1 aKingsford-Adaboh, Robert1 aAsante, Isaac1 aNyarko, Stephen1 aTawiah, Rose1 aNazzah, Noble0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 July, v. 24, no. 20 p.17187-17205dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9287-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009800168520123700266592002801503650001701531650001401548650001901562650001501581650002501596650002501621650001401646700002401660700002201684700002501706773012001731856008001851852000901931655001201940IND60780861320221118214141.0220623e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078086132DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110608132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilazieva, Zarema 14aThe Dual Role of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Their Extracellular Vesicles in Carcinogenesis  aMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and play an important role in tumor progression. MSCs remodel the extracellular matrix, participate in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, promote the spread of metastases, and inhibit antitumor immune responses in the TME; however, there are also data pertaining to the antitumor effects of MSCs. MSCs activate the cell death mechanism by modulating the expression of proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, angiogenesis receptors, and proapoptotic proteins. One of the main ways in which MSCs and TME interact is through the production of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by cells. Currently, data on the effects of both MSCs and their EVs on tumor cells are rather contradictory. Various studies have reported that EVs from MSCs can have either antitumor or pro-tumor effects, depending on both the tumor type and developmental stage. In this review, we discuss published data on EV MSCs and their effect on tumor cells. The molecular composition of vesicles obtained from MSCs is also presented in the review. In addition, the use of EV MSCs for the development of new methods for treating oncological diseases is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aapoptosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3aextracellular matrix 3aneoplasm progression 3aneoplasms1 aPonomarev, Aleksei 1 aRizvanov, Albert 1 aSolovyeva, Valeriya 0 tBiology.g2022 May 25, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110608133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245009800175300001500273520142300288592002801711650002101739650002501760650002001785650001101805650001201816650001101828650001001839650001901849650001201868650001901880650001101899650001401910650001401924650002401938650001801962650000901980650001801989653002002007653001302027653001102040653001902051653001802070700002002088700002202108700002202130700002002152700002302172773009402195856008702289852000902376655001202385IND60526594020221122211929.0190408e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052659402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontibus, Mathilde10aAssessment of Penicillium expansum and Escherichia coli transfer from poplar crates to apples  ap. 95-102.  aPoplar crates are widely used in contact with foodstuffs. One of the major markets for poplar crates is apple packaging. As a direct food contact material, wood is subject to European regulation n° 1935/2004, which requires no negative effect of material or packaging on foodstuffs. This study aims to quantify the transfer of Penicillium expansum conidia and Escherichia coli from poplar specimens to Golden apples. This [microorganisms-poplar-Golden apple] model was developed taking into account realistic parameters with extreme and usual conditions. Poplar specimens were artificially contaminated with P. expansum and E. coli. They were then put in contact with apples and stored in a climatic room for up to one week. Both wood specimens and apples were analyzed to assess the survival of microorganisms on wood specimens and the proportion of microorganism transfer to apples. Whereas P. expansum conidia survived but did not grow on wood specimens, E. coli mortality was observed after one hour of contact with wood. The proportion of both microorganisms transferred to apples was less than 0.25%. The impact of wood moisture content, contact time between wood and apples, and apple supply variability on the transfer levels were studied. The hygroscopic properties of wood were discussed. The low and reproducible transfer levels observed demonstrate that poplar is a safe packaging material for apples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPenicillium expansum 3aadverse effects 3aapples 3aconidia 3acrates 3afoods 3ahygroscopicity 3amarkets 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amortality 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3awater content 3awood 3awood moisture 0aWooden surfaces 0aTransfer 0aApples 0aMicroorganisms 0aContamination1 aIsmaïl, Rached1 aMichel, Valérie,1 aFederighi, Michel1 aAviat, Florence1 aLe Bayon, Isabelle0 tFood control.g2016 Feb., v. 60 p.95-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009200171300001800263520051800281592002800799650001800827650000900845650002300854650001700877650001100894650001900905650004400924653001800968653001600986653001301002653001701015700001401032700001901046700001801065773010601083856008501189852000901274655001201283IND60396120020221119115643.0150825e20151018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6039612002DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10094592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hai-Long12aA new highly oxygenated daphnane diterpene esters from the flower buds of Daphne genkwa  ap. 1878-1883.  aThe phytochemical investigation of the flower buds of Daphne genkwa yielded eight highly oxygenated daphnane-type diterpene esters, including a new one, genkwanine N 20-palmitate (1) and seven known ones (2 – 8).

However, the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of L-carnosine in the focal cerebral ischemia model have yet to be elucidated. To investigate the molecular mechanisms, rat models of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and sham operation were first established and then pMCAO and sham-operated rats were treated with L-carnosine or vehicle alone. After this treatment, neurological deficits were evaluated at 12, 24 and 72h after operation and the infarct volume was measured at 72h after treatment. In addition, we also detected the mRNA expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Pim-1 and the protein expression of phosphorylated STAT3, Pim-1, bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 at 12, 24 and 72h post-pMCAO. Our results showed that the L-carnosine-treated rats had milder neurological deficits and smaller infarct volume and showed up-regulated expression in mRNA levels of STAT3 and Pim-1 than vehicle-treated rats at 72h after treatment. Meanwhile, compared with vehicle-treated rats, the L-carnosine-treated rats exhibited higher protein expressions of pSTAT3, Pim-1 and bcl-2 but lower expression of cleaved caspase-3 protein at 72h following operation. These results indicate that L-carnosine plays an important role in inhibiting neuronal cell apoptosis through STAT3 signaling pathway after acute cerebral ischemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acaspase-3 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ainfarction 3aischemia 3aneurons 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBrain Ischemiaxdrug therapyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aCarnosinextherapeutic use 2aInfarction, Middle Cerebral Arteryxdrug therapyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMotor Activityxdrug effects 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylation 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1xmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSTAT3 Transcription Factorxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction1 aYang, Zhi-Tang1 aLiu, Cong1 aHe, Yuan-Hong1 aZhao, Shan-Shan0 tBrain research.g2013 Apr. 24, v. 1507 p.125-133dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2013.02.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003400145245015700179520144800336592002801784650001501812650001701827650001601844650001301860650001101873650002001884650001201904650002001916650002701936650001601963650001801979650001001997650001402007650001302021650001702034650000902051700001902060700001902079700002702098700001802125700002802143773012002171856008002291852000902371655001202380IND60780861420221118214827.0220623e20220525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078086142DNAL7 a10.3390/biology110608142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-González, Cristina 10aEffect of Bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) on Zinc, Copper, and Manganese Homeostasis and DMT1 mRNA Expression in Streptozotocin-Induced Hyperglycemic Rats  aOur aim was to examine whether vanadium (IV) corrects alterations in zinc, copper and manganese homeostasis, observed in streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic rats, and whether such changes are related to divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) mRNA expression, and antioxidant and proinflammatory parameters. Four groups of Wistar rats were examined: control; hyperglycemic (H); hyperglycemic treated with 1 mg V/day (HV); and hyperglycemic treated with 3 mg V/day (HVH). Vanadium was supplied in drinking water as bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) for five weeks. Zinc, copper and manganese were measured in food, excreta, serum and tissues. DMT1 mRNA expression was quantified in the liver. Hyperglycemic rats showed increased Zn and Cu absorption and content in the liver, serum, kidneys and femurs; DMT1 expression also increased (p < 0.05 in all cases). HV rats showed no changes compared to H rats other than decreased DMT1 expression (p < 0.05). In the HVH group, decreased absorption and tissular content of studied elements (p < 0.05 in all cases) and DMT1 expression compared to H (p < 0.05) were observed. Liver zinc, copper and manganese content correlated positively with glutathione peroxidase activity and negatively with catalase activity (p < 0.05 in both cases). In conclusion, treatment with 3 mg V/d reverted the alterations in zinc and copper homeostasis caused by hyperglycemia, possibly facilitated by decreased DMT1 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acatalase 3acopper 3adivalent metals 3aexcreta 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3aliver 3amanganese 3avanadium 3avanadyl ions 3azinc1 aMoreno, Laura 1 aAranda, Pilar 1 aMontes-Bayón, María 1 aLlopis, Joan,1 aRivas-García, Lorenzo 0 tBiology.g2022 May 25, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110608143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245012000188300001600308520114300324592002801467650002701495650001601522650001901538650001501557650001301572650001601585700002001601700002601621773010701647856008101754852000901835655001201844IND50073751420221119214250.0150213e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007375142DNAL7 a240725632pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9865-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKieffer, James D.10aTemperature has a reduced effect on routine metabolic rates of juvenile shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum)  ap. 551-559.  aThis study examined the effects of acclimation temperature (10, 15, 20, or 25 °C) and an acute exposure to various temperatures on the routine metabolism of juvenile (~11 g) shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum). For the acclimation experiment, the minimum, mean, and maximum routine metabolic rates were established for sturgeon at each temperature. Mean routine metabolic rates for 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C were 134, 277, 313, and 309 mg O₂ kg⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively, with significant differences occurring between 10 and 15, 10 and 20, and 10 and 25 °C. For the acute exposure, similar patterns and significant differences were observed. Temperature quotient (Q₁₀) values indicate that the greatest effect of temperature occurred between 10 and 15 °C for both the acclimation and acute temperature experiments. In addition, the effect of temperature on the metabolic rate of sturgeon was nearly negligible between 15 and 25 °C. These results suggest that juvenile shortnose sturgeon are sensitive to temperature changes at the lower end of the range, and less sensitive in the mid-to-upper temperature range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser brevirostrum 3aacclimation 3aacute exposure 3ametabolism 3asturgeon 3atemperature1 aPenny, Faith M.1 aPapadopoulos, Vasoula0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2014 Apr., v. 40, no. 2 p.551-559dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-013-9865-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014100171300001600312520139900328592002801727596009701755650001501852650001801867650001701885650001401902650001501916650002701931650001401958650001101972650001401983650001001997650001202007650001602019650001702035650001002052650001802062650001002080650001902090650002202109650002202131700002202153700002202175700002002197700002202217700001802239700006502257700002402322773013702346856008102483852000902564655001202573IND60631403520221119061330.0190222e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063140352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-018-0640-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoringa, Prakash G.10aMetagenomic characterisation of ruminal bacterial diversity in buffaloes from birth to adulthood using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing  ap. 237-247.  aMicrobial colonisation in the forestomach of a ruminant is one of the most crucial factors in determining many of its physiological developments and digestive capabilities. The present study attempts to identify establishment pattern of microbes in relation to food, age and rumen development in the buffalo calves at every fortnight interval from birth to 6 months of age, followed by every month till animals became 1 year of age. Diversity study based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified rapidly changing bacterial population during initial 60 days of life, which got assemblage as rumen became physiologically mature with increasing age of animals. A lactate fermenting aerobic to facultative anaerobic genera found during initial 30 days of life were expeditiously replaced by strict anaerobic cellulolytic bacterial population with increasing age. The study confirms that initial colonisation mainly depends on the oral cavity and skin of the mother, followed by the surrounding environment and feed offered, which is reversed in order once animal gets older. Some of the well-described genera based on culture-dependent studies like Ruminococcus spp. were found to be in lesser proportion suggesting an additional role of other microbes or niche in cellulose degradation. We report the presence of Porphyromonas spp. and Mannheimia glucosidal for the first time in bovine infants.  aPublisher supplied data  aNO.

In S. vitreus, one source of the blue color has been identified as a bili-binding protein pigment (sandercyanin), found in surface mucus of the fish. Little is known about the production of the pigment or about its functions. We examined the anatomical localization and seasonal variation of sandercyanin in S. vitreus from a population in McKim Lake, northwestern Ontario, Canada. Skin sections were collected from 20 fish and examined histologically. Mucus was collected from 306 fish over 6 years, and the amount of sandercyanin was quantified spectrophotometrically. Sandercyanin was found solely on dorsal surfaces of the fish and was localized to novel cells in the epidermis, similar in appearance to secretory sacciform cells. Sandercyanin concentrations were significantly higher in fish collected in summer versus other seasons. Yellow and blue morphs did not differ in amounts of sandercyanin, suggesting that the observed blue color, in fact, arises from lack of yellow pigmentation in blue morphs. The function of the sandercyanin remains unclear, but roles in photoprotection and countershading are consistent with available data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander vitreus 3acolor 3afish 3alakes 3amorphs 3amucus 3aphotostability 3apigmentation 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aOntario1 aSchmitz, Mark H.1 aBlazer, Vicki S.1 aEhlinger, Timothy J.1 aBerges, John A.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2014 Oct. 5, v. 72, no. 2 p.281-289dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-01393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014100163300001400304520128400318592002801602650001701630650002701647650001601674650003201690650001701722650001501739650001601754650001901770650001001789650001501799650002501814650001701839700002001856700002301876700002301899773010001922856008102022852000902103655001202112IND4393039220221119213225.0151024e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439303922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10886-006-9203-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUsha Rani, P.10aRETRACTION: Kairomones Extracted from Rice Yellow Stem Borer and their Influence on Egg Parasitization by Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead  ap. 59-73.  aHost location and acceptance by egg parasitoids can be mediated by close-range host stimuli. In this study, we tested the response of Trichogramma japonicum Ashmead to cuticular extracts of adult and larval rice yellow stem borer (YSB), Scripophaga incertulas Walker. We also studied the wasps’ response to extracts from YSB larval frass. Laboratory bioassays revealed that hexane extracts of the adult host body stimulate ovipositor probing of T. japonicum. Extracts of larval frass also stimulated parasitization. In contrast, host larval cuticular extracts had no effect on parasitization rates. Fractionation of the crude extracts of adult YSB cuticular extracts was performed using silica gel chromatography, followed by bioassays of the individual fractions to test their effects on wasp behavior. Analyses of the most active fractions by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry revealed that the extract contained saturated long chain alkanes and alkenes, with carbon numbers ranging from C₂₀ to C₃₂. Hydrocarbons were applied onto host eggs to test their effects on parasitization rates. Treatments of eggs with docosane, tetracosane, pentacosane, and eicosane enhanced host egg parasitization, while pentadecane, hexadecane, and nonadecane deterred oviposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichogramma 3aScirpophaga incertulas 3aparasitoids 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahost seeking 3aparasitism 3aoviposition 3ainsect cuticle 3afrass 3akairomones 3achemical composition 3ahydrocarbons1 aIndu Kumari, S.1 aSriramakrishna, T.1 aRatna Sudhakar, T.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2007 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.59-73dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-006-9203-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245013900125300001400264500001900278520072600297592002801023650002001051650001401071650002201085650001301107650003901120650001701159650001701176653001301193653001301206653002801219700001401247700001201261700001401273773016101287852000901448655001201457IND60706141220221118001715.0200807e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070614122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVyas, RP10aGenetic Variability Study on the Basis of Seed Storage Protein Polymorphism of Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) Genotypes through SDS-PAGE  ap. 87-89.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStorage seed proteins of KGD-1287, KGD 1288, KGD 1290, KGD 1291, KGD 1298, KGD 1299, KGD 1300, KGD 1301, KGD 1302, KGD 1168, Avarodhi, Pragati and Radhey were analysed by SDS-PAGE.

No information is available on Zingiber zerumbet (Zz) TFs involved in defense response against Pythium myriotylum. Here, we provide a global identification, characterization, and temporal expression profiling of Zz TFs following an incompatible interaction with P. myriotylum using a transcriptome sequencing approach. We identified a total of 903 TFs belonging to 96 families based on their conserved domains. Evolutionary analysis clustered the Zz TFs according to their phylogenetic affinity, providing glimpses of their functional diversities. High throughput expression array analysis highlighted a complex interplay between activating and repressing transcription factors in fine-tuning Zz defense response against P. myriotylum. The high differential modulation of TFs involved in cell wall fortification, lignin biosynthesis, and SA/JA hormone crosstalk allows us to envisage that this mechanism plays a central role in restricting P. myriotylum proliferation in Zz. This study lays a solid foundation and provides valuable resources for the investigation of the evolutionary history and biological functions of Zz TF genes involved in defense response.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 38(1397)/14EMR-IIcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research 3aPythium myriotylum 3aZingiber zerumbet 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease resistance 3afunctional diversity 3agenes 3alignin 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aKoyyappurath, Sayuj1 aAlex, Teena Elizabeth1 aGeetha, Kiran Ayyanperumal1 aAugustine, Lesly1 aNasser, Alka1 aThomas, George1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6524-04490 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2019 Mar., v. 19, no. 2 p.249-264dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl61464x1438-793X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-018-0644-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009700166520146800263592002801731650003101759650002201790650002601812650000901838650001101847650001801858650002501876650002201901650001501923651002501938651001301963653002701976653001402003653002302017653003102040653004302071700001502114773011602129856008402245852000902329655001202338IND60755112220221118233259.0211213e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075511222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1072742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuarte, A.C.10aHow changes in cropping intensity affect water usage in an irrigated Mediterranean catchment  aAgricultural policies and social change influence irrigation management decisions and their associated effects. The changes in the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union have deeply affected irrigated agriculture in the Mediterranean region. In this region, hydrology is rather complex and the environment particularly vulnerable. We monitored cropping patterns and the water balance in a sprinkler-irrigated catchment in Central Portugal over thirteen irrigation seasons and twelve rainfall seasons. There was wide variation in annual rainfall (from 283 mm to 667 mm) and in the intensity of rainfall events from year to year. A monitoring station at the catchment outlet was installed to measure runoff which, together with field observations, allowed us to compute a water balance for both the rainfed and the irrigation seasons. Changes in cropping intensity led to changes in the depth of irrigation. Irrigation runoff followed irrigation depth and both followed the trend of cropping intensity. Less intensive cropping also reduced the off-site effects of agricultural activities. The runoff coefficient was 0.28 in the rainfed seasons and 0.02 in the irrigation seasons. The changes in the irrigation hydrology and in the off-site effects of agricultural activities in the catchment were caused by changes in cropping intensity induced by the European Union Common Agricultural Policy reforms, rather than by environmental or technical factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3airrigated farming 3airrigation management 3arain 3arunoff 3asocial change 3asprinkler irrigation 3awater utilization 3awatersheds 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal 0aIrrigation performance 0aCatchment 0aRunoff coefficient 0aRelative irrigation supply 0aIrrigation consumptive use coefficient1 aMateos, L.0 tAgricultural water management.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 260 p.107274-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.1072743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008400166300001200250520127900262592002801541596005801569650001501627650001201642650002601654650001501680650000901695650000901704650001501713650001601728650002501744650001101769650000901780650000901789700002001798700002801818700002701846700002901873700002401902773013401926856008202060852000902142655001202151IND60590984020221119035130.0190128e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059098402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7287-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoradi, Razieh10aBearing capacity of soft soil model treated with end-bearing bottom ash columns  ap. 100.  aGranular column technique is a soil improvement method used to increase the bearing capacity of a soft soil area by replacing the soil with a group of granular column materials. The by-product utilisation is a worldwide interest for sustainable infrastructure development. Bottom ash, which is a combustion deposit derived from coal burning, is a potential by-product that could be used alternatively to sand or aggregate as a green granular column material. This research is to study the potential use of the bottom ash column-improved soft clay by conducting a series of small-scale physical modelling test. The bearing capacity behaviour and failure mode of soft clay improved with end-bearing group of bottom ash columns with and without geotextile encasement are investigated. The bearing capacity of soft clay is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of bottom ash columns; that is, 239% of bearing capacity improvement is observed with only 13% of improvement area. The bulging of the bottom ash column is transferred to buckling failure with higher bearing capacity when the bottom ash column is encased by geotextile. The outcome of this research leads to the usage of bottom ash by-product as a granular column material in sustainable soil improvement technique.  aPublisher supplied data  aRTA5980005cTRF Senior Research Scholar program Grant 3abottom ash 3aburning 3abyproduct utilization 3abyproducts 3aclay 3acoal 3acombustion 3ageotextiles 3agreen infrastructure 3amodels 3asand 3asoil1 aMarto, Aminaton1 aRashid, Ahmad Safuan A.1 aMoradi, Mohammad Moeen1 aGaniyu, Abideen Adekunle1 aHorpibulsuk, Suksun0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Feb., v. 77, no. 3 p.100-100dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7287-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245016500185300001600350520162800366592002801994650002402022650001302046650002202059650001702081650001602098650001602114650002702130650001602157650001402173650001702187650001402204650001302218650001202231650001502243650001102258650002402269650003202293650001802325700001902343700002802362700001702390700001502407700002002422700002002442773010702462856004802569852000902617655001202626IND50073751720221119214036.0140308e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007375172DNAL7 a240782212pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-013-9868-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancis, D.

Therefore, strategies to maximise the deposition efficiency of these key health beneficial fatty acids are being investigated. The present study examined the effects of four vegetable-based dietary lipid sources (linseed, olive, palm and sunflower oil) on the deposition efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA and the circulating blood plasma concentrations of the appetite-regulating hormones, leptin and ghrelin, during the grow-out and finishing phases in rainbow trout culture. Minimal detrimental effects were noted in fish performance; however, major modifications were apparent in tissue fatty acid compositions, which generally reflected that of the diet. These modifications diminished somewhat following the fish oil finishing phase, but longer-lasting effects remained evident. The fatty acid composition of the alternative oils was demonstrated to have a modulatory effect on the deposition efficiency of n-3 LC-PUFA and on the key endocrine hormones involved in appetite regulation, growth and feed intake during both the grow-out and finishing phases. In particular, n-6 PUFA (sunflower oil diet) appeared to ‘spare’ the catabolism of n-3 LC-PUFA and, as such, resulted in the highest retention of these fatty acids, ultimately highlighting new nutritional approaches to maximise the maintenance of the qualitative benefits of fish oils when they are used in feeds for aquaculture species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aappetite 3aaquaculture feeds 3ablood plasma 3adietary fat 3afarmed fish 3afatty acid composition 3afeed intake 3afinishing 3afish culture 3afish oils 3ahormones 3alinseed 3ametabolism 3aolives 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asunflower oil1 aThanuthong, T.1 aSenadheera, S.

In our study, the potential for angling-induced change in fish behavior was examined in two marine coastal fishes exploited by boat recreational fishing in the Mediterranean (Mallorca, Spain). It was expected that the mean vulnerability to capture of surviving individuals would differ across a gradient of previous exposure to recreational angling and that this effect would be present in multiple species. The prediction received partial empirical support. Recreational angling intensity was correlated with enhanced gear-avoidance behavior in only one of the two study species, the carnivorous painted comber (Serranus scriba). By contrast, the omnivorous fish species in our study, the annular seabream (Diplodus annularis), did not differ in its behavior towards hooks in exploited compared with unexploited sites. These results suggest that recreational angling may contribute to patterns of hyperdepletion in catch rates because of increased timidity and associated reduced vulnerability to fishing gear in some exploited species. Such effects would lead to erroneous interpretations about the status of the fish stocks when assessed by fishery-dependent data and would negatively affect catch rates and quality of the fishery in the affected species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiplodus annularis 3aSerranus 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3aboats 3acarnivores 3afish 3afish behavior 3afisheries 3alearning 3aomnivores 3aprediction 3asport fishing 3aSpain1 aPalmer, Miquel1 aTrías, Pedro1 aDíaz-Gil, Carlos1 aArlinghaus, Robert0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2014 Oct. 6, v. 72, no. 2 p.217-225dNRC Research Pressx1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-01833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245012700215300001400342520151500356592002801871650001601899650001701915650001001932650001201942650001301954650001001967650001001977650001201987650001201999650002502011650001702036653002702053653002002080653001902100653001702119653002302136653002802159653001702187653002302204653001402227653002502241700003302266700002702299700002402326773014902350856008602499852000902585655001202594IND60556341720221121175011.0190214e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055634172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoucaud, Ingrid C.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0286-558810aIncubating females signal their needs during intrapair vocal communication at the nest: a feeding experiment in great tits  ap. 77-86.  aParental care is a key factor of breeding success and parents face evolutionary trade-offs between investment in current offspring and future reproduction and survival. Incubation in birds is energetically costly and the balance between parental and offspring's energetic needs is especially challenging when only one sex incubates, generally the female. In that case, males can contribute indirectly to incubation effort by feeding their mate and females may use begging behaviours to signal their needs to their visiting partner. The great tit, Parus major, is a good model species to test whether females use acoustic communication from the nest to signal their needs to their mate outside because females interact vocally with their mate during incubation. To test whether females use these vocal exchanges to communicate how hungry they are, great tit pairs were recorded on 2 days during incubation: 1 day with a feeder of mealworms in the nestbox and 1 day with an empty feeder. First, food supplementation increased females' nest attentiveness, revealing a decrease in foraging activity and consequently in females' needs. Second, females signalled their need for food both during their male's visits inside the nest but also during the vocal exchange immediately preceding the male's entrance by calling more and by modifying the frequency spectrum of their calls. So females' calling behaviour is an honest signal of need not only during their male's visits, but also before his entrance in the nest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3abioacoustics 3abirds 3afemales 3aforaging 3amales 3anests 3aparents 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3avocalization 0aacoustic communication 0abiparental care 0afemale begging 0afemale calls 0aincubation feeding 0aintrapair communication 0amate feeding 0anest attentiveness 0apair bond 0asolicitation calling1 aAguirre Smith, Mélissa L.N.1 aValère, Pénélope A.1 aVignal, Clémentine0 tAnimal behaviour.g2016 Dec., v. 122 p.77-86dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010200166520098800268592002801256650001701284650001501301650001801316650002201334650000901356650001501365650004401380650002301424650000901447650001001456650001401466653000901480653002601489653001801515653001301533653001401546700001901560700001801579700001301597700002101610700005801631773010001689856008701789852000901876655001201885IND60666140020221119150812.0200217e20200215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066614002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1255172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yue10aAnalysis of the physiochemical properties of rice induced by postharvest yellowing during storage  aPasting properties indicated that the yellowing process led to a reduced peak viscosity and breakdown value of the postharvest yellowing (PHY) rice compared to corresponding normal one. More importantly, the current study revealed that both moduli of G′ and G″ of the gel formed from the PHY rice was lower than that of its corresponding rice and the yellowing significantly reduced the area of the hysteresis curve. Thus, it is proposed that PHY may inhibit the formation of a continuous network structure. Studies of moisture absorption dynamics and low-field NMR suggested that the yellowing process led to a faster moisture absorption and de-absorption, indicating a faster moisture fluidity in rice kernels induced by yellowing process. Potent of the “capillary channels” might be formed during rice yellowing, and these structural characteristics may be associated with its higher digestibility due to the accelerated diffusion of the digestive enzymes in rice kernels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aabsorption 3adigestibility 3adigestive enzymes 3agels 3ahysteresis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apasting properties 3arice 3aseeds 3aviscosity 0aRice 0aPostharvest yellowing 0aThermodynamic 0aRheology 0aMechanism1 aShang, Wenting1 aLiu, Jinguang1 aSun, Hui1 aStrappe, Padraig1 aZhou, Zhongkai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0760-27040 tFood chemistry.g2020 Feb. 15, v. 306 p.125517-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1255173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245009100128300001600219500001400235520117900249592002801428650001501456650002201471650001701493650001801510650001801528650001401546650002001560650001101580650003101591650002801622650001301650650001101663650002601674650001501700650001301715650002101728653001401749653002801763653001401791653002101805700002301826773014101849852000901990655001201999IND60706141620221118001735.0200807e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070614162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDey, Avijit10aGastrointestinal Nematodiasis in Ruminants: Nutritional Consequences and Ameliorations  ap. 101-109.  aNAL-light  aGastrointestinal (GI) parasitism is a potent threat to overall economy of animal rearing as it affects animal production drastically. GI parasites reduce nutrient availability to the host through both reduction in voluntary feed intake and/or reduction in the efficiency of absorbed nutrients. The extent of impairment by parasite is influenced by the level of larval challenge, species of worms, host's previous infection of parasites, its age and breed. Subclinical infection of GI nematodes may cause only transient or no effect on apparent digestibility of crude protein or energy but extensive damage of the GI tract during acute phase of infection significantly affects the digestion and absorption of nutrients especially proteins. Nutritional modulation through supplying of protein, energy and minerals can help to improve the immunity status of the body for resistance and resilience against GI parasites. Plants containing condensed tannins may be beneficial for controlling GI parasite infections as low amount of condensed tannins have protective action against proteins, improve immunity and antioxidant status of animals and direct toxic effect against worms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanimal production 3aantioxidants 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3aenergy 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3agastrointestinal system 3aimmunity 3alarvae 3anutrient availability 3aparasitism 3atoxicity 3avoluntary intake 0aNematodes 0aGastro-intestinal tract 0aNutrition 0aFeed utilization1 aPaul, Shyam Sundar0 tIndian journal of animal nutrition.g2014 June, v. 31, no. 2 p.101-109dAnimal Nutrition Society of IndiawJournal:2071x2231-67447nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245013000165300001600295520129400311592002801605650000801633650002001641650002001661650001701681650001601698650001901714650001101733650002401744650004301768650001001811650001701821653000801838653001001846653001001856653002201866700001601888700001501904700001301919700001901932700001401951700001401965700001101979773009501990856008702085852000902172655001202181IND60526594520221122175938.0190408e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052659452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.07.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Rui12aA validated strip-based lateral flow assay for the confirmation of sheep-specific PCR products for the authentication of meat  ap. 146-150.  aMolecular methods, such as PCR and real-time PCR, have been developed to detect species in meat and meat products. Despite good specificity and sensitivity, they are not widely implemented in food control programs due to complex operation or financial reasons. In the present study, a simple, rapid and affordable method, Sheep-PCR-Strip [Sheep specific polymerase chain reaction-Strip], was developed for the authentic identification of raw and heat-treated mutton. The assay is based on PCR amplification of sheep DNA, followed by detection of the PCR product by a strip format; the result can be read within 5 min by the naked eye. There is a real advantage of the strip approach rather in the reduced time (5 min versus electrophoresis) and avoidance of chemicals (e.g. ethidiumbromide). The sensitivity of the Sheep-PCR-Strip test was established to be 0.01% for the detection of adulterated meat; the limit of detection (LOD) was up to 0.01 pg of sheep DNA. The assay was also specific for sheep, and no cross-reactions were observed in other non-target species. It is a promising new tool for sheep identification and can be rapidly modified for other meat detection and widely used for solving problems related to food quality assurance, species authentication and traceability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adetection limit 3aelectrophoresis 3afood quality 3afood safety 3aheat treatment 3amutton 3anontarget organisms 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3atraceability 0aPCR 0aSheep 0aStrip 0aMeat adulteration1 aSun, Yajuan1 aYu, Shuang1 aWang, Yi1 aZhang, Meiping1 aXu, Yawei1 aXue, Jian1 aXu, Na0 tFood control.g2016 Feb., v. 60 p.146-150dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2015.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009200171520097800263592002801241650001901269650001901288650001701307650001401324650002301338650001401361650001401375650001901389650001801408650002001426650001101446650002401457650002001481650001301501650001501514653002301529653003801552653002201590653003601612700002101648700001601669700001901685700001601704700001301720700001301733700001701746700001701763773010001780856008701880852000901967655001201976IND60666140120221119150903.0200217e20200305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066614012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1255192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dachuan10aAdditiveChem: A comprehensive bioinformatics knowledge-base for food additive chemicals  aFood additives are considered to be the catalysts and headstones of the modern food industry, affecting every step of food production, processing, and storage.

Herein, we have inserted ultrasmall MnO nanoparticles into N-rich carbon nanosheets (MnO@NCs) via a facile and scalable method. By integrating copious nitrogen species (over 13 wt%), flexible but robust carbon nanosheets offer powerful support for dispersing large amounts of MnO nanoparticles, creatively avoiding the inherent deficiencies of MnO such as poor electrical conductivity, low mechanical stability and severe electrochemical dissolution. Consequently, the MnO@NC electrode exhibited a striking capacitance of 570 F g⁻¹ at 2 A g⁻¹ within a wide operation voltage of 1 V, which spurs the low capacitance of MnO materials (generally 200–350 F g⁻¹) to a higher level. Furthermore, initial attempts at fabricating asymmetric supercapacitors based on MnO@NCs demonstrated an energy density superior to its well-studied MnO₂ counterpart. The introduction of N-rich species is of great significance for releasing restricted properties and fully exerting positive effects on the supercapacitors. Particularly, the impressive capacitance retention of ∼99% over 6000 cycles also propels a new direction for transition metal oxide/NC composites towards high-performance energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3amanganese dioxide 3amanganese monoxide 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3anitrogen1 aZhong, Yiren1 aZhou, Xianlong1 aRen, Jingjing1 aSu, Liwei1 aWei, Jinping1 aZhou, Zhen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 15, v. 2, no. 31 p.12519-12525dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02055c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008900158300001600247520168300263592002801946650000801974650001901982650002502001650001002026650001502036650001402051650001302065650003902078650001802117650001702135650001302152650001302165650000902178650001602187650002402203650001202227650001102239650001502250650001602265650001302281650001402294700001602308700001502324700001502339700001602354700001502370773015102385856007402536852000902610655001202619IND60082235120221119111241.0141017e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008223512DNAL7 a10.1111/ajgw.121052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, H.S.10aPollen grain development is highly sensitive to temperature stress in Vitis vinifera  ap. 474-484.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is often exposed to above optimal temperature in the field. Although genomic analysis has been underway for over a decade, studies on grapevine chromosome behaviour and nuclear topology are scarce. Here, we explore the influence of hot‐water sanitation treatments, involving immersing dormant canes in water at 50°C for 45 min or heat exposure to 42°C for 4 h during reproductive growth, on the dynamics of somatic nuclei and meiotic chromosomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Chromatin behaviour was analysed by 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole hydrochloride staining, fluorescent in situ hybridisation with various probes, and immunocytochemistry with an antibody against DNA methylated at cytosine residues. Sanitation procedures had no effect on somatic or meiotic chromatin behaviour or nuclear topology. In contrast, although meiosis proceeded normally during exposure to 42°C for 4 h, this heat regime resulted in highly disrupted pollen grains likely due to cell wall fragility and in a significant reduction in pollen viability. CONCLUSIONS: Grapevine pollen mother cell meiosis is described in detail for the first time. Although hot‐water sanitation treatments had no effect on chromatin behaviour, the range of temperature to which grapevines are often exposed to in the field induces gametophyte malformations associated with decreased pollen viability. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Heat stress during reproductive development disrupts pollen grain development and can therefore have implications on yield. Such knowledge may offer a tool for identification and selection of heat‐tolerant genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aVitis vinifera 3aabnormal development 3acanes 3acell walls 3achromatin 3acytosine 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agametogenesis 3agametophytes 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ameiosis 3apollen 3asanitation 3atemperature 3atopology 3aviability1 aDelgado, M.1 aAvó, A.P.1 aBarão, A.1 aSerrano, I.1 aViegas, W.0 tAustralian journal of grape and wine research.g2014 Oct., v. 20, no. 3 p.474-484dAustralian Society of Viticulture and Oenologyx1322-71307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.121053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012100169300001300290500001900303506002800322520209500350592002802445506003702473650001902510650001102529650002202540650001402562650001002576650002102586650002002607650000902627650001702636650001002653650001602663650001102679650001702690650001302707653001902720653001702739653001802756700002402774700002202798773011802820856008202938852000903020655001203029IND60739643920221207074645.0210221e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073964392DNAL7 a10.1186/s41936-021-00210-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeko, Bankole J.14aThe mitigating effect of Ananas comosus on aluminum-induced oxidative stress on the testes of adult male Wistar rats  ap. 1-12.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aBackground The mitigating effect of Ananas comosus (pineapple juice) extract on an aluminum-induced testicular toxicity in male Wistar rats was examined in this study. Thirty healthy adult male Wistar rats with an average weight of 200 g were grouped into six groups; distilled water and 1 ml of pineapple juice extracts were administered to the control and treated animals respectively for 3 weeks. The control group was given rat pellets and distilled water. Negative control was given 100mg/kg/d Aluminum Chloride and pellets; Group 1 was given 100mg/kg/d and 1ml of pineapple juice in distilled water orally; Group 2 was given 100mg/kg/d Aluminum Chloride and 1.5 ml of in distilled water orally; group 3 was given 100 mg/kg/day aluminum chloride and 2 ml of pineapple juice in distilled water orally; group 4 was given 100 mg/kg/day aluminum chloride and 2.5 ml of pineapple juice in distilled water orally. Testicular histology, semen parameters, and testosterone were assessed. Results This study showed a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in testicular volume, motile sperm count, concentration, total count, progressive evaluation, and morphology in the negative control group relative to the normal control and extract control groups. In the groups co-treated with aluminum chloride and Ananas comosus extract, there was improvement in sperm volume, motility, total count, progressive assessment, and morphology. There was also a statistical decrease (P < 0.05) in testosterone hormone in the negative control group, but there was an increase in the aluminum chloride and Ananas comosus extract co-treated groups. Similarly, in co-treated aluminum chloride and Ananas comosus extract, the degenerative seminiferous tubule histoarchitecture due to aluminum chloride in the negative control group was enhanced. Conclusion Based on this current study, it was evident that aluminum chloride induced oxidative stress and retarded reproduction in males whereas Ananas comosus mitigated reproduction in males by improving sperm parameters and microarchitecture of the testes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnanas comosus 3aadults 3aaluminum chloride 3ahistology 3amales 3aoxidative stress 3apineapple juice 3arats 3areproduction 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atoxicity 0aAsthenospermia 0aPeroxidation 0aTeratospermia1 aOlawuyi, Solomon T.1 aOkon, Lawrence U.0 tJournal of basic & applied zoology.g2021 Feb., v. 82, no. 1 p.1-12dSpringerOpenwJournal:23227x2090-990X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41936-021-00210-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012900179300001600308520176400324592002802088650003002116650002002146650002202166650001002188650001102198650002502209650001402234650003002248650000902278650003102287650001502318650002502333650002002358650001702378650002102395650007302416650004102489650004102530650001602571650006502587650001102652650002802663650001402691650003002705650002902735650003402764650002702798650002402825650002302849651001002872651001002882700001302892700001802905700001602923700001602939700001702955700001502972700001802987700001503005773009803020856004803118852000903166655001203175IND4469780020221119180345.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446978002DNAL7 a214617282pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2333-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Aiqin10aMolecular identification and distribution of Cryptosporidium and Giardia duodenalis in raw urban wastewater in Harbin, China  ap. 913-918.  aContamination of the water supply by protozoa often causes outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. The goals of the present study was to investigate the level of Cryptosporidium and Giardia duodenalis in wastewater from wastewater treatment plants in Harbin, China, and to understand the endemic transmission characteristics of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis. Forty-eight domestic wastewater specimens from the two wastewater treatment plants in Harbin City were collected from April 2009 to March 2010. Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis assemblages were identified by PCR and sequencing of the 18S ribosomal RNA and the triosephosphate isomerase genes, respectively. In total, 15 wastewater specimens were PCR positive for Cryptosporidium and 23 were PCR positive for G. duodenalis. The prevalence of contamination with G. duodenalis (47.9%) was higher than that of Cryptosporidium (31.3%). Molecular identification showed the presence of two Cryptosporidium spp. (14 belonging to Cryptosporidium andersoni and one belonging to Cryptosporidium ubiquitum) and two G. duodenalis assemblages (18 belonging to assemblage AII and six belonging to assemblage B). In addition, eight specimens contained both Cryptosporidium and G. duodenalis, and one specimen contained G. duodenalis assemblages AII and B. These results suggested humans might be the primary source of G. duodenalis contamination in wastewater in the studied area. In contrast, a low prevalence of C. ubiquitum suggested a reduced risk of human cryptosporidiosis caused by C. ubiquitum via waterborne route. This work provides basic experimental data needed for local wastewater treatment plants to develop protective strategies for water safety and to eliminate waterborne parasites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium andersoni 3aGiardia lamblia 3acryptosporidiosis 3agenes 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater pollution 3awater supply 2aCluster Analysis 2aCryptosporidiumxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aGiardiaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aWaterxparasitology 2aWater Purification 3aChina 0aChina1 aJi, Hong1 aWang, Ensheng1 aLiu, Jingbo1 aXiao, Lihua1 aShen, Yujuan1 aLi, Yihong1 aZhang, Weizhe1 aLing, Hong0 tParasitology research.g2011 Sept., v. 109, no. 3 p.913-918dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2333-4  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245006100182300001600243520072800259592002800987650002501015650001501040650002201055650001101077650001201088650002101100651001301121653001701134653001801151653001301169653003001182653002601212700002801238773013701266856005101403852000901454655001201463IND50075156420221120072252.0140410e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515642DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2012.7216982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Valinas, María A.,10aWater service quality in Tanzania: access and management  ap. 451-471.  aProblems related to water access and quality are significant in several countries around the world.

However, there are patients who respond well to GMA, and patients who do not benefit. Therefore, predictive factors of GMA efficacy need to be defined.In a prospective multicenter setting, 200 UC patients at 32 institutes received one GMA session per week over 10 weeks. Patients who achieved remission were followed for 12 months. The Clinical Activity Index (CAI) ≤3 meant remission, and response meant CAI decreased by ≥3. Quality of life was evaluated by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ).After final GMA, remission, response and no response rates were 67.0%, 15.0% and 18%, respectively. The remission group had a significant decrease in myeloid leucocytes and platelets. Corticosteroid dose decreased (P < 0.001); 49 of 97 patients on corticosteroids became steroid-free. Baseline CAI was lower in the remission group versus non-remission (P < 0.01), whereas IBDQ was higher in the remission group versus non-remission (P < 0.05). After 12 months, 52 of 134 patients had maintained remission. Disease duration was longer in the relapsed group versus maintained remission group (P = 0.041). Male gender, first UC episode and corticosteroid responder were significant factors for maintaining remission, whereas corticosteroid dependent UC was associating with relapse.Selective myeloid leucocyte depletion was effective for remission induction and improving patients' quality of life. Baseline demographics such as disease activity level, duration and corticosteroid dependency appear to predict response to GMA. Additionally, patients with a first UC episode who were drug naive responded well to GMA and achieved a favorable long-term disease course by avoiding pharmacologics from an early stage of their inflammatory bowel disease. These findings should help to end unnecessary use of medical resources by targeting GMA to patients who may respond well.  aPublisher supplied data 0along-term prognosis 0amyeloid lineage leucocytes 0aplatelets 0apredictive factor of response to therapy 0aulcerative colitis1 aWatanabe, Kenji1 aIto, Hiroaki1 aNishishita, Masakazu1 aSawada, Koji1 aOkuyama, Yusuke1 aOkazaki, Kazuichi1 aFujii, Hisao1 aNakase, Hiroshi1 aMasuda, Tsutomu1 aFukunaga, Ken1 aAndoh, Akira1 aNakamura, Shiro0 tCytotherapy.g2015 May, v. 17 p.680-688dElsevier Inc.aInternational Society for Cellular Therapyx1465-32497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245007100161300001600232520092200248592002801170650002701198650002501225650002001250650001301270650001201283773015101295856007701446852000901523655001201532IND60521108320221118050700.0160528e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052110832DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1957-10022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Erich10aElektrophoretische Untersuchungen an Mutanten des Tabakmosaikvirus  ap. 609-614.  aElectrophoretic pH-mobility diagrams were constructed for two groups of TMV strains. In each group the strains followed each other by single or by few mutation steps. In accordance with biological symptoms and serological results, the division into two groups could be seen also in electrophoretic behaviour (differences in number of electrophoretically active basic components). There is no parallelism however between alterations of biological symptoms and electrophoretic mobility. To explain the differences in electrophoretic behaviour of our TMV strains it is suggested that only the outermost part of the protein coat should be considered as electrophoretically active. Thus differences in mobility could be caused not only by alterations in amino acid content but also by changes in the distribution of the charge-defining groups at the virus surface — e. g. the sequence of amino acids in the peptid chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acid sequences 3aelectrophoresis 3amutation 3aviruses0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 12, no. 10 p.609-614dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1957-10023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003600149245008800185300001500273520079900288592002801087650000801115650002001123650002001143650001201163650001401175650001901189650001401208650002201222650001101244650001301255700002901268700002401297700002201321700002001343700002901363773014901392856008301541852000901624655001201633IND60480426320221120181635.0160127e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048042632DNAL7 a10.1560/8THY-K0P8-4V15-QCHQ2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFORINO, LAURA MARIA CONSTANTINA10aDNA methylation of tapetum cells during microsporogenesis in Malus domestica Borkh.  ap. 91-100.  a<P>Anther tapetum of Malus domestica Borkh. is a unilayered tissue; its cells have a short lifespan, become senescent, and die by autolysis in the interval between free microspore and bicellular pollen stages.

This sensitive and reliable method is based on the use of gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS). The method has been validated according to the European Union SANCO/12571/2013 guidelines and ISO 17025:2005. The extraction required a prior water addition, an ethyl acetate extraction of the sample, and a final cleanup step. Calibration curves were linear from 0.003 to 0.150 mg kg⁻¹ for most compounds. The limit of quantification was set at 0.0036 mg kg⁻¹ for more than 80 % of the pesticides. Recoveries were calculated at 0.004 and 0.040 mg kg⁻¹, resulting always in the range 70–116 %, and with precision values ≤20 %. The expanded uncertainty was estimated at the two abovementioned concentrations, being always ≤50 %. The method applicability has been evaluated by the analysis of real samples, and no pesticides were detected above the limit of quantification, although some minor amounts of pesticides were detected (pirimiphos methyl, tebuconazole, chlorpyrifos, and chlorpyrifos methyl) in some of them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aacetonitrile 3achlorpyrifos 3aethyl acetate 3agas chromatography 3aguidelines 3arice 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atebuconazole 3auncertainty 3awheat flour1 aArrebola-Liébanas, Francisco Javier1 aMartínez-Vidal, José Luis1 aHernández-Torres, María Elena1 aGarrido-Frenich, Antonia0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.548-563dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0214-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02480naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245020400158300002000362520132100382592002801703650001801731650001601749650001301765650002201778650001901800650002301819650002601842700001301868700002001881700001501901773014301916856007402059852000902133655001202142IND60670792720221119150906.0191002e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067079272DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta02060j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiaoling10aUnique UV-resistant and surface active aramid fibers with simultaneously enhanced mechanical and thermal properties by chemically coating Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈ having low photocatalytic activity  ap. 11286-11298.  aTo conquer the inferior UV resistance and poor surface activity without sacrificing the outstanding integrated performance of aramid fiber (KF) is still a challenge. A series of unique modified KFs coated with CaO doped CeO₂ (Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈), Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈@KF, were prepared, and their structures and properties were systematically investigated. Results show that the morphology of Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈@KF can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈ coated on the surface of KF, so does the integrated performances of fibers; while the chemical and crystal structures of Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈@KF are nearly the same as those of KF. Attractively, all Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈@KFs not only have greatly improved UV-resistance and surface activity, but also exhibit enhanced mechanical and thermal properties. The surface free energies of Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈@KFs are 1.2–1.4 times those of KFs; and the retentions of tenacity of Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈@KFs after 168 h UV irradiation depend on the loading of Ce₀.₈Ca₀.₂O₁.₈ on the surface of KF, but all of them are as high as 88–95%. The origin behind this is intensively discussed. This investigation provides an effective method to overcome the bottle-necks of KFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxide 3aceric oxide 3acoatings 3acrystal structure 3aphotocatalysis 3athermal properties 3aultraviolet radiation1 aYuan, Li1 aLiang, Guozheng1 aGu, Aijuan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 1, v. 2, no. 29 p.11286-11298dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02060j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002200166245011800188300001400306520205300320592002802373653001802401653001502419653001902434653001902453653002002472653001502492700002502507700001902532773010402551856011402655852000902769655001202778IND60129114420221119034621.0151124e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012911442DNAL7 a10.3375/0885-8608(2007)27[16:EARALM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahan, Carolyn G.10aEvaluating and Revising a Long-Term Monitoring Program for Vascular Plants: Lessons From Shenandoah National Park  ap. 16-24.  aMonitoring programs have been established by agencies to assist in the conservation of biological diversity and to assess the impacts of a variety of threats to species and natural systems. However, poorly designed programs may fail to detect changes in the system they were intended to monitor. We evaluated and revised the long-term monitoring program for vascular plants at Shenandoah National Park (SHEN) and used our evaluation and revision to illustrate common problems associated with monitoring programs. Our evaluation of data collected through SHEN's 14-year monitoring program indicated that the design and sampling effort lacked the statistical power to detect changes in stem density of shrubs or saplings, although there was sufficient power to detect changes in tree basal area for some species. The inability of the program to detect changes was due, in part, to the lack of specific management and sampling objectives, stratifying the park according to forest cover types that changed over time, errors associated with misidentification of species, and an inappropriate temporal schedule for visiting sampling plots. Our revised sampling design attempted to correct these deficiencies by using strata that are unlikely to change over time (elevation, bedrock geology, and aspect), streamlining data collection to allow a greater number of sampling plots, and visiting all plots over a 2-year period (interpenetrating sampling) to increase sample size. Long-term monitoring programs should: (1) establish specific, quantifiable, and attainable management and statistical sampling objectives; (2) use permanent characteristics to define strata (e.g., elevation or bedrock geology), if stratification is warranted; and (3) perform a statistical evaluation of the monitoring program once sufficient data have been collected. Prompt evaluation of an implemented monitoring program will allow timely modifications of either sampling objectives or the sample design with minimal delay in collecting meaningful long-term trend information.  aPublisher supplied data 0aforest plants 0amonitoring 0anational parks 0apower analysis 0avascular plants 0avegetation1 aDiefenbach, Duane R.1 aCass, Wendy B.0 tNatural areas journal.g2007 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.16-24dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F0885-8608%282007%2927%5B16%3AEARALM%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245015200158300002000310520105000330592002801380650001101408650001101419650001401430650001401444650002101458650001501479650001401494650001301508650002301521650002101544700002401565700002601589700001801615700001601633700001801649773014401667856007401811852000901885655001201894IND60670792820221119150658.0191002e20140722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067079282DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta02062f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan-Jie10aTa and Nb co-doped TiO₂ and its carbon-hybrid materials for supporting Pt–Pd alloy electrocatalysts for PEM fuel cell oxygen reduction reaction  ap. 12681-12685.  aTo explore possible substitutes for carbon supports in PEM fuel cell catalysts, both Ta and Nb co-doped TiO₂ (TaNbTiO₂) and carbon–TaNbTiO₂ (C–TaNbTiO₂) hybrid support materials are successfully synthesized by a modified thermal hydrolysis method. These materials are employed as support candidates for Pt–Pd alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Among several supported catalysts, 20 wt% Pt₀.₆₂Pd₀.₃₈/C₇₅wₜ%–(Ta₀.₀₁Nb₀.₀₃Ti₀.₉₆O₂)₂₅wₜ% is found to have an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) mass activity of 260 mA mgPₜ⁻¹ and an ORR loss of 30%, which are slightly better than those of the commercially available Pt/C baseline catalyst which has a mass activity of 110 mA mgPₜ⁻¹ and an ORR loss of 40% probably because of a strong physicochemical interaction among the Pt–Pd alloy catalyst particle, carbon–TaNbTiO₂ support and carbon, as well as the stability of oxide to protect carbon from corrosion by the distribution of oxide onto carbon, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3afuel cells 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3athermal hydrolysis 3atitanium dioxide1 aWilkinson, David P.1 aNeburchilov, Vladimir1 aSong, Chaojie1 aGuest, Alan1 aZhang, Jiujun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 22, v. 2, no. 32 p.12681-12685dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02062f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008500165300001800250520112500268592002801393650002001421650002701441650001301468650002601481650001401507650003601521650002001557650001101577650001601588650002101604650001201625650002501637650002001662650002101682650001901703650001301722650001001735653001601745653002001761653002001781653001801801700002101819700001801840773015301858856007702011852000902088655001202097IND60522613020221122164244.0160603e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052261302DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1979-12262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöller, Wolfram,10aIncomplete Glyoxysomes Appearing at a Late Stage of Maturation of Cucumber Seeds  ap. 1232-1236.  aSeeds of cucumber fruits at a late stage of ripening were analyzed for microbodies and micro­body components. On isopycnic density gradient centrifugation of homogenates in the presence of EDTA, several particulate fractions were obtained: a light membraneous fraction (density d = 1.09-1.11 kg × 1⁻¹), a mitochondria-enriched fraction (d = 1.21 kg × 1⁻¹), a microbody-enriched fraction (d = 1.23 kg × 1⁻¹), and a protein body fraction (d= 1.26 - 1.29 kg × 1⁻¹). Microbo­dies were revealed by exactly coinciding peaks of malate synthase, catalase and crotonase; small proportions of citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase were also present in this zone. Isocitrate lyase activity, however, did not occur in the seeds at this stage. The examination of enzyme activi­ties indicated the presence of microbodies which cannot function as competent glyoxysomes be­cause of the lack of isocitrate lyase. Moreover, de novo synthesis from [³H] leucine could be de­monstrated for malate synthase by means of immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized malate synthase and subsequent electrophoretic analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3acatalase 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3acucumbers 3adensity gradient centrifugation 3aelectrophoresis 3afruits 3aglyoxysomes 3aisocitrate lyase 3aleucine 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amalate synthase 3aprecipitin tests 3aprotein bodies 3aripening 3aseeds 0aMicrobodies 0aMalate Synthase 0aCucumis sativus 0aSeed Ripening1 aFrevert, Jürgen1 aKindi, Helmut0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 34, no. 12 p.1232-1236dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:21135x0939-50757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-1979-12263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015400172520141400326592002801740650001101768650001501779650001401794650001501808650002301823650001601846650001601862650001901878650001401897650001601911650001101927650001501938650001901953650001401972650002401986650003302010650001302043650001002056650001702066653001502083653000802098653001002106653001202116653001002128653003302138700001902171700002102190700001602211773009502227856008402322852000902406655001202415IND60762452320221119121041.0220326e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076245232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2021.1026252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamadhiya, Kanchan10aNewly isolated native microalgal strains producing polyhydroxybutyrate and energy storage precursors simultaneously: Targeting microalgal biorefinery  aWith escalating urbanization and ever-increasing population, plastic pollution has become the problem of hour. Owing to its deep roots in our daily life, it is imperative to find an alternative. Sustainable production of poly hydroxy butyrate (PHB) can be our way out from this soup of plastic pollution. Microalgae, being photoautotrophs, helps in bioremediation and can metabolize the waste products into biodiesel, bioethanol, protein, and also bioplastics in the form of PHB. The present study reports the accumulation of PHB in Coelastrella sp., Ettlia texensis and Pecatinodesmus sp. isolated from nearby regions of Indore under nutrient stress and mixotrophic conditions. The individual effect of nutrients was studied, and concluded that under mixotrophic cultivation, Coelastrella sp. can accumulate up to 151.8 ± 12.1 μg/mg dry cell weight (DCW) of PHB under N₁.₅P₀.₀₄Ga₁₀ supplementation in 72 h of cultivation. A two-stage cultivation strategy enabled the accumulation of high PHB content in microalgae without compromising the microalgal growth, which was noted in terms of chlorophyll and biomass accumulation. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed close relation between biomass and poly hydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation with organic carbon presence having a great impact. These results pave the way for sustainable PHA/PHB production using three microalgal species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEttlia 3aautotrophs 3abiodiesel 3abioethanol 3abiomass production 3abioplastics 3abiorefining 3abioremediation 3abutyrates 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3amicroalgae 3aorganic carbon 3apollution 3apolyhydroxybutyrate 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3asoups 3aurbanization 0aMicroalgae 0aPHB 0aLipid 0aProtein 0aANOVA 0aPrinciple component analysis1 aGhosh, Atreyee1 aNogueira, Regina1 aBala, Kiran0 tAlgal research.g2022 Mar., v. 62 p.102625-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2021.1026253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245005100165300001200216520121200228592002801440650001101468650002201479650001001501650003101511650001101542650002001553650001001573650000901583650001301592650002601605650001801631650002401649650001501673700002301688700002301711773012301734856004501857852000901902655001201911IND50065294020221119175454.0130419e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006529402DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2012001572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwab, Wilfried10aTransformation of terpenes into fine chemicals  ap. 3-8.  aThe chemical industry has flourished in the 20th century due to the massive supply of cheap crude oil. However, growing concerns about the dependence on imported oil and the awareness that the world's oil supplies are limited have prompted interest in exploring nature's richness of plant sources. Plants offer enormous potential as cost‐effective, unlimited, environmentally friendly production systems that make efficient use of light energy and supply raw materials for the production of fuels, bulk, and fine chemicals. Terpenes are one of the largest and most diverse classes of organic compounds produced by all plants. They are derived biosynthetically from isoprene units, which consist of five carbon atoms. Due to their high abundance they have attracted attention as a class of natural products that can be converted into novel and valuable compounds commercially important for the industrial production of fragrances, perfumes, flavors, and pharmaceuticals as well as useful synthetic intermediates and chiral building blocks. The review focuses on the use of terpenes available from renewable resources in the fine chemicals industry. Chemical and biotechnological approaches are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemical industry 3adrugs 3aenergy use and consumption 3aflavor 3afuel production 3aodors 3aoils 3aperfumes 3aproduction technology 3araw materials 3arenewable resources 3aterpenoids1 aFuchs, Christopher1 aHuang, Fong‐Chin0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2013 Jan., v. 115, no. 1 p.3-8dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.201200157  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002300166245010500189300001400294520187400308592002802182653001202210653002002222653001502242653002702257653002002284700002202304700001902326700001502345700002202360773010402382856011402486852000902600655001202609IND60129114720221119034525.0151124e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012911472DNAL7 a10.3375/0885-8608(2007)27[41:DNAAFR]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlocum, Matthew G.10aDecoupling Natural and Anthropogenic Fire Regimes: a Case Study in Everglades National Park, Florida  ap. 41-55.  aAnthropogenic fire regimes obscure natural fire regimes, reducing the ability to manage fire-frequented habitats ecologically. To address this problem, we attempted to decouple natural and anthropogenic fire regimes by comparing them to seasonal climatic patterns and landscape characteristics in Everglades National Park (1948––1999). Of the total area burned by lightning fires, 57%% resulted from ignitions seven days within onset of the wet season, 11%% from ignitions starting 7––21 days before onset, and 36%% from ignitions > 7 days after onset. In contrast, of the total area burned by incendiary fires, 89%% resulted from ignitions > 7 days before onset, and 40%% resulted from ignitions > 35 days before onset. Moreover, ~100%% of the total area burned by prescribed fires resulted from ignitions > 7 days after onset. Lightning fires occurred most frequently in wet seasonal savanna that had limited accessibility to humans; incendiary fires were most frequent in wet seasonal savanna that had ready accessibility to humans. In addition, 35%% of the total area burned by incendiary fires in areas of limited accessibility occurred when incendiary fires spread from readily accessible areas. We propose that, because incendiary fires occurred at the end of the dry season, they burned drier fuels and burned more intensely than lightning fires, which generally occurred following the first rains of the wet season. Incendiary fires thus should be more likely to burn lower elevation areas that normally hinder fire spread. Finally, by occurring later in the wet season, prescribed fires may have burned patchily and insufficiently intensely to achieve restoration goals. Decoupling anthropogenic and natural fire regimes using seasonal climate patterns and landscape characteristics leads us to propose strategies to guide fire management in the park.  aPublisher supplied data 0aclimate 0aincendiary fire 0alandscapes 0alightning fire regimes 0aprescribed fire1 aPlatt, William J.1 aBeckage, Brian1 aPanko, Bob1 aLushine, James B.0 tNatural areas journal.g2007 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.41-55dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F0885-8608%282007%2927%5B41%3ADNAAFR%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245016300163300001800326520186500344592002802209650002402237650002302261650003002284650001202314650002302326650001202349650001502361650002202376650002102398650001402419650002102433650001302454650001702467650002402484650001002508650001102518650001502529650001202544700001802556700002002574773009102594856004802685852000902733655001202742IND4474900520221119175316.0120701e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447490052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-012-0073-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yang-Ping10aNo evidence for evolutionarily decreased tolerance and increased fitness in invasive Chromolaena odorata: implications for invasiveness and biological control  ap. 1157-1166.  aTolerance, the degree to which plant fitness is affected by herbivory, is associated with invasiveness and biological control of introduced plant species. It is important to know the evolutionary changes in tolerance of invasive species after introduction in order to understand the mechanisms of biological invasions and assess the feasibility of biological control. While many studies have explored the evolutionary changes in resistance of invasive species, little has been done to address tolerance. We hypothesized that compared with plants from native populations, plants from invasive populations may increase growth and decrease tolerance to herbivory in response to enemy release in introduced ranges. To test this hypothesis, we compared the differences in growth and tolerance to simulated herbivory between plants from invasive and native populations of Chromolaena odorata, a noxious invader of the tropics and subtropics, at two nutrient levels. Surprisingly, flower number, total biomass (except at high nutrient), and relative increase in height were not significantly different between ranges. Also, plants from invasive populations did not decrease tolerance to herbivory at both nutrient levels. The invader from both ranges compensated fully in reproduction after 50Â % of total leaf area had been damaged, and achieved substantial regrowth after complete shoot damage. This strong tolerance to damage was associated with increased resource allocation to reproductive structures and with mobilization of storage reserves in roots. The innately strong tolerance may facilitate invasion success of C. odorata and decrease the efficacy of leaf-feeding biocontrol agents. Our study highlights the need for further research on biogeographical differences in tolerance and their role in the invasiveness of exotic plants and biological control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromolaena odorata 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abiomass 3acolonizing ability 3aflowers 3aherbivores 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aleaf area 3anutrient content 3aregrowth 3areproduction 3aresource allocation 3aroots 3ashoots 3asubtropics 3atropics1 aFeng, Yu-Long1 aBarclay, Gregor0 tPlant ecology.g2012 July, v. 213, no. 7 p.1157-1166dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-012-0073-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009600158300002000254520132500274592002801599650001401627650002401641650001201665650001301677650001301690650001101703650001601714650001601730650001601746650001601762650001801778700001801796700001701814700001501831773012401846856007401970852000902044655001202053IND60641545320221117231713.0190505e20170328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064154532DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00394c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Zhongming10aHigh-quality cadmium stannate annealed in N₂ atmosphere for low-cost thin film solar cell  ap. 18545-18552.  aRadio frequency magnetron sputtered cadmium stannate (Cd₂SnO₄) or cadmium tin oxide (CTO) films were annealed in a nitrogen (N₂) atmosphere. The resistivity of argon/oxygen (Ar/O₂) gas sputtered CTO films decreased drastically after high temperature annealing, and the lowest resistivity of 1.73 × 10⁻⁴ Ω cm was achieved. The Cd₂SnO₄ crystal phase of CTO films deposited in Ar/O₂ gas occurred after annealing at 600 °C to 635 °C, and the optical band gap increased obviously after annealing. When the deposition atmosphere was pure Ar, the as-deposited CTO resistivity was in the order of 10⁻⁴ Ω cm. The resistivity of thin films deposited in Ar gas could decline slightly after annealing. However, the resistivity of thick films deposited under Ar gas increased drastically after annealing. No Cd₂SnO₄ crystal phase of Ar gas sputtered CTO occurred after annealing. The visible region and near infrared spectrum transmittance of CTO films increased after annealing in a N₂ atmosphere. The resistivity of CTO films deposited in Ar/O₂ and after annealing in N₂ gas at 620 °C increased slightly after chlorine treatment. Furthermore, the resistivity of films deposited in Ar/O₂ and then annealed in N₂ gas at 620 °C decreased slightly after vacuum annealing at 600 °C for 5 min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aargon (noble gases) 3acadmium 3achlorine 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aradio waves 3asolar cells 3atemperature 3atin dioxide 3atransmittance1 aLiu, Xiangxin1 aZhang, Yufen1 aZhu, Ziyao0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 28, v. 7, no. 30 p.18545-18552dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00394c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01351naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008300171300001600254520029600270592002800566650001500594650001600609650002100625650001900646651001000665700001800675700002400693700002200717700002000739700002400759773013600783856008500919852000901004655001201013IND60480426820221120172331.0160127e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048042682DNAL7 a10.1560/M5P1-CB91-DTRR-16T12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTornadore, Noemi,10aMorphological, karyological, and molecular analysis in Aster spp. (Asteraceae)  ap. 109-116.  aTwo species of the genus Aster L. from Nepal have been studied and compared with a common European species A. alpinus L.

Less than 25%% of the pre-Columbian bottomland hardwood forests remain in the southeastern United States. Because of the valuable ecological and hydrological functions performed by these forests, their conservation and restoration has been a high priority. Part of these restoration efforts has focused on developing tools that can be used for both assessments at the landscape level and policy implementation at the local level. The distribution of bottomland hardwood forests in the Cache and White River watersheds in eastern Arkansas were examined using existing GIS databases. Criteria were developed to select areas that should be conserved or augmented for wildlife habitat. Over 67%% of the study area was classified as agriculture, with bottomland hardwood forest the next largest habitat class. The thickness of a forest fragment was defined as the radius of the largest circle that can be inscribed in a fragment. Thickness was used in three ways. First, individual forest fragments were identified and selected based on ecological function using criteria we established. Second, individual fragments that were too small to support interior species, but large enough that if moderately augmented they could recover that function, were identified and selected. These augmentable fragments were further prioritized by adjacency to habitat that might be suitable for reforestation, namely agriculture. Third, watersheds were prioritized for conservation and augmentation based on the size and distributions of forest fragment thickness and area within each watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArkansas 0abottomland hardwood forest 0aconservation 0aGIS 0asynoptic assessment1 aBiagas, Janelda0 tNatural areas journal.g2007 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.72-82dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F0885-8608%282007%2927%5B72%3APBHFSF%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010400164300001600268520056200284592002800846650001200874650001300886650001500899650001300914650001600927650002000943650001100963650001200974650000900986650002500995700002101020700002301041773015101064856007701215852000901292655001201301IND60521111220221119035802.0160528e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052111122DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1957-12062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKallee, Ekkehard10aTrichloressigsäure-Aceton-Extraktion von Albuminen aus Seren und Antigen-Antikörper-Präzipitaten  ap. 777-783.  a1.

In this context, the aim of this work was to evaluate the presence, removal and environmental relevance of 22 selected pesticides in three different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), paying attention not only to their occurrence and elimination but also to the toxicity of each pesticide against three aquatic micro organisms (algae, daphnia and fish) through the calculation of the so-named Environmental Relevance of Pesticides from Wastewater treatment plants Index (ERPWI). For this purpose, an analytical method based on isotope dilution on-line solid phase extraction–liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (SPE–LC–MS/MS) was optimized, allowing the determination of the 22 target pesticides in wastewater with satisfactory sensitivity (limits of detection below 30ng/L), accuracy and precision. Concerning the results, total pesticide levels were in most instances below 1μg/L but removal in the WWTPs was variable and often poor, with concentrations in the effluent sometimes higher than in the corresponding influent. Possible explanations for these poor or negative removal rates are, among many others considered (e.g. sampling, sample preservation, method biases, atmospheric deposition), deconjugation of metabolites and/or transformation products of the pesticides, hydrolysis, and desorption from particulate matter during wastewater treatment. The most significant pesticides in terms of concentration and frequency of detection were diazinon and diuron. These two pesticides, followed by atrazine, simazine and malathion, were also the most relevant from the environmental point of view, according to the calculated ERPWI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3aatrazine 3aeffluents 3adetection limit 3amalathion 3asimazine 3awastewater treatment 3adiazinon 3ametabolites 3aparticulates 3adiuron 3aisotope dilution technique 3afish 3ahydrolysis 3aenvironmental impact 3amass spectrometry 3awastewater 3atoxicity 3adesorption 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDiazinonxanalysis 2aDiuronxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxstatistics & numerical data 2aPesticidesxanalysis 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aSpain 0aAlgae 0aLC–MS/MS 0aRisk assessment 0aWastewater treatment 0aWater analysis 0aPesticides1 aVillagrasa, Marta1 aLópez de Alda, Miren1 aCéspedes-Sánchez, Raquel1 aVentura, Francesc1 aBarceló, Damià,0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 458-460 p.466-476dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01007naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245004000164300001400204520022800218592002800446650001100474650001300485650001300498650000900511773013500520856007700655852000900732655001200741IND60521112120221119035804.0160528e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052111212DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1957-02042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiehr, Andrew D.10aStructure of Co(CO)4H and Fe(CO)4H2  ap. 95-96.  aBy use of symmetry arguments new structures are proposed for the controversial metal-carbonyl hydrides of iron and cobalt.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching is a major determinant for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation outcome. For patients lacking a fully HLA-matched donor, umbilical cord blood (UCB) units are alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells because UCB transplantation allows a less stringent HLA matching. However, selection of the optimal UCB units remains challenging. The current UCB donor selection strategies are based on both cell dose and HLA matching. This Review focuses on the immunogenetic factors that influence UCB donor selection and highlights the future perspectives in UCB donor search.  aPublisher supplied data 0acord blood transplantation 0adonor search 0aHLA 0aPIRCHE1 aSpierings, Eric0 tCytotherapy.g2015 June, v. 17 p.702-710dElsevier Inc.aInternational Society for Cellular Therapyx1465-32497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008900172300001600261520073900277592002801016650001601044650001101060650001201071650002001083650001601103650001301119650001101132650001901143650001201162650001001174651001001184653002101194653002101215653003401236653002301270653001901293700002601312700001601338773013601354856008401490852000901574655001201583IND50075157920221120072318.0150324e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515792DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2012.7439572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinesh Kumar, M.,10aCan India raise agricultural productivity while reducing groundwater and energy use?  ap. 557-573.  aThis paper provides empirical evidence that power tariff reform with pro rata pricing and higher unit rates for electricity not only would promote equity, efficiency and sustainability in groundwater use, but also would be socio-economically viable for small-holder farmers. It shows that the arguments of “high transaction cost” and “political infeasibility” used against metering are valid only in specific regional contexts and under increasingly outmoded power-pricing and agricultural-production regimes, if one considers the recent advancements in remote sensing and the facts that overexploited regions have a low density of wells and are mostly owned by farmers who constitute a small segment of the farming community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3agroundwater 3apolitics 3aprices 3aremote sensing 3atariffs 3awells 3aIndia 0apro rata pricing 0aenergy rationing 0agroundwater-electricity nexus 0awater productivity 0aprepaid meters1 aScott, Christopher A.1 aSingh, O.P.0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 29, no. 4 p.557-573dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2012.7439573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007700154300002000231520088400251592002801135650002401163650001101187650001501198650001201213650002201225650001401247700001901261700001501280700001501295700001701310700002001327773014401347856007401491852000901565655001201574IND60670793420221119104552.0191002e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067079342DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta02075h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying10aLithium–tellurium batteries based on tellurium/porous carbon composite  ap. 12201-12207.  aFor the first time, lithiation/delithiation behavior of tellurium at room temperature was investigated using tellurium/porous carbon (Te/C) composite electrodes. The Te/C composite is synthesized by the infusion of liquid tellurium into a porous carbon host at the high temperature of 600 °C under vacuum. Owing to the physical confinement of Te by porous carbon matrix, the Te/C electrode is capable of delivering a reversible volumetric capacity as high as 1400 mAh cm⁻³ (224 mAh g⁻¹) at 312 mA cm⁻³ (50 mA g⁻¹) current and maintains 87% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. Even when the current increases to 12480 mA cm⁻³ (2000 mA g⁻¹), the Te/C electrode can still provide a volumetric capacity of 500 mAh cm⁻³. The high volumetric capacity, long cycle life and good rate capability make Te/C composite a promising electrode for Li-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbon 3aelectrodes 3aliquids 3alithium batteries 3atellurium1 aWang, Jiangwei1 aXu, Yunhua1 aZhu, Yujie1 aBigio, David1 aWang, Chunsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 15, v. 2, no. 31 p.12201-12207dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02075h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01513naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007800168300001600246520065600262592002800918653002500946653002100971653001500992653001401007700001901021700001501040773007701055856008201132852000901214655001201223IND60554337820221120193751.0161024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055433782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcyt.2015.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCany, Jeannette10aUmbilical cord blood–derived cellular products for cancer immunotherapy  ap. 739-748.  aAlthough the vast majority of experience with umbilical cord blood (CB) centers on hematopoietic reconstitution, a recent surge in the knowledge of CB cell subpopulations as well as advances in ex vivo culture technology have expanded the potential of this rich resource.

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 303-311.  aThe clover root weevil, Sitona lepidus Gyll. is a pest of clovers (Trifolium spp.), particularly white clover (T. repens). Larva feeding severely impairs the capacity of white clover to fix atmospheric nitrogen, by attacking the nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Development of the egg stage was studied at six different constant temperatures ranging from 9 to 30Â°C to improve the basis for phenological forecasts. Development occurred over the entire range of temperatures, although hatching percentage at 30Â°C was only 24.4% compared to 90.1% at 28.5Â°C. Developmental time decreased with increase in temperature from 9 to 28.5Â°C but increased markedly at 30Â°C. At 28.5Â°C, the embryo development period was the shortest (10.35Â days); whereas at 9Â°C, this parameter was the longest (55.08Â days). Using linear regression, the lower threshold temperature was calculated 4.38Â°C and the thermal constant was 236.45 degree-days. The relationship between constant temperature and developmental rate was evaluated using nine models. The suitability of the models was evaluated based on eight indicators (R 2, RSS, R adj 2 , AIC, BIC, AICC, W j , and Z i ). Of the nonlinear models, the Logan-6, Sharpe and DeMichele, and Lactin models were the most accurate at calculating t opt of 27, 27.50, and 28Â°C, respectively. The results suggest that of the three models (Lactin, Briere, and Hilbert and Logan), that estimated critical temperatures, (t min, t opt, and t max), Lactin gave the most suitable fit of data. This response of S. lepidus to temperature can be used for developing phonological models to predict the timing of egg hatch which are important for management programs targeting the weevil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitona lepidus 3aTrifolium repens 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aheat sums 3alinear models 3anitrogen 3anonlinear models 3aroot nodules 3atemperature1 aMcneill, Mark R.0 tJournal of pest science.g2011 Sept., v. 84, no. 3 p.303-311dSpringer-Verlagx1612-47587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-011-0360-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016500160300001600325520119600341592002801537650001401565650001701579650001301596650002001609650001101629650003301640700002101673700001901694700002001713773009501733856007301828852000901901655001201910IND60082236320221119110932.0141017e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008223632DNAL7 a10.1111/ens.120752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŌsawa, Takeshi,10aNew approach for evaluating habitat stability using scarce records for both historical and contemporary specimens: a case study using Carabidae specimen records  ap. 425-431.  aNatural history collections, such as specimen records, are crucial resources for conservation and habitat management. However, these data are usually scarce compared to physical environmental data (e.g., digital terrain maps) that we often have little species data and a lot of physical environmental data with which to evaluate habitats. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating habitat stability using scarce natural history records and abundant physical environmental data. We used both historical and contemporary specimen records of carabid beetles (areas in which records of the same species were recorded during both periods) and evaluated the attributes of these areas using terrain characteristics. We found two common terrain characteristics among the occupied areas: large total river length and low variation in elevation. These terrain characteristics suggest that habitats of carabid species have been conserved in disturbed and wet environments for a long time. These results are consistent with the ecological characteristics of carabid beetles. Our study shows that scarce natural history collections, combined with ingenuity, can be useful for evaluating habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3acase studies 3ahabitats 3anatural history 3arivers 3awet environmental conditions1 aWatanabe, Kyohei1 aIkeda, Hiroaki1 aYamamoto, Shori0 tEntomological science.g2014 Oct., v. 17, no. 4 p.425-431dBlackwell Pub.x1343-87867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.120753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04274naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245015200205300002100357506011700378506007600495520241000571592002802981506003703009650000903046650001603055650002803071650001403099650001803113650001203131650002203143650002803165650001003193650002503203650000903228650001503237651001203252653002103264653000903285653001703294653001103311653001503322700006503337700002103402700006803423773018503491856008303676852000903759655001203768IND60762453120221207095848.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076245312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jand.2022.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Harleen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6913-819310aRural and Urban Differences in Vegetable and Fruit Consumption Among Older Cancer Survivors in the Deep South: An Exploratory Cross-Sectional Study  ap. 1717-1724.e4.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCancer survivors, especially those who are older, experience increased comorbidity and risk for secondary cancers. A varied dietary pattern rich in vegetables and fruits (V&F) is recommended to improve health. However, V&F intake can differ by rural vs urban status. Our objective was to assess the differences in V&F consumption among older cancer survivors residing in urban- and rural-designated areas, and to explore whether differences exist according to sex, race, and cancer type. This was a cross-sectional secondary analysis. Screening data from the Harvest for Health trial were obtained from October 2016 to November 2019 on 731 Medicare-eligible cancer survivors across Alabama. V&F consumption was measured by 2 items from the National Cancer Institute’s dietary screener Eating at America’s Table. Rural and urban residence was coded at the ZIP-code level using the US Department of Agriculture’s Rural-Urban Commuting Area coding schema using 5 different classifications (A through E). Sex, race, and cancer type were dichotomized as male or female, non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black, and gastrointestinal or other cancers, respectively. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum and post-hoc tests were performed to detect differences in V&F consumption (α < .05). The study sample was largely female (66.2%) and non-Hispanic White (78.1%); mean age was 70 years and reported average V&F intake was 1.47 cups/d. V&F consumption of cancer survivors living in isolated, small, rural towns was roughly one-half that consumed by survivors living elsewhere; thus, statistically significant rural–urban differences were found in models that accounted specifically for this subgroup, that is, Rural-Urban Commuting Area categorizations A and E. V&F consumption also was significantly lower in non-Hispanic Black (1.32 ± 0.98 cups/d) than non-Hispanic White survivors (1.51 ± 1.10 cups/d) (P = .0456); however, no statistically significant differences were detected by sex and cancer type. Analyses that address the variability within rural-designated areas are important in future studies. Moreover, a greater understanding is needed of factors that adversely affect V&F consumption of those most vulnerable, that is, older, non-Hispanic Black cancer survivors, as well as those living in isolated, small, rural towns to best target future interventions. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02985411.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUSDA 3acomorbidity 3across-sectional studies 3adietetics 3aeating habits 3afemales 3afruit consumption 3agastrointestinal system 3amales 3anutrition assessment 3arisk 3avegetables 3aAlabama 0aCancer survivors 0aAged 0aRural health 0aFruits 0aVegetables1 aFernández, José R.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7509-66661 aLocher, Julie L.1 aDemark-Wahnefried, Wendy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5241-932X0 tJournal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.g2022 Sept., v. 122, no. 9 p.1717-1724.e4dElsevier Inc.aAcademy of Nutrition and DieteticswJournal:J000001156x2212-26727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2022.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000008004100013016002300054024003200077040001800109100001900127245015300146300001600299500001500315520131400330592002801644650002101672650001601693650002601709650001701735650001601752650004301768650001101811650001901822650001701841650001101858653002901869700002101898773009101919856004502010852000902055655001202064IND500644290130329e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006442902DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2012001002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Cui‐Lan10aIn vitro fermentation of a retrograded maize starch by healthy adult fecal extract and impacts of exogenous microorganisms on three acids production  ap. 330-337.  a2019-12-06  aThe impacts of 14 exogenous microorganisms on simulated colonic fermentation and acid production of a retrograded maize starch were studied in the present work. A commericial high‐amylose maize starch (Hylon VII) was treated by three autoclaving–cooling cycles. The obtained retrograded starch contained RS of 29.4% w/w, was used as RS‐containing substrate for an in vitro fermentation by healthy adult fecal extract at 40 g/L and 37°C for 36 h. GC analysis showed that acetic, propionic and butyric acid generated in the fermentation system were about 8.8, 2.7, and 3.2 mM, respectively. Fermented jointly by the fecal extract and one of nine prepared microorganism cultures, the retrograded starch yielded more acetic acid ranging from 16.0 to 20.3 mM. Addition of one culture from Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Bifidobacterium infantis, or B. longum other than other strains resulted in propionic and butyric acid production near to 9 mM in the fermentation system, showing favorable impacts of the four strains on two acids production. It is suggested that some microorganisms can mediate acid production during conlonic fermentation of RS or RS‐containing products, and the interaction between prebiotics and probiotics in colon‐targeted functional foods should be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3afunctional foods 3aacetic acid 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3afermentation 3acorn starch 3aBifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 3astarch 3amicroorganisms 3abutyric acid 3aadults 0aBifidobacterium infantis1 aZhao, Xin‐Huai0 tStärke =.g2013 Mar., v. 65, no. 3‐4 p.330-337dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201200100  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245005200204300001800256506007600274520140800350592002801758506003701786650000801823650003101831650001101862650001301873650001201886650001501898650001401913700002301927700002201950773017301972856008302145852000902228655001202237IND4481683220221207105309.0120502e20120221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448168322DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11148591092doi7 aPMC32869382pmcid7 a223083762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiore, Julie L.10aEntropic origin of Mg2+-facilitated RNA folding  ap. 2902-2907.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMg2+ is essential for the proper folding and function of RNA, though the effect of Mg2+ concentration on the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy landscapes of RNA folding is unknown. This work exploits temperature-controlled single-molecule FRET methods to address the thermodynamics of RNA folding pathways by probing the intramolecular docking/undocking kinetics of the ubiquitous GAAA tetraloop–receptor tertiary interaction as a function of [Mg2+]. These measurements yield the barrier and standard state enthalpies, entropies, and free energies for an RNA tertiary transition, in particular, revealing the thermodynamic origin of [Mg2+]-facilitated folding. Surprisingly, these studies reveal that increasing [Mg2+] promotes tetraloop–receptor interaction by reducing the entropic barrier (Formula ) and the overall entropic penalty (Formula ) for docking, with essentially negligible effects on both the activation enthalpy (Formula ) and overall exothermicity (Formula ). These observations contrast with the conventional notion that increasing [Mg2+] facilitates folding by minimizing electrostatic repulsion of opposing RNA helices, which would incorrectly predict a decrease in Formula and Formula with [Mg2+]. Instead we propose that higher [Mg2+] can aid RNA folding by decreasing the entropic penalty of counterion uptake and by reducing disorder of the unfolded conformational ensemble.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3alandscapes 3amagnesium1 aHolmstrom, Erik D.1 aNesbitt, David J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Feb. 21, v. 109, no. 8 p.2902-2907dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11148591093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002700167245009600194300001600290520164700306592002801953653001301981653003801994653001802032653000902050653002202059653002202081700002102103700002202124700002002146773010602166856011502272852000902387655001202396IND60129115820221119034940.0151124e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012911582DNAL7 a10.3375/0885-8608(2007)27[161:DAUPRT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKillmaster, Charles H.10aDeer and Understory Plant Responses to a Large-Scale Herd Reduction on a Georgia State Park  ap. 161-168.  aWhen white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) become overabundant within a park they disrupt park operations, reduce deer health, and threaten natural vegetative communities. At a heavily visited state park in Georgia, where deer were protected from hunting for >15 years, we used spotlight and camera surveys to estimate deer population density before and after a major herd reduction. We measured deer health and abundance of understory plants before and after the reduction. We compared these results to similar data from an adjacent wildlife management area (WMA) where deer were managed for 47 years by hunting. Only one year after removing 172 deer, plant species at the park increased 31%% in spite of stable environmental conditions. In addition, before reduction, differences (P == 0.006) in number of plant species at the park versus the WMA became similar (P>0.05) after the removal. Live body weights of adult females and fawns (P<0.0001), physical condition scores (P == 0.0003) of tagged deer, and reproductive status of females (P<0.0001) improved. Although live body weights of deer killed at the park before the reduction were lower (P ≤≤0.05) than those killed on the adjacent WMA, by the next year, weights of adult females and fawns were similar (P>0.05) at both properties. Although our study demonstrated the viability of lethal removal of deer from a park and measured post-reduction benefits (i.e., density-dependant responses by plants and deer) of that removal, increased reproduction by the residual deer population highlighted the need for continued deer management, including subsequent removals.  aPublisher supplied data 0abrowsing 0aOdocoileus virginianus Zimmermann 0aoverabundance 0apark 0aunderstory plants 0awhite-tailed deer1 aOsborn, David A.1 aWarren, Robert J.1 aMiller, Karl V.0 tNatural areas journal.g2007 Apr., v. 27, no. 2 p.161-168dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F0885-8608%282007%2927%5B161%3ADAUPRT%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007300155300002000228520088300248592002801131650001101159650001301170650002201183650002201205650001701227650001901244650002501263650001801288650001201306650002201318650001501340700001501355700001301370700001401383700001601397700002001413773014401433856007401577852000901651655001201660IND60670793820221119104718.0191002e20140722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067079382DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta02097a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Guiyin10aHigh performance lithium–sulfur batteries: advances and challenges  ap. 12662-12676.  aThe development of high-energy batteries is highly attractive for powering advanced communication equipment and electric vehicles in future. Lithium–sulfur batteries have attracted much attention in recent years due to their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity and energy density. However, lithium–sulfur batteries have not been commercialized because of their intrinsic shortcomings, including the insulation of the active cathode materials, the high solubility of lithium polysulfides in organic liquid electrolytes, and the lithium dendrite in the anode. In this feature article, recent research progress in cathode materials, electrolytes, anode materials, and others is reviewed and commented upon. Some perspectives and directions on future development of lithium–sulfur batteries are pointed out based on knowledge from previous studies and our experience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acommercialization 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3ainsulating materials 3aionic liquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3asolubility1 aDing, Bing1 aPan, Jin1 aNie, Ping1 aShen, Laifa1 aZhang, Xiaogang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 22, v. 2, no. 32 p.12662-12676dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02097a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245011900161300001600280506002800296520102300324592002801347506003701375650002701412650001101439650001101450650001301461650001401474650002101488650001301509650001701522650001301539653002701552653001601579653001301595653001701608653002101625700002001646773012601666856007801792852000901870655001201879IND60739645820221207052237.0101112s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073964582DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN0916149S2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmirnov, A.N.10aReproductive strategies of field Phytophthora infestans populations on potato and tomato in some regions of Russia  ap. 149-157.  aResource is Open Access  aThe occurrence of zoosporangia and oospores is analyzed for 88 field populations of Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary in Moscow region and other regions of Russia from 1997 to 2006. For estimation of zoosporangia and oospore frequencies in the populations, the indexes IZ (for zoosporangia) and IO (for oospores) are suggested. The combinations of these indexes enabled a reveal of 4 strategies for P. infestans reproduction, which were found in the field populations of the pathogen. These strategies were more numerous in P. infestans field populations on tomato than on potato (4 versus 2) in spite of the fact that potato populations in Moscow region strongly predominated. It was connected with rareness or absence of oospores in potato and their presence in tomato, especially in fruit of many populations. The knowledge about strategies of reproduction can be applied for verification of efficiency of new methods for crop protection against late blight, and for investigations of P. infestans populations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aRussia 3afruits 3aoospores 3apathogens 3aplant protection 3apotatoes 3areproduction 3atomatoes 0aPhytophthora infestans 0alate blight 0aoospores 0azoosporangia 0afield estimation1 aKuznjecov, S.A.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2009, v. 2009, no. 116 p.149-157dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN0916149S3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245005100165300001400216520117300230592002801403650001301431650002001444650001801464650001001482650001301492650001001505650002701515650001401542650001001556650002201566650001201588650001701600651002801617651001101645653002001656653001501676653002301691653001401714653001801728653001701746700002501763700001801788773013501806856007801941852000902019655001202028IND60124901420221117072155.0151029e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012490142DNAL7 a10.3161/068.038.02042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErritzoe, Johannes10aBird Casualties on European Roads — A Review  ap. 77-93.  aRoad traffic affects the natural environment in numerous ways. The most striking of these is the death of wild animals and birds as a result of collisions with moving vehicles. In this paper the available data on bird mortality on roads are reviewed. Estimates of annual mortality for some European countries (350 000 to 27 million birds), the monthly distribution of casualties, their distribution among sex and age classes, as well as the methods used in the study of this problem are presented. The species composition of birds killed in this way is compared for several countries. In western Europe sparrows and Blackbirds are the species that most frequently die on the roads, but in Central and Eastern Europe not only sparrows but also corvids and Barn Swallows make up a high proportion of the victims. Analysis of the monthly distribution of casualties in 10 species shows this to differ between countries, probably because of the geographic variation of certain aspects of their biology (migration, breeding etc.). Several factors affecting the frequency of casualties are discussed, and some suggestions for the prevention of bird casualties are also given.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvidae 3aHirundo rustica 3aage structure 3abirds 3abreeding 3adeath 3ageographical variation 3amortality 3aroads 3aspecies diversity 3atraffic 3awild animals 3aEastern European region 3aEurope 0aroad casualties 0aroad kills 0alearning abilities 0asex ratio 0aroad planning 0aconservation1 aMazgajski, Tomasz D.1 aRejt, Łukasz0 tActa ornithologica.g2003 Dec., v. 38, no. 2 p.77-93dMuseum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of Sciencesx0001-64547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161%2F068.038.02043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245017000168300002000338520092700358592002801285650001301313650001401326650001601340650001301356650002301369650002301392650001701415650002601432700002901458700002601487700002901513700002001542773012401562856007401686852000901760655001201769IND60641546120221118194858.0190505e20170316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064154612DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00413c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtíz-Palacios, Jesús10aSynthesis, characterization and optical properties of novel dendronized azo-dyes containing a fullerene C₆₀ unit and well-defined oligo(ethylene glycol) segments  ap. 16751-16762.  aHerein, we report the preparation and characterization of a novel series of dendronized azo-dyes containing a fullerene C₆₀ unit and well-defined oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers. The azobenzene units present in these dyes were substituted in the 4′-position with different functional groups (–H, –OCH₃, –C₄H₉, –CN and –NO₂). The optical properties of these compounds were studied by absorption spectroscopy as a function of the dipole moment of the azobenzene moieties. All fullerene C₆₀-azobenzene derivatives exhibited trans–cis photoisomerization and photoprotonation under irradiation with UV-light. The results were compared to those obtained with their precursor azo-dyes without fullerene C₆₀. It was found that the presence of the fullerene unit significantly quenches the photoisomerization yield, whereas the photoprotonation was not affected by the presence of this chromophore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3afullerene 3airradiation 3amoieties 3aoptical properties 3aphotoisomerization 3aspectroscopy 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZaragoza-Galán, Gerardo1 aAguilar-Ortíz, Edgar1 aRodríguez-Alba, Efraín1 aRivera, Ernesto0 tRSC advances.g2017 Mar. 16, v. 7, no. 27 p.16751-16762dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00413c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007300173300001600246520102800262592002801290650001501318650001901333650001301352650001201365650001701377650002101394650001701415650002801432653002701460653001701487653002101504653002901525653001801554653003801572773013601610856008401746852000901830655001201839IND50075158620221120072250.0150324e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515862DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2013.7819142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSusskind, Lawrence10aWater and democracy: new roles for civil society in water governance  ap. 666-677.  aIn most democratic countries, government officials make water-allocation decisions.

In many parts of the world, water users and stakeholders have additional opportunities to comment on such decisions before they are implemented. Under some circumstances, citizens can challenge water management decisions in court. This is not enough. More direct democracy, involving stakeholders before such decisions are made, can produce fairer and increasingly sustainable results.

In the present study N. tanajoae is investigated at the morphological and molecular levels and physiological attributes of N. tanajoae and N. floridana are compared. Morphological observations of N. tanajoae isolates generally correspond to N. floridana and to other mite pathogenic species of Neozygites. However, this fungus readily can be distinguished from N. floridana based on 18S rDNA sequences, host ranges, nutritional requirements for growth in vitro, tolerances to cold (4 C) and abilities to withstand specific cryopreservation techniques. N. tanajoae isolates from Brazil and Africa have identical 18S rDNA sequences but they presented 5.7 and 9.94% pairwise distance from N. floridana isolates. N. tanajoae proved to differ sufficiently from other mite-pathogenic fungi referred to as N. floridana to justify the description of a new species.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3ahost range 3aMononychellus tanajoa 3aNeozygites floridana 3abiological control agents 3aribosomal DNA 3amites 3aanimal pathogenic fungi 3amolecular systematics 3anucleotide sequences 3anew species 3afungal anatomy 3anew geographic records 3abiological control 3aBrazil 0abiological control 0aEntomophthorales 0aMononychellus tanajoa 0aNeozygites floridana 0aTetranychus urticae 0aZygomycetes1 aHajek, Ann E.1 aHumber, Richard A.0 tMycologia.g2004 Sept. 1, v. 96, no. 5 p.1002-1009dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/412913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15572536.2005.118329003Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03373naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012100170300001400291500001500305520163300320592002801953650001901981650002002000650000902020650002402029650001302053650002202066650001802088650002002106650002102126650000902147650001602156650002502172650002702197650001902224650001702243650001902260650002102279650002602300653001102326653001202337653002002349653002402369653001802393653002502411653002302436653001502459653002502474700002102499700002302520700002502543773012302568856008302691852000902774655001202783IND50064485320221119181350.0190318e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006448532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2013.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilera, Eduardo10aManaging soil carbon for climate change mitigation and adaptation in Mediterranean cropping systems: A meta-analysis  ap. 25-36.  a2019-12-06  aMediterranean croplands are seasonally dry agroecosystems with low soil organic carbon (SOC) content and high risk of land degradation and desertification. The increase in SOC is of special interest in these systems, as it can help to build resilience for climate change adaptation while contributing to mitigate global warming through the sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C). We compared SOC change and C sequestration under a number of recommended management practices (RMPs) with neighboring conventional plots under Mediterranean climate (174 data sets from 79 references). The highest response in C sequestration was achieved by those practices applying largest amounts of C inputs (land treatment and organic amendments). Conservation tillage practices (no-tillage and reduced tillage) induced lower effect sizes but significantly promoted C sequestration, whereas no effect and negative net sequestration rates were observed for slurry applications and unfertilized treatments, respectively. Practices combining external organic amendments with cover crops or conservation tillage (combined management practices and organic management) showed very good performance in C sequestration. We studied separately the changes in SOC under organic management, with 80 data sets from 30 references. The results also suggest that the degree of intensification in C input rate is the main driver behind the relative C accumulation in organic treatments. Thus, highest net C sequestration rates were observed in most eco-intensive groups, such as “irrigated”, “horticulture” and controlled experiments (“plot scale”).  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3adesertification 3arisk 3asoil organic carbon 3aslurries 3aagricultural land 3ameta-analysis 3areduced tillage 3acropping systems 3asoil 3acover crops 3acarbon sequestration 3aconservation practices 3aglobal warming 3ahorticulture 3arisk reduction 3aland degradation 3aMediterranean climate 0acarbon 0aTillage 0aOrganic farming 0aSoil organic carbon 0aMediterranean 0aCarbon sequestration 0aOrganic amendments 0aadaptation 0aconservation tillage1 aLassaletta, Luis1 aGattinger, Andreas1 aGimeno, Benjamín S.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 168 p.25-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03943naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100002000163245009000183300001600273500002000289500000900309520283100318592002803149650002303177650001403200650001303214650001403227650002503241650002103266650001803287650001503305651001303320700002003333773012103353856009803474852000903572655001203581IND60665516320221119193147.0220623e198507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066551632DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1985.0011183X002500040001x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNienhuis, James10aEffects of Location and Plant Density on Yield and Architectural Traits in Dry Beans1  ap. 579-584.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aPlant architectural traits associated with yield have been suggested as indirect selection criteria for improving seed yield of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) but critical data from selection experiments are lacking. Six dry bean experimental lines of growth habits I, II and III, bred for one or more plant architectural traits, were therefore compared at three locations in Colombia with six other cultivars which were conventionally developed experimental lines of similar growth habits. At each location plant densities of 5, 13, 22, and 30 plants/m² were established. The objectives were to examine: a) whether lines bred for architectural traits outyielded cultivars and experimental lines bred conventionally, b) the effects of environment and plant density on architectural traits and seed yield, and c) the associations between architectural traits and yield. We did not find a genotype of any growth habit bred for specific architectural traits outyielding the commercial check cultivar. Indeterminate, prostrate type llI, and type II cultivars, in that order, were among the highest yielding regardless of environment and plant density. These also offer the best opportunity for the development of broadly adapted, high yielding cultivars of dry beans for monoculture. Locations, seasons within locations, and plant densities each affected yield and architectural traits. Significant interactions were observed between environment, growth habit, and plant density; and these factors affected yield and all architectural traits. Differences were greatest between determinate and indeterminate growth habits (type I vs. types II and III). For plant density the shape of the response curves for yield was parabolic whereas the shape for type I beans was asymptotic. Curvilinear (types I and II) and linear (type III) increases nodes/m² were observed as plant density increased. Branch and node number/plant decreased linearly with increasing plant density for genotypes of all three growth habits. Linear reductions in node number on the main stem were observed in indeterminate types II and III with increasing plant density, but internode length did not change. In contrast, the number of nodes on the main stem of determinate type I remained unchanged but internode length increased linearly as plant density increased. Nodes/m² and branches/plant were positively correlated with yield regardless of environment or plant density. In contrast, nodes/branch and internode length on the main stem were positively correlated with yield over the range of plant densities used, but showed variable correlation over environments. Therefore, development of bean plant ideotypes with enhanced expression of certain architectural traits can result in limited adaptation and reduced yield potential in some environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3adry beans 3agenotype 3aideotypes 3aindeterminate growth 3ainternode length 3aplant density 3aseed yield 3aColombia1 aSingh, Shree P.0 tCrop science.g1985 July, v. 25, no. 4 p.579-584dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1985.0011183X002500040001x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014400168300001600312520140900328592002801737650000901765650001601774650001101790650002001801650001801821650001601839650004301855650002101898650002901919650001201948650002101960650002701981700001902008700002102027700002402048700003002072700002402102700002002126773009302146856008102239852000902320655001202329IND60479297320221117182217.0160120e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047929732DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0190-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Clercq, Nikki10aOptimization and Validation of a Method Without Alkaline Clean-Up for Patulin Analysis on Apple Puree Agar Medium (APAM) and Apple Products  ap. 370-377.  aA sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-UV (HPLC-UV) method, based on the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) Official method 2000.02, was developed and validated for the high-throughput analysis of patulin in in vitro experiments on apple puree agar medium (APAM). The importance of repeating the ethyl acetate extraction step at liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was examined, as well as the extent of patulin degradation during the sodium carbonate clean-up. In addition to this alkaline clean-up, the efficiency of using an Oasis HLB or C₁₈ cartridge as solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up was compared. This resulted in a two-step ethyl acetate LLE, followed by an Oasis HLB SPE clean-up, without alkaline clean-up conditions. The method was fully validated for APAM, cloudy apple juice, and apple puree. Average patulin recoveries at levels of 100, 500, and 1000 μg kg⁻¹ of APAM varied between 95 and 113 % over 3 independent days, with an interday precision (RSDR) of 5 to 10 %. Recovery experiments carried out with the spiked apple juice (at 50 μg kg⁻¹) and apple puree (10 μg kg⁻¹) showed average recovery rates laying between 80–101 % (RSDR = 12 %) and 77–100 % (RSDR = 9 %), respectively. This method offered a detection limit of 3–4 μg kg⁻¹ and a quantification limit of 5–8 μg kg⁻¹ for APAM, apple juice, and puree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aapple juice 3aapples 3adetection limit 3aethyl acetate 3afruit puree 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3apatulin 3asodium carbonate 3asolid phase extraction1 aVan Pamel, Els1 aVan Coillie, Els1 aVlaemynck, Geertrui1 aDevlieghere, F.q(Frank),1 aDe Meulenaer, Bruno1 aDaeseleire, Els0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.370-377dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0190-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007000170300001600240520110500256592002801361650001201389650002601401650001401427650001501441650001301456650000901469650002001478650002001498651001101518653001701529653002301546653002301569653003401592653003701626700002601663773013601689856005101825852000901876655001201885IND50075154320221120072219.0140410e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007515432DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2012.7138482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Giuseppe10aManaging drought risk in water supply systems in Europe: a review  ap. 272-289.  aThe frequent occurrence of drought and the increasing severity of its impacts make the traditional emergency approach inadequate and call for a risk-management approach, particularly in order to reduce water shortages in water supply systems.

The review focuses on: 1. the drought indices to be used for an effective monitoring and early warning system; 2. the methods for assessing the risk of water shortage due to drought; and 3. the measures for reducing societal vulnerability to droughts and mitigating their impacts. Better coordination of drought-preparedness planning tasks, adaptive operation of water supply systems to prevent severe shortages, and more extensive use of early drought warning are suggested.

Merr]. Soybean cultivars show variability in susceptibility, but no complete resistance to the disease has been reported and little information on the genetics of resistance is available. The objective of this study was to identify putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with Sclerotinia stem rot resistance in soybean. Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from five populations were developed by crossing Williams 82, a susceptible cultivar, with five cultivars exhibiting partial resistance: Corsoy 79, Dassel, DSR173, S19-90, and Vinton 81. The F₂ to F₅ generations were advanced by single seed descent. Parental polymorphism was tested with 507 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers from the integrated linkage map of soybean, and primers were selected for progeny screening in the five populations on the basis of polymorphism and distribution in the genome. Five hundred RILs, consisting of 100 F₅:₆ lines from each population, were evaluated for resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum isolate 143 by a detached leaf method in the laboratory to measure lesion area on leaves inoculated with mycelium plugs. Single degree-of-freedom contrasts in PROC MIXED and interval analysis were used to detect putative QTLs. Twenty-eight putative QTLs for resistance to Sclerotinia stem rot of soybeans were identified on 15 different linkage groups in five RIL populations by single degree-of-freedom contrasts. Alleles involved in reduction of lesion size came from both the resistant and susceptible parents, and transgressive segregates were identified in two populations. The amount of phenotypic variation explained by individual QTLs ranged from 4 to 10%. Seven QTLs on seven different linkage groups were identified in multiple populations with some QTL regions corresponding with mapped resistance genes and resistance gene analogs. The results suggest that several genes control resistance to Sclerotinia stem rot and that markers could facilitate an initial screen of segregating breeding populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3alinkage groups 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amycelium 3aparents 3aphenotypic variation 3aprogeny 3aquantitative trait loci 3aresistance genes 3ascreening 3asoybeans 3astem rot1 aGraef, George L.1 aSpecht, James E.1 aSteadman, James R.1 aEskridge, Kent M.0 tCrop science.g2001 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.180-188dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2001.411180x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015700162300001600319520123000335592002801565650001501593650001501608650001301623650002501636650002201661650001301683650001301696650001901709650001401728650001301742650003801755650001401793650002101807650003201828650001301860650001401873650002701887650001401914650000901928700001501937700002001952773009301972856008102065852000902146655001202155IND60479297420221117182235.0160120e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047929742DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0203-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jinxin10aPreparation of Artificial Antigen and Development of Indirect Competitive ELISA Based on Chicken IgY for the Detection of Acid Orange II in Food Samples  ap. 378-384.  aTo evaluate the feasibility of specific egg yolk antibodies (IgY) technology for the detection of hazardous chemical residues in foodstuffs, IgY were generated to detect acid orange II (AO2) residues. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was made to bind with AO2 by succinic anhydride (SA), and the conjugate was used to immunize the laying chickens. PEG-6000 precipitation was used to extract IgY antibodies. The titer of anti-AO2 IgY attained the peak (1:12,800) after fifth booster immunization. Checkerboard titration showed that 1:640 dilution of anti-AO2 IgY could approximately give an optical density (OD) 1.0 at 5 μg/mL AO2-OVA coating concentration. The anti-AO2 IgY based indirect competitive ELISA (ic-ELISA) showed that the IC₅₀ value of anti-AO2 IgY was 10.72 μg/mL and regression curve equation was y =−24.41 × +75.11 (R ² = 0.946). The ic-ELISA showed less cross-reactivity in range between 0.09 and 21.07 %. Recoveries from dried bean curd, sausage, and chilli powder samples were from 78.80 to 152.90 %, with relative standard deviation lower than 19.13 %. The study suggests that generated anti-AO2 IgY antibodies could be used in routine screening analysis of AO2 residues in food samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abovine serum albumin 3achemical residues 3achickens 3acoatings 3across reaction 3adry beans 3aegg yolk 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequations 3aimmunoglobulin Y 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3asausages 3ascreening 3asecondary immunization 3atitration 3atofu1 aWang, Yuan1 aZhang, Xiaoying0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Feb., v. 9, no. 2 p.378-384dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0203-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010600159300002000265520073000285592002801015650002301043650002201066650001401088650002301102650002201125650002201147650002201169650001801191650001301209650001101222650001301233700001701246700001601263700001701279773012401296856007401420852000901494655001201503IND60641543020221118194901.0190505e20170228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064154302DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00319f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Hongchuan10aSelective water-based oxychlorination of phenol with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by manganous sulfate  ap. 13467-13472.  aAn efficient method for the selective oxychlorination of phenol to 2,4-dichlorophenol catalyzed by manganous(ii) sulfate is developed using hydrogen chloride as a chlorinating source, hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant and water as a solvent. The catalyst has high activity and selectivity under mild conditions. The products are automatically isolated from aqueous solution, which also contains the catalyst at the end of the reaction, and hence product separation and catalyst recycling are both simple in this system. The performance of manganous(ii) sulfate with the oxidative chlorinating system HCl/H₂O₂ indicates that this is a promising synthetic method for the manufacture of various 2,4-dichlorophenol derivatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amanganese sulfate 3amanufacturing 3aoxidants 3aphenol 3asolvents1 aYang, Shilei1 aAn, Baigang1 aAn, Zengjian0 tRSC advances.g2017 Feb. 28, v. 7, no. 22 p.13467-13472dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00319f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007800164300002000242520155800262592002801820650002201848650003701870650001701907650000801924650001201932650001101944650001801955650001401973650001301987650002602000650003402026650002102060650001702081650002202098650001502120650001902135650001302154650003202167650000902199650001302208650001302221650000702234650001402241650001802255650001602273650003702289700002202326773014402348856007402492852000902566655001202575IND60670790820221119150611.0191002e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067079082DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta02010c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfsahi, Foroughazam10aNon-precious electrocatalysts synthesized from metal–organic frameworks  ap. 12270-12279.  aProton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered as clean and efficient energy conversion devices with great potential to replace currently used internal combustion engines (ICEs) in the near future. Developing high-performance and less expensive non-precious metal electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode side is crucial for widespread application of PEMFCs. Herein an Fe-containing metal–organic framework (MOF) was employed as the sole precursor for preparing a cathode electrocatalyst. The Fe-MOF was synthesized and subsequently subjected to thermolysis under a non-reactive gas atmosphere followed by acid leaching and heat treatment under NH₃ at different temperatures between 700 and 1000 °C. Upon pyrolysis, iron–nitrogen containing carbon active sites (Fe/N/C) were formed in parallel with development of an electronically conductive carbon medium produced through pyrolytic carbonization of the organic component of the MOF material. The prepared electrocatalysts were characterized by XRD, N₂ physisorption, TEM and XPS. In a H₂SO₄ (pH = 1) electrolyte, the ORR onset potential of 0.915 V, and the half-wave potential of 0.811 V are achieved using the most promising electrocatalyst (C700/950). The membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) made of these electrocatalysts were also tested as a cathode in a H₂/air single fuel cell. The most promising electrocatalyst (C700/950) demonstrated an open circuit voltage of 0.945 V and a maximum power density of 0.302 W cm⁻² reached at 0.391 V.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aair 3aammonia 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acoordination polymers 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy conversion 3afuel cells 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3ainternal combustion engines 3airon 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3apH 3apyrolysis 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKaliaguine, Serge0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 July 15, v. 2, no. 31 p.12270-12279dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta02010c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001400148245019000162300001600352520180600368592002802174650001302202650000902215650001802224650001302242650002102255650002102276650001902297650001002316650002302326650000902349700001502358700001402373700001402387700001502401700001502416700001302431700001502444773009302459856008402552852000902636655001202645IND4480441120221120044607.0141112e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448044112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2012.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aInfluences of dietary nitrogen and non-fiber carbohydrate levels on apparent digestibility, rumen fermentation and nitrogen utilization in growing yaks fed low quality forage based-diet  ap. 139-147.  aThe effects of dietary N and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) levels on nutrient digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and nitrogen utilization were investigated in growing yaks. Four diets (N content: 1.43%, 1.97%, 2.45% and 2.90% of DM basis; ratio of dietary NFC and RDP: 5.9, 3.2, 2.2 and 1.6) were offered to four yaks in a 4Ã4 Latin square design. Dietary N and NFC did not affect the gastrointestinal tract digestibility of DM, organic matter (OM), NFC, NDF, or ADF (P>0.05). Ruminal pH value, molar proportion of butyrate, and ratio of acetate to propionate were not affected by the diets (P>0.05); whereas, molar proportions of acetate, propionate, iso-butyrate, iso-valerate, valerate, and total VFA concentration in rumen fluid increased linearly (P<0.01) with increase in dietary N and decrease in dietary NFC. Except for ruminal NHâ-N and soluble protein N, free amino acid-N and peptide-N maintained constantly within the sampling time (from 0 to 8h of post feeding; P>0.05). The increment of N intake linearly increased the N retention (P=0.003), but no difference (P>0.05) was observed in the ratio of N retention to the gastrointestinal trace absorbed N after dietary N reached to 2.45% of DM. Microbial N supply had linear and quadric (P<0.001) responses to the dietary N, and the highest microbial N synthesis efficiency was observed when the yaks were fed with 1.97% N diet in which ratio of NFC to RDP was 3.2, and dietary NFC and RDP were 20.2% and 6.7% of DM, respectively. Total purine derivatives excretion and microbial purine N:total N had a quadric (P<0.05) response to the dietary N. Results of the current experiment suggest that maximizing N utilization and microbial efficiency were obtained when the yaks were fed a diet with an optimal dietary ratio of NFC to RDP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3adiet 3adigestibility 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3arumen 3arumen fermentation 3ayaks1 aZhou, J.W.1 aGuo, X.S.1 aCui, G.X.1 aDing, L.M.1 aWang, H.C.1 aLi, L.W.1 aLong, R.J.0 tLivestock science.g2012 Aug., v. 147, no. 1-3 p.139-147dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01895naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011100160300001500271520100400286592002801290650001601318650001301334650001401347650001601361700001801377773013601395856007701531852000901608655001201617IND60521097420221117201005.0160528e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052109742DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1956-02082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarm, Walter10aZur Deutung von Maxima und Sättigungs-Effekten bei Dosis-Effekt-Kurven für strahleninduzierte Mutationen  ap. 89-105.  aThe dose-effect curves for radiation- (especially ultraviolet-) induced mutations sometimes show saturation effects or maxima at the higher dose range. These phenomena either could be typical for the radiation induced mutation process and consequently contributing to its analysis, or could be caused by mere secondary effects. The following possible interpretations are given and are discussed by aid of mathematical methods: (1) Higher probability to be inactivated for the mutating individuals than for normal ones, (2) non-manifestation of the mutated phenotype as the result of interference with other mutations, (3) radiation induced formation and (at higher doses) destruction of mutagenic substances within the cell, (4) inhomogenity of the population with respect to radiation sensitivity and/or mutability. — Some experimental data described in the literature are proved in account of their compatibility with such interpretations.

This SDG6 aims to provide adequate improved sanitation facilities to over 2.3 billion people around the world who have no or limited access to sanitation, wherein more than two-thirds of these un-served people live in rural areas. One of the strategies for addressing this global issue is through emerging sustainable sanitation technologies such as the Eco-Toilet System (ETS), which uses small amounts of water or is even waterless and recovers nutrients from human waste thereby promoting water-energy conservation, improved sanitation and supplement nutrients essential to plant growth. Social acceptance, however, remains a key barrier in deploying the ETS. A social perception study on the use of the ETS was conducted in a rural community in Mulanay, Philippines. The researchers analyzed the proposed combined technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior (C-TAM-TPB) using multiple linear regression and the Mann-Whitney U-test to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes of a rural community towards the use of the ETS. The results showed that more than 50% of the respondents are aware of the nutrient value of human excreta and believe that it is usable as fertilizer; however, less than 25% prefer to utilize it for food production. Results also indicate that the behavior of the users is driven by their attitude (β = 0.420, p-value < 0.010). Moreover, the Mann-Whitney U-test results revealed that people who are knowledgeable of the nutrient value of human excreta and are willing to collect them have more positive attitude towards the ETS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3adeath 3aexcreta 3afertilizers 3afood production 3ahumans 3amodels 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aplant growth 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3arural communities 3asanitation 3asustainable development 3aPhilippines1 aAlvin Malenab, Roy1 aPausta, Carla  Mae1 aBeltran, Arnel1 aBelo, Lawrence1 aTanhueco, Renan  Ma.1 aEra, Marlon1 aEusebio, Ramon  Christian1 aPromentilla, Michael  Angelo1 aOrbecido, Aileen0 tSustainability.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100205213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015200160300002000312520103000332592002801362650002101390650001301411650001701424650001601441650001801457650001501475650002101490650001201511650003101523650001901554650001801573650001601591650001401607650000701621650001301628650002301641700002401664700001801688700001301706700001801719700001701737700001301754700001601767773012401783856007501907852000901982655001201991IND60636111320221118032249.0190505e20170206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063611132DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra27332g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shanshan10aMultifunctional chitosan modified Gd₂O₃:Yb³⁺,Er³⁺@nSiO₂@mSiO₂ core/shell nanoparticles for pH responsive drug delivery and bioimaging  ap. 10287-10294.  aGd₂O₃:Yb³⁺,Er³⁺@nSiO₂@mSiO₂ (Gd@mSi) core/shell structure nanospheres were synthesized through a sol–gel method.

The CS decorated nanocomposites showing good biocompatibility and red emission under 980 nm laser excitation can be potential candidates for bioimaging in vitro. FA modified nanospheres loaded with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) show higher cytotoxicity for HeLa cells in vitro compared with those nanoparticles with chitosan shells only and pure DOX.

It is expected that since a great number of goals are shared by both schemes this can help assure their fulfilment and prove useful in working towards the sustainable use of water, mindful of climate change considerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3ahydrologic cycle 3aissues and policy 3aMexico 0aclimate change 0ahydrological cycle 0aSpecial Programme on Climate Change 0avulnerability 0apublic policies 0aMexico1 aLópez-Pérez, Mario0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2013 June 1, v. 29, no. 2 p.172-183dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2012.721712  aDNAL 7aarticle
