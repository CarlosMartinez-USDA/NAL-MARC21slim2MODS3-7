Twenty-four lines, four for each one of the 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 cycles of recurrent selection, were evaluated for two consecutive years (2011 and 2012). The experimental lines were evaluated under conventional (CT) and no tillage (NT) systems. Grain yield and grain weight were determined and harvest index and grain number estimated. Flour protein content, sodium dodecyl sulphate sedimentation (IS-SDS) and lactic acid SRC (LASRC) were considered as end-use quality predictive tests. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to measure the relationships among yield, its components and grain quality parameters. Within the context of CT, flour protein content was negatively associated with all the agronomic variables. The IS-SDS has a negative association with the grain weight; meanwhile, LASRC associated positively with all the agronomic variables. When wheat was grown in NT, the relationship between IS-SDS and harvest index, like LASRC with all agronomic traits, was positive. Confining the discussion to the CT results, after ten cycles of recurrent selection the highest grain yield achieved was accompanied by a decrease in protein percentage. However, the decrease in the percentage of protein in more advanced selection cycles was offset by an improvement of its quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagronomic traits 3acorrelation 3aflour 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3alactic acid 3ano-tillage 3aprotein content 3arecurrent selection 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3awheat 0ayield 0agrain protein 0awheat breeding1 aSteffolani, M.E.1 aDi Rienzo, J.A.1 aLeón, A.E.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.146-153dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.44.2016.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245007000189300001400259520197800273592002802251650002902279650002102308650001102329650001602340650001902356650002202375650001202397650001602409650001102425650001002436650001802446650001502464650002102479650001202500650001402512650001402526650001402540650005202554650002202606650001302628650001202641650001602653650002702669650001102696700002602707700002002733700002902753700002802782700002202810773012302832856008102955852000903036655001203045IND60650559720221120150905.0190710e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065055972DNAL7 a291834112pmid7 a10.1017/S0022149X170011092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerath, H.M.L.P.B.13aAn ARV1 homologue from a filarial nematode is functional in yeast  ap. 12-20.  aThe transmembrane protein, ARV1, plays a key role in intracellular sterol homeostasis by controlling sterol distribution and cellular uptake. To date, only the ARV1s from yeast and humans have been characterized to some extent. In this study, the ARV1 of an animal filarial parasite, Setaria digitata (SdARV1), was characterized; its cDNA was 761 bp and encoded a protein of 217 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 25 kDa, containing a highly conserved ARV1 homology domain and three transmembrane domains in the bioinformatic analyses. Information required to cluster members belonging to a particular taxon has been revealed in phylogenetic analyses of ARV1 sequences derived from different organisms. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses indicated that SdARV1 was expressed in different developmental stages – microfilariae and adult male and female worms. Experiments carried out with a single copy of the SdARV1 under the control of the PMA-1 promoter in a temperature-sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain indicated full complementation of the mutant phenotype, with growth at a non-permissive temperature (37°C). Microscopic observations of cellular morphology with Gram staining revealed alteration of the shape from shrunken to oval, in mutant and complemented strains, respectively. Assessment of free sterol levels extracted from mutant yeast and complemented strains indicated that the level of sterol was significantly higher in the former compared to the latter, which had sterol levels similar to those of the wild type. Thus, the results of the current study suggest that SdARV1 is ubiquitously expressed in different developmental stages of S. digitata, and that it is a true functional homologue of mammalian and yeast ARV1s, which have crucial phylogenetic information that follows classical evolutionary trends. Finally, this is the first study to report the biological function of nematode ARV1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSetaria digitata 3aadults 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3acomplementary DNA 3afemales 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3amales 3amicrofilariae 3amicroscopy 3amolecular weight 3amutants 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3astaining 3asterols 3atemperature 3atransmembrane proteins 3ayeasts1 aGunawardene, Y.I.N.S.1 aPathiranage, M.1 aWickramasinghe, P.D.S.U.1 aWickramatunge, P.G.T.S.1 aDassanayake, R.S.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2019 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.12-20dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X170011093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245012900203300001800332500002000350520161300370592002801983650001802011650002002029650002202049650002402071650001502095650001602110650001502126650001102141650001102152650002502163650001502188650001102203650001502214650000902229650002602238650001702264650001002281650001702291651001102308700005802319700001702377700002002394700002102414700005602435773011502491856007502606852000902681655001202690IND60795216820221119081025.0221003e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079521682DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.208012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObour, Augustine K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0660-802010aSpring‐planted cover crop effects on weed suppression, crop yield, and net returns in no‐tillage dryland crop production  ap. 1981-1996.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntegrating cover crops (CCs) into dryland crop rotations could provide options for herbicide‐resistant (HR) weed control in no‐tillage (NT) systems. Field experiments investigated weed suppression potential of spring‐planted CCs and their effects on plant available water, crop yields, and net returns. The CC treatments were implemented during the fallow phase of NT wheat (Triticum aestivum L)–sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench)–fallow rotation at two locations: Brownell and Colby, over 3 yr in western Kansas. Treatments were oat–triticale (OT), oat–triticale–pea (Pisum sativum; OTP), spring pea, and fallow. Spring pea aboveground biomass was 3,290 kg ha⁻¹, whereas OT produced 5,640 kg ha⁻¹ and OTP produced 5,260 kg ha⁻¹. Regardless of location, weed biomass was reduced between 86 and 99% with CCs relative to weedy fallow. Cover crops reduced plant available water at winter wheat planting in three out of the six site‐years. Averaged across years, CCs reduced winter wheat yields by 18% compared with fallow at Brownell but not at Colby. Replacing fallow with spring pea increased gross revenue but generated negative net returns because of high cost of herbicide and pea seed. Net return with OT or OTP CCs were negative in four out of six site‐years when used strictly for weed suppression. However, net returns were mostly positive when OT ($110–876) or OTP (−$110–832) CCs were used as forage. Our results showed replacing fallow with spring‐planted CCs for weed suppression in dryland cropping system is profitable only when the CCs are used for forage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aSorghum bicolor 3aTriticum aestivum 3aaboveground biomass 3aarid lands 3acover crops 3acrop yield 3afallow 3aforage 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicides 3aincome 3ano-tillage 3apeas 3aplant available water 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awinter wheat 3aKansas1 aDille, Johanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3968-30861 aHolman, John1 aSimon, Logan M.1 aSancewich, Brian1 aKumar, Vipan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8301-58780 tCrop science.g2022 Sept., v. 62, no. 5 p.1981-1996dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.208013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001900123040001800142100001900160242011200179245009000291300001400381520197900395592002802374650001302402650001002415650001002425650000902435650001302444650001802457650001202475650001102487650001602498650001202514650001702526651001802543653002102561653002102582653001702603653001602620653002202636653001802658653000902676700002202685700002002707700002702727700002102754700002402775773011102799856007602910852000902986655001202995IND60555420420221118010215.0180522e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055542042DNAL7 a10.1642/AUK-16-63.12doi4 atauk-134-01-03  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudon, Jocelyn10aLa diète explique la présence de plumes de vol rouges chez le pic doré dans l'est de l'Amérique du Nord10aDiet explains red flight feathers in Yellow-shafted Flickers in eastern North America  ap. 22-33.  aYellow-shafted Flickers (Colaptes auratus auratus subspecies group of the Northern Flicker) occasionally have orange to red flight feathers in eastern North America far from the hybrid zone with the Red-shafted Flicker (C. a. cafer subspecies group). Blocks of feathers of anomalous color tend to show bilateral symmetry and may differ from one year to the next in the same bird. It has been suggested that hybridization with cafer must be the source of the red color and that selection for that color could explain the high incidence of red or orange shafts in eastern flickers in some localities. Complex, though largely unproven, physiological mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the variegated look. We evaluated a simpler, dietary explanation for the variation: that the pigment rhodoxanthin acquired exogenously at the time of feather molt comes to rest alongside the carotenoids normally present in these feathers. An exogenous source of rhodoxanthin exists in the berries of nonnative bush honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.) now naturalized in eastern North America and the American Midwest. We confirm the presence of rhodoxanthin and a probable metabolite, rather than the 4-keto-carotenoids found in the Red-shafted Flicker, in the red flight feathers of 2 Yellow-shafted Flickers from eastern North America. In these individuals, dietary rhodoxanthin appeared to interfere with the production of lutein, the main carotenoid in auratus. A fairly abrupt appearance of red color in earlier-molted primaries (usually p4 or p5) followed by its gradual fading in subsequent primaries in a large series of aberrantly colored flickers from eastern North America and the American Midwest supports a dietary explanation. We use data on the timing of replacement of primaries in the Northern Flicker at Manomet in Plymouth, eastern Massachusetts, to infer that these aberrantly colored Yellow-shafted Flickers on average acquired the unusual red pigment in early August.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLonicera 3abirds 3acolor 3adiet 3afeathers 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3alutein 3ametabolites 3amolting 3asmall fruits 3aMassachusetts 0aColaptes auratus 0aNorthern Flicker 0arhodoxanthin 0acarotenoids 0abush honeysuckles 0aLonicera spp. 0adiet1 aDriver, Robert J.1 aRice, Nathan H.1 aLloyd-Evans, Trevor L.1 aCraves, Julie A.1 aShustack, Daniel P.0 tAuk.g2017 Jan., v. 134, no. 1 p.22-33dThe American Ornithologists' UnionwJournal:19765x1938-42547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-16-63.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01825naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010600165300001200271520068100283592002800964650001500992650001301007650002201020650001901042650002801061650001601089650001301105650002101118650001101139650001801150650001901168650001001187651000901197700002901206773011401235856008101349852000901430655001201439IND60485960520221119120507.0160301e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048596052DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-5077-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolchin, Iman10aHydro-geochemical characteristics and groundwater quality assessment in Iranshahr plain aquifer, Iran  ap. 317.  aThe chemical analysis of 25 water wells in Iranshahr plain has been evaluated to determine the hydro-geochemical processes and ion concentration background in the region.

The most critical parameter for an injectable scaffold usage is its injectability, which can be related with rheological properties. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to increase knowledge about the critical parameters influencing injectability of biopolymers used for injectable scaffolds. Rheological and mechanical properties of a biopolymer blend in combination with injectability tests for a given design space controlled by the concentrations of both polymers and temperatures was made. Then those results were modeled to better understand the impact of parameters on injectability. The biopolymer blend chosen was Chitosan physically blended with Poly(ethylene glycol) where variations of both polymer concentrations and molecular weights were tested. Rheological and mechanical properties of all samples were determined, together with the injection force using a compression test at different injection conditions. All solutions were clear and transparent suggesting perfect miscibility. Rheological results were modeled using Ostwald-Waelle law and revealed a shear thinning pseudo-plastic solution at any composition and temperature, being chitosan concentration the most influencing variable.

The “nest failure hypothesis” posits that the distribution of the risk of nest predation across the nesting cycle (from egg laying to the fledging of young) determines the optimal degree of hatching asynchrony. If such risk is higher earlier in the nesting cycle, then much asynchrony (e.g., incubation on the first egg laid) is generally favored. Alternatively, if the risk of nest predation is concentrated later in the cycle, then greater synchrony (a late start to incubation) is favored. Adult mortality during incubation favors greater hatching synchrony. Existing models suggest that optimal hatching asynchrony should depend on the ratio of daily mortality risks prehatching and posthatching, or early and late in the nesting cycle. We show that these classic theoretical expectations depend critically on the assumption of a single nesting attempt per breeding season. Allowing for multiple nesting attempts per season leads to a large range of possible outcomes, often with large deviations from the expectations of single-attempt models. We show further that daily nest survival probabilities across the entire nesting cycle combine to influence optimal hatching asynchrony, not just a subset of values, or a ratio of values, as suggested by earlier theory. In addition, assumptions about the transitions in daily survival values between nesting stages (abrupt vs. gradual changes) are also important determinants of hatching asynchrony. Overall, however, a consideration of multiple nesting attempts does not alter the general expectation that high risk early in the nesting cycle favors hatching asynchrony, and that greater synchrony is favored by high risk later in the cycle or adult mortality during incubation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abirds 3abreeding season 3aeggs 3afledglings 3ahatching 3amodels 3amortality 3anesting 3anests 3aoviposition 3apredation 3arisk 0ahatching asynchrony 0amultiple-nesting 0anest failure hypothesis 0anest survival1 aLima, Steven L.0 tAuk.g2017 Jan., v. 134, no. 1 p.1-10dThe American Ornithologists' UnionwJournal:19765x1938-42547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-16-90.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245008000210520098000290592002801270650002501298650001901323650001701342773012701359856008501486852000901571655001201580IND60761230920221118123336.0220614e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076123092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2021.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDepietri, Yaella1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0204-354410aPlanning for urban green infrastructure: addressing tradeoffs and synergies  aUrban green infrastructure (UGI), designed and implemented to improve sustainability and reduce vulnerability to natural hazards, are increasingly advocated as win–win solutions. These have indeed proven to be desirable to complement grey infrastructure in urban areas. However, it is becoming apparent that the implementation of UGI also involves unique obstacles and unintended outcomes. In this process, tradeoffs and conflicts can originate because of competing planning goals and socio-economic objectives, as well as because of conflicting cultural values held by different stakeholders. Conversely, synergistic solutions can be sought, leading to a successful implementation of UGI. Based on a review of the recent literature, this paper identifies and categories the main types of tradeoffs and synergies that can originate from the design and implementation of UGI. Then it lists and analyses approaches that can help reduce those tradeoffs and maximize synergies.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreen infrastructure 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2022 Feb., v. 54 p.101148-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2021.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008700171300001600258520221000274592002802484650002302512650002602535650002102561650002602582650002302608650001602631650001202647650002402659650001602683650002102699650001802720650001002738651002902748653001602777653002702793653001602820653002902836700002902865773012402894856008503018852000903103655001203112IND60555420820221118010107.0161027e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055542082DNAL7 a10.3159/TORREY-D-15-00062.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCipollini, Kendra10aComparison of allelopathic effects of five invasive species on two native species1  ap. 427-436.  aRecent studies have found that allelopathy can be an important mechanism of plant invasions. Alliaria petiolata, Lonicera maackii, Ranunculus ficaria, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Microstegium vimineum are invasive species found in the Midwestern USA. We investigated the comparative direct and indirect allelopathic effects of these five species in a laboratory setting using leaf extracts in a germination experiment and a growth experiment. Results illustrate that the effect of each invasive species varied with target species and with life stage. Extracts of L. maackii and R. ficaria had the largest overall effects (∼50% reduction) on germination across both species, but effects of extracts varied by target species. Extracts of A. petiolata and C. orbiculatus had a greater effect on germination of E. hystrix than on C. fasciculata. Extracts of L. maackii, M. vimenum, and R. ficaria had larger inhibitory germination effects on C. fasciculata than on E. hystrix. For growth of E. hystrix after 8 wk, C. orbiculatus and L. maackii extracts had the largest (>80%) reduction of biomass, followed by treatment with extracts of R. ficaria (∼ 20% reduction). Treatment with L. maackii and C. orbiculatus extracts reduced height, with extracts of L. maackii having greater effects (60% versus 40% reduction, respectively). Plants treated with L. maackii extracts allocated significantly less biomass to roots. We also found evidence of indirect impacts. Mycorrhizal inoculation overall was most negatively affected by treatment with L. maackii extracts (∼70% reduction), even at low concentrations, and least by treatment with C. orbiculatus, with intermediate effects of A. petiolata, M. vimineum, and R. ficaria. Overall, L. maackii had the strongest effects, followed closely by C. orbiculatus, which was then followed in turn by R. ficaria. These results provide further support for the allelopathic potential of L. maackii and add to the growing body of evidence on the allelopathic potential of R. ficaria and C. orbiculatus. Effects of A. petiolata and M. vimineum were less strong than in other studies, suggesting the importance of variation between populations and in experimental venue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlliaria petiolata 3aCelastrus orbiculatus 3aLonicera maackii 3aMicrostegium vimineum 3aRanunculus ficaria 3aallelopathy 3abiomass 3aecological invasion 3agermination 3ainvasive species 3aleaf extracts 3aroots 3aMidwestern United States 0aallelopathy 0agermination inhibition 0amycorrhizae 0anovel weapons hypothesis1 aGreenawalt Bohrer, Megan0 tjournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2016 Oct., v. 143, no. 4 p.427-436dTorrey Botanical Societyx1095-56747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159%2FTORREY-D-15-00062.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01470naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001700168245004100185300001600226500000900242520063100251592002800882650001800910700001900928700002900947773012100976852000901097856009801106655001201204991589345720742620221116142905.0191122e197107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7191719562DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1971.0011183X001100040043x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuramoto, H.10aCold Tolerance in a Hexaploid Cotton  ap. 589-591.  aepub  aPlants of a recently introduced strain of hexaploid cotton, 6X-3, produced up to six true leaves after 4 months in a cold phytotron environment (average of 14 C); whereas a number of common cultivars produced only one or two true leaves and then died, apparently from a fungus. The true leaves of the hexaploid were blue green. Those of the other cottons were very chlorotic.

Among the spectrum of materials under exploration in nanocarrier research, proteins offer unparalleled structural and functional versatility for designing virus-like molecular vehicles. By exhibiting ‘smart’ functions and biomimetic traits, protein-based nanocarriers will be a step ahead of the conventional drug–protein conjugates already in the clinic in ensuring efficient delivery of passenger antitumor drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiomimetics 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 3atissues 0aprotein nanoparticles 0adrug delivery 0abiomaterials 0abiomimetics 0aprotein engineering 0atargeted therapy1 aCéspedes, María Virtudes1 aVázquez, Esther1 aFerrer-Miralles, Neus1 aMangues, Ramón1 aVillaverde, Antonio0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2015 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.253-258dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl35011x0167-77997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014400168520114600312592002801458650002701486650002301513650001401536650001001550650001401560651002801574651001901602653001501621653002001636653001501656653001301671700002501684700002101709700001901730700002301749700002301772700002001795700001801815700002001833773011601853856008501969852000902054655001202063IND60761231120221118123431.0220207e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076123112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1018932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukla, Rudolf10aFrancisella tularensis caused cervical lymphadenopathy in little children after a tick bite: Two case reports and a short literature review  aAlthough Francisella (F.) tularensis is a well-described and understood zoonotic pathogen, its importance in Central Europe is relatively minor and, as such, tularaemia may be missed in the differential diagnosis. The annual incidence of tularaemia in the Czech Republic is relatively stable with up to 100 reported cases per year, except in the epidemic years 1998 and 1999 with 225 and 222 reported cases, respectively. It is, however, higher in comparison with the neighbouring countries. The common route of transmission in Central Europe is handling infected animals. Tularaemia is not commonly recognized as a tick-borne disease. Here we report two rare cases of a tick bite-associated ulceroglandular form of tularaemia in 2.5-year-old and 6.5-year-old children presenting with cervical lymphadenopathy. The unusual and interesting features of those cases are the young age and relatively uncommon route of transmission suggesting possible changes in the epidemiology of tularaemia in the Czech Republic. Therefore, the infection with F. tularensis should be considered in the differential diagnosis after a tick bite even in infants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrancisella tularensis 3alymphatic diseases 3apathogens 3aticks 3atularemia 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic 0aTularaemia 0aLymphadenopathy 0aTick-borne 0aChildren1 aKračmarová, Renata1 aRyšková, Lenka1 aBavlovič, Jan1 aPellantová, Věra1 aBolehovská, Radka1 aFajfr, Miroslav1 aPavlík, Ivo,1 aBoštík, Pavel0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2022 Mar., v. 13, no. 2 p.101893-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1018933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245016100173300001800334520141200352592002801764650001601792650002401808650001101832650002201843650001401865650000901879650001401888650001801902650001301920650001101933650001101944650001101955650002201966700002301988700002002011700001702031700001902048773014402067856007902211852000902290655001202299IND60675915620221122203251.0191111s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067591562DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2018-04362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacnaughton, Camille J.10aUsing meta-analysis to derive a respiration model for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to assess bioenergetics requirements of juveniles in two Canadian rivers  ap. 2225-2234.  aStandard metabolic rates (SMRs) for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have been calculated independently for different life stages and populations, but the absence of a comprehensive SMR model limits its application for modelling the energy use or life stage-specific growth. Atlantic salmon respiration data were compiled from a meta-analysis of 26 publications, and exponential or optimal relationships were fitted to the metadata to estimate respiration equation parameters and generate confidence intervals dependent on temperature and body mass. While model parameters were significant for both models, mass-corrected standard metabolic rates (g O₂·day⁻¹) increased as a function of water temperature (°C) and decreased beyond ∼16 °C following an optimal relationship (AICₒₚₜᵢₘₐₗ = –9185.50 versus AICₑₓₚₒₙₑₙₜᵢₐₗ = –8948.95; ΔAIC = 236.55). Juvenile Atlantic salmon growth (cohorts 1 and 2) from bioenergetics simulations did not vary between Little Southwest Miramichi and Northwest Miramichi rivers; however, variation between simulations using the different respiration models (i.e., exponential versus optimal) led to differences in the way fish allocate energy throughout the year. Results from this analysis will inform conservation efforts for the species throughout its current range and predict the energetic requirements at juvenile life stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aconfidence interval 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aequations 3afish 3ajuveniles 3ameta-analysis 3ametadata 3amodels 3aoxygen 3arivers 3awater temperature1 aDeslauriers, David1 aIpsen, Erinn L.1 aCorey, Emily1 aEnders, Eva C.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2019, v. 76, no. 12 p.2225-2234dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-04363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245009800173300001300271520162800284592002801912650001701940650001801957650002001975650001101995650001502006650001702021650001302038650001102051650000902062650003302071650001002104651001002114653002202124653001802146653002702164653002502191653001602216773009702232856008802329852000902417655001202426IND60599746720221120200006.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059974672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2014.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathur, Neeraj10aTertiary oils from Upper Assam Basin, India: A geochemical study using terrigenous biomarkers  ap. 9-25.  aThe Upper Assam Basin in northeast India is a Tertiary sub-basin of the Assam-Arakan Basin. Hydrocarbons are present in the Langpar Formation (Upper Palaeocene), Lakadong member of the Sylhet Formation (Lower Eocene), and the Barail (Oligocene), Tipam (Lower Miocene) and Girujan (Middle Miocene) formations in the basin. A detailed study to understand the nature and origin of the oils from different stratigraphic horizons using terrigenous and other biomarkers has been carried out. Further, the variation in maturities of oils occurring in different stratigraphic horizons has also been studied. The study shows that rearranged oleananes, oleananes and bicadinanes are present in these oils implying land plant input to their source rocks. The oils have been classified into different groups, using ratios of rearranged oleananes, oleananes, bicadinanes and steranes, indicating presence of multiple source rocks in the basin with subtle variation in characteristics. Maturity studies show that oils from younger horizons (Barail, Tipam and Girujan) are more mature than oils from older horizons (Langpar and Lakadong). There is an apparent mismatch in maturity of oils as measured by different biomarker maturity parameters. This is due to the mixing of two different charges of oils, having different maturities and generated from two different source rock kitchens, in the same reservoir. Principal component analysis (PCA) of biomarker data has also been able to classify the oils into various groups. A new parameter has been developed, using ratios of rearranged oleananes, for determining maturity of these oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aMiocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3abasins 3abiomarkers 3ahydrocarbons 3akitchens 3amixing 3aoils 3aprincipal component analysis 3arocks 3aIndia 0aUpper Assam Basin 0aTertiary oils 0aTerrigenous biomarkers 0aRearranged oleananes 0aBicadinanes0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 76 p.9-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2014.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165300001200250500001500262520168600277592002801963650002701991650002202018650001802040650001202058650002402070650001002094650002602104650002902130650001402159650001102173650002402184650002502208650003302233650000702266650002202273650002302295650002702318650003002345650002302375653001002398700001502408700001502423700001602438700002002454700001602474773011402490856008102604852000902685655001202694IND60485961120221119120214.0160301e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048596112DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-5197-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tianzhi10aBiofilm microbial community structure in an urban lake utilizing reclaimed water  ap. 314.  a2019-12-06  aAnalyses of biofilm community structure may potentially be employed for aquatic ecosystem health assessment, however, to date, biofilm diversity within urban lakes using reclaimed water has not been examined. Accordingly, the microbial community diversity and structure of biofilms from the surface of multiple matrices with varying roughness (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 μm) were characterized using a suite of molecular techniques including scanning electron microscopy, genetic fingerprinting and phospholipid-derived fatty acid analyses. Samples were largely comprised of inorganic particles, algae and numerous bacterial species; 12 phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) types were identified, significantly less than typically associated with sewage. Both growth matrix surface roughness and biofilm growth phase were shown to concur with significantly different microbial quantity and community structures. Gram-negative bacteria bacillus i15:03OH and 18:0 were the dominant bacterial genera, collectively comprising ≈75 % of identified PLFA species content. Calculated species diversity (H) and species dominance (D) exhibited identical correlational patterns with measured water quality parameters; significant positive correlations were exhibited with respect to Mg², while significant negative correlations were found for NO³, TP, BOD, COD, SP, PO⁴, SO⁴ and pH. Results indicate that analyses of biofilm formation and structure could be effectively used to undertake integrated assessments of the ecological health of lake systems using reclaimed water. Further work is required to elucidate the optimum conditions for sample collection and analytical interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3asurface roughness 3awater quality 3abiofilm 3acommunity structure 3alakes 3amicrobial communities 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aroughness 3asewage 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aenvironmental health 3ascanning electron microscopy 3apH 3aspecies diversity 3aDNA fingerprinting 3achemical oxygen demand 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aaquatic ecosystems 0aAlgae1 aLi, Yunkai1 aXu, Tingwu1 aWu, Naiyang1 aLiang, Mingchao1 aHynds, Paul0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Feb., v. 75, no. 4 p.314-314dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-5197-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009100158300001400249520079800263592002801061650001801089650001101107650001601118650002201134650001801156650001201174650002201186650001001208650000901218650001601227651001001243653002201253653002301275653003001298653001701328700002001345700001901365773009201384856007501476852000901551655001201560IND60128416820221122014139.0151115e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012841682DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.12.272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiina, Kanomi10aCharacteristics of Trees Excavated by the Japanese Pygmy Woodpecker Dendrocopos kizuki  ap. 27-33.  aSmall woodpeckers have weak excavation capabilities presumed to be affected by tree characteristics. To determine the features of trees preferred by the Japanese Pygmy Woodpecker Dendrocopos kizuki, we compared 50 excavated trees (8 for nesting, 10 for roosting, and 32 old cavities) with 280 unused trees in a natural mixed forest in Hokkaido, Japan. The woodpeckers tended to excavate cavities in larger trees, and preferred decaying trees over living trees. Dominant tree species, such as birches Betula platyphylla and oaks Quercus crispula, tended to be avoided in favour of particular trees especially alders Alnus hirsuta. These results suggest that small woodpeckers select particular trees, with softer wood, in which to nest and roost on the basis of their weaker excavation ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlnus hirsuta 3aBetula 3aDendrocopos 3aQuercus mongolica 3amixed forests 3anesting 3aroosting behavior 3atrees 3awood 3awoodpeckers 3aJapan 0aCavity excavation 0aDendrocopos kizuki 0aJapanese Pygmy Woodpecker 0aTree species1 aHasegawa, Osamu1 aHigashi, Seigo0 tOrnithological Science.g2013 June, v. 12, no. 1 p.27-33dUniBio Pressx1347-05587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2326%2Fosj.12.273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245005000170500002200220520109400242592002801336650002001364650001401384650002301398650001301421650001101434650001401445650001101459650002101470650003601491650001801527650001901545650001901564650001201583650002001595650002101615653003001636653002501666653003501691653002901726700001801755700001601773773008901789856008201878852000901960655001201969IND60684067320221119044204.0200228e20200204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068406732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2020.1310242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuzumi, Shunichi10aBioinspired artificial photosynthesis systems  aPre-press version  aIn photosynthesis, the oxidizing equivalents generated by photoinduced charge separation in the photosynthetic reaction center in photosystem II (PSII) are used for four-electron oxidation of water to dioxygen, whereas the reducing equivalents are used to reduce two equivalents of plastoquinone in quinone pool to produce two equivalents of plastoquinol. Plastoquinol is used as a two-electron/two-proton reductant to reduce NADP⁺ regioselectively to NADPH in photosystem I (PSI). This review focuses on bioinspired artificial photosynthetic systems to mimic charge-separation processes in the photosynthetic reaction centers and also the functions of PSII to oxidize water, accompanied by reduction of plastoquinone to plastoquinol as well as PSI to reduce protons by plastoquinol to produce hydrogen. Simple photosynthetic reaction center model compounds, which undergo fast charge separation but slow charge recombination, are applied as effective photoredox catalysts to catalyze a variety of chemical transformations under photoirradiation including mimicry of the function of PSI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotoirradiation 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 3aphotosystem I 3aphotosystem II 3aplastoquinones 3aprotons 3areducing agents 3aregioselectivity 0aArtificial photosynthesis 0aPhotoredox catalysis 0aPhotosynthetic reaction center 0aPhotocatalytic mechanism1 aLee, Yong-Min1 aNam, Wonwoo0 tTetrahedron.g2020 Feb. 04,  p.131024-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2020.1310243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008600175300001500261520107600276592002801352650001601380650001301396650001201409650001601421650001401437650002701451650002401478650002801502650002501530650002401555650001501579650001901594650001801613650001001631653002401641653002501665653001801690653003301708700001701741700001801758700002201776700002001798773010701818856008601925852000902011655001202020IND60590749320221122135750.0220214e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059074932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.02.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenttilä, Paavo A.10aEnzymatic hydrolysis of biomimetic bacterial cellulose–hemicellulose composites  ap. 95-102.  aThe production of biofuels and other chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass is limited by the inefficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. Here a biomimetic composite material consisting of bacterial cellulose and wood-based hemicelluloses was used to study the effects of hemicelluloses on the enzymatic hydrolysis with a commercial cellulase mixture. Bacterial cellulose synthesized in the presence of hemicelluloses, especially xylan, was found to be more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than hemicellulose-free bacterial cellulose. The reason for the easier hydrolysis could be related to the nanoscale structure of the substrate, particularly the packing of cellulose microfibrils into ribbons or bundles. In addition, small-angle X-ray scattering was used to show that the average nanoscale morphology of bacterial cellulose remained unchanged during the enzymatic hydrolysis. The reported easier enzymatic hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose produced in the presence of wood-based xylan offers new insights to overcome biomass recalcitrance through genetic engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiomimetics 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3acomposite materials 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agenetic engineering 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3ananomaterials 3axylan 0aBacterial cellulose 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aHemicellulose 0aSmall-angle X-ray scattering1 aImai, Tomoya1 aHemming, Jarl1 aWillför, Stefan,1 aSugiyama, Junji0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 June 15, v. 190 p.95-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.02.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245008800172300001600260520169600276592002801972650002502000650001902025650001502044650001102059650002402070650002602094650004102120650001102161650002602172650002002198650004402218650001802262650002402280650002302304650001102327650002002338650001602358650001002374653002402384653001602408653002502424653002702449700002402476700002702500700002402527700001902551700002302570700002302593700002702616700002202643773010002665856008802765852000902853655001202862IND60599746920221120195927.0180702e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059974692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2014.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPisani, Oliva10aAccumulation of aliphatic compounds in soil with increasing mean annual temperature  ap. 118-127.  aChemical recalcitrance of biomolecules, physical protection by soil minerals and spatial inaccessibility to decomposer organisms are hypothesized to be primary controls on soil organic matter (SOM) turnover. Previous studies have observed increased sequestration of plant derived aliphatic compounds in experimentally warmed soils but did not identify the mechanisms for this enhanced preservation. To further test the role of environmental conditions in the preservation of aliphatic carbon, we analyzed native soils along a bicontinental, longitudinal, mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient to examine relationships between SOM composition, soil physical properties and temperature. Using biomarker analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and solid state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance to characterize SOM, we observed that the concentration of aliphatic compounds derived from the waxes and cuticles of plant leaves increased with MAT. We did not observe any significant correlations between aliphatic SOM and clay mineral content which suggests that their inherent chemical recalcitrance is responsible for their persistence in soils. Other SOM components were not correlated with MAT, indicating that temperature alone does not control the overall preservation and biodegradation of soil carbon. As such, other environmental factors (e.g., microbial community structure and activity, litter quality and quantity, mineral surfaces, soil moisture content and antioxidant capacity) also play a role in the selective preservation or accumulation of various SOM components.

This paper presents the characteristics of four major clusters into which olive oil tourists can be divided and the assessments made by these tourists of the activities carried out, their overall olive oil tourism experience, the various elements of the destination they visited, and the destination as a whole. The results obtained show that, a priori, the reasons for engaging in olive oil tourism, educational background, employment, and age, are the most influential factors when it comes to evaluating such experiences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemployment 3agastronomy 3aolive oil 3atourism 3atourists 0aOlive oil tourism 0aSpecial interest tourism 0aCluster analysis 0aTourism demand 0aSpain1 aCasado-Montilla, Jairo1 aCarrillo-Hidalgo, Isabel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0914-50841 aPulido-Fernández, Maria de la Cruz0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2022 Mar., v. 27 p.100461-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2021.1004613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009100206506007600297520160200373592002801975506003702003650003402040650001702074650002002091650001002111650001502121650001402136650000902150650003302159650001302192650001602205650001202221650001602233650001702249700002402266773012502290856007702415852000902492655001202501IND60670038320221207102644.0190925e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067003832DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox80903332doi7 aPMC67700782pmcid7 a314434762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinter, Aimee  N.10aAnthocyanins and Their Metabolites as Therapeutic Agents for Neurodegenerative Disease  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by the death of neurons within specific regions of the brain or spinal cord. While the etiology of many neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive, several factors are thought to contribute to the neurodegenerative process, such as oxidative and nitrosative stress, excitotoxicity, endoplasmic reticulum stress, protein aggregation, and neuroinflammation. These processes culminate in the death of vulnerable neuronal populations, which manifests symptomatically as cognitive and/or motor impairments. Until recently, most treatments for these disorders have targeted single aspects of disease pathology; however, this strategy has proved largely ineffective, and focus has now turned towards therapeutics which target multiple aspects underlying neurodegeneration. Anthocyanins are unique flavonoid compounds that have been shown to modulate several of the factors contributing to neuronal death, and interest in their use as therapeutics for neurodegeneration has grown in recent years. Additionally, due to observations that the bioavailability of anthocyanins is low relative to that of their metabolites, it has been proposed that anthocyanin metabolites may play a significant part in mediating the beneficial effects of an anthocyanin-rich diet. Thus, in this review, we will explore the evidence evaluating the neuroprotective and therapeutic potential of anthocyanins and their common metabolites for treating neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3aanthocyanins 3abioavailability 3abrain 3acell death 3acognition 3adiet 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aetiology 3ametabolites 3aneurons 3aspinal cord 3atherapeutics1 aBickford, Paula  C.0 tAntioxidants.g2019 Aug. 22, v. 8, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox80903333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010000175300001600275520135400291592002801645650002601673650002601699650001701725650001001742650001501752650001601767650002601783650001401809650003701823650001701860650001201877651001101889700001901900700002201919700002101941700002701962700002001989773009302009856008402102852000902186655001202195IND60121991420221123024629.0150324e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012199142DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2013.8543082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgudín, M.

To gain deeper insight into the epidemiology and diversity of S. aureus associated with articular disease in domestic turkeys, isolates were collected from infected foot joints of turkeys in Brittany (France). A total of 34 isolates were recovered and characterized by means of antimicrobial resistance, staphylococcal protein A typing, macrorestriction pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and micro-array analysis. Thirty isolates were identified as clonal complex (CC) 398 and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), one was identified as a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) CC398 isolate, and the remaining were also MSSA and belonged to CC5, CC101, and CC121. Eleven different antimicrobial resistance patterns were detected, with most isolates resistant to penicillin and tetracycline. Based on all typing methods used, the 34 isolates could be divided into 22 different strains. Results on selected isolates, genotyped using microarrays, indicated a high homogeneity among pathogenic MSSA isolates from turkeys. Moreover, all isolates, except the unique MRSA isolate, carried specific φAvβ prophage avian-niche-specific genes, demonstrating the versatility of S. aureus to adapt to the specific ecological poultry niche.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotic resistance 3aepidemiology 3agenes 3agenotyping 3amethicillin 3amicroarray technology 3apathogens 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3atetracycline 3aturkeys 3aFrance1 aCariou, Nadine1 aSalandre, Olivier1 aLe Guennec, Jean1 aNemeghaire, Stéphanie1 aButaye, Patrick0 tAvian pathology.g2013 Dec. 1, v. 42, no. 6 p.572-580dTaylor & Francisx1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2013.8543083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01794naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001800168245005600186300001600242500000900258520092600267592002801193650001501221650001501236700002001251700001601271773012201287852000901409856009801418655001201516991616723140742620221121072223.0191122e197009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7090866662DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1970.0011183X001000050020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarks, K.

Moench) varieties having high, intermediate, and low levels of “recovery resistance” (tolerance) to the sorghum shoot fly, Atherlgona varia Meigen, showed that the inheritance of this character is complex. Additive gene action contributed most to the variation among entries in percentage of recovered plants, but specific and epistatic effects were also significant. The average heterosis was 11% for the single cross mean over the mean of the parents, and the correlation between yield and percentage recovered plants was very high. Cultivars ‘Namatare’ and ‘Serena’ proved valuable in the short-term breeding work, and populations (including derivatives of these cultivars) are being established for the longer term recurrent selection program. They should be effective in view of the largely additive genetic variance in recovery resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentomology 3aarthropods1 aEberhart, S.

Methodological quality of selected studies was assessed using Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist (CHEERS). Decision making of vaccination was obtained from Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) and Department of Health in Hong Kong.Nine eligible studies reporting twelve comparative cost-effectiveness comparisons of vaccination programme for influenza (n=2), pneumococcal disease (n=3), influenza plus pneumococcal disease (n=1), chickenpox (n=2), Haemophilus influenzae b (n=1), hepatitis A (n=1), cervical cancer (n=1) and rotavirus (n=1) were identified. Ten comparisons (83.3%) calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of a vaccination strategy versus status quo as outcomes in terms of cost in USD per life-years, cost per quality-adjusted life-years, or cost per disability-adjusted life-years. Among those 10 comparisons in base-case scenario, 4 evaluated interventions were cost-saving relative to status quo while the ICER estimates in 3 of the 6 remaining comparisons were far below commonly accepted threshold and WHO willingness-to-pay threshold, suggestive of very cost-effective. Seven studies were of good quality based on the CHEERS checklist; one was of moderate quality; and one was of excellent quality. The common methodological problems were characterisation of heterogeneity and reporting of study parameters.There was a paucity of cost-effectiveness models evaluating vaccination targeted to the Hong Kong population. All evaluated vaccinations and immunisation interventions in Hong Kong, except for Haemophilus influenzae b, hepatitis A and HPV vaccinations, were considered either cost-saving or very cost-effective when compared to status quo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aRotavirus 3aWorld Health Organization 3acost effectiveness 3adatabases 3adecision making 3aeconomic evaluation 3ahepatitis A 3ainfluenza 3amodels 3aquality-adjusted life year 3asystematic review 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3avaccination 3avaccines 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aSystematic review 0aCost-effectiveness 0aIncremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold 0aQuality-adjusted life-years 0aDecision making 0aVaccination1 aLiao, Qiuyan1 aGuo, Vivian Y.W.1 aXin, Yiqiao1 aLam, Cindy L.K.0 tVaccine.g2017 May 31, v. 35, no. 24 p.3153-3161dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013200172520106100304592002801365650003101393650003101424650002101455650001701476650001501493650001701508650001101525650002001536650002101556650001401577650001801591650002201609650002101631650000701652650003901659650001701698650001901715653001901734653001701753653002101770653001301791653000901804653001701813700005901830773012201889856008302011852000902094655001202103IND60761231920221118194918.0220809e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076123192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1022602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Rupkatha10aBiochemical characterization and thermodynamic principles of purified l-Asparaginase from novel Brevibacillus borstelensis ML12  al-Asparaginase from Brevibacillus borstelensis ML12 was purified and sequentially studied for biochemical characterization.

The research was carried out about 15 years after the landfill site ceased operation. According to the regulations on landfills sites in Poland (J. of Laws of 2002 No. 220 item 1858, Regulation of the Minister of Environment of 9 December 2002 on the scope, time, manner and conditions of landfill monitoring; J. of Laws of 2010 No. 238 item 1588, Regulation of the Minister of Environment of 8 December 2010 amending the regulation on the scope, time, manner and conditions of landfill monitoring), the monitoring period will end in 2021. Despite reclamation, the landfill site still affects the environment. The aim of this study was to assess the geochemical maturation of the stored waste and the landfill site activity by determining the current phase of the landfill site lifetime. This was achieved by means of non-standard application of carbon stable isotopes for the assessment of the landfill activity combined with conventional methods for measuring COD, BOD, DOC, BOD/COD ratio, and H₂S and O₂ content in biogas. An analysis of carbon isotopic composition and COD, BOD, DOC of the leachate-contaminated groundwater and O₂ concentration in biogas indicated that the landfill site was between the methanogenic phase and air intrusion phase. However, BOD/COD ratio and H₂S concentration in the biogas suggested that the landfill site is still active and the wastes contain readily biodegradable organic matter. The impact of the landfill site on the environment seems quite significant. In this case, and in other situations when the impact of a landfill site on the environment is high after the post-closure stage, the monitoring period should be extended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradability 3abiogas 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3agroundwater 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alandfills 3amethanogens 3amonitoring 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3astable isotopes 3awastes 3aPoland0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Feb., v. 75, no. 4 p.331-331dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5256-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100001800168245011600186300001600302500000900318520119300327592002801520650001501548650001501563700001801578700001901596700001601615773012101631852000901752856009801761655001201859991616703740742620221120064701.0191122e196909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7090608792DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1969.0011183X000900050049x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkeson, W.

In weevil feeding tests on water extracts of these leaves a close relationship was found between actual feeding and the feeding predicted on the basis of nitrate content. At a given level of nitrate, extracts of young M. infesta leaves were less attractive to the weevil than were extracts of young M. officinalis leaves. Leaves of mature M. infesta plants contained very little nitrate, but water extracts of such leaves remained unattractive to the weevil in feeding tests. These extracts were lower in Stimulant A activity and higher in Deterrent A activity than extracts of mature M. officinalis leaves. Swectclover weevil resistance is influenced by the balance between Stimulant A, Deterrent A, and Deterrent B (nitrate), and the relative contributions of the different factors vary with stage of development of the leaves and the plant. Nitrate appears to be the predominant water-soluble factor in young leaves, and Deterrent A and Stimulant A assume increased importance in leaves from mature plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentomology 3aarthropods1 aBeland, G.

The results show that sterane maturity parameters for light oils from the Neogene Shawan Formation differ from other maturity parameters. Sterane αααC29 20S/(20S+20R) and C29 ββ/(ββ+αα) ratios indicate low maturity, while aromatic hydrocarbons indicate high maturity. We infer that light oils from the Shawan Formation have higher maturity than Cretaceous and Jurassic crude oils and were generated at equivalent vitrinite reflectance of ∼0.9–1.2%. It can be concluded that the Shawan light oils originated mainly from deeply buried, highly mature Jurassic source rocks, southeast of Sikeshu Sag, southwest of Shawan Sag, and west of Huomatu Anticline Belt. During upward migration, crude oils generated from Jurassic source rock dissolved less mature Cretaceous bitumen resulting in a mixture with apparently conflicting parameters. Phase fractionation during migration also could have contributed to the anomalously low sterane maturity parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aJurassic period 3aNeogene period 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abasins 3abitumen 3afractionation 3aoils 3apetroleum 3areflectance 3arocks 3aChina 0aOverprinting 0aMaturity 0aAromatic hydrocarbon 0aSterane 0aLight oils 0aChepaizi High 0aJunggar Basin1 aLiu, Luofu1 aZhang, Zhihuan1 aWu, Kangjun1 aXu, Zhengjian1 aZhou, Changxiao0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 76 p.48-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2014.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245008000172300001600252520103900268592002801307650002201335650002201357650001901379650001801398650001301416650002701429650001401456650001301470650002101483650001501504650002001519650002101539650001301560650003301573650001101606650003701617650003701654653001801691653002501709653001801734653001801752653001901770700002401789700002501813700002901838700006301867700002401930773010801954856008602062852000902148655001202157IND60590750020221123035944.0220214e20180615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059075002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.02.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovikov, Ilya V.10aChitosan composites with Ag nanoparticles formed in carbonic acid solutions  ap. 103-112.  aChitosan-based hydrogels with stabilized Ag nanoparticles were synthesized in the aqueous solutions of carbonic acid, i.e. water saturated with CO₂ under pressure in hundreds of bars. Such a medium is biocompatible and self-neutralizing at decompression. The influence of various parameters, such as chitosan molecular weight, molar ratio of chitosan to silver, additional stabilization of gels by genipin as a cross-linking agent, on the structure of the chitosan/Ag composites was investigated using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, rheology measurements. The distributions of chitosan-stabilized Ag nanoparticles in a chitosan matrix turned out to be uniform, their average size was in the range of 2–5 nm. The higher degree of Ag nanoparticles reduction could be achieved using self-eliminating gaseous hydrogen as an additional reducing agent being admixed to CO₂.

The synthetic steps include the polymerization of styrene with R-group designed RAFT agents, the transformation of the thiocarbonyl thio end groups into OH functionalities, and their subsequent chain extension by ROP. The obtained linear ABA poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(styrene)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (pCL-b-pS-b-pCL) (12 500 g mol–¹ ≤ Mₙ ≤ 33 000 g mol–¹) and the star-shaped poly(styrene)-block-poly(ε-caprolactone) (Mₙ = 36 000 g mol–¹) copolymers were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. The focus of the current study is on the detailed characterization of the ABA (star) block polymers via multidimensional chromatographic techniques specifically high performance liquid chromatography coupled to size exclusion chromatography (HPLC-SEC). In particular, we demonstrate the first time separation of poly(ε-caprolactone) (pCL) homopolymer and additionally poly(styrene) (pS) from the ABA poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(styrene)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) and star-shaped poly(styrene)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) block copolymer utilizing critical conditions (CC) for pCL with concomitant gradient elution liquid chromatography (GELC).  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3agel chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3astyrene1 aWeidner, Steffen1 aFalkenhagen, Jana1 aBarner-Kowollik, Christopher0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 45, no. 1 p.87-99dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma20224523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007600167300001800243500001900261500001100280520092500291592002801216596007301244650001601317650002101333650001701354650001401371650001701385650002601402650000901428650001701437650001501454650001401469700006001483773014601543856008201689852000901771655001201780IND60675916720221122203227.0191111e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067591672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10311-019-00887-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Marta10aAdvances in the antimicrobial and therapeutic potential of siderophores  ap. 1485-1494.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe increasing bacterial resistance from antibiotic overuse has fostered the search for novel antimicrobial strategies. In particular, bacterial systems involving iron (Fe) uptake are studied to develop new therapeutics against infectious diseases, because iron is crucial for bacterial growth and is a main virulence factor for infection. Iron assimilation is commonly based on the production of siderophores, which are iron chelators produced to facilitate iron uptake. Siderophores are thus crucial for bacterial pathogenicity. Here we review the antimicrobial and therapeutic potential of siderophores. There are three main approaches for siderophore application in antimicrobial therapy: siderophore-mediated drug delivery, inhibition of siderophores biosynthesis and iron starvation by competitive chelation. Major advances on the use of siderophores as therapeutic agents for disease treatment are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data  aPOCI-01-0145-FEDER-030219cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aantibiotics 3abacterial growth 3abiosynthesis 3achelation 3adrug therapy 3aenvironmental science 3airon 3asiderophores 3astarvation 3avirulence1 aSimões, Manuel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3355-43980 tEnvironmental chemistry letters.g2019 Dec., v. 17, no. 4 p.1485-1494dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000202x1610-36537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10311-019-00887-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012300163300001200286520166100298592002801959650001201987650001301999650001102012650002502023650001802048650002102066650001602087650001702103650000902120650001102129650001902140650001402159650000902173650002002182650001202202650001802214650002502232650000902257651002102266700002002287700001802307773011402325856008102439852000902520655001202529IND60485962420221119120219.0160301e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048596242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5268-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSungur, Ali10aChemical fractionation, mobility and environmental impacts of heavy metals in greenhouse soils from Çanakkale, Turkey  ap. 334.  aThe primary objective of this study was to identify possible heavy metal pollution risks in greenhouse soils. Collected soil samples were subjected to heavy metal analysis to determine Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations. Binding forms of the metals were determined by following a sequential extraction procedure. The wet digestion method with aqua regia procedure was employed to find the pseudo total heavy metal concentrations of soil samples. BCR-701 and NIM-GBW07425 certified reference materials were used to validate the reliability of the methods. Contamination factor, potential ecological risk index and risk assessment code were used to assess the environmental impacts of heavy metals in greenhouse and field samples. Results of extractable amounts of heavy metals from greenhouse samples revealed that mobile fractions of Cd, Pb and Ni were higher than immobile fractions and mobile fractions of Cr and Zn were closer to immobile fractions. Human-induced effects were considered the primary reason for this. Soil pH and organic matter content were found to be highly correlated with heavy metals of soil samples from greenhouses. With regard to environmental impacts of heavy metals, Cd was much more mobile in greenhouse samples than in field samples, retained less in ambient soil and had high environmental risks. It was observed that Cd was highly mobile, less retained and exerted higher environmental risks. With regard to environmental risks, Cd was followed respectively by Pb, Cr and Zn in greenhouse soils. Sequential extraction yielded significant information about mobility, behavior and environmental impacts of heavy metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aenvironmental impact 3afractionation 3agreenhouse soils 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil pH 3asoil sampling 3awet digestion method 3azinc 3aTurkey (country)1 aSoylak, Mustafa1 aÖzcan, Hasan0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Feb., v. 75, no. 4 p.334-334dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5268-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03704naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014300164300001600307520191900323592002802242650001902270650002702289650001402316650002502330650002102355650001302376650002202389650003302411650002202444650001802466650001802484650001902502650002202521650002502543650001402568650001202582650001002594650002802604650001802632650001402650650001002664650002302674650002102697650001002718650001702728650001202745650001902757650001302776650001702789650001602806651001702822700001702839700001902856773012502875856008103000852000903081655001203090IND60650556820221120135538.0190710e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065055682DNAL7 a10.1017/S0022149X170007612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJulius, R.S.10aHelminth composition and prevalence of indigenous and invasive synanthropic murid rodents in urban areas of Gauteng Province, South Africa  ap. 445-454.  aAlthough synanthropic rodents such as the indigenous species, Mastomys coucha, and the invasive species, Rattus norvegicus, R. rattus and R. tanezumi, are well-known to be hosts to various micro- and macroparasites, their helminth parasite fauna is poorly studied in South Africa. In an attempt to remedy the situation, the aim of the present study was to investigate the helminth fauna of these sympatric rodent species, which were obtained from the informal settlements of Alexandra, Tembisa, Diepsloot and residential suburbs of Pretoria and Hammanskraal, Gauteng Province, South Africa. Helminths were recovered from the urinary bladder, liver and gastrointestinal tract and were identified morphologically and molecularly. The recovered nematodes were all rodent-specific and included Aspiculuris tetraptera, Eucoleus sp., Heterakis spumosa, Mastophorus muris, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Protospirura sp., Strongyloides ratti, Syphacia obvelata, Syphacia muris, Trichuris sp. and Trichosomoides crassicauda. Syphacia obvelata, a commensal nematode of laboratory rodents, was recovered from indigenous M. coucha. Strobilar stages of cestodes recovered included Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana and Inermicapsifer madagascariensis. Recovered metacestodes were strobilocerci of Hydatigera taeniaeformis from all three invasive Rattus species and coenurostrobilocerci of Hydatigera parva from M. coucha. An acanthocephalan, Moniliformis moniliformis, was recovered from R. rattus only. All rodent species examined showed high helminth infection prevalence (≥70%) with equal or higher nematode than cestode prevalence. Mastomys coucha, however, showed significantly lower cestode prevalence than Rattus species where they co-occur. Interspecific transmission of helminths likely occurs between invasive and indigenous rodents, and these rodents harbour several helminths that have zoonotic implications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aAspiculuris tetraptera 3aHeterakis 3aHymenolepis diminuta 3aHymenolepis nana 3aMastomys 3aMastophorus muris 3aNippostrongylus brasiliensis 3aRattus norvegicus 3aRattus rattus 3aStrongyloides 3aSyphacia muris 3aSyphacia obvelata 3aTaenia taeniaeformis 3aTrichuris 3abladder 3afauna 3agastrointestinal system 3ahelminthiasis 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aliver 3ametacestodes 3arodents 3asuburban areas 3asympatry 3asynanthropes 3aurban areas 3aSouth Africa1 aSchwan, E.V.1 aChimimba, C.T.0 tJournal of helminthology.g2018 July, v. 92, no. 4 p.445-454dCambridge University PresswJournal:23124x1475-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X170007613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245006400169300001400233500001500247520168000262592002801942650001801970650001801988650001802006650001002024650001102034650002302045650001502068650001802083650001702101650001502118650001802133650002102151650001702172650001502189650001502204651001902219653001902238773010102257856004802358852000902406655001202415IND4487792820221120040516.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448779282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-011-9319-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Richard Philip10aKnowledge claims and the governance of agri-food innovation  ap. 79-91.  a2019-12-04  aIn this paper I examine how knowledge claims operating through two types of governance techniques can guide product innovations in the agri-food sector. The notion that knowledge claims have strong social and material components informs the analysis undertaken, developed through a discussion of social science approaches to the role of human groups and biophysical properties in social change. I apply this socio-technical perspective to two case studies: defining dietary fiber and reducing saturated fat. The first involves attempts to produce an international definition of dietary fiber standards in the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The second involves efforts by food manufacturers to reduce the saturated fat content of food products in line with UK government guidelines. The case studies draw upon observations, document analysis, and over forty interviews. I suggest that although knowledge claims are active constituents of both governance processes, important differences are evident and arise from the history of scientific and technical controversies, and from the scope for articulating broader questions. In particular, the different criteria for judging âsuccessâ guide how knowledge claims are implicated in the governance of product innovation. I suggest that further work is required to understand the wider implications of efforts to change the composition of foods, not only for public heath, but also in relation to food security, quality, safety, and availability in a rapidly changing context. In order to do this successfully, knowledge claims made about the material properties of food should be made objects of social science analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3asocial change 3alipid content 3adietary fiber 3afoods 3ahumans 3aCodex Alimentarius 3ainterviews 3afood industry 3afood quality 3aguidelines 3afood security 3afood composition 3acase studies 3atechnology 3agovernance 3aUnited Kingdom 0anew technology0 tAgriculture and human values.g2012 Mar., v. 29, no. 1 p.79-91dSpringer-Verlagx0889-048X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-011-9319-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009300157300001800250500001500268520110900283592002801392650001901420650001601439650001701455650001301472650000801485650001001493650001901503650002301522650001401545653001201559653003301571653003301604653001401637700001901651700001401670700001501684700002101699773012401720856007501844852000901919655001201928IND60527344920221120023636.0160715e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052734492DNAL7 a10.1021/am30111152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Eunyeong10aColorimetric and Resistive Polymer Electrolyte Thin Films for Real-time Humidity Sensors  ap. 5179-5187.  a2019-12-06  aWe have developed fast responsive, colorimetric and resistive-type polymeric humidity sensors from a series of self-assembled poly(styrenesulfonate-methylbutylene) (PSS-b-PMB) block copolymers with tailored hygroscopic properties. In dry state, the PSS-b-PMB films exhibit hexagonal cylindrical morphology where hydrophobic PMB cylinders are dispersed within a PSS matrix. Under levels of humidity, the PSS-b-PMB thin films self-displayed discernible reflective color changes, covering almost entire visible light regions from violet (RH = 20%) to red (RH = 95%). The sensors also revealed a few orders of magnitude changes in impedance with exposure to humid air by taking advantages of strong polymer electrolytes characteristics. Remarkably, the time to complete the changes in the signals was only a few seconds, as rationalized by good connectivity of the PSS domains and short water diffusion pathways in nanometer scales. Repeated hydration/dehydration tests demonstrated reliable sensor properties, which is in sharp contrast to the poor stability of PSS homopolymer sensors lacking organization.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahygroscopicity 3acolorimetry 3aelectrolytes 3ahumidity 3aair 3acolor 3ahydrophobicity 3acomposite polymers 3acylinders 0asensors 0astimuli-responsive materials 0ablock copolymer electrolytes 0aimpedance1 aKim, Sung Yeon1 aJo, Gyuha1 aKim, Suhan1 aPark, Moon Jeong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 4, no. 10 p.5179-5187dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam30111153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245014400167520231100311592002802622650003002650650001702680650001202697650001902709650001902728650002202747650001402769650002002783650003002803650001502833650001302848650001102861650001602872651002202888700004102910700002802951700003202979700003603011700003303047773011903080856007403199852000903273655001203282IND60702950020221117225828.0200719e20200509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070295002DNAL7 a10.3390/f110505302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas-Piedra, Gonzalo 10aCurrent and Future Potential Distribution of the Xerophytic Shrub Candelilla (Euphorbia antisyphilitica) under Two Climate Change Scenarios  aCandelilla (Euphorbia antisyphilitica Zucc.) is a shrub species distributed throughout the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico and southern of the United States of America. Candelilla has an economic importance due to natural wax it produces. The economic importance and the intense harvest of the wax from candelilla seems to gradually reduce the natural populations of this species. The essence of this research was to project the potential distribution of candelilla populations under different climate change scenarios in its natural distribution area in North America. We created a spatial database with points of candelilla presence, according to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). A spatial analysis to predict the potential distribution of the species using Maxent software was performed. Thirteen of 19 variables from the WorldClim database were used for two scenarios of representative concentration pathways (RCPs) (4.5 as a conservative and 8.5 as extreme). We used climate projections from three global climate models (GCMs) (Max Planck institute, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and the Met Office Hadley), each simulating the two scenarios. The final predicted distribution areas were classified in five on-site possible candelilla habitat suitability categories: none (< 19%), low (20–38%), medium (39–57%), high (58–76%) and very high (> 77%). According to the area under the curve (0.970), the models and scenarios used showed an adequate fit to project the current and future distribution of candelilla. The variable that contributed the most in the three GCMs and the two RCPs was the mean temperature of the coldest quarter with an influence of 45.7% (Jackknife test). The candelilla’s distribution area for North America was predicted as approximately 19.1 million hectares under the current conditions for the high habitat suitability; however, the projection for the next fifty years is not promising because the GCMs projected a reduction of more than 6.9 million hectares using either the conservative or extreme scenarios. The results are useful for conservation of the species in the area with vulnerable wild populations, as well as for the selection of new sites suitable for the species growth and cultivation while facing climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia antisyphilitica 3abiodiversity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3afluid mechanics 3ageographical distribution 3ageophysics 3ahabitats 3ashrubs 3atemperature 3aChihuahuan Desert1 aValdez Cepeda, Ricardo David,d1960-1 aLópez Santos, Armando,1 aFlores Hernández, Arnoldo,1 aHernández-Quiroz, Nathalie  S.1 aMartínez Salvador, Martín,0 tForests.g2020 May 09, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f110505303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245009900167300001300266500001400279520125000293592002801543650001601571650001601587650001101603650001901614650001001633650002401643650000901667650002301676650001601699650001401715650001001729650001001739650001001749653001701759653001301776653001101789653002301800653001301823653001501836653002101851700002801872773017801900856007602078852000902154655001202163IND60724321620221122024835.0210121e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072432162DNAL7 a10.1635/053.166.01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarella, Henrique R.10aCrenicichla dandara, new species: the black jacundá from the Rio Xingu (Teleostei: Cichlidae)  ap. 1-12.  aNAL-light  aCrenicichla dandara, new species, is endemic to the rio Xingu above the Belo Monte narrows, and its major left bank tributary the rio Iriri. The new species is distinguished from all congeners by the following combination of characters: body uniformly black (live fishes) or dark brown (preserved specimens) in adults and 74–86 scales in the E1 row. Crenicichla dandara is considered herein to be the tenth species of the C. lugubris group, but its allies within the group are not clear. Among members of this group, C. dandara is most similar in general body shape, snout characteristics and squamation to C. lugubris and C. adspersa, but lacks a caudal-fin blotch as does C. johanna and C. monicae, a condition rare within the Crenicichla-Teleocichla clade. The overall black coloration in Crenicichla dandara is shared with the syntopic, but not closely related, Teleocichla preta. Both species inhabit clear water rapids where they hide among the shadows of large rocks, suggesting that the dark coloration is for camouflage and ambush predation. Based on a preliminary assessment of its conservation status following the criteria and categories of IUCN classification, Crenicichla dandara is considered as a species of least concern (LC).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrenicichla 3aTeleocichla 3aadults 3aclassification 3acolor 3aconservation status 3afish 3amimicry (behavior) 3anew species 3apredation 3arocks 3ashape 3awater 0aAmazon basin 0aendemism 0arapids 0arheophilic species 0ataxonomy 0acamouflage 0afeeding strategy1 aIto, Priscila Madoka M.0 tProceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.g2018 Apr., v. 166, no. 1 p.1-12dAcademy of Natural Sciences of PhiladelphiawJournal:19727x1938-52937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1635/053.166.01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245006000171300001600231520118000247592002801427650001101455650002001466650001601486650001401502650001901516650001801535650001001553650001501563700002201578700002001600700002001620773016201640856008001802852000901882655001201891IND60480540720221117222930.0160128e20050201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048054072DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.71.2.1972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Mouélic, Stéphane12aA Least Squares Adjustment of Multi-temporal InSAR Data  ap. 197-204.  a<p><i>Satellite radar interferometry can be used to spatially monitor small vertical ground deformations. When millimeter accuracy is required, the differential interferometry technique is hampered by the ambiguity with atmospheric artifacts. It is also often difficult to obtain a precise evaluation of the kinematic evolution of ground deformations from a set of time, randomly distributed interferograms. We present the results of a least-squares approach coupled with a temporal filtering and applied to a large data set over the City of Paris. The mean deformation rate and a map of areas affected by time, non-linear deformation events are presented. We show that this approach, which provides a chronologically ordered set of phase screens, allows the retrieval of the kinematic parameters of ground deformations as low as 1 to 2 mm per year. Subsiding areas have been detected, and their evolution in time has been quantified. Such an approach can be useful to fully characterize the kinematic evolution of ground deformations in major cities or desertic areas where large areas have a high degree of coherence and where millimeter accuracy is often required.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adata collection 3adeformation 3aevolution 3ainterferometry 3aleast squares 3aradar 3asatellites1 aRaucoules, Daniel1 aCarnec, Claudie1 aKing, Christine0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2005 Feb. 1, v. 71, no. 2 p.197-204dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.71.2.1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01618naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024001800122040001800140100002600158245009800184300001600282520049100298592002800789650001400817650002800831650001600859650001300875650001900888650001300907651001700920651001400937653001400951653001500965653001300980653001900993700002001012773011701032856007401149852000901223655001201232IND60597717820221118180702.0180625e20170725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059771782DNAL7 a10.3417/D-16-000122doi4 anovo-25-03-04  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanotti, Christian A.10aNototriche chaniensis (Malvaceae), una Nueva Especie Poligámica de los Andes de la Argentina  ap. 394-398.  aWe describe and illustrate Nototriche chaniensis C.

The nanofibers contained poly[2,7-(9,9-dihexylfluorene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PFBT) nanoparticles as the luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) and Ag nanoparticles for the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Aligned- and crossed-fiber architecture patterns were fabricated to compare the effects of the architecture on the OPV efficiency. The plasmonic-enhanced LSC ES nanofibers with crosslinked poly(methacrylic acid) could be directly integrated into the conventional OPV configuration without sacrificing the coverage area of the active layer. In addition, the in situ reduction of Ag nanoparticles simultaneously enhanced the exciton generation of PFBT and the active materials with the SPR effect. The dual functional ES nanofibers with a crossed-pattern embedded into OPV devices provided significant light harvesting through down conversion and enhanced exciton generation. They led to PCE values of 4.11 and 7.12% for P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) : PC₆₁BM ([6,6]-phenyl C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester) and PTB7 (polythieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-co-benzodithiophene) : PC₇₁BM ([6,6]-phenyl C₇₁-butyric acid methyl ester) ([6,6]-phenyl) photovoltaic cells, respectively, which are 18% enhancements compared to their parent devices. This interface-modification approach using plasmonic-enhanced LSC ES nanofibers provides a new approach for enhancing the OPV device performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3afluorenes 3aluminescence 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asolar collectors 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aChiu, Yu-Cheng1 aShi, Jianzhong,1 aWu, Wen-Chung1 aChen, Wen-Chang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2015 July 14, v. 3, no. 29 p.15039-15048dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ta02417j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04560naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245012100200300001600321500002000337520183700357592002802194596004402222596004402266596004402310596004402354596004402398596003102442650002302473650001102496650001302507650001302520650001202533650002002545650001302565650001702578650001502595650002002610650001202630650001202642651000902654700002102663700001802684700002002702700002202722700002702744700001902771700002302790700001602813700002202829700002002851700003402871700002402905700002502929700001502954700002102969700001902990700001803009700002003027700001703047700002303064700001803087700002603105700001703131700001903148700001903167700002003186700002203206700002003228700005603248700002403304700002303328700002203351700002103373700002003394700002503414700002403439773012403463856007403587852000903661655001203670IND60794415620221117191950.0220922e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079441562DNAL7 a10.1111/jrh.126482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeoples, Anita R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3645-396010aImpact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on rural and urban cancer patients' experiences, health behaviors, and perceptions  ap. 886-899.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPURPOSE: The COVID‐19 pandemic has disrupted many facets of life. We evaluated pandemic‐related health care experiences, COVID‐19 prevention behaviors and measures, health behaviors, and psychosocial outcomes among rural and urban cancer patients. METHODS: Among 1,472 adult cancer patients, who visited Huntsman Cancer Institute in the past 4 years and completed a COVID‐19 survey (August‐September 2020), we assessed the impact of the pandemic on medical appointments, prevention/health behaviors, and psychosocial factors, stratified by urbanicity. FINDINGS: Mean age was 61 years, with 52% female, 97% non‐Hispanic White, and 27% were residing in rural areas. Rural versus urban patients were more likely to be older, not employed, uninsured, former/current smokers, consume alcohol, and have pandemic‐related changes/cancellations in surgery appointments (all P<.05). Changes/cancellations in other health care access (eg, doctor's visits) were also common, particularly among urban patients. Urban versus rural patients were more likely to socially distance, use masks and hand sanitizer, and experience changes in exercise habits and in their daily lives (all P<.05). Less social interaction and financial stress were common among cancer patients but did not differ by urbanicity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the COVID‐19 pandemic had a substantial impact on cancer patients, with several challenges specific to rural patients. This comprehensive study provides unique insights into the first 6 months of COVID‐19 pandemic‐related experiences and continuity of care among rural and urban cancer patients predominantly from Utah. Further research is needed to better characterize the pandemic's short‐ and long‐term effects on rural and urban cancer patients and appropriate interventions.  aPublisher supplied data  aP30 CA042014cNational Cancer Institute  aR01 CA189184cNational Cancer Institute  aR01 CA207371cNational Cancer Institute  aR01 CA211705cNational Cancer Institute  aU01 CA206110cNational Cancer Institute  cHuntsman Cancer Foundation 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aadults 3aalcohols 3aexercise 3afemales 3ahealth services 3apandemic 3arural health 3asanitizers 3asocial behavior 3asurgery 3asurveys 3aUtah1 aOswald, Laura B.1 aOse, Jennifer1 aDaniels, Bailee1 aHimbert, Caroline1 aHathaway, Cassandra A.1 aGigic, Biljana1 aKirchhoff, Anne C.1 aLin, Tengda1 aGrossman, Douglas1 aTward, Jonathan1 aVarghese, Thomas K., Jr.cJr.1 aFigueiredo, Jane C.1 aToriola, Adetunji T.1 aBeck, Anna1 aScaife, Courtney1 aShibata, David1 aLaStayo, Paul1 aGonzalez, Brian1 aSalas, Karen1 aAshworth, Anjelica1 aMatsen, Cindy1 aChristenson, Cristina1 aMa, Debra S.1 aColman, Howard1 aHunt, Jason P.1 aJones, Kevin B.1 aLee, Catherine J.1 aLarson, Mikaela1 aOnega, Tracy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1633-30401 aAkerley, Wallace L.1 aLi, Christopher I.1 aSchneider, Martin1 aPenedo, Frank J.1 aSiegel, Erin M.1 aTworoger, Shelley S.1 aUlrich, Cornelia M.0 tJournal of rural health.g2022 Sept., v. 38, no. 4 p.886-899dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44673x0890-765X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.126483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245015700164300001300321500001400334520208800348592002802436650001702464650001402481650001602495650001102511650001202522650001702534650001402551650001102565650001502576650001302591650001302604650001102617650001702628650001502645651001802660653003802678700003302716773017802749856007602927852000903003655001203012IND60724321820221122024906.0210121e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072432182DNAL7 a10.1635/053.166.01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabaj, Mark Henry10aTaxonomic assessment of the Hard-Nosed Thornycats (Siluriformes: Doradidae: Trachydoras Eigenmann 1925) with description of Trachydoras gepharti, n. sp.  ap. 1-53.  aNAL-light  aTrachydoras is a genus of Doradidae (thorny catfishes) with five nominal valid species distributed in lowland areas of the Amazon, Orinoco, Paraná-Paraguay and Essequibo river basins of South America. A sixth species is described here as Trachydoras gepharti and diagnosed by five characteristics unique among congeners: mental barbels thick, tapered and profusely ornamented with many elongate fleshy papillae loosely arranged in 2–3 rows (vs. mental barbels thinner, papillae lacking or fewer, arranged in 1–2 rows); distinct columns of small, soft papillae along medial and lateral margins of gill filaments on all gill arches (vs. gill filaments lacking conspicuous papillae in congeners); gas bladder acorn-shaped (vs. cordiform) with smooth anterolateral shoulder (vs. shoulder with accessory diverticulum) and terminal diverticula medially united into singular, finger-like projection formed mostly by elongation of only one of the two posterior chambers (vs. both chambers elongated, contributing more or less equally to terminal diverticula in congeners or terminal diverticula absent or reduced in some specimens of T. nattereri and T. paraguayensis). Trachydoras gepharti is known from the Amazon and Orinoco basins where it often occurs syntopically with T. microstomus, T. nattereri and a separate undescribed species of Trachydoras. Like other species of Trachydoras, T. gepharti is specialized for vacuuming chironomid larvae from sandy substrates in medium to large river channels. Redescriptions and diagnoses are provided for the five nominal valid species of Trachydoras along with a key to identification and comments on characteristics used to diagnose the genus and delimit species. Designations include a lectotype (NMW 46375, 91.7 mm SL) for Trachydoras brevis (Kner 1853) and neotype (ANSP 178443, 100 mm SL) for T. nattereri (Steindachner 1881). The true holotype of T. microstomus (Eigenmann 1912) is identified as FMNH 118302 [ex. FMNH 53207, ex. CM 1650] and the specimen previously cataloged as the holotype (FMNH 53206) is identified as T. brevis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChironomidae 3aDoradidae 3aMicrostomus 3abasins 3acatfish 3adiverticulum 3aholotypes 3alarvae 3alectotypes 3alowlands 3aneotypes 3arivers 3aswim bladder 3awatersheds 3aSouth America 0aTrachydoras gepharti Sabaj & Arce1 aHernández, Mariangeles Arce0 tProceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.g2017 Nov., v. 166, no. 1 p.1-53dAcademy of Natural Sciences of PhiladelphiawJournal:19727x1938-52937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1635/053.166.01073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100005300143245008200196300001600278520123600294592002801530596014501558596010101703650002001804650002201824650002601846650002401872650001001896650001301906650001701919650001801936651001801954653003001972653003102002653002602033653002002059700001802079700001702097773014102114856007802255852000902333655001202342IND60795213620221119081125.0221003e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079521362DNAL7 a10.1139/cjm-2022-00402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4421-778410aSpatial variability of bacterial community compositions in the Mariana Trench  ap. 633-642.  aHadal microorganisms play an important role in the biogeochemical processes in marine ecosystems and act as a valuable resource for industrial applications. This paper presents the bacterial community analysis of samples taken from the Challenger Deep within the Mariana Trench, which is the deepest site in the ocean. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to reveal that the vertically sampled bacterial populations at eight stations varied at the surface to 10 km depth. The surface water samples harbored a distinct bacterial assemblage, while the mesopelagic and bathyal samples manifested different bacterial community composition, which was not consistent with previous studies. Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant bacteria in the bathyal and hadal waters. The hadal bacterial community consisted mostly of Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales. The former was widely spread in the water column, which might suggest habitat partitioning at the genus and operational taxonomic unit levels, while the latter might represent hadal-enriched hydrocarbon degraders. The present work complements the current knowledge and understanding of the bathyal and hadal bacterial communities of the Mariana Trench.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo.2020TD67,a2017HY-ZD1003cCentral Public-interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, CAFSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100012428  aNo.31900035cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aAlteromonadales 3aOceanospirillales 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3ahabitats 3amicrobiology 3asurface water 3aPacific Ocean 0ahadal microbial community 0amarine bacterial diversity 0adeep-sea microbiology 0aChallenger Deep1 aSun, Jingjing1 aHao, Jianhua0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 68, no. 10 p.633-642dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:jnl44722x1480-32757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2022-00403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012500161300001800286520157000304592002801874650003701902650001401939650002801953650002801981650001302009650002002022650001002042650002602052650002102078650001802099650000902117650001102126650001302137650001102150653001702161653001502178653005502193653002002248653002002268653001302288700002602301700002202327700002702349700002502376700002002401700001802421773012402439856007502563852000902638655001202647IND60527345120170710000000.0160715e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052734512DNAL7 a10.1021/am301124b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinbach, Annina10aPlasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition of n-Heptane and Methyl Methacrylate for Potential Cell Alignment Applications  ap. 5196-5203.  aPlasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited polymers (plasma polymers) are promising candidates for biomaterials applications. In the present study, plasma deposition as a fast and easily scalable method was adapted to deposit coatings from n-heptane and methyl methacrylate monomers onto glass substrates. Linear patterns with line and groove widths between 1.25 and 160 μm were introduced by degrative UV-lithography for cell alignment. Differential interference contrast optical microscopy, profilometry and atomic force microscopy revealed that the patterned surfaces had a smooth, homogeneous appearance and a pattern height of 8 and 45 nm for plasma deposited n-heptane and methyl methacrylate, respectively. UV-lithography increased the oxygen content on the surface drastically as shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After immersion in simulated body fluid for 21 days, the pattern was still intact, and the ester groups were also maintained for the most part as shown by infrared spectroscopy. To test the coatings’ potential applicability for biomaterial surfaces in a preliminary experiment, we cultured murine preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells on these coatings. Light and electron microscopically, a normal spindle-shaped and aligned cell morphology was observed. At the mRNA level, cells showed no signs of diminished proliferation or elevated expression of apoptosis markers. In conclusion, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited polymers can be patterned with a fast and feasible method and might be suitable materials to guide cell alignment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aapoptosis 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiocompatible materials 3acoatings 3agene expression 3aglass 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3alight microscopy 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3avapors 0abiomaterials 0athin films 0aplasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) 0aplasma polymers 0amicropatterning 0aMC3T3-E11 aTautzenberger, Andrea1 aSchaller, Andreas1 aKalytta-Mewes, Andreas1 aTränkle, Sebastian,1 aIgnatius, Anita1 aVolkmer, Dirk0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 4, no. 10 p.5196-5203dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam301124b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245010600181300001800287520137600305592002801681650001801709650001601727650002501743650001701768650001101785650001201796650001301808650000901821650002501830650002701855650001201882650001201894650005601906650005401962650001402016650004002030650001602070650006002086650001102146650002002157650002002177650001102197650000902208650002402217650004302241650000902284650002102293650008302314650005502397650008102452700001502533700001502548700001902563700001302582700001702595700001402612700001502626700001402641773011602655856004802771852000902819655001202828IND50067472620221117231005.0140621e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006747262DNAL7 a234632512pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-4787-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aDesign, expression and characterization of a novel coexpression system of two antiarthritic molecules  ap. 6301-6314.  aThe complexity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis makes combined blockade of multiple targets an attractive therapeutic strategy. The combination therapy with anti-TNF plus anti-T-cell has been mostly reported to provide greater efficacy than anti-TNF alone. TNFR (p75)-Fc fusion protein, which has been proven effective in clinics, is chosen as the TNF antagonist in this study. CTLA4-FasL fusion molecule, which has been well characterized in our previous studies for its suppressive effect in rat arthritis model, is chosen as the T-cell antagonist. In this study, furin cleavage site and 2A self-processing sequence were introduced to link upstream TNFR-Fc and downstream CTLA4-FasL and mediate separate coexpression of the two fusion proteins in a single recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector. Using this expression system, we generated two fusion proteins with same size as their individual counterparts in vitro and in vivo, and the proteins desirably retained their parent biological activities. In vivo results demonstrated that furin-2A technology is able to regulate separate coexpression of these proteins under arthritic inflammatory conditions. This study describes a single rAAV vector for production of two antiarthritic molecules antagonizing both TNF and T cells, which may serve as an attractive expression system for RA gene therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantagonists 3abioactive properties 3agene therapy 3amodels 3aparents 3aproteins 3arats 3arheumatoid arthritis 3atumor necrosis factors 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aArthritis, Rheumatoidxgeneticsxtherapyxvirology. 2aCTLA-4 Antigenxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aCell Line 2aDependovirusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Design 2aFas Ligand Proteinxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Therapy 2aHumans 2aMice 2aProtein Engineering 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Lew 2aReceptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type IIxgeneticsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aWang, Fang1 aYan, Jinqi1 aZhang, Xiaojun1 aWang, Yu1 aJiang, Yunbo1 aWang, Lin1 aXu, Yuanji1 aYu, Jiyun0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 July, v. 97, no. 14 p.6301-6314dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-4787-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245009300178300001800271500001100289520114000300592002801440650002001468650002101488650001501509650002501524650001101549650001601560700002101576700002601597700002301623700002001646773012001666856008801786852000901874655001201883IND60600045420221123025920.0180702e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060004542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01852.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaughlin, Daniel C.12aA predictive model of community assembly that incorporates intraspecific trait variation  ap. 1291-1299.  aLETTER  aCommunity assembly involves two antagonistic processes that select functional traits in opposite directions. Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait‐based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait‐based community assembly models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3adominant species 3aecosystems 3aevolutionary biology 3amodels 3atemperature1 aJoshi, Chaitanya1 avan Bodegom, Peter M.1 aBastow, Zachary A.1 aFulé, Peter Z.0 tEcology letters.g2012 Nov., v. 15, no. 11 p.1291-1299dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01852.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009100170300001600261520073500277592002801012650001601040650001001056650001501066650001701081650001001098650001801108650001301126650001201139650001401151650001001165650002301175650001601198700002401214700002001238700002301258773016801281856008401449852000901533655001201542IND60130548020221119132328.0151127e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013054802DNAL7 a10.1894/0038-4909-58.1.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsakiris, Eric T.10aAbundance and Diversity of Arthropods in Nests of Lark Sparrows (Chondestes grammacus)  ap. 113-117.  aWe examined abundance and diversity of arthropods in nests of lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus).

Zoolgoea and its related floc-forming bacteria are required for formation of AS flocs which is the key to gravitational effluent-and-sludge separation and AS recycling. However, little is known about the genetics, biochemistry and physiology of Zoogloea and its related bacteria. This report deals with the comparative genomic analyses on two Zoogloea resiniphila draft genomes and the closely related proteobacterial species commonly found in AS. In particular, the metabolic processes involved in removal of organic matters, nitrogen and phosphorus were analyzed. Furthermore, it is revealed that a large gene cluster, encoding eight glycosyltransferases and other proteins involved in biosynthesis and export of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), was required for floc formation. One of the two asparagine synthase paralogues, associated with this EPS biosynthesis gene cluster, was required for floc formation in Zoogloea. Similar EPS biosynthesis gene cluster(s) were identified in the genome of other AS proteobacteria including polyphosphate-accumulating Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis (CAP) and nitrifying Nitrosopira and Nitrosomonas bacteria, but the gene composition varies interspecifically and intraspecifically. Our results indicate that floc formation of desired AS bacteria, including CAP strains, facilitate their recruitment into AS and gradual enrichment via repeated AS settling and recycling processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aZoogloea resiniphila 3aactivated sludge 3aasparagine 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3agenomics 3aglycosyltransferases 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3amultigene family 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphysiological transport 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3arecycling 3asewage 0aGenome 0aZoogloea 0aActivated sludge 0aFloc formation 0aAsparagine synthases1 aGuo, Feng1 aSong, Yulong1 aGao, Na1 aBai, Shijie1 aDai, Jingcheng1 aWei, Hehong1 aZhang, Liping1 aYu, Dianzhen1 aXia, Ming1 aYu, Ying1 aQi, Ming1 aTian, Chunyuan1 aChen, Haofeng1 aWu, Zhenbin1 aZhang, Tong1 aQiu, Dongru0 tWater research.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 102 p.494-504dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.06.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245017200166300001300338500001400351520151100365592002801876650001401904650001201918650001701930650001601947650001101963650001001974650001001984650000901994650000902003650001502012650001002027650001102037650001302048650001202061650001102073650002102084650001002105650001502115651001702130651001102147653001702158653001202175653002202187653002102209653002802230700001902258700003102277700002702308700003502335700002802370773017802398856007602576852000902652655001202661IND60724322120221122025126.0210121e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072432212DNAL7 a10.1635/053.166.01102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagalhães, Célio,10aAnnotated checklist of parasitic and decapod crustaceans from the middle and lower Xingu (Amazon Basin) above and below the Belo Monte dam complex, Pará State, Brazil  ap. 1-34.  aNAL-light  aResults are presented on species richness and distribution of the crustacean fauna obtained by iXingu Project expeditions along the middle and lower Xingu River during low and high water seasons primarily from 2013-2014, prior to the completion of the Belo Monte dam complex. The checklist includes the parasitic and decapod crustacean species surveyed in the Xingu River from the mouth of its tributary, the Iriri River, to its confluence with the Amazon River. With the addition of records from the scientific literature, a total of 32 species representing 18 genera in eight families are known to occur in the middle to lower Xingu basin: four species of fish lice, family Argulidae, four parasitic isopods, families Corallanidae (1 species) and Cymothoidae (3), 13 decapod crabs, families Pseudothelphusidae (5) and Trichodactylidae (8), and 11 decapod shrimps, families Sergestidae (1), Euryrhynchidae (3), and Palaemonidae (7). Seventeen species are recorded for the first time from the Xingu basin, highlighting the importance of focused sampling of decapods and other crustaceans in major sub-basins of the Amazon. The lower Xingu, below the Volta Grande rapids, held the most diversity with 19 species. The Volta Grande rapids (between Altamira and the lower Xingu) and the middle Xingu above Altamira exhibited 17 and 15 species, respectively. Based on comparisons to other Amazon and South American river basins, the middle and lower Xingu River supports a remarkably high diversity of decapods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgulidae 3aIsopoda 3aPalaemonidae 3aSergestidae 3abasins 3acrabs 3afauna 3afish 3alice 3aliterature 3amouth 3arivers 3asampling 3aseasons 3ashrimp 3aspecies richness 3awater 3awatersheds 3aAmazon River 3aBrazil 0abranchiurans 0aisopods 0afreshwater shrimp 0afreshwater crabs 0aNeotropical crustaceans1 aRobles, Rafael1 aSouza-Carvalho, Edvanda A.1 aCarvalho, Fabrício L.1 aMalta, José Celso de Oliveira1 aMantelatto, Fernando L.0 tProceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.g2017 Nov., v. 166, no. 1 p.1-34dAcademy of Natural Sciences of PhiladelphiawJournal:19727x1938-52937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1635/053.166.01103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245013100168300001800299520172900317592002802046650002002074650001202094650001202106650001002118650001502128650002502143650001402168650001902182650000902201650001102210650002202221650002202243700002002265700002802285700003002313700001602343700002302359700002002382700001702402700001702419700001902436773012102455856007902576852000902655655001202664IND60082097420221122155935.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008209742DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.123142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanden Eede, Sarah10aAssessing the impact of beach nourishment on the intertidal food web through the development of a mechanistic‐envelope model  ap. 1304-1313.  aBeach nourishment, the placement of sand onto a sediment‐starved stretch of coast, is widely applied as a soft coastal protection measure because of its reduced ecological impact relative to hard coastal protection. In order to predict effects on the intertidal sandy beach ecosystem, we developed a simulation model that integrates species envelope‐based projections for the dominant macrobenthos species and mechanistic food web modules for higher trophic levels. Species envelopes were estimated by using Bayesian inference of species' biomass relationships according to the three determining abiotic variables: intertidal elevation, median grain size and total organic matter, obtained from multiple sampling campaigns along the Belgian coast. Maximum potential abundance of higher trophic levels represented by birds, shrimp and flatfish were estimated based on their derived trophic relationship with macrobenthos. After validation, we demonstrated that unlike nourishment slope, sediment grain size strongly determines beach‐level species richness and production, with strong deterioration in species richness after nourishment with coarse sediment (>300 μm). Patterns for higher trophic levels do not follow the changes in macrobenthos abundance and biomass. Synthesis and applications. The optimal grain size range for nourishment of fine‐grained beaches is 200–300 μm. This modelling approach shows that the impact assessment of beach nourishment needs to include the evaluation of different species richness and biomass variables. Focusing solely on the potential abundance of species from higher trophic levels might lead to deceptive conclusions due to the dominance of opportunistic prey species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3abeaches 3abiomass 3abirds 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afood webs 3aorganic matter 3asand 3ashrimp 3asimulation models 3aspecies diversity1 aVan Tomme, Joke1 aDe Busschere, Charlotte1 aVandegehuchte, Martijn L.1 aSabbe, Koen1 aStienen, Eric W.M.1 aDegraer, Steven1 aVincx, Magda1 aBonte, Dries1 aAngeler, David0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2014 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.1304-1313dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.123143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245007500162300002000237520074100257592002800998650001601026650001401042650002301056650001601079650001901095650001201114650001801126650001301144650002301157650001101180700001601191773013601207856007501343852000901418655001201427IND60537614320221117024256.0160809e20131127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053761432DNAL7 a10.1021/ie40227542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegirmenci, Levent10aMicroencapsulation of Silicotungstic Acid To Retain Catalytic Activity  ap. 16714-16718.  aMicroencapsulation is used as a means to retain the activity of silicotungstic acid (STA), an industrially important catalyst, during repeated use in ethyl acetate synthesis reaction. Standard sol–gel microencapsulation procedures were modified to microencapsulate STA inside a silica shell. The microcapsules were characterized to determine their morphology, the presence and amount of the active material, and the pore structure. The activity of the catalyst was tested in an esterification reaction between acetic acid and ethanol. The catalyst was used multiple times after being washed and dried after each run. Results indicate no leaching of the active material and no significant loss in catalyst activity after repeated runs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aengineering 3aesterification 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aleaching 3amicroencapsulation 3asilica1 aOrbey, Nese0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2013 Nov. 27, v. 52, no. 47 p.16714-16718dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie40227543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245012200164300001300286500001400299520104900313592002801362650001501390650001101405650001201416650000901428650001601437650001301453650001701466651001101483653001701494653001301511653002701524653002001551700002201571700001901593700001901612700002201631773017801653856007601831852000901907655001201916IND60724322220221122024801.0210121e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072432222DNAL7 a10.1635/053.166.01112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Leandro M.10aPlatydoras birindellii, new species of striped raphael catfish (Siluriformes: Doradidae) from the Xingu Basin, Brazil  ap. 1-13.  aNAL-light  aA new species of Platydoras is described from the rio Xingu Basin, Brazil. Platydoras birindellii is distinguished from congeners by having gas bladder simple (vs. with posterior secondary chamber) and dorsal and caudal fins uniformly dusky (vs. with distinct marks composed of dark broad band or blotch on central portion of dorsal fin and pair of dark broad stripes on caudal fin, one central to each lobe). Platydoras birindellii shares a simple gas bladder with the sister taxon to Platydoras, Centrochir crocodili, a monotypic genus endemic to the Magdalena Basin. With respect to the caudal skeleton, the parhypural is incompletely fused to hypurals 1+2 in P. birindellii, a condition that is intermediate between those of Centrochir (parhypural typically separated from hypurals 1+2 by distinct suture) and Platydoras (parhypural typically fully fused to hypurals 1+2). Platydoras birindellii is commonly found in rocky clearwater rapids and apparently endemic to the middle and upper portions of the Xingu draining the Brazilian Shield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatydoras 3abasins 3acatfish 3afins 3anew species 3askeleton 3aswim bladder 3aBrazil 0aAmazon basin 0ataxonomy 0agas bladder morphology 0acaudal skeleton1 aChaves, Mateus S.1 aAkama, Alberto1 aZuanon, Jansen1 aSabaj, Mark Henry0 tProceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.g2017 Nov., v. 166, no. 1 p.1-13dAcademy of Natural Sciences of PhiladelphiawJournal:19727x1938-52937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1635/053.166.01113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245006700187300001600254520084600270592002801116650001501144650001001159650001101169650001401180650001301194650002401207650001501231650002901246650005301275650001201328650001701340650004801357650003801405650004701443650003101490650001701521650001101538650006201549650003301611650003201644650005001676650002101726650003701747650002401784650003301808650003801841700001601879700002401895773009001919856008102009990002302090852000902113655001202122IND60093975120221120195435.0141104e20130204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009397512DNAL7 a233333152pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2012.11.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidor, Clara M.10aMask Proteins Are Cofactors of Yorkie/YAP in the Hippo Pathway  ap. 223-228.  aThe Hippo signaling pathway acts via the Yorkie (Yki)/Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator family to control tissue growth in both Drosophila and mammals [1–3]. Yki/YAP drives tissue growth by activating target gene transcription, but how it does so remains unclear. Here we identify Mask as a novel cofactor for Yki/YAP. We show that Drosophila Mask forms a complex with Yki and its binding partner, Scalloped (Sd), on target-gene promoters and is essential for Yki to drive transcription of target genes and tissue growth. Furthermore, the stability and subcellular localization of both Mask and Yki is coregulated in response to various stimuli. Finally, Mask proteins are functionally conserved between Drosophila and humans and are coexpressed with YAP in a wide variety of human stem/progenitor cells and tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3agenes 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNuclear Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPhosphoproteinsxmetabolism 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aTrans-Activatorsxmetabolism 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism1 aBrain, Ruth1 aThompson, Barry J.0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Feb. 4, v. 23, no. 3 p.223-228dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.11.0613Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001900123040001800142100002000160245015800180300001600338520234100354592002802695650001702723650001402740650001302754650001502767650001702782650001902799650003202818650001702850650002002867650002502887651001902912651001102931651001702942651001002959651002002969653001802989653003903007653001103046653004303057653002003100653002303120653002803143653004603171700002503217773015003242856007503392852000903467655001203476IND60597718220221118175703.0180625e20170811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059771822DNAL7 a10.3417/D-16-00014A2doi4 amobt-102-02-17  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelmas, Maïté14aThe Sud Expert Plantes Développement Durable (SEP2D) Program, Supporting Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) Achievement and the Aichi Targets  ap. 357-363.  aIn keeping with the 2011–2020 Strategic Plan adopted by the 10th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010, France scaled up its biodiversity action with a new National Biodiversity Strategy (NBS) for 2011–2020. Target 16 aims at strengthening international solidarity and ensuring greater mainstreaming of biodiversity into French development assistance, and target 17 addresses reinforcing green diplomacy and international governance for biodiversity. In this context, France launched in 2015 the Sud Expert Plantes Développement Durable (SEP2D) program, a five-year multilateral program aiming at sustaining the scientific communities in 22 francophone countries in western and central Africa, the Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia. Focusing on the sustainable management of plant biodiversity, SEP2D is supported by Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the French Global Environment Facility (GEF), and Ministère des Affaires étrangères et du Développement International (MAEDI), as well as other public and private partners among which are the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN) and the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD). SEP2D is making every effort to bolster partnerships and collaboration on plant biodiversity, building bridges between research, education, and societal demands. In this regard it encourages the scientific community to work on applied topics, such as the major challenges associated with conservation and tropical plant biodiversity assessment. It advocates the national authorities, public stakeholders, private sector operators, and associations to meet societal demands by developing a culture of public-private partnership and backing vocational training for the green economy job market. The Program Steering Committee includes the institutional funders, southern representatives, and key partners. It relies on a Scientific and Pedagogical Council articulated around four themes: forestry and mines; the valorization of plants for medicinal, cosmetics, and agrobiodiversity purposes; research and collections; and training and awareness. The program and its context, planned actions for research, innovation, training, and transversal activities are presented in this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acosmetics 3aforestry 3agovernance 3alabor market 3aprivate sector 3apublic-private partnerships 3astakeholders 3atropical plants 3avocational education 3aCentral Africa 3aFrance 3aIndian Ocean 3aJapan 3aSouth East Asia 0aAichi targets 0aConvention on Biological Diversity 0aFrance 0aGlobal Strategy for Plant Conservation 0aNagoya protocol 0aplant biodiversity 0asustainable development 0aSud Expert Plantes Développement Durable1 aRana, Anshuman Singh0 tAnnals of the Missouri Botanical Garden.g2017 Aug. 11, v. 102, no. 2 p.357-363dthe Missouri Botanical GardenwJournal:jnl45950x0026-64937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3417/D-16-00014A3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009100157300002000248520096800268592002801236650001401264650001901278650001401297650001301311650001601324650001901340650002801359650002001387650001601407700002101423700001901444700002301463700002201486773013601508856007501644852000901719655001201728IND60537614420221117024058.0160809e20131127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053761442DNAL7 a10.1021/ie402295r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeong, Thomas10aUltrasonic Separation of Particulate Fluids in Small and Large Scale Systems: A Review  ap. 16555-16576.  aThis review details recent developments in nondestructive ultrasound separation techniques that can be used to separate, trap, or fractionate particles or emulsified droplets from bulk phase liquids. Whereas most previous reviews have focused on small scales or specific applications, this review groups different aspects of the acoustic separation technique and directs it at an audience with interests in separation technologies. The process has potential as an attractive alternative to common separation processes such as centrifugation, membrane filtration, sedimentation, or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The technology can achieve precise, gentle, and label-free separation in a system that involves no moving parts. The fundamental concepts are presented in detail and previous studies covering a range of different applications are reviewed. The challenges and opportunities for addressing large-scale industrial applications are evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acentrifugation 3achemistry 3adroplets 3aengineering 3aflow cytometry 3aindustrial applications 3amicrofiltration 3aultrasonics1 aJohansson, Linda1 aJuliano, Pablo1 aMcArthur, Sally

The current model species for standardized tests is Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei. However, these species are absent from agricultural soils and often less sensitive to pesticides than other earthworm species found in mineral soils. To move towards a better assessment of pesticide effects on non-target organisms, there is a need to perform a posteriori tests using relevant species. The endogeic species Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny, 1826) is representative of cultivated fields in temperate regions and is suggested as a relevant model test species. After providing information on its taxonomy, biology, and ecology, we reviewed current knowledge concerning its sensitivity towards pesticides. Moreover, we highlighted research gaps and promising perspectives.

This task is considered to be a la-beling process through which a lidar point is labeled as either a ground point or a non-ground point. Mathematical formulation is presented to define the ground. A new approach is proposed that conducts one-dimensional labeling in two opposite directions followed by a linear regression, both along the lidar scan line profile. The study shows that the one-dimensional characteristic makes the calculation efficient, and the reliability is assured by the bidirectional labeling process. Lidar data over suburban and downtown Baltimore (Maryland), Osaka (Japan), and Toronto (Canada) are used for the study. Quality assessment is designed and conducted to investigate the performance of the labeling approach by using manually-selected ground truth. It is shown that 2.7 percent ground points are wrongly labeled as building points, and 2.6 percent building points are mistakenly labeled as ground points over the four study areas. Detailed graphic and numerical results are provided to illustrate the proposed labeling approach and its performance for complex urban areas.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3adigital elevation models 3alidar 3alinear models 3aurban areas 3aCanada 3aJapan 3aMaryland1 aAparajithan, Sampath0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2005 Feb. 1, v. 71, no. 2 p.217-226dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.71.2.2173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245007300174300001800247500001100265520109900276592002801375650002001403650001301423650001901436650002201455651001801477700002201495700002101517700002501538700002001563700001901583700002001602700002301622700002401645700001801669700002501687700001701712773012001729856008801849852000901937655001201946IND60600045820221123035538.0180702e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060004582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01847.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWithey, John C.10aMaximising return on conservation investment in the conterminous USA  ap. 1249-1256.  aLETTER  aEfficient conservation planning requires knowledge about conservation targets, threats to those targets, costs of conservation and the marginal return to additional conservation efforts. Systematic conservation planning typically only takes a small piece of this complex puzzle into account. Here, we use a return‐on‐investment (ROI) approach to prioritise lands for conservation at the county level in the conterminous USA. Our approach accounts for species richness, county area, the proportion of species' ranges already protected, the threat of land conversion and land costs. Areas selected by a complementarity‐based greedy heuristic using our full ROI approach provided greater averted species losses per dollar spent compared with areas selected by heuristics accounting for richness alone or richness and cost, and avoided acquiring lands not threatened with conversion. In contrast to traditional prioritisation approaches, our results highlight conservation bargains, opportunities to avert the threat of development and places where conservation efforts are currently lacking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3aplanning 3aprioritization 3aspecies diversity 3aUnited States1 aLawler, Joshua J.1 aPolasky, Stephen1 aPlantinga, Andrew J.1 aNelson, Erik J.1 aKareiva, Peter1 aWilsey, Chad B.1 aSchloss, Carrie A.1 aNogeire, Theresa M.1 aRuesch, Aaron1 aRamos, Jorge, JrcJr1 aReid, Walter0 tEcology letters.g2012 Nov., v. 15, no. 11 p.1249-1256dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01847.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001900175245010000194300001400294520214100308592002802449650002002477650001002497650001002507650001002517650002202527650001202549650002002561650000902581650001102590650001702601650000902618650001302627650001602640650002702656700001602683700002402699700001802723700001802741700001902759700001802778700001702796700001802813773014902831856006802980856009903048990002303147852000903170655001203179IND60643213120221122172107.0190510e20091120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064321312DNAL7 a10.3791/13242doi7 aPMC31578502pmcid7 a199356382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoule, John D.10aCombining peripheral nerve grafting and matrix modulation to repair the injured rat spinal cord  ap. e1324.  aTraumatic injury to the spinal cord (SCI) causes death of neurons, disruption of motor and sensory nerve fiber (axon) pathways and disruption of communication with the brain. One of the goals of our research is to promote axon regeneration to restore connectivity across the lesion site. To accomplish this we developed a peripheral nerve (PN) grafting technique where segments of sciatic nerve are either placed directly between the damaged ends of the spinal cord or are used to form a bridge across the lesion. There are several advantages to this approach compared to transplantation of other neural tissues; regenerating axons can be directed towards a specific target area, the number and source of regenerating axons is easily determined by tracing techniques, the graft can be used for electrophysiological experiments to measure functional recovery associated with axons in the graft, and it is possible to use an autologous nerve to reduce the possibility of graft rejection. In our lab we have performed both autologous (donor and recipient are the same animal) and heterologous (donor and recipient are different animals) grafts with comparable results. This approach has been used successfully in both acute and chronic injury situations. Regenerated axons that reach the distal end of the PN graft often fail to extend back into the spinal cord, so we use microinjections of chondroitinase to degrade inhibitory molecules associated with the scar tissue surrounding the area of SCI. At the same time we have found that providing exogenous growth and trophic molecules encourages longer distance axonal regrowth into the spinal cord. Several months after transplantation we perform a variety of anatomical, behavioral and electrophysiological tests to evaluate the recovery of function in our spinal cord injured animals. This experimental approach has been used successfully in several spinal cord injury models, at different levels of injury and in different species (mouse, rat and cat). Importantly, the peripheral nerve grafting approach is effective in promoting regeneration by acute and chronically injured neurons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3aaxons 3abrain 3adeath 3aelectrophysiology 3aenzymes 3agraft rejection 3amice 3amodels 3anerve tissue 3arats 3aregrowth 3aspinal cord 3atissue transplantation1 aAmin, Arthi1 aCote, Marie-Pascale1 aLemay, Michel1 aMiller, Kassi1 aSandrow, Harra1 aSanti, Lauren1 aShumsky, Jed1 aTom, Veronica0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2009 Nov. 20, , no. 33 p.e1324-e1324dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/13243Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1324/combining-peripheral-nerve-grafting-matrix-modulation-to-repair  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008400166300001600250520175400266592002802020650001502048650001102063650001202074650001102086650001302097650001002110650002602120650001902146650000902165650002002174650001002194651002102204700001502225700001402240700002102254773016202275856008002437852000902517655001202526IND60480541320221117222948.0160128e20050201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048054132DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.71.2.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeckie, Donald G.10aAutomated Mapping of Stream Features with High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery  ap. 145-155.  a<p><i>The capabilities of high-resolution, multispectral remote sensing imagery to map important stream features is investigated. Eighty centimeter spatial resolution CASI imagery was acquired in eight spectral bands over Tofino Creek on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. A spectral angle mapping algorithm was used to classify stream habitat including hydraulic habitat, substrate material, and woody debris. Subclasses were attempted in terms of streambed material and water depth, but results were not reliable. A classification of deep water, moderate depth water, shallow water, sand, gravel and cobble, and woody debris in sunlit conditions, however, proved accurate (80 percent on average). Individual logs and piles of woody debris were consistently detected. Silty substrate in a tidal flats zone was also classified, but results indicated that different substrate material beneath the water may require separate classes and can result in problematic water depth classification. Patterns of general classes were reasonably represented within shadowed areas cast by isolated trees or groups of trees. However, problems do arise within lengthy shadowed stretches. Some boundaries of stream features with surrounding forest and between some zones of sand, gravel, and cobble were also misclassified. High-resolution, multispectral imagery in four or more bands combined with good geometric correction, image mosaicking, and appropriate automatic classification techniques offer a viable tool for stream mapping to meet a variety of issues and applications. In the future, a powerful suite of stream information may be compiled from multispec-tral classification combined with high-resolution thermal and lidar data.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoasts 3aforests 3agravel 3ahabitats 3alidar 3amultispectral imagery 3aremote sensing 3asand 3astream channels 3atrees 3aBritish Columbia1 aCloney, Ed1 aJay, Cara1 aParadine, Dennis0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2005 Feb. 1, v. 71, no. 2 p.145-155dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.71.2.1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245010000157300001600257520171500273592002801988650001902016650001902035650001502054650001902069650002202088650002102110650001502131650000902146650001702155650001202172650001902184650001902203650001802222650001302240650001202253650001902265650001702284650000902301651002102310651001102331700002002342700001902362700001902381700002302400773012102423856004802544852000902592655001202601IND4487088720221118151834.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448708872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-011-0358-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPa, Ann10aEnvironmental footprints of British Columbia wood pellets from a simplified life cycle analysis  ap. 220-231.  aPURPOSE: Environmental footprints of wood pellets produced in British Columbia (BC) of Canada are to be estimated based on industry surveys and published emission factor data. METHOD: The streamlined life cycle analysis starts from raw material acquisition and ends at port Rotterdam in Europe for exported pellets or North Vancouver port for domestically used pellets. The raw materials used for pellet production are dry and wet sawmill residues, and allocations are based on dry mass. The pellet production data are based on three pellets mills in western Canada. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: For every tonne of BC pellets exported, 295Â kg CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases is released. The human health, ecosystem quality, and climate change impacts of the exported pellets can be reduced by 61%, 66%, and 53%, respectively, if the pellets stay in BC for local applications. Harvesting is the second highest impacting process, following marine transportation. The total amount of primary energy consumed for 1Â tonne of exported pellets is 6,372Â MJ, and approximately 35% of it is attributed to marine transportation. Exported pellets have 16.4% of nonrenewable energy content and an energy penalty of 33% with energy penalty defined as the amount of primary energy consumed to produce and deliver one unit of process energy using the higher heating value. For domestically used pellets, the energy penalty is 21% and the nonrenewable energy content is 8.59%. CONCLUSIONS: Marine transportation is the main contributor for all impact categories. Improving the energy efficiency of the harvesting and pellet plant operations is also a way to effectively reduce these wood pellet's environmental footprints.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aenergy content 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gases 3aharvesting 3aheat 3ahuman health 3apellets 3aprimary energy 3aprocess energy 3araw materials 3asawmills 3asurveys 3atransportation 3aunit process 3awood 3aBritish Columbia 3aEurope1 aCraven, Jill S.1 aBi, Xiaotao T.1 aMelin, Staffan1 aSokhansanj, Shahab0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2012 Feb., v. 17, no. 2 p.220-231dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-011-0358-7  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100002100187245013800208300001200346506007600358520154800434592002801982506003702010650001602047650001802063650001402081650001002095650001402105650005202119650002602171650002202197650006102219650004802280650001802328650003802346650005702384650004602441650003802487650002902525650001802554650003402572650004802606650005802654650002802712650002002740650004902760700002202809700001702831700002402848700001902872700002202891700001902913700002302932700002502955700002302980700001803003700001903021700001903040700002103059700002003080773010303100856008003203852000903283655001203292IND50067835820221207071359.0170816e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006783582DNAL7 a237592182pmid7 aPMC37068452pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2013-14-6-r562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGregis, Veronica10aIdentification of pathways directly regulated by SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE during vegetative and reproductive development in Arabidopsis  ap. R56.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: MADS-domain transcription factors play important roles during plant development. The Arabidopsis MADS-box gene SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is a key regulator of two developmental phases. It functions as a repressor of the floral transition during the vegetative phase and later it contributes to the specification of floral meristems. How these distinct activities are conferred by a single transcription factor is unclear, but interactions with other MADS domain proteins which specify binding to different genomic regions is likely one mechanism. RESULTS: To compare the genome-wide DNA binding profile of SVP during vegetative and reproductive development we performed ChIP-seq analyses. These ChIP-seq data were combined with tiling array expression analysis, induction experiments and qRT-PCR to identify biologically relevant binding sites. In addition, we compared genome-wide target genes of SVP with those published for the MADS domain transcription factors FLC and AP1, which interact with SVP during the vegetative and reproductive phases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses resulted in the identification of pathways that are regulated by SVP including those controlling meristem development during vegetative growth and flower development whereas floral transition pathways and hormonal signaling were regulated predominantly during the vegetative phase. Thus, SVP regulates many developmental pathways, some of which are common to both of its developmental roles whereas others are specific to only one of them.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3abinding sites 3aflowering 3agenes 3ameristems 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factors 3avegetative growth 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Regulatory Networks 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenome-Wide Association Study 2aMADS Domain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMeristemxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Binding 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aAndrés, Fernando1 aSessa, Alice1 aGuerra, Rosalinda F1 aSimonini, Sara1 aMateos, Julieta L1 aTorti, Stefano1 aZambelli, Federico1 aPrazzoli, Gian Marco1 aBjerkan, Katrine N1 aGrini, Paul E1 aPavesi, Giulio1 aColombo, Lucia1 aCoupland, George1 aKater, Martin M0 tGenome biology.g2013 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.R56-R56dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2013-14-6-r563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001500175245008300190300001400273520073900287592002801026650001001054650001301064650002201077650002001099650001701119650001901136650002701155650001501182650001701197650002601214700002101240773014901261856006801410856010501478990002301583852000901606655001201615IND60643213220221122172206.0190510e20090805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064321322DNAL7 a10.3791/13252doi7 aPMC31499072pmcid7 a196845632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, James10aLive cell imaging of f-actin dynamics via fluorescent speckle microscopy (fsm)  ap. e1325.  aIn this protocol we describe the use of Fluorescent Speckle Microscopy (FSM) to capture high-resolution images of actin dynamics in PtK1 cells.

This technique is particularly useful in deriving quantitative measurements of F-actin dynamics when paired with computer vision software (qFSM).

Despite significant water quality improvement in the Czech Republic in the last decade, several important pollution sources in the Elbe River basin remain. The aim of the study was to evaluate fish community in a chronically polluted part of the channelized lowland Elbe River and its potential indicative capability. The effluent from both industrial and municipal sewage treatment plant exhibited low pH, high conductivity and wide set of organic compounds (PAH, PCB, DDT etc.). Ecological characteristics of fish communities were obtained by boat electro fishing at selected sites in four inter-weir sections in July 2005 and 2006. Relatively high fish species richness (24 species) was observed in both seasons. Generalists (bleak, roach, chub) form the majority of the fish community in all four sections. There was no significant difference in fish species richness or density among study sections (river segments between weirs) even with a high level of measured organic compounds at the pollution inlet. Significant differences in fish species richness and density were registered among individual sites within study sections. Sites downstream the weirs had significantly higher species richness and density than the other two sites in the middle and upstream weirs. Fish community does not display any indicative remarks concerning water pollution, or in the case of mid-size river, sampling strategy was not efficient to recognize it. Channelization and regulation of the study stretch of the Elbe River seems to be the most important determinant of fish community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aaquatic habitat 3aboats 3achannelization 3acommunity structure 3afish 3afish communities 3apH 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arivers 3asewage treatment 3aspecies richness 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aweirs 3aCzech Republic 0abioindicators 0apollution1 aJanáč, Michal1 aValová, Zdenka1 aStreck, Georg0 tFolia zoologica.g2010 July, v. 59, no. 2 p.157-168dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.v59.i2.a10.20103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245018800170500001900358520143400377592002801811650001701839650002001856650002801876650002401904650002701928650001301955650002001968650001701988650002102005650002102026650001802047650001702065650001402082650001402096650001402110650001202124650001702136650001402153653004602167653001802213653001702231700001602248700001702264700001702281700001902298700001402317700001802331700001902349773009302368856009002461852000902551655001202560IND60687867120221117210108.0200405e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068786712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1199872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Lisen10aTargeted immunomodulation of inflammatory monocytes across the blood-brain barrier by curcumin-loaded nanoparticles delays the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt is difficult to carry out early diagnosis and treatment of Multiple sclerosis (MS) because of the complex pathogenesis elicited by diversified autoantigens. Monocytes play important roles in the process of MS, especially as most of the amplified inflammatory monocytes cross the BBB to promote neuron injury and recruit more immune cells to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we propose monocytes as an effective immunotherapy target for MS. We used High-density lipoprotein-mimicking peptide-phospholipid scaffold (HPPS) as a carrier to improve the bioavailability of curcumin. Curcumin-loaded HPPS (Cur-HPPS) were taken up specifically and efficiently by monocytes through the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1) receptor. This delivery hindered inflammatory monocytes across the BBB in EAE mice, inhibited the proliferation of microglia, and restricted the infiltration of other effector immune cells, resulting in the reduction of EAE morbidity from 100% to 30%. It attributed to the immunomodulatory effect of Cur-HPPS on inflammatory monocytes, which inhibited NF-κB activation and downregulated the expression of adhesion-and migration-related molecules. Meanwhile, infiltrated monocytes in the CNS of EAE mice characterize early inflammation. Therefore, targeted modulation of monocytes with HPPS carrying therapeutic and/or imaging agents offers a novel strategy for MS diagnosis and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoantigens 3abioavailability 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood-brain barrier 3acentral nervous system 3acurcumin 3aearly diagnosis 3aencephalitis 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunomodulators 3aimmunotherapy 3ainflammation 3amonocytes 3amorbidity 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3asclerosis 0aExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 0aNanoparticles 0aTheranostics1 aQi, Shuhong1 aChen, Yuzhou1 aLuo, Haiming1 aHuang, Songlin1 aYu, Xiang1 aLuo, Qingming1 aZhang, Zhihong0 tBiomaterials.g2020 July, v. 245 p.119987-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1199873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002200175245009300197300001400290520213800304592002802442650001102470650002002481650001002501650002502511650001102536650002002547650001302567650001202580650002002592650003102612650001002643650002102653650000902674650001102683650000902694650000902703650001102712650001202723650002302735700002202758700003002780773015002810856006802960856010203028990002303130852000903153655001203162IND60643213420221122172105.0190510e20090924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064321342DNAL7 a10.3791/13332doi7 aPMC31428652pmcid7 a197794012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetros, Timothy J10aIn utero and ex vivo electroporation for gene expression in mouse retinal ganglion cells  ap. e1333.  aThe retina and its sole output neuron, the retinal ganglion cell (RGC), comprise an excellent model in which to examine biological questions such as cell differentiation, axon guidance, retinotopic organization and synapse formation[1]. One drawback is the inability to efficiently and reliably manipulate gene expression in RGCs in vivo, especially in the otherwise accessible murine visual pathways. Transgenic mice can be used to manipulate gene expression, but this approach is often expensive, time consuming, and can produce unwanted side effects. In chick, in ovo electroporation is used to manipulate gene expression in RGCs for examining retina and RGC development. Although similar electroporation techniques have been developed in neonatal mouse pups[2], adult rats[3], and embryonic murine retinae in vitro[4], none of these strategies allow full characterization of RGC development and axon projections in vivo. To this end, we have developed two applications of electroporation, one in utero and the other ex vivo, to specifically target embryonic murine RGCs[5, 6]. With in utero retinal electroporation, we can misexpress or downregulate specific genes in RGCs and follow their axon projections through the visual pathways in vivo, allowing examination of guidance decisions at intermediate targets, such as the optic chiasm, or at target regions, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus. Perturbing gene expression in a subset of RGCs in an otherwise wild-type background facilitates an understanding of gene function throughout the retinal pathway. Additionally, we have developed a companion technique for analyzing RGC axon growth in vitro. We electroporate embryonic heads ex vivo, collect and incubate the whole retina, then prepare explants from these retinae several days later. Retinal explants can be used in a variety of in vitro assays in order to examine the response of electroporated RGC axons to guidance cues or other factors. In sum, this set of techniques enhances our ability to misexpress or downregulate genes in RGCs and should greatly aid studies examining RGC development and axon projections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aaxons 3acell differentiation 3achicks 3aelectroporation 3aexplants 3aganglia 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3amice 3amodels 3apups 3arats 3aretina 3asynapse 3atransgenic animals1 aRebsam, Alexandra1 aMason, C.

Nematicidal activity was then correlated with the anti-oxidant power. The highest nematicidal activity was recorded for p-nitrophenol followed by m-nitrophenol, o-nitrophenol and p-bromophenol, with an EC₅₀ after 1 day of immersion of about 0.70 ± 0.64, 8.14 ± 5.49, 15.79 ± 10.81 and 25.92 ± 11.37 μg/ml, respectively. The structure–activity relationship indicates that the nitro-group at position 4 on the phenolic ring (p-nitrophenol) is very important for nematicidal activity, followed by that at position 2 (o-nitrophenol) and position 3 (m-nitrophenol). p-Nitrophenol showed the highest nematicidal activity with the corresponding lowest anti-oxidant activity of about 97 ± 20 μg/ml.

Field experiments were conducted in 2017 and 2018 at New Deal, TX, to evaluate the response of guar (‘Matador’) to four levels of deficit irrigation (DI; extreme, 51 mm; severe, 127 mm; moderate, 203 mm; and mild, 279 mm). Soil moisture extraction patterns, plant height, leaf area index, yield components, seed yield, harvest index (HI), agronomic water use efficiency (AWUE), and irrigation WUE (IWUE) were measured among the irrigation levels. In both years, guar grown under extreme and severe DI extracted a major portion of the water from the 50‐to‐100‐cm soil depth. Water deficit reduced plant height, leaf area index, and number of pods per plant in both years. However, the IWUE and 1,000‐seed weight increased with reduced irrigation. There were no significant differences in seed yield, HI, and AWUE among treatments as a result of a tradeoff between increased seed weight with low pod production under lower DI treatments and increased pod production with low seed weight under higher DI treatments. Guar extracted water deeper in the soil and produced adequate numbers of pods per plant in balance with the source organ capacity to allocate resources toward optimal seed development. Our research offers valuable information about root exploration and development of larger seeds as compensatory mechanisms that can be further explored to improve the adaptability of guar under water‐restricted production conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyamopsis tetragonoloba 3aalternative crops 3adeficit irrigation 3aharvest index 3aleaf area index 3aplant height 3aseed development 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3awater use efficiency1 aSingh, Sukhbir1 aRitchie, Glen0 tCrop science.g2022 Sept., v. 62, no. 5 p.1937-1947dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.207963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04800naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012600164300001600290520328700306592002803593650001203621650001803633650001903651650001103670650001603681650002903697650001303726650001503739650002003754650001803774650001903792650000903811650001103820650001103831650001203842650001303854650001403867650000903881650001103890650001203901650001403913650001803927650001203945650001803957651000903975700002603984700002304010700001904033700002704052773009804079856004804177852000904225655001204234IND4486061020221118152252.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448606102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-010-9115-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrupp, Patrick10aNutrient Inputs, Phytoplankton Response, and CO2 Variations in a Semi-Enclosed Subtropical Embayment, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii  ap. 473-498.  aThe marine shelf areas in subtropical and tropical regions represent only 35% of the total shelf areas globally, but receive a disproportionately large amount of water (65%) and sediment (58%) discharges that enter such environments. Small rivers and/or streams that drain the mountainous areas in these climatic zones deliver the majority of the sediment and nutrient inputs to these narrow shelf environments; such inputs often occur as discrete, episodic introductions associated with storm events. To gain insight into the linked biogeochemical behavior of subtropical/tropical mountainous watershed-coastal ocean ecosystems, this work describes the use of a buoy system to monitor autonomously water quality responses to land-derived nutrient inputs and physical forcing associated with local storm events in the coastal ocean of southern Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, USA. The data represent 2.5Â years of near-real time observations at a fixed station, collected concurrently with spatially distributed synoptic sampling over larger sections of Kaneohe Bay. Storm events cause most of the fluvial nutrient, particulate, and dissolved organic carbon inputs to Kaneohe Bay. Nutrient loadings from direct rainfall and/or terrestrial runoff produce an immediate increase in the N:P ratio of bay waters up to values of 48 and drive phytoplankton biomass growth. Rapid uptake of such nutrient subsidies by phytoplankton causes rapid declines of N levels, return to N-limited conditions, and subsequent decline of phytoplankton biomass over timescales ranging from a few days to several weeks, depending on conditions and proximity to the sources of runoff. The enhanced productivity may promote the drawing down of pCO2 and lowering of surface water column carbonate saturation states, and in some events, a temporary shift from N to P limitation. The productivity-driven CO2 drawdown may temporarily lead to air-to-sea transfer of atmospheric CO2 in a system that is on an annual basis a source of CO2 to the atmosphere due to calcification and perhaps heterotrophy. Storms may also strongly affect proximal coastal zone pCO2 and hence carbonate saturation state due to river runoff flushing out high pCO2 soil and ground waters. Mixing of the CO2-charged water with seawater causes a salting out effect that releases CO2 to the atmosphere. Many subtropical and tropical systems throughout the Pacific region are similar to Kaneohe Bay, and our work provides an important indication of the variability and range of CO2 dynamics that are likely to exist elsewhere. Such variability must be taken into account in any analysis of the direction and magnitude of the airâsea CO2 exchange for the integrated coastal ocean, proximal and distal. It cannot be overemphasized that this research illustrates several examples of how high frequency sampling by a moored autonomous system can provide details about ecosystem responses to stochastic atmospheric forcing that are commonly missed by traditional synoptic observational approaches. Finally, the work exemplifies the utility of combining synoptic sampling and real-time autonomous observations to elucidate the biogeochemical and physical responses of coastal subtropical/tropical coral reef ecosystems to climatic perturbations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acalcification 3acarbon dioxide 3acoasts 3acoral reefs 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrawdown 3aecosystems 3anutrient uptake 3aphytoplankton 3apollution load 3arain 3arivers 3arunoff 3asalting 3aseawater 3asediments 3asoil 3astorms 3astreams 3asubsidies 3asurface water 3atropics 3awater quality 3aOahu1 aDe Carlo, Eric Heinen1 aMackenzie, Fred T.1 aBienfang, Paul1 aSabine, Christopher L.0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2011 Sept., v. 17, no. 4-5 p.473-498dSpringer-Verlagx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-010-9115-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001800175245008700193300001400280520106800294592002801362650001501390650003501405650001401440650001901454650001101473650001501484650000901499650001201508650001501520700001901535700002301554700002101577773015001598856006801748856010201816990002301918852000901941655001201950IND60643213620221122172207.0190510e20090914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064321362DNAL7 a10.3791/13462doi7 aPMC31296622pmcid7 a197528562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeuse, Tobias10aImaging in-stent restenosis: an inexpensive, reliable, and rapid preclinical model  ap. e1346.  aPreclinical models of restenosis are essential to unravel the pathophysiological processes that lead to in-stent restenosis and to optimize existing and future drug-eluting stents. A variety of antibodies and transgenic and knockout strains are available in rats. Consequently, a model for in-stent restenosis in the rat would be convenient for pathobiological and pathophysiological studies. In this video, we present the full procedure and pit-falls of a rat stent model suitable for high throughput stent research. We will show the surgical procedure of stent deployment, and the assessment of in-stent restenosis using the most elegant technique of OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography). This technique provides high accuracy in assessing plaque CSAs (cross section areas) and correlates well with histological sections, which require special and time consuming embedding and sectioning techniques. OCT imaging further allows longitudinal monitoring of the development of in-stent restenosis within the same animal compared to one-time snapshots using histology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahistology 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3amonitoring 3arats 3asurgery 3atomography1 aIkeno, Fumiaki1 aRobbins, Robert C.1 aSchrepfer, Sonja0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2009 Sept. 14, , no. 31 p.e1346-e1346dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/13463Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1346/imaging-stent-restenosis-an-inexpensive-reliable-rapid-preclinical  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245013100166300001800297500000900315520190700324592002802231650004002259650002102299650001302320650002402333650001402357650001502371650001202386650002202398650001902420650001702439650001602456650001602472650001902488650001102507650001502518650002102533650001902554650001902573650001802592650001102610700001702621773012402638856008102762852000902843655001202852IND60665604020221121102201.0191228e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066560402DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2004.17372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xunzhong10aCytokinin-Containing Seaweed and Humic Acid Extracts Associated with Creeping Bentgrass Leaf Cytokinins and Drought Resistance  ap. 1737-1745.  aepub  aDrought continues to be a major limiting factor for creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds. A.) quality and persistence on golf course fairways, greens, and tees. Little breeding specifically aimed at improving bentgrass drought resistance has been completed. However, a number of reports indicate that treatment with natural products such as seaweed extracts and humic acids improve cool-season grass drought resistance possibly by hormonal up-regulation of plant defense systems against oxidative stress. This study was conducted to determine the response of exogenous natural product treatment of three creeping bentgrass cultivars subjected to drought. ‘Penn G-2’, ‘L-93’, and ‘Penncross’ creeping bentgrass were treated with seaweed extract (SWE) at 0.5 kg ha⁻¹, humic acid (HA; 80% a.i.) at 1.5 kg ha⁻¹, alone or in combination, and maintained in a greenhouse at approximately field capacity (−0.01 MPa) or allowed to dry until near the permanent wilting point (−1.5 MPa). Unashed samples of SWE and HA contained 66 μg g⁻¹ and 57 μg g⁻¹ zeatin riboside (ZR), respectively, while ashed samples contained no detectable cytokinins as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There were no significant differences between cultivars in response to drought, except for ZR concentration, which was higher in Penn G-2 than in L-93 or Penncross foliage. Turf quality and photochemical efficiency began to decline 14 d into the dry-down for the control and at 21 d in the natural product-treated bentgrass. The combination of HA + SWE enhanced root mass (21–68%), and foliar α-tocopherol (110%) and ZR (38%) contents. This is the first known report indicating that these natural products contain cytokinins and that their application resulted in increased endogenous cytokinin levels, possibly leading to improved creeping bentgrass drought resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrostis stolonifera var. palustris 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abreeding 3acool season grasses 3acultivars 3acytokinins 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3afield capacity 3agolf courses 3agreenhouses 3ahumic acids 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3amacroalgae 3aoxidative stress 3aphotochemistry 3aplant extracts 3awilting point 3azeatin1 aErvin, E.

The role of plant factors, total copper load in soils, and/or the aging effect on the uptake of copper was explored so as to assess health risks through contamination of the food chain associated with growing the crop on such soils. Contaminated soils and clean soils were collected from coffee-growing fields in Kilimanjaro and Arusha, Tanzania. Two bean seeds were sown per pot, replicated three times, and arranged in a randomized design in a glass house. Copper spiking significantly increased extractable copper, as expected. For all of the treatments except for the Mwanga and Arumeru control soils, the addition of CuSO ₄ did not significantly increase the humic-acid-bound copper, but it significantly increased the fulvic-acid-bound copper (p = 0.05). Moshi soils had significantly higher concentrations of copper in the bean shoots than was the case with other treatments (p = 0.05). For the respective soil types, there was no significant difference in the concentrations of copper in bean leaves between spiked and unspiked treatments (p = 0.05).

Here, we analyzed a clinical influenza A (H1N1) pdm09-infected patient case hospitalized for two months in Guangdong (from December 14, 2019 to February 15, 2020). This isolate, named A/Guangdong/LCF/2019 (LCF/19), was genetically sequenced, rescued by reverse genetics, and phylogenetically analyzed in the context of other relevant pdm09 isolates. Compared with earlier isolates, this pdm09 virus's genetic sequence contains four substitutions, S186P, T188I, D190A, and Q192E, of the hemagglutinin (HA) segment at position 186–192 (H3 numbering) in the epitope Sb, and two of which are located at the 190-helix. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the epitope Sb started undergoing a rapid antigenic change in 2018. To characterize the pathogenicity of this novel substitution motif, a panel of reassortant viruses containing the LCF/2019 HA segment or the chimeric HA segment with the four substitutions were rescued. Kinetic growth data revealed that the reassortant viruses, including the LCF/2019 with the PTIAAQE substitution, propagated faster than those rescued ones having the STTADQQ motif in the epitope Sb in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. The HI test showed that the binding activity of escape mutant to 2018 pdm09 sera was weaker than GLW/2018, suggesting that old vaccines might not effectively protect people from infection. Due to the difference in the selection of vaccine strains, people vaccinated in the southern hemisphere could still suffer a severe infection if infected with this antigenic drift pdm09 virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigenic variation 3adogs 3aepitopes 3ahemagglutinins 3ainfluenza 3akidneys 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3apeople 3aphylogeny 3areverse genetics 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aChina1 aChen, Yunbo1 aChen, Boqian1 aBu, Ling1 aLiu, Ying1 aZeng, Zhiqi1 aGuan, Wenda1 aChen, Qigao1 aLin, Yongping1 aQin, Kun1 aChen, Honglin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5108-83381 aDeng, Xilong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1085-51551 aWang, Xinhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9118-37191 aSong, Wenjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0165-78940 tVirologica Sinica.g2021 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.1220-1227dSpringer SingaporewJournal:1429x1674-07697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-021-00401-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012700164300001100291520194600302592002802248650002302276650001102299650001202310650002302322650001402345650001902359650002802378650002102406650001402427650000902441650002702450650001202477650001002489650001402499650001602513650001002529700001702539700001802556700001602574700001802590700001702608700001602625700001602641700001502657773009602672856008102768852000902849655001202858IND60485959120221119114243.0160219e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048595912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-016-0437-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cuifen10aMolecular mapping of a new temperature-sensitive gene LrZH22 for leaf rust resistance in Chinese wheat cultivar Zhoumai 22  ap. 18.  aLeaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most widespread diseases in common wheat globally. The Chinese wheat cultivar Zhoumai 22 is highly resistant to leaf rust at the seedling and adult stages. Seedlings of Zhoumai 22 and 36 lines with known leaf rust resistance genes were inoculated with 13 P. triticina races for gene postulation. The leaf rust response of Zhoumai 22 was different from those of the single gene lines. With the objective of identifying and mapping, the new gene(s) for resistance to leaf rust, F₁, F₂ plants and F₂:₃ lines from the cross Zhoumai 22/Chinese Spring were inoculated with Chinese P. triticina race FHDQ at the seedling stage. A single dominant gene, tentatively designated LrZH22, conferred resistance. To identify other possible genes in Zhoumai 22, ten P. triticina races avirulent on Zhoumai 22 were used to inoculate 24 F₂:₃ lines. The same gene conferred resistance to all ten avirulent races. A total of 1300 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 36 EST markers on 2BS were used to test the parents, and resistant and susceptible bulks. Resistance gene LrZH22 was mapped in the chromosome bin 2BS1-0.53-0.75 and closely linked to six SSR markers (barc183, barc55, gwm148, gwm410, gwm374 and wmc474) and two EST markers (BF202681 and BE499478) on chromosome arm 2BS. The two closest flanking SSR loci were Xbarc55 and Xgwm374 with genetic distances of 2.4 and 4.8 cM from LrZH22, respectively. Six designated genes (Lr13, Lr16, Lr23, Lr35, Lr48 and Lr73) are located on chromosome arm 2BS. In seedling tests, LrZH22 was temperature sensitive, conferring resistance at high temperatures. The reaction pattern of Zhoumai 22 was different from that of RL 4031 (Lr13), RL 6005 (Lr16) and RL 6012 (Lr23), Lr35 and Lr48 are adult-plant resistance genes, and Lr73 is not sensitive to the temperature. Therefore, LrZH22 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene or allele.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia recondita 3aadults 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3adominant genes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agenetic distance 3aleaf rust 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3araces 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3awheat1 aYin, Guihong1 aXia, Xianchun1 aHe, Zhonghu1 aZhang, Peipei1 aYao, Zhanjun1 aQin, Jinyan1 aLi, Zaifeng1 aLiu, Daqun0 tMolecular breeding.g2016 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.18-18dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-016-0437-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013600166300001600302520133600318592002801654650002701682650002401709650001401733650001501747650001301762650002201775650001701797650001201814650001501826650001801841651001601859651001201875653001701887653001301904653001301917653001601930653002101946653001101967700002201978700001802000773009402018856008402112852000902196655001202205IND60625178620221121233430.0201125e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062517862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Chad10a“His main platform is ‘stop the turbines’ ”: Political discourse, partisanship and local responses to wind energy in Canada  ap. 670-681.  aDecades after wind energy has taken hold in many developed countries, social scientists are beginning to understand the complex story of what causes differentiated responses to local development. Transitions in this literature include moving from attitudinal factors, and the infamous Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) explanation, toward place attachment, environmental justice, and how policy development might shape support for wind turbines in rural communities. While this research has advanced our understanding of some of the major questions in this area, the political arena has largely remained implicit or in the background, rather than a specific area of detailed inquiry. Addressing this gap in the literature, we detail findings from our mixed method study of interviews (n = 54) and surveys (n = 240) with local residents, developers, and other stakeholders in Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada. We focus on the interplay of partisanship and geography, and how together they can powerfully influence attitudes toward wind energy. Specifically, we extend the existing literature and argue that when parties politicize the issue of wind energy — especially within the context of an urban/rural divide — it becomes intertwined with elements of ideology which can amplify responses and further entrench local conflict.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3adeveloped countries 3ageography 3ainterviews 3apolitics 3arural communities 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3awind power 3awind turbines 3aNova Scotia 3aOntario 0aPartisanship 0aIdeology 0aPolitics 0aWind energy 0aRenewable energy 0aCanada1 aStephenson, Laura1 aBaxter, Jamie0 tEnergy policy.g2018 Dec., v. 123 p.670-681dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245012800178300001300306500001500319520184800334592002802182650001402210650001802224650001302242650001302255650001502268650004402283650001102327650002502338650001802363650001902381650001102400650004402411650002002455650001102475650002002486651001202506653002102518653001902539653000802558653003102566653002102597653002102618653003102639700001802670700002202688700002202710773009702732856008802829852000902917655001202926IND60599745020221120210123.0180702e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059974502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2014.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatcher, Patrick G.10aDiagenesis of organic matter in a 400 m organic rich sediment core from offshore Namibia using solid state 13C NMR and FTIR  ap. 8-23.  a2019-12-06  aAlthough rates and mechanisms of early diagenesis have been well studied, the effects of microbial metabolism on the molecular composition of the sedimentary organic matter (SOM) over long periods of time need more investigation. In this study, we characterize the early diagenesis of marine SOM from organic rich sediments of the Ocean Drilling Program site 1082 located off Namibia, in the vicinity of the Benguela coastal upwelling system. We used both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹³C NMR) to assess the quantitative partitioning of the organic carbon into major compound classes (aliphatic, aromatic, ester, carboxylic, amide and carbons from carbohydrates). Then, we calculate the SOM composition in the main biomolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and lignin) on the basis of previous ¹³C NMR based estimates of the molecular composition of the organic mixtures. Results show that the SOM is still labile at 7m below the seafloor (mbsf) and composed of about 25% proteins and 15% carbohydrates. With increasing depth, the protein content exponentially decreases to 13% at 367 mbsf, whereas the carbohydrate content decreases linearly to 11%. The lignin and lipid content consistently represent around 10% and 40% of the SOM, respectively, and show an increase with depth, due mostly to selective enrichment as the more labile components are lost by degradation. Thus, these components of the SOM are considered refractory at the depth scale considered. The calculated remineralization rates are extremely slow ranging from 5.6mol Cm⁻³ky⁻¹ at the top of the core to 0.2mol Cm⁻³ky⁻¹ according to the organic carbon flux to the seafloor. Knowing the labile carbon losses, we propose a method to calculate the initial TOC before the diagenesis took place.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3alipid content 3aproteins 3adrilling 3ametabolism 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolids 3acarbohydrate content 3acarbohydrates 3aorganic carbon 3alipids 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aprotein content 3alignin 3astable isotopes 3aNamibia 0aMarine sediments 0aorganic matter 0aTOC 0aSedimentary organic matter 0aDiagenesis rates 0aEarly diagenesis 0aNuclear magnetic resonance1 aRavin, Azdine1 aBehar, Françoise1 aBaudin, François0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 75 p.8-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2014.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245007100167300001600238520113300254592002801387650001401415650002001429650001601449650002301465650001301488650002701501650001301528650002201541650001601563700002501579700002301604773011701627856007301744852000901817655001201826IND60577712220221118015649.0170810e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057771222DNAL7 a10.1021/ma20172772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToepperwein, Gregory N.10aDynamics and Deformation Response of Rod-Containing Nanocomposites  ap. 543-554.  aTheoretical and computational studies of polymer nanocomposites have largely focused on spherical inclusions in a polymer matrix. In order to address the influence of particle shape on nanocomposite behavior, extensive Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine the structure and deformation behavior of a model polymer upon addition of rods of varying aspect ratios. It is found that, at constant temperature, nanorod length does not meaningfully affect the elastic properties of composites but does affect postyield properties, such as the strain hardening modulus. In contrast, at constant T/Tg, several trends with additive length arise. Examination of the polymer bond autocorrelation function during deformation reveals that longer, dispersed rods induce a broadening of the relaxation spectrum. Nanocomposites show longer bond orientation relaxation times than the pure polymer during all stages of deformation. For the truly nanoscale additives used in this study, polymer mobility is found to be only a weak function of distance to the nearest nanorod so long as the additives did not aggregate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aautocorrelation 3adeformation 3amolecular dynamics 3ananorods 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymers 3asimulation models 3atemperature1 aRiggleman, Robert A.1 aDe Pablo, Juan J.,0 tMacromolecules.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 45, no. 1 p.543-554dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ma20172773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010800179520143900287592002801726650001301754650002301767650002001790650000901810650001701819650001101836650001201847650001301859650001401872650002401886653002001910653002701930653001201957653002001969653001501989700002602004700002402030700001802054700001802072773010102090856008502191852000902276655001202285IND60761229320221120153644.0220124e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076122932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1048092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosińska-Selbi, Barbara10aBreeding goals for conservation and active Polish dairy cattle breeds derived with a bio-economic model  aThe aim of the study was to calculate economic values (EV) of breeding traits (production, reproduction, direct health, calving and survival traits) for the Polish dairy cattle breeds Polish Holstein (PH) and Polish Red (PR). EV are key elements in setting up economically based breeding goals for dairy cattle and they are crucial for optimizing breeding schemes. For deriving EV, a stochastic bio-economic model was used, which estimates EVs based on population-specific biological and economic characteristics. Because the bio-economic model considers correlations between different traits, a multiple regression approach was used to correct for any double counting of effects. The results showed that EVs for direct health traits and fertility differed between breeds. The biggest difference was observed for lameness (PH -1.44 €, PR -1.09 € per cow-year), ketosis (PH -0.94 €, PR -0.58 € per cow-year) and for cow conception rate (PH 1.94 €, PR 0.84 € per cow-year). The relative economic weights for production traits were estimated as 37.00 % (PH) and 34.30 % for (PR) and for fertility traits 15.10 % (PH and for 16.10 % (PR). Major economic differences between the relative weights were observed for cow mortality (22.70 % PH, 16.90 % PR). The results of our study showed that breeding the PH brings higher economic profit than breeding the PR. Total income per PR cow was equal to 1,623 € and for PH 2,970 €.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3abioeconomic models 3aconception rate 3acows 3adairy cattle 3aincome 3aketosis 3alameness 3amortality 3aregression analysis 0aeconomic values 0astochastic simulations 0aSimHerd 0aPolish Holstein 0aPolish Red1 aSchmidtmann, Christin1 aEttema, Jehan Frans1 aSzyda, Joanna1 aKargo, Morten0 tLivestock science.g2022 Jan., v. 255 p.104809-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1048093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245015900164300001800323520113100341592002801472650002501500650001101525650002201536650001701558650001501575650001501590650002301605650001401628650002301642650002201665650001101687650001101698650001101709651001401720651001801734700002301752700002601775773014401801856007901945852000902024655001202033IND60675913920221122111323.0191111s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067591392DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2018-02712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalde, Tomás10aEarly warning: detection of exotic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) by environmental DNA and evidence of establishment at the extreme south of Patagonia  ap. 2343-2349.  aThe global expansion of aquaculture is a constant propagule pressure that enables the establishment of exotic species in freshwater and marine environments. Here, we provide the first report on the presence of exotic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) at the extreme south of Patagonia, in the island of Tierra del Fuego (TDF). During the last 6 years, 43 juvenile coho salmon were captured along the Beagle Channel, while one adult was captured in fresh water. Scale analysis showed that migration from fresh water as smolt would occur during their first winter of life. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed two haplotypes previously reported in North America and a new haplotype not reported before. We developed an environmental DNA assay for detecting coho salmon DNA from fresh water, obtaining positive results in three rivers. Additionally, one of these rivers was monitored monthly for a year, and we detected coho salmon DNA over 7 months, revealing the probable occurrence of coho salmon juveniles in fresh water. These results suggest the potential establishment of self-sustaining populations of coho salmon in TDF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aadults 3aenvironmental DNA 3afish culture 3afreshwater 3ahaplotypes 3aintroduced species 3ajuveniles 3amarine environment 3amitochondrial DNA 3arivers 3asmolts 3awinter 3aArgentina 3aNorth America1 aNardi, Cristina F.1 aFernández, Daniel A.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2019, v. 76, no. 12 p.2343-2349dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-02713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009100161300001100252520156400263592002801827650002101855650002301876650001601899650002901915650000901944650000901953650001901962650001301981650000701994650003302001650001302034650001302047650001402060700001802074700001702092700001702109700001802126700001702144700001602161773012202177856008102299852000902380655001202389IND60485959320221119114259.0160319e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048595932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-2766-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei10aPreparation and Characterization of a Composite Coagulant: Polyferric Titanium Sulfate  ap. 79.  aIn this study, a novel composite coagulant polyferric titanium sulfate (PFTS) was synthesized and the kaolin-fulvic acid simulated water was employed to verify the coagulation efficiency. To obtain the optimal conditions for preparing the composite coagulant, the parameters affecting the coagulation performance such as Ti/Fe, P/Fe, OH/Fe, and oxidizer dosage were evaluated by single factor experiments and response surface methodology. The structure and morphology of PFTS were investigated by some conventional methods and those affecting coagulation–flocculation behaviors such as coagulant dosage, water sample initial pH, were also examined. Flocs properties of PFTS were investigated by Mastersizer 2000. The results indicated that PFTS presented a porous and a compacted gel network structure, in which some major phase structure and chemical bonds were discovered. The jar tests demonstrated the superior coagulation performance at coagulant dosage of 20–30 mg/L and the optimum pH range of 7–8. The optimum synthetic conditions were Ti/Fe, P/Fe, OH/Fe molar ratio and oxidant adding speed of 0.13, 0.25, 0.29, and 4 mL/min, respectively. Under the optimal condition, the residual turbidity, (Dissolved organic matter) DOC removal and residual iron of 0.82, 53 %, and 0.08 mg/L, respectively, could be acquired by PFTS. The flocs analysis results manifested that the dominant mechanism in flocs growth is absorption-bridging and sweeping coagulation, while charge neutralization mechanisms is the primary in the formation of compact flocs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3achemical structure 3acoagulation 3adissolved organic matter 3agels 3airon 3aneutralization 3aoxidants 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3asulfates 3atitanium 3aturbidity1 aZheng, Huaili1 aGuo, Jinsong1 aLi, Fengting1 aTang, Xiaomin1 aLiu, Bingzhi1 aZhou, Yuhao0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 Mar., v. 227, no. 3 p.79-79dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-2766-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245013800178520169800316592002802014650001602042650002202058650001602080650001002096650002002106650001602126650001202142650004102154650001402195650002102209650002302230650004002253650000902293650001702302650001602319650002002335653001302355653002002368653001202388653001202400653001802412653000702430653000802437653000702445653000702452653000802459653000802467653000802475653000802483653000702491653000802498653000802506653000802514653000902522653000802531653000802539653001302547653001302560653001302573653000802586653000802594653000702602653000802609700002102617700002002638700002202658700002602680700002402706700002202730700001802752700002302770700002702793773010102820856008502921852000903006655001203015IND60761229420221120143305.0220124e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076122942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1048102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBressan, Maria Cristina14aThe impact of genetic groups (Alentejano and F1 Landrace x Large White pigs) and body weight (90, 120 and 160kg) on blood metabolites  aThis research work was carried out with the goal of studying the impact of genetic groups-GG (Alentejano-AL, n = 30, and F1 Landrace*Large White-F1 pigs, n = 30) and body weight-BW (90, 120 and 160 kg) on plasma metabolites. Blood parameters were correlated with animal production traits, carcass measurements and meat quality. Individual records for feed conversion index (CI) and daily feed intake were recorded on a weekly basis, for a period of 15 weeks. Compared to the F1, AL pigs displayed (P <0.05) higher average levels of glucose, total cholesterol-TC, triglycerides-TG, HDL-cholesterol (HDL), LDL-cholesterol (LDL) and total protein (TP), by about 14.0, 21.0, 42.2, 18.2, 21.2 and 5.0%, respectively. AL pigs (120–160 kg) showed higher TG levels, when compared to the values at 90 kg (2.6 and 1.6 times higher). High TG levels occurred when animals exhibited high daily feed intake (0.450 and 1.810 kg, for AL and F1 pigs). In the AL high TG levels were correlated with high fat deposition, at 120 kg (r = 0.51). At 90 kg, however, high fat deposition was related to HDL (r = 0.59), a lipoprotein associated to cholesterol transport. A progressive increase in ALB was found in the F1, as expected, but AL pigs showed higher and similar ALB means at 90, 120 and 160 kg. As for meat color, AL pigs with high cholesterol were negatively associated to L*, while high TG levels were associated to low b*. Animals with high ALB produced more tender meats (low shear force). Pigs with higher levels of lipid metabolism showed Longissimus thoracis muscles with decreased luminosity and yellowness (meats of a less attractive appearance). However, these meats were tenderer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3aanimal production 3abody weight 3acolor 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alandraces 3alipid metabolism 3alongissimus muscle 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ameat 3ameat quality 3ametabolites 3aprotein content 0aFat pigs 0aHDL-cholesterol 0aAlbumin 0aBackfat 0aTriglycerides 0aAL 0aGLU 0aTC 0aTG 0aBUN 0aHDL 0aLDL 0aALB 0aCI 0aDFI 0aABF 0aMBL 0aDB12 0aDB6 0aALT 0aL2 or L9 0aA2 or A9 0aB2 or B9 0aMOI 0aASH 0aPB 0aIMF1 aBelo, Ana Teresa1 aAmaral, Andreia1 aCordeiro, Daniela1 aBoari, Cleube Andrade1 aBettencourt, Carlos1 avan Harten, Sofia1 aMoreira, Olga1 ada Gama, Luis Telo1 aAlmeida, João Marques0 tLivestock science.g2022 Jan., v. 255 p.104810-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2021.1048103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001400290520106600304592002801370650001501398650001201413650001101425650001701436650001601453650001701469650002101486650001301507650000901520650001801529650002601547650001501573650001901588650001101607650001501618650001101633650002001644650002301664650001301687653002001700653005501720653002301775653002501798700002001823700001401843700001901857700001801876700002201894773010501916856008602021852000902107655001202116IND60590747720221122135732.0190318e20180501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059074772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.01.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Zi-jian10aEngineering sodium alginate-based cross-linked beads with high removal ability of toxic metal ions and cationic dyes  ap. 85-93.  aSodium alginate (SA) beads with ultrahigh adsorption capacity were prepared via hydrogen bonds between SA and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropa-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS), and the AMPS was then post-cross-linked to manufacture SA/PAMPS beads. The equilibrium adsorption capacities of methylene blue (MB) and Pb2+ for the SA/PAMPS10 beads were 2977 and 2042 mg/g, respectively. Although the SA beads exhibited higher equilibrium adsorption capacities of MB and Pb2+ than those of the SA/PAMPS10 beads, the SA/PAMPS10 beads had better mechanical property and higher stability. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm described the adsorption processes of the SA/PAMPS10 beads for MB well. In addition, the SA/PAMPS10 beads could be reused with stable adsorption capacity for at least three cycles. The beads also had excellent performances on absorbing methylene violet and other heavy metal ions (Cu2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+). Therefore, the SA-based beads with high adsorption capacity might be good candidates for industrial pollutant treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3aengineering 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogen bonding 3akinetics 3alead 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3ametal ions 3amethylene blue 3anickel 3apollutants 3asodium 3asodium alginate 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity 0aSodium alginate 0aPoly (2-acrylanmido-2-methylpropa-1-sulfonic acid) 0aCross-linked beads 0aWastewater treatment1 aHuang, Xue-lian1 aYang, Fan1 aZhao, Wei-feng1 aZhou, Xin-zhi1 aZhao, Chang-sheng0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 May 01, v. 187 p.85-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.01.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013900174300001600313520101600329592002801345650001801373650001501391650001501406650001201421650001301433650001301446650002301459650001501482650001901497650001101516650000701527650002201534650002301556650001101579653003401590653004701624653004101671653003901712653003401751653004601785653003801831653003301869653004201902653003501944653001301979653001901992653002402011653001502035653003202050653002602082700002202108700002302130773010802153856008602261852000902347655001202356IND60590747820221122135819.0190318e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059074782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLessa, Emanuele F.10aChitosan/waste coffee-grounds composite: An efficient and eco-friendly adsorbent for removal of pharmaceutical contaminants from water  ap. 257-266.  aWaste coffee-grounds (WCG), a poorly explored source of biocompounds, were combined with chitosan (Cs) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in order to obtain composites. Overall, WCG showed a good interaction with the polymeric matrix and good dispersibility up to 10 wt-%. At 5 wt-% WCG, the composite exhibited a noticeable enhancement (from 10 to 44%) of the adsorption of pharmaceuticals (metamizol (MET), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), acetaminophen (ACE), and caffeine (CAF)) as compared to the pristine sample. The highest removal efficiency was registered at pH 6 and the removal followed the order ASA > CAF > ACE > MET. For all pharmaceuticals, the adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo-second order model, while the adsorption mechanism was explained by the Freundlich isotherm. Reuse experiments indicated that the WCG-containing composite has an attractive cost-effectiveness since it presented a remarkable reusability in at least five consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaspirin 3acaffeine 3achitosan 3acost effectiveness 3adesorption 3adispersibility 3amodels 3apH 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asorption isotherms 3awastes 0aChitosan (PubChem CID: 71853) 0aPoly(vinyl alcohol) (PubChem CID: 3083375) 0aHydrochloric acid (PubChem CID: 313) 0aGlutaraldehyde (PubChem CID: 3485) 0aMetamizol (PubChem CID: 3111) 0aAcetyl salicylic acid (PubChem CID: 2244) 0aAcetaminophen (PubChem CID: 1983) 0aCaffeine (PubChem CID: 2519) 0aSodium hydroxide (PubChem CID: 14798) 0aAcetic acid (PubChem CID: 176) 0aChitosan 0aCoffee grounds 0aChitosan composites 0aAdsorption 0aPharmaceutical contaminants 0aEmerging contaminants1 aNunes, Matheus L.1 aFajardo, André R.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 June 01, v. 189 p.257-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245010400210300001600314520171000330592002802040650001002068650002102078650002602099650001702125650001802142650001702160650002502177650002302202650003002225650001002255650001402265650001402279650001202293650001302305650001402318650001202332650003102344650001802375650002502393650001402418650002002432650002502452650001902477650001202496650002402508650001302532653002302545653002802568653001502596653000802611653001102619700002102630700002602651700002002677700002202697700002202719700002202741700001902763700001802782773009802800856008502898852000902983655001202992IND60568036820221118064855.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056803682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2016.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruce, Toby J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9912-060510aProspects for plant defence activators and biocontrol in IPM – Concepts and lessons learnt so far  ap. 128-134.  aThere is an urgent need to develop new interventions to manage pests because evolution of pesticide resistance and changes in legislation are limiting conventional control options for farmers. We investigated β-aminobutyric acid (BABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and fructose as possible plant defence activators against grey mould disease, Botrytis cinerea, and root knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. We also tested Trichogramma achaeae parasitoid wasps and an antifeedant plant extract for biocontrol of the invasive tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta. BABA and JA enhanced resistance of tomato plants to B. cinerea but neither treatment provided complete protection and the efficacy of treatment varied over time with BABA being more durable than JA. Efficacy was partly dependent on tomato cultivar, with some cultivars responding better to BABA treatment than others. Furthermore, treatment of tomato with BABA, JA and fructose led to partial suppression of M. incognita egg mass development. Biocontrol agent, T. achaeae, performance against T. absoluta could be enhanced by adjusting the rearing conditions. Both attack rate and longevity were improved by rearing the parasitoids on T. absoluta rather than on other insects. Finally, Ajuga chamaepitys extract was shown to have significant antifeedant activity against T. absoluta. Our findings suggest that there are potential new solutions for protection of crops but they are more complicated to deploy, more variable and require more biological knowledge than conventional pesticides. In isolation, they may not provide the same level of protection as pesticides but are likely to be more potent when deployed in combination in IPM strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAjuga 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aTrichogramma 3aTuta absoluta 3aantifeedants 3aantifeeding activity 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acrops 3acultivars 3aevolution 3afarmers 3afructose 3agray mold 3ainsects 3aintegrated pest management 3ajasmonic acid 3alaws and regulations 3alongevity 3aparasitic wasps 3apesticide resistance 3aplant extracts 3arearing 3aroot-knot nematodes 3atomatoes 0aInduced resistance 0aPlant defence activator 0aBiocontrol 0aIPM 0aTomato1 aSmart, Lesley E.1 aBirch, A.

The turbidity and orthophosphate (Pi) removal properties of chitosan (CHI), CMC, and CMC-CTA were compared in the presence (and absence) of FeCl3 coagulant. At a fixed FeCl3 dosage, the effects of flocculant dosage, pH and settling time were evaluated. Turbidity removal (%) and optimal dosage (FeCl3; mg/L) was determined: CMC-CTA (95.8%;5), CHI (88.8%;7.0) and CMC (68.8%;9.0). The corresponding Pi removal (%) and dosage (mg/L) are listed: (93.4%;10), (90.6%;10), and (67.4%;5). Optimal turbidity and Pi removal occurred at pH 4, where CMC-CTA had greater efficiency over CMC and CHI. The turbidity removal kinetics was described by the pseudo-second-order model, while Pi removal followed the pseudo-first-order model. The removal process involves cooperative Coulombic interactions between the biopolymer/Fe(III)/Pi and/or kaolinite colloids, along with polymer bridging effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3achitosan 3acoagulants 3acolloids 3aferric chloride 3aflocculants 3airon 3akaolinite 3amodels 3aorthophosphates 3apH 3aturbidity 3awastewater 0aCoagulation 0aFlocculation 0aOrthophosphate 0aChitosan 0aTurbidity 0aCarboxymethyl chitosan1 aWilson, Lee D.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2018 June 01, v. 189 p.360-370dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2018.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245008800176300001400264520165700278592002801935650001001963650002001973650002101993650001002014650002102024650001202045650002202057650001102079650001302090650002602103650001602129650001702145650002802162650001502190653003002205653004102235653002002276653001602296653002102312653002302333653001402356700002202370700002702392700001802419700002202437773009602459856008502555852000902640655001202649IND60568036920221118064834.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056803692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngevin, Frédérique10aAssessing the sustainability of crop production systems: Toward a common framework?  ap. 18-27.  aAll three dimensions of sustainability —economic, social and environmental— must be integrated into a holistic assessment framework in the development of sustainable cropping systems (CS). Numerous sustainability assessment methods meet this requirement, but most of them handle only one type of production system (arable crops, fruit or vegetables). We propose here a common framework for sustainability assessment applicable to various types of crop production. The DEXiPM model, which was designed for the ex ante assessment of innovative arable CS was adapted to other production systems. Three groups of experts analyzed and modified this model, to develop suitable methods for assessing the sustainability of pomefruit orchards, field vegetable systems, and grapevine systems. We used the resulting models to formalize a sustainability assessment framework, in which a fixed core of hierarchically organized generic agricultural sustainability issues can be weighted according to stakeholder priorities, and a set of basic attributes can be estimated in a flexible manner, depending on the situation to be assessed and the data available. This common framework for sustainability assessment has several advantages. It can facilitate communication between stakeholders involved in the development of innovative production systems. It can also help researchers to identify gaps in knowledge and the means of bridging them. Its results can provide recommendations for policy makers, concerning actions likely to incite the adoption of innovative systems, for example. We also consider the general applicability and limitations of this framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aex ante analysis 3aexperts 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aorchards 3aproduction technology 3aresearchers 3astakeholders 3asustainable agriculture 3avegetables 0aSustainability assessment 0aMulti-attribute decision-aid methods 0aCropping system 0aArable crop 0aField vegetables 0aPomefruit orchards 0aGrapevine1 aFortino, Gabriele1 aBockstaller, Christian1 aPelzer, Elise1 aMesséan, Antoine0 tCrop protection.g2017 July, v. 97 p.18-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013600165300001100301520174600312592002802058650002302086650001902109650001702128650002202145650001302167650001102180650002202191650002502213650001602238650002102254650002702275650000702302650003702309650001302346650001502359650002002374700002102394700001902415773012302434856008102557852000902638655001202647IND60485959720221119114232.0160312e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048595972DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-015-2001-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndriani, Ade10aEffects of saline-alkaline stress on benzo[a]pyrene biotransformation and ligninolytic enzyme expression by Bjerkandera adusta SM46  ap. 39.  aBenzo[a]pyrene (BaP) accumulates in marine organisms and contaminated coastal areas. The biotreatment of waste water using saline-alkaline-tolerant white rot fungi (WRF) represents a promising method for removing BaP under saline-alkaline conditions based on WRF’s ability to produce ligninolytic enzymes. In a pre-screening for degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of 82 fungal strains using Remazol brilliant blue R, Bjerkandera adusta SM46 exhibited the highest tolerance to saline-alkaline stress. Moreover, a B. adusta culture grown in BaP-containing liquid medium exhibited resistance to salinities up to 20 g l⁻¹. These conditions did not inhibit fungal growth or the expression of manganese peroxidase (MnP) or lignin peroxidase (LiP). The degradation rate also became higher as salinity increased to 20 g l⁻¹. Fungal growth and enzyme expression were inhibited at a salinity of 35 g l⁻¹. These inhibitory effects directly decreased the degradation rate (>24 %). The presence of MnSO₄ as an inducer improved the degradation rate and enzyme expression. MnP and LiP activity also increased by seven- and fivefold, respectively. SM46 degraded BaP (38–89 % over 30 days) in an acidic environment (pH 4.5) and under saline-alkaline stress conditions (pH 8.2). Investigating the metabolites produced revealed BaP-1,6-dione as the main product, indicating the important role of ligninolytic enzymes in initializing BaP cleavage. The other metabolites detected, naphthalene acetic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, benzoic acid, and catechol, may have been ring fission products. The wide range of activities observed suggests that B. adusta SM46 is a potential agent for biodegrading BaP under saline conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBjerkandera adusta 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abenzoic acid 3abiotransformation 3acatechol 3acoasts 3alignin peroxidase 3amanganese peroxidase 3ametabolites 3amicrobial growth 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3apH 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asalinity 3awastewater 3awhite-rot fungi1 aTachibana, Sanro1 aItoh, Kazutaka0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2016 Mar., v. 32, no. 3 p.39-39dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-2001-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04628naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012200167520297400289592002803263650003603291650002103327650002303348650001803371650001303389650002003402650001503422650001903437650002603456650002203482650001403504650001503518650002003533650001803553650003703571650002403608650001503632650002903647650002003676650001403696650001203710653002303722653000903745653001003754653001903764653001503783700001603798700001303814700001703827700001903844773010603863856008403969852000904053655001204062IND60761229920221120183335.0220110e20220220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076122992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2021.1044622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Huimin10aMembrane proteomic analysis identifies the polarity protein PARD3 as a novel antiviral protein against PEDV infection  aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic enteric coronavirus causing lethal watery diarrhea in suckling piglets. PEDV could remodel host membrane structures for their replication, assembly and escape from host cells. However, little is known about the host membrane proteins of PEDV infection. In this study, we analyzed differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between PEDV infection group and control group and identified the polarity protein PARD3 as one of the most significantly DAPs. PARD3 is implicated in the formation of tight junctions at epithelial cell-cell contacts. Then, we found that PEDV infection promoted the degradation of PARD3 via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Moreover, knockdown of PARD3 promoted the proliferation of PEDV. Further study showed that the downregulation of PARD3 altered the normal morphology of the tight junction proteins and promoted apical and basolateral virus proliferation. Tight junctions enable epithelial cells to form physical barriers, which act as an innate immune mechanism that can impede viral infection and PEDV affected the barrier functions by causing degradation of PARD3. Taken together, this work is the first time to investigate the membrane protein profile of PEDV-infected cells using quantitative proteomics and suggests that PARD3 could be a potential novel antiviral protein against PEDV infection.Membrane proteins are involved in various physiological and biochemical functions critical for cellular function. It is also dynamic in nature, where many proteins are changed during in response to environmental stress. However, membrane proteins are difficult to study because of their hydrophobicity. Membrane proteomic methods using mass spectrometry analysis have been developed and applied for the characterization of the plasma membrane and subcellular organelles of various virus infected cells. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric pathogen of importance to the swine industry, causing high mortality in neonatal piglets. Because PEDV infected Vero cells can lead to significant changes in cell membrane morphology and form syncytial lesions. Here, we isolated the membrane proteins of PEDV infected and control cells and applied isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantitatively identify the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in PEDV-infected Vero cells and confirmed the DAPs by performing RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Among these differential proteins, we focused on a down-regulated protein PARD3 which is important for cell tight junction and cell polarity. Loss of PARD3 can destroy the tight junction of cells and promote the proliferation of PEDV in the apical and basolateral sides. These findings will provide valuable information to better understand the mechanisms underlying the host defense responses to PEDV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3aWestern blotting 3aantiviral proteins 3acell polarity 3adiarrhea 3aenteropathogens 3aepithelium 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid chromatography 3amembrane proteins 3amortality 3aorganelles 3aplasma membrane 3apork industry 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein composition 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atight junctions 3aubiquitin 3aviruses 0aMembrane proteomic 0aPEDV 0aPARD3 0aTight junction 0aPDZ domain1 aLi, Yongtao1 aWang, Li1 aSong, Yapeng1 aZhang, Gaiping0 tJournal of proteomics.g2022 Feb. 20, v. 253 p.104462-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2021.1044623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012700168300001800295520201700313592002802330650002302358650002802381650001702409650002302426650001302449651002002462700001502482700001502497700001602512700001502528773013302543856008202676852000902758655001202767IND60759207520221121004656.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075920752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-021-1704-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Chad Yixian10aUse of the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment to Identify Pre-Frailty and Frailty in Hospitalized Older Adults  ap. 1229-1234.  aOBJECTIVES: The Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) and Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) are widely used in acute care settings to assess nutritional and frailty status, respectively. We aimed to determine whether the scored PG-SGA can identify pre-frailty and frailty status, to simultaneously evaluate malnutrition and frailty in clinical practice. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 329 consecutive patients admitted to an acute medical unit in South Australia. MEASUREMENTS: Nutritional and frailty status were ascertained with scored PG-SGA and EFS, respectively. Optimal cut-off scores to identify pre-frailty and frailty were determined by calculating the Scored PG-SGA’s sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, Youden Index (YI), Liu index, Receiver Operator Curves (ROC) and Area Under Curve (AUC). Nutritional status and patient characteristics were analysed according to frailty categories. RESULTS: The optimal cut-off PG-SGA score as determined by the highest YI, to identify both pre-frailty and frailty was >3, with a sensitivity of 0.711 and specificity of 0.746. The AUC was 0.782 (95% CI 0.731–0.833). In this cohort, 64% of the patients were well-nourished, 26% were moderately malnourished and 10% were severely malnourished. Forty-three percent, 24% and 33% of the patients were classified as robust, pre-frail and frail, respectively. Bivariate analysis showed that those robust were significantly younger than those who were pre-frail (−2.8, 95% CI −5.5 to −0.1, p=0.036) or frail (−3.4, 95% CI −5.9 to −1.0, p=0.002). Robust patients had significantly lower Scored PG-SGA than those who were pre-frail (−2.5, 95%CI −3.8 to −1.1, p<0.001) or frail (−4.9, 95% CI −6.1 to −3.7, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Scored PG-SGA is moderately sensitive in identifying pre-frailty/frailty in older hospitalized adults and can be useful in identifying both conditions concurrently.  aPublisher supplied data 3abivariate analysis 3across-sectional studies 3amalnutrition 3anutritional status 3apatients 3aSouth Australia1 aSharma, Y.1 aYaxley, A.1 aBaldwin, C.1 aMiller, M.0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2021 Dec., v. 25, no. 10 p.1229-1234dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl4279172x1279-77077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-021-1704-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245009700205300001400302520212300316592002802439650002002467650001202487650001202499650001902511650001902530650002202549650001302571650001102584650001502595650002002610650001102630650001502641650001402656650002002670650001502690650002302705650002502728650001002753651001102763653001902774653001502793653001302808653001602821653001302837653001402850653001802864700002202882700002802904700002102932773009702953856008103050852000903131655001203140IND60555419820221121203153.0180905s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055541982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2016.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaanaia, Nabil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3673-728510aHow will climate change affect the vegetation cycle over France? A generic modeling approach  ap. 31-42.  aThe implementation of adaptation strategies of agriculture and forestry to climate change is conditioned by the knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the vegetation cycle and of the associated uncertainties. Using the same generic Land Surface Model (LSM) to simulate the response of various vegetation types is more straightforward than using several specialized crop and forestry models, as model implementation differences are difficult to assess. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of a LSM to address this issue. Using the SURFEX (“Surface Externalisée”) modeling platform, we produced and analyzed 150-yr (1950–2100) simulations of the biomass of four vegetation types (rainfed straw cereals, rainfed grasslands, broadleaf and needleleaf forests) and of the soil water content associated to each of these vegetation types over France. Statistical methods were used to quantify the impact of climate change on simulated phenological dates. The duration of soil moisture stress periods increases everywhere in France, especially for grasslands with, on average, an increase of 9days per year in near-future (NF) conditions and 36days per year in distant-future (DF) conditions. For all the vegetation types, leaf onset and the annual maximum LAI occur earlier. For straw cereals in the Languedoc-Provence-Corsica area, NF leaf onset occurs 18days earlier and 37days earlier in DF conditions, on average. On the other hand, local discrepancies are simulated for the senescence period (e.g. earlier in western and southern France for broadleaf forests, slightly later in mountainous areas of eastern France) for both NF and DF. Changes in phenological dates are more uncertain in DF than in NF conditions in relation to differences in climate models, especially for forests. Finally, it is shown that while changes in leaf onset are mainly driven by air temperature, longer soil moisture stress periods trigger earlier leaf senescence over most of France. This shows that developing in situ soil moisture networks could help monitoring the long-term impacts of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abiomass 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adeciduous forests 3aforestry 3agrains 3agrasslands 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3arisk management 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3astatistical analysis 3astraw 3aFrance 0aClimate change 0aAdaptation 0aModeling 0aAgriculture 0aForestry 0aPhenology 0aSoil moisture1 aCarrer, Dominique1 aCalvet, Jean-Christophe1 aPage, Christian,0 tClimate risk management.g2016, v. 13 p.31-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2016.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009300154300001600247520091300263592002801176650002301204650002201227650001701249650003101266650001301297650002401310650001401334700001701348700001401365700002001379773011701399856007301516852000901589655001201598IND60577712820221118015619.0170810e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057771282DNAL7 a10.1021/ma201872e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ran10aSalt Effects on Sol–Gel Transition of Telechelic Polyelectrolytes in Aqueous Solutions  ap. 555-562.  aUsing Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we focus on the physical gelation behavior and conformation change under the existence of additional monovalent salt, which provides screening to the electrostatic interaction of charged telechelic polyelectrolyte chains and causes new balance between hydrophobic interaction of end groups and electrostatic interaction originated from the polyelectrolyte blocks.

Characterizing seasonal patterns of variation in the size spectrum is necessary so that monitoring programs can be designed to minimize the masking effects that seasonal processes can have on detecting longer-term temporal change. We used a random effects model to measure monthly, annual, and interlake variability in the slope (i.e., relative abundance of small and large organisms) and centered height (i.e., total abundance) of the crustacean zooplankton normalized abundance size spectrum from 1981 to 2011 among eight Canadian Shield lakes. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the slope was a relatively stable characteristic of the zooplankton community compared with the height, which varied significantly among lakes. We identified a seasonal signal in height and slope and used a mixed effects model to characterize the linear rate of change from May to October; there was an overall decline in height and an overall increase in slope. Seasonal variance was greater than annual variance for both the height and the slope, suggesting that long-term monitoring of lakes and interlake comparisons using zooplankton size spectra should be based on temporally standardized sampling protocols that minimize the effects of seasonal processes. We recommend sampling the zooplankton community in midsummer because this results in size spectrum estimates close to seasonal mean values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanadian Shield 3aCrustacea 3alakes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3avariance 3azooplankton 3aCanada1 aShuter, Brian John1 aSprules, William Gary1 aMinns, Charles Kenneth1 aRusak, James Anthony0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2019, v. 76, no. 12 p.2268-2287dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-03713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015400167300001600321520235100337592002802688650001402716650002002730650003102750650001402781650001002795650001702805650001002822650001502832650001702847650001902864650001902883650003002902650001702932650001102949650001202960650001102972653003002983653002003013653001903033653002503052700001803077700001903095700001603114700001803130700001903148700001403167700001903181700001903200700001603219700001803235700001603253773012403269856005203393852000903445655001203454IND60761230220221120215025.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076123022DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(21)60079-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Qiang,10aXinglou Chengqi Decoction improves neurological function in experimental stroke mice as evidenced by gut microbiota analysis and network pharmacology  ap. 881-899.  aThe current study was designed to explore the brain protection mechanism of Xinglou Chengqi Decoction (XCD) based on gut microbiota analysis and network pharmacology. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of mice was established, followed by behavioral evaluation, TTC and TUNEL staining. Additionally, to investigate the effects of gut microbiota on neurological function after stroke, C57BL/6 mice were treated with anti-biotic cocktails 14 days prior to ischemic stroke (IS) to deplete the gut microbiota. High-throughput 16S rDNA gene sequencing, metabonomics technique, and flow multifactor technology were used to analyze bacterial communities, SCFAs and inflammatory cytokines respectively. Finally, as a supplement, network pharmacology and molecular docking were applied to fully explore the multicomponent-multitarget-multichannel mechanism of XCD in treating IS, implicated in ADME screening, target identification, network analysis, functional annotation, and pathway enrichment analysis. We found that XCD effectively improved neurological function, relieved cerebral infarction and decreased the neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, XCD promoted the release of anti-inflammatory factor like IL-10, while down-regulating pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-17A, and IL-22. Furthermore, XCD significantly increased the levels of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyric acid. The mechanism might be related to the regulation of SCFAs-producing bacteria like Verrucomicrobia and Akkermansia, and bacteria that regulate inflammation like Paraprevotella, Roseburia, Streptophyta and Enterococcu. Finally, in the network pharmacological analysis, 51 active compounds in XCD and 44 intersection targets of IS and XCD were selected. As a validation, components in XCD docked well with key targets. It was obviously that biological processes were mainly involved in the regulation of apoptotic process, inflammatory response, response to fatty acid, and regulation of establishment of endothelial barrier in GO enrichment. XCD can improve neurological function in experimental stroke mice, partly due to the regulation of gut microbiota. Besises, XCD has the characteristic of “multi-component, multi-target and multi-channel” in the treatment of IS revealed by network pharmacology and molecular docking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRoseburia 3aVerrucomicrobia 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3abutyric acid 3agenes 3ainfarction 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3aneurons 3astroke 0aXinglou Chengqi Decoction 0aIschemic stroke 0aGut microbiota 0aNetwork pharmacology1 aHAN, Zhen-Yun1 aTIAN, Dan-Feng1 aLIU, Gan-Lu1 aWANG, Zhen-Yi1 aLIN, Jing-Feng1 aCHANG, Ze1 aZHANG, Dan-Dan1 aXIE, Ying-Zhen1 aSUN, Yi-Kun1 aYAO, Xing-Wei1 aMA, Da-Yong0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2021 Dec., v. 19, no. 12 p.881-899dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(21)60079-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03729naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014500167300001600312520200700328592002802335650002202363650002802385650002202413650002302435650001102458650001902469650001702488650001802505650001802523650001802541650001302559650001802572650001202590650001702602650001002619650001702629651001002646653002002656653002302676653001002699653002102709653002202730653002502752653003002777700001702807700001502824700001702839700001902856700001802875700001502893700001602908700001802924773012402942856005203066852000903118655001203127IND60761230320221122164341.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076123032DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(21)60104-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Yan,10aExploring the mechanism of Buxue Yimu Pill on hemorrhagic anemia through molecular docking, network pharmacology and experimental validation  ap. 900-911.  aBuxue Yimu Pill (BYP) is a classic gynecological medicine in China, which is composed of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Leonurus japonicus Houtt, Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, Colla corii asini and Citrus reticulata Blanco. It has been widely used in clinical therapy with the function of enriching Blood, nourishing Qi, and removing blood stasis. The current study was designed to determine the bioactive molecules and therapeutic mechanism of BYP against hemorrhagic anemia. Herein, GC-MS and UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS were employed to identify the chemical compounds from BYP. The genecards database (https: //www.genecards.org/) was used to obtain the potential target proteins related to hemorrhagic anemia. Autodock/Vina was adopted to evaluate the binding ability of protein receptors and chemical ligands. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were conducted using the ClusterProfiler. As a result, a total of 62 candidate molecules were identified and 152 targets related to hemorrhagic anemia were obtained. Furthermore, 34 active molecules and 140 targets were obtained through the virtual screening experiment. The data of molecular-target (M-T), target-pathway (T-P), and molecular-target-pathway (M-T-P) network suggested that 32 active molecules enhanced hematopoiesis and activated the immune system by regulating 57 important targets. Pharmacological experiments showed that BYP significantly increased the counts of RBC, HGB, and HCT, and significantly down-regulated the expression of EPO, IL-6, CSF3, NOS2, VEGFA, PDGFRB, and TGFB1. The results also showed that leonurine, leonuriside B, leosibiricin, ononin, rutin, astragaloside I, riligustilide and levistolide A, were the active molecules closely related to enriching Blood. In conclusion, based on molecular docking, network pharmacology and validation experiment results, the enriching blood effect of BYP on hemorrhagic anemia may be associated with hematopoiesis, anti-inflammation, and immunity enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngelica sinensis 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3aCitrus reticulata 3aLeonurus japonicus 3aanemia 3aastragalosides 3ablood stasis 3agene ontology 3ahematopoiesis 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3ainterleukin-6 3aligands 3apharmacology 3arutin 3atherapeutics 3aChina 0aBuxue Yimu Pill 0aHemorrhagic anemia 0aGC-MS 0aUPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS 0aMolecular docking 0aNetwork pharmacology 0aExperimental pharmacology1 aCAO, Xu-Yuan1 aLIU, Bo-Yu1 aDAI, Yong-Qi1 aZHOU, Heng-Jun1 aHE, Juan-Juan1 aGong, Yun,1 aWU, Xue-Wen1 aTANG, Huai-Bo0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2021 Dec., v. 19, no. 12 p.900-911dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(21)60104-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245007500172300001400247520113700261592002801398650001501426650001701441650001901458650001201477650001401489650001701503650002001520650001901540650002201559650002001581650001501601650001601616653001701632653003401649653002301683653002801706653002701734653002001761653001901781773010601800856008801906852000901994655001202003IND60564211320221117232230.0180830e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056421132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarde, Hermann10aScrutinizing the carbon cycle and CO2 residence time in the atmosphere  ap. 19-26.  aClimate scientists presume that the carbon cycle has come out of balance due to the increasing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change. This is made responsible for the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations over recent years, and it is estimated that the removal of the additional emissions from the atmosphere will take a few hundred thousand years. Since this goes along with an increasing greenhouse effect and a further global warming, a better understanding of the carbon cycle is of great importance for all future climate change predictions. We have critically scrutinized this cycle and present an alternative concept, for which the uptake of CO2 by natural sinks scales proportional with the CO2 concentration. In addition, we consider temperature dependent natural emission and absorption rates, by which the paleoclimatic CO2 variations and the actual CO2 growth rate can well be explained. The anthropogenic contribution to the actual CO2 concentration is found to be 4.3%, its fraction to the CO2 increase over the Industrial Era is 15% and the average residence time 4years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aemissions 3afossil fuels 3afuel combustion 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse effect 3aland use change 3aprediction 3atemperature 0aCarbon cycle 0aAtmospheric CO2 concentration 0aCO2 residence time 0aAnthropogenic emissions 0aFossil fuel combustion 0aLand use change 0aClimate change0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2017 May, v. 152 p.19-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245011700172300001800289500002400307520084400331650001401175650001401189650002201203650001201225650001501237650002101252650001301273650001101286650001601297650001101313700002001324700001501344700002101359773009801380852000901478856005301487655001201540IND4405026120221116232356.0080428e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440502612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBootsma, Jason A.10aHydrolysis of oligosaccharides from distillers grains using organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silica catalysts  ap. 5226-5231.  aIncludes references  aThe use of propylsulfonic acid-functionalized mesoporous silica as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of oligosaccharides released by hydrothermal pretreatment of distiller's grains was examined in batch reactor studies.

This higher temperature operation allowed for more selective recovery of glucose, but was detrimental to arabinose recovery since significant degradation occurred. Xylose recovery efficiency improved with increasing temperature, but the higher temperature led to increased degradation. Using a model feed, solubilized proteins were found to deactivate the organic-inorganic hybrid catalyst, but a simple pretreatment with activated silica was found to alleviate the deactivation. 3aarabinose 3acatalysts 3adistillers grains 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3aoligosaccharides 3aproteins 3asilica 3atemperature 3axylose1 aEntorf, Matthew1 aEder, Judd1 aShanks, Brent H.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Aug., v. 99, no. 12 p.5226-5231dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.09.033 7aarticle02987naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245015400167300001600321500002400337520187400361650001302235650000902248650001102257650001302268650002602281650002402307650001202331650001102343650002102354650002702375650001102402650001802413700002202431773010302453852000902556856004802565655001202613IND4441607020221116232440.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444160702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-010-0482-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennis Thomas, T.10aIn vitro propagation for the conservation of a rare medicinal plant Justicia gendarussa Burm. f. by nodal explants and shoot regeneration from callus  ap. 943-950.  aIncludes references  aJusticia gendarussa is a valuable medicinal plant and various parts of this plant are pharmaceutically used for the treatment of different diseases. In vitro regeneration of shoot buds was obtained from culture of nodal cuttings as well as shoot regeneration from callus. The nodal cuttings differed in shoot proliferation in terms of percentage of explants that responded and average shoot length with various concentrations (4.4, 8.9, 13.3, 17.7, 22.2 μM) of 6-benzyladenine (BA), kinetin (Kn) and thidiazuron. In all treatments, one shoot was invariably present. Optimum 87% of cultures responded with an average shoot length of 4.4 cm on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 17.7 μM BA. Callus was induced from the mature leaf segments on MS medium supplemented with Kn (4.7, 13.9, 23.2 μM) alone or in combination with 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D; 2.3 μM, 4.5 μM). Optimum callus induction (78%) was obtained on MS medium supplemented with 14 μM Kn and 4.5 μM 2, 4-D. When the callus was subcultured on MS medium fortified with BA (8.9, 17.7, 26.6 μM) or Kn (9.3, 18.6, 27.9 μM) alone or in combination with α naphthalene acetic acid (NAA; 2.7, 5.4 μM), shoot regeneration was obtained. The highest response (92%) was observed on MS medium containing 17.7 μM BA and 5.4 μM NAA. On this medium, an average number of 12.2 shoots were obtained per responding callus. The shoots obtained from callus and nodal cuttings were rooted with a frequency of 73% on MS medium augmented with 9.8 μM indole-3-butyric acid. The rooted shoots were successfully transplanted to soil and sand mixture (1:1) with 90% survival rate. The protocol standardized for shoot proliferation and regeneration in J. gendarussa from nodal cuttings and leaf-derived callus is suitable for micropropagation and conservation of this essential medicinal plant. 3aJusticia 3abuds 3acallus 3aexplants 3ain vitro regeneration 3aindole butyric acid 3akinetin 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3ashoots 3asurvival rate1 aYoichiro, Hoshino0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2010 Sept., v. 32, no. 5 p.943-950dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-010-0482-1 7aarticle01860naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245008500171300001400256500001500270520057600285650002500861650002200886650001800908650002800926650002400954650001700978650001900995650001401014650001601028650002301044651001801067653003401085653003601119653002801155773009301183852000901276856009401285930003301379945001301412946001301425655001201438IND2049238220221116231900.0951218e199509  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204923822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00555.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacler, B.A.10aDeveloping a national drinking water regulation for disinfection of ground water  ap. 77-84.  a2019-12-04  aThe Safe Drinking Water Act directs EPA to promulgate requirements for disinfection of ground water-based drinking water systems.

An unsaturated zone soil core was subjected to a flow of nitrogen gas, oxygen, water vapor, and vapor-phase hydrocarbons in a configuration analogous to a biofilter or an in situ bioventing or sparging situation. The vertical profiles of vapor-phase hydrocarbon concentration in the soil core were determined by gas chromatography of vapor samples. Biodegradation reduced low influent hydrocarbon concentrations by 45 to 92 percent over a 0.6-m interval of an intact soil core. The estimated total hydrocarbon concentration was reduced by 75 percent from 26 to 7 parts per million. Steady-state concentrations were input to a simple analytical model balancing advection and first-order biodegradation of hydrocarbons. First-order rate constants for the major hydrocarbon compounds were used to calibrate the model to the concentration profiles. Rate constants for the seven individual hydrocarbon compounds varied by a factor of 4. Compounds with lower molecular weights, fewer methyl groups, and no quaternary carbons tended to have higher rate constants. The first-order rate constants were consistent with kinetic parameters determined from both microcosm and tubing cluster studies at the field site. 3ahydrocarbons 3apetroleum 3asoil pollution 3asoil microorganisms 3abiodegradation 3akinetics 3amathematical models 3aMichigan 0acomparisons1 aOstendorf, D.W.1 aRichards, R.J.1 aGoodwin, S.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1996 Winter, v. 16, no. 1 p.141-153x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1996.tb00581.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03154naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245008600174300001600260500001500276520183500291650002502126650002302151650001102174650000902185650001302194650001402207650001902221650001202240650001202252650001602264650001002280653001702290653001702307653002602324700002102350700001602371700001902387700001902406773009702425852000902522856009402531930003302625945001302658946001302671655001202684IND2063067120221116231226.0980410e199706  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206306712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb00596.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalanitro, J.P.10aUse of aerobic and anaerobic microcosms to assess BTEX biodegradation in aquifers  ap. 210-221.  a2019-12-04  aThe natural attenuation of soluble aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) in aquifer plumes is controlled by several factors, including the concentration of BTEX and dissolved oxygen (DO) or other electron acceptors (EA), hydrogeological factors (dispersion, dilution, aquifer reaeration rate), and the presence of BTEX-degrading microbes. We have investigated three laboratory soil and/or well water systems (aerobic, anaerobic, and chronic low DO) which may represent field plume conditions. Microcosms prepared with sufficient DO always degraded hydrocarbons (less than or equal to 10,000 ppb) at high rates (greater than or equal to 0.10/d) with no lag phase. Experimental simulations of chronic low DO were performed in a pressure transducer controlled respirometer in which O2 was maintained at constant low levels (e.g., 0.2 to 2 mg/L). BTX also biodegraded rapidly (0.3 to 0.7/d) at all DO levels. These results suggest that plumes which appear to have low DO but continuous O2 infiltration significantly bioattenuate hydrocarbons. The anaerobic biodegradation potential of BTEX was determined in microcosms prepared with subsoil or well water samples amended with NO3(-), Fe(+3), SO4(-2), or no added EA. Well water from the "aerobic" or "anaerobic" portions of one site plume showed losses in BTEX, but there was no correlation between the presence of reduced EA and degradation. Anaerobic slurries prepared from subsoil of another site showed a significant decrease (0.02 to 0.25/d) in BTEX with lag times of 0 to 40 days. Reduced gases (CH4, H2S, H2) were not produced, but high concentrations of soil-bound Fe(+2) formed, suggesting that Fe(+3) may have been a predominant anaerobic EA. These data indicate that the presumed consumption/reduction of anaerobic EA may not always be coupled to BTEX losses in ground water plumes. 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaerobic conditions 3axylene 3asoil 3aaquifers 3apollution 3abiodegradation 3atoluene 3abenzene 3agroundwater 3awells 0acontaminants 0aethylbenzene 0aaromatic hydrocarbons1 aWisniewski, H.L.1 aByers, D.L.1 aNeaville, C.C.1 aSchroder, R.A.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1997 Summer, v. 17, no. 3 p.210-221x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb00596.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02995naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245006900171300001600240520169200256650001201948650003001960650001301990650001602003650003002019650001902049650002002068650001502088650000902103650001302112650001402125651001102139653001302150653003002163653002702193700001902220700002002239700002102259773009502280852000902375856009402384930003302478945001302511946001302524655001202537IND2123270820221116231452.0980610e199709  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212327082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb01272.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindberg, J.10aSpodic material for in situ treatment of arsenic in ground water  ap. 125-130.  aThe leaching of chromium-copper-arsenic salts from old wood preservation sites is a threat to ground water at many places in Sweden. The installation of in situ reactive barriers is an attractive "passive" technique to prevent the further spreading of contaminants. The use of peat as a reactive barrier material has been suggested for heavy metals, but this material was expected to be unsatisfactory for arsenic (As). Therefore, the feasibility of using spodic B horizon material for the retention of arsenic was tested in laboratory column experiments. Contaminated soil was taken from an old preservation site and leached under conditions designed to imitate the field conditions. The arsenic load during the three-month duration of the test corresponded to a load at the field site during three years. The B horizon material proved to be efficient for retention of arsenic, despite the observation that As(III) dominated the As speciation. The As(III) concentration was reduced from 1 to 3 mg dm-3 to < 0.02 mg dm-3. Pure peat was, as expected, not suited as a reactive barrier for As, and a mixed B horizon/peat reactive barrier also proved unsatisfactory for the removal of As. It is therefore important to separate the B horizon material from any peat that is used to sorb heavy metals. Before applying the B horizon reactive barrier technique in the field, the effect of the naturally occurring variability of the reactive compounds should be tested. The inclusion of oxidizing agents in the barrier could possibly improve the lifetime considerably. Furthermore, the influence of the flow rate should be evaluated since the kinetics of the arsenic adsorption is relatively slow. 3aarsenic 3achromated copper arsenate 3aleaching 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3apolluted soils 3aspodic horizons 3aB horizons 3apeat 3asorption 3aleachates 3aSweden 0abarriers 0ain situ reactive barriers 0aremediation techniques1 aSterneland, J.1 aJohansson, P.O.1 aGustafsson, J.P.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1997 Fall, v. 17, no. 4 p.125-130x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb01272.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02365naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245010100174300001400275520111200289650003001401650001901431650002501450650002501475650001501500650001701515650002401532650002901556653001701585653002401602653002101626700001701647700001801664700001801682773009301700852000901793856009401802930003301896945001301929946001301942655001201955IND2123270620221116231815.0980610e199709  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212327062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb01268.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChevalier, L.R.10aExperimental investigation of surfactant-enhanced dissolution of residual NAPL in saturated soil  ap. 89-98.  aNonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) is a long-term source of ground water contamination as the pollutant slowly partitions into the air and water phases. The objective of this work was to study the efficacy of aqueous surfactant solution to enhance the dissolution of a residual NAPL below the capillary fringe, hence reducing the time needed for aquifer restoration. An analytical technique was developed to measure the concentration of NAPL in a nonionic surfactant. Soil column experiments simulated conditions in the saturated soil where a NAPL may become trapped as a discontinuous immobile phase. Experimental results indicate that dissolution was a rate-limited process, approaching equilibrium concentrations after 24 hours. The relative permeability of the aqueous phase initially decreased as surfactant was injected, but increased over time as the saturation of residual NAPL was reduced through mass transfer into the surfactant-enhanced aqueous phase. These findings suggest that enhancing the aqueous phase with a nonionic surfactant may significantly enhance the in situ recovery or residual NAPL. 3agroundwater contamination 3apolluted soils 3asaturated conditions 3anonionic surfactants 3asolubility 3apermeability 3amathematical models 3anonaqueous phase liquids 0acontaminants 0atransport processes 0atransport models1 aMasten, S.J.1 aWallace, R.B.1 aWiggert, D.C.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1997 Fall, v. 17, no. 4 p.89-98x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1997.tb01268.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980702b19980709c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02755naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245009800171300001600269520162500285650001001910650001901920650001601939650001301955650001401968650001201982650001801994650002502012650001702037651001402054653002602068700001602094773009702110852000902207856009402216930003302310945001302343946001302356655001202369IND2199331920221116232029.0990616e199904  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219933192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1999.tb00212.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkel, R.S.10aNaturally occurring arsenic in sandstone aquifer water supply wells of northeastern Wisconsin  ap. 114-121.  aThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 50 microgram/L for arsenic was exceeded in 86 of 2125 water supply wells sampled over a broad geographic range in parts of Brown, Outagamie, and Winnebago Counties, Wisconsin. The hydrologic and geochemical properties of the area were examined and the source of arsenic was determined to be natural. Ground water collected from two geologic formations, the St. Peter Sandstone and the overlying Platteville/Galena Dolomite, was found to be the principal source of the elevated arsenic concentrations. These two formations supply a large portion of eastern Wisconsin private wells with their drinking water. Three wells were found within Outagamie County to have an unusually low pH. Results suggest that the cause of the low pH in these wells is of natural origin induced by the oxidation of iron sulfide minerals. In this reaction iron sulfide minerals are oxidized, forming sulfuric acid causing a low pH and a high concentration of various metals to leach from native rock formations into the water supply. Based on the data gathered from this study. an arsenic advisory area was designated for both Outagamie and Winnebago Counties. Guidelines were developed for well drillers and owners constructing new wells within the advisory area to reduce the likelihood of arsenic presence in the water supply. Fifteen wells containing arsenic exceeding the MCL were successfully reconstructed or new wells were constructed based on the guidelines developed. These constructions substantially reduced arsenic levels in the well water supplies. 3awells 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3aaquifers 3asandstone 3aarsenic 3awater quality 3aspatial distribution 3ageochemistry 3aWisconsin 0avertical distribution1 aStoll, R.C.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1999 Spring, v. 19, no. 2 p.114-121x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1999.tb00212.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02059naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245008600160300001600246520107400262650001601336650001801352650002401370650002201394650001201416700002601428773010301454852000901557856008501566930003301651945001301684946001301697990002301710655001201733IND2052772320221116231454.0960827e199512  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205277232DNAL7 a10.1177/1077727X9502420042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNies, J.I.10aEffect of safe food handling programming on participants' food handling behaviors  ap. 161-179.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which participants adopted safe food handling behaviors after attending food safety programs conducted by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service. One hundred telephone interviews with program participants were completed. The interview schedule included 16 food handling questions. Participants reported practicing safe food handling behaviors a higher percentage of the time after participating in the programs than before participating in the programs. The food handling behaviors showing statistically significant changes included thawing frozen food in the refrigerator; using appliance thermometers; keeping food preparation areas clean; washing hands before handling food, after handling raw meat, and before handling cooked food; refrigerating perishable foods promptly; and using different cutting boards for raw meats and other foods. Based on participant responses, the food safety programs appear to be effective in the promotion of behavioral change and the adoption of safe food handling behaviors. 3afood safety 3afood handling 3aextension education 3aconsumer behavior 3asurveys1 aGentry Van Laanen, P.0 tFamily and consumer sciences research journal.g1995 Dec., v. 24, no. 2 p.161-179x1077-727X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077727X9502420043Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdTHW  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01320naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115242010800130245010700238300001600345500002400361500001500385520011400400650001400514653003100528653004200559653002500601653001800626653003100644653003400675653003300709653002600742653003500768773008200803852000900885939003300894945000800927946001100935655001200946991593470120742620221116231443.0840726e198403  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aPAR840048072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubois, G.14aThe genera Prosostephanus Lutz, 1935 and Duboisia Szidat, 1936 (Trematoda: Strigeata: Cyathocotyloidea)14aLes genres Prosostephanus Lutz, 1935 et Duboisia Szidat, 1936 (Trematoda: Strigeata: Cyathocotyloidea)  ap. 149-155.  aSummary in English.  a2019-12-05  adescriptions of Prosostephanus and Duboisia, measurements given for P. industrius, key to species of Duboisia 3ahelminths 0aanimal parasites and pests 0aProsostephanus industrius (Trematoda) 0aDuboisia (Trematoda) 0aanimal health 0aProsostephanus (Trematoda) 0aDuboisia teganuma (Trematoda) 0aDuboisia syriaca (Trematoda) 0aMorphology, Trematoda 0aDuboisia skrjabini (Trematoda)0 tRevue suisse de zoologie.g1984 Mar., v. 91, no. 1 p.149-155x0035-418X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840726c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03026naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010300168300001600271500001500287520167500302650002301977650001902000650001002019650001902029650002202048650002602070650001402096650001902110650001602129650001502145650001802160650001702178651001002195653002002205700001702225700001402242700001702256700001402273700001602287773008302303852000902386856009202395930003302487945001302520946001102533655001202544IND2333007420221116231549.0030611e20020912enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233300742DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00725.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaina, J.G.10aDigestibility and feeding value of some feed ingredients fed to tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.)  ap. 853-862.  a2019-12-04  aThe apparent digestibility of protein, organic matter and energy of high-fibre and fibre-reduced sunflower cakes, Kenya's 'omena' fishmeal, anchovy fishmeal and wheat bran were investigated in tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) fingerlings. The feeding values and protein qualities of the above ingredients were also determined at two dietary protein levels. Fourteen diets were formulated, and each was provided to three tanks containing 12 fish in Expt 1 (digestibility study) and 25 fish in Expt 2 (feeding trial). Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations were maintained above 26 degrees C and 5.5 mg L(-1) respectively. Anchovy and 'omena' fishmeals each had an apparent digestibility coefficient for protein (ADC-P) of 90%, whereas the fibre-reduced and high-fibre sunflower cakes had ADC-P values of 89% and 86%. Wheat bran had an ADC-P value of 75%, which was significantly lower than those found for the other test ingredients. Apparent digestibility coefficients for energy (ADC-E) and digestible energy values (DE) were 86% and 78% and 4003 kcal kg(-1) and 3624 kcal kg(-1) for anchovy and omena fishmeals respectively. The corresponding values for the plant protein sources were 42% and 30% and 2200 kcal kg(-1) and 1400 kcal kg(-1) for the fibre-reduced and high-fibre sunflower cakes respectively. Diets based on the fibre-reduced cake had higher levels of all amino acids than those based on the high-fibre cake. Fish fed diets with 30% protein gained 40 g and had a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 1.87, whereas those fed diets with 20% protein gained 35 g and had a FCR of 2.2. The source of protein had a significant effect on weight gain. 3adigestible protein 3aenergy content 3afeeds 3aorganic matter 3adigestible energy 3aOreochromis niloticus 3afish meal 3asunflower meal 3aingredients 3awheat bran 3adigestibility 3afish feeding 3aKenya 0anutritive value1 aBeames, R.M.1 aHiggs, D.1 aMbugua, P.N.1 aIwama, G.1 aKisia, S.M.0 tAquaculture research.g2002 Sept. 12, v. 33, no. 11 p.853-862x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00725.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02802naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245017100168300001600339500001500355520144000370650001601810650002301826650001601849650001001865650001601875650002501891650001801916650002701934650001701961650002401978650001302002653000902015653001102024700001702035700001902052700001602071700001602087773008302103852000902186856009202195930003302287945001302320946001102333655001202344IND2333010220221116231329.0030611e20020912enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233301022DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00727.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJobling, M.10aInfluence of a dietary shift on temporal changes in fat deposition and fatty acid composition of Atlantic salmon post-smolt during the early phase of seawater rearing  ap. 875-889.  a2019-12-04  aThe proportion of body fat in farmed fish correlates with the concentration of fat in the feed, and the fatty acid composition of the storage fat usually reflects that of the lipids in the feed. We examined the time course of changes in fatty acid compositions of fillet, viscera and carcass of Atlantic salmon post-smolt over 14 weeks after transfer from fresh water to seawater. The fish had been fed either high-(34%) or low- (22%) fat feeds based upon either fish or vegetable oils during freshwater rearing. Changes in tissue fat concentrations and fatty acid compositions were studied to assess the extent to which lipid turnover and fatty acid metabolism might contribute to temporal changes in fatty acid profiles. When given a 41% protein, 31% fat, fish oil-based feed, the tissue fatty acid profiles of salmon fed vegetable oil-based feeds in fresh water gradually came to resemble those of fish fed the fish oil-based feed throughout freshwater and seawater rearing. The changes in tissue fatty acid compositions were greatest during the second half of the study, corresponding to the time at which growth rates of the fish were highest (SGRs weeks 0-6, 0.3-0.6% day(-1); weeks 0-14 SGRs > 1% day(-1)). As the fish increased in size and body fat increased, their tissue fatty acid compositions seemed to be influenced more by deposition of fatty acids obtained from the feed than by lipid turnover and fatty acid metabolism. 3aSalmo salar 3atemporal variation 3afatty acids 3afeeds 3adietary fat 3adevelopmental stages 3afish products 3abiological development 3afish feeding 3acarcass composition 3abody fat 0adiet 0alipids1 aLarsen, A.V.1 aAndreassen, B.1 aSigholt, T.1 aOlsen, R.L.0 tAquaculture research.g2002 Sept. 12, v. 33, no. 11 p.875-889x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00727.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02334naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011000166300001600276500001500292520104300307650001601350650001501366650001001381650002501391650002101416650001301437650001001450650001001460650001101470650001601481650002601497650001501523650002001538650001901558653002301577700001801600700001701618773008301635852000901718856009201727930003301819945001301852946001101865655001201876IND2333007220221116231019.0030611e20020912enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233300722DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00720.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEpp, M.A.10aCarbon and nitrogen dynamics in zero-water exchange shrimp culture as indicated by stable isotope tracers  ap. 839-846.  a2019-12-04  aThe uptake and assimilation of nitrogen and carbon by shrimp were measured in 1200 L mesocosms using stable isotope enrichments. Labels were added via 15N-, 13C-glycine and amino acid mixtures in feeds or as 15NH4(+) to pond water. Label was incorporated into shrimp via algal growth indicating that up to 31% of nitrogen requirements were derived from pond ecosystem dynamics. This value is low in comparison with other shrimp aquaculture isotopic tracer studies but is probably due to differences in shrimp-rearing conditions. Direct incorporation of the enriched feed label was low in shrimp muscle tissue (3.3% for 13C-glycine, 5.9% for 15N-glycine and 7.8% for 15N-amino acid mixture). Mass balance calculations indicate the remaining shrimp biomass was derived from feed, but loss of label into solution during feeding led to underestimation based on tracers. Incorporation of isotopic labels into feed as large molecular weight proteinaceous or microencapsulated/fat-coated compounds is recommended to prevent dissolution and loss. 3awater reuse 3aestimation 3afeeds 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3aalgae 3aponds 3acarbon 3aamino acids 3anutrient requirements 3aecosystems 3astable isotopes 3ashrimp culture 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aZiemann, D.A.1 aSchell, D.M.0 tAquaculture research.g2002 Sept. 12, v. 33, no. 11 p.839-846x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00720.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02748naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245019500167300001600362500001500378520137300393650001501766650001001781650001301791650002401804650002101828650001601849650001701865650001901882650002001901650001301921653001501934653001101949700001901960700001801979700001701997700001602014700001902030773008302049852000902132856009202141930003302233945001302266946001102279655001202290IND2333010520221116231745.0030611e20020912enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233301052DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00729.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPirini, M.10aResponse to T3 treatment and changing environmental salinity of liver lipid composition, mitochondrial respiration and (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum  ap. 891-905.  a2019-12-04  aRainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum were fed a pelleted diet (14.3% wet weight lipid) containing 9 p.p.m. 3, 5, 3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) for 1 month and then transferred from fresh water to brackish water (average 22 p.p.t. salinity), where they were maintained untreated for 22 days. Trout fed a control diet were subjected to the same protocol. For both treated and control trout, liver lipid and fatty acid composition, mitochondrial respiratory activity and oxidative phosphorylation and (Na(+) + K(+))-ATPase activity were monitored in fish sampled periodically throughout the trial. No differences between treated and control trout occurred in liver total lipid, phospholipid and cholesterol content or fatty acid composition. Conversely, irrespective of T3 administration, the trout from the two habitats showed adaptive changes to salinity, differing in phospholipids and in the fatty acid composition of total and neutral lipids and selected phospholipids. Liver membrane permeability and mitochondrial respiratory activity were affected by both T3 treatment and salinity transfer. The latter was apparently greater than the former in affecting mitochondrial respiratory activity. The higher (Na(+) + K(+))-ATPase activity in T3-treated trout after 22 days in brackish water may reflect long-term effects of the hormone linked to salinity adaptation. 3afreshwater 3aliver 3asalinity 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3atriiodothyronine 3acholesterol 3amitochondria 3abrackish water 3aenzyme activity 3ahabitats 0aadaptation 0alipids1 aPagliarani, A.1 aVentrella, V.1 aTrobetti, F.1 aTrigari, G.1 aBorgatti, A.R.0 tAquaculture research.g2002 Sept. 12, v. 33, no. 11 p.891-905x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2002.00729.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle04046naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203072001700220100001600237245012900253300001800382500001500400520249900415650001602914650001802930650001702948650001602965650002702981650002003008650001803028650002803046650002103074650001603095650002903111650001403140650001103154650002603165650002203191650001903213650001803232653002503250700002003275773008403295852000903379856009203388945002503480946001103505655001203516IND4361496020221116231046.0040304e20031222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436149602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2003.00970.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The interaction between these factors in governing fatty acid compositions has been little studied, even though this may have importance when fish are reared in cold water. An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of temperature (2 vs. 8°C), dietary oil source (fish oil vs. vegetable oils) and feed fat content (21% vs. 34% fat) on tissue fatty acid compositions of Atlantic salmon parr. The fish were held in fresh water under a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod until they doubled in body mass (from ca. 19 to 38 g, which took ca. 2 months at 8°C and ca. 6 months at 2°C), and then the muscle, viscera and carcass PLs and NLs were analysed for fatty acid composition. The ratios of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (UFA:SFA), and the unsaturation indices (UIs, the number of unsaturated bonds per 100 fatty acid molecules) were calculated for each lipid class (PL, NL) within each tissue (muscle, viscera and carcass). Both dietary fatty acids and temperature influenced the compositions of the tissue lipids, with the dietary effects being most pronounced. The fatty acid composition of the feed oils was strongly reflected in the NLs of all three tissues, and also had a significant influence on the fatty acid profiles of the PLs. The effects of temperature were more marked in the PLs than in the NLs. Exposure to the lower temperature resulted in PLs with higher UFA:SFAs, and this is interpreted as a thermal acclimation response that would contribute to the maintenance of membrane fluidity. The PLs of fish given vegetable oils had higher UFA:SFAs than those of salmon provided with feeds containing fish oil, implying that the cell membranes of the former may have had greater fluidity. By contrast, the PLs of salmon fed with fish oil had higher concentrations of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids, and higher UIs, which may have made them more prone to peroxidative damage. This raises the intriguing possibility that the feeding of vegetable oils may have produced fish that were better able to withstand exposure to low temperature as a result of improved membrane fluidity (implied from the higher UFA:SFAs in these fish), while having membrane PLs that were less susceptible to oxidative damage (implied from the lower UIs). 3aSalmo salar 3alipid content 3afish culture 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3adiadromous fish 3avegetable oil 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3atriacylglycerols 3aacclimation 3adietary nutrient sources 3afish oils 3asalmon 3asaturated fatty acids 3awater temperature 3aanimal tissues 3aphospholipids 0aanimal fats and oils1 aBendiksen, E.A.0 tAquaculture research.g2003 Dec. 22, v. 34, no. 15 p.1423-1441x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2003.00970.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/03/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01979naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100001600169245016400185300001600349500001500365520085100380650001401231650001801245650001501263650001301278650001701291650001501308650002401323650001401347650001501361653001001376773008201386852000901468856009201477945002501569946001101594655001201605IND4361603620221116231532.0040312e20030820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436160362DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00868.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The specific growth rate (SGR) of rotifers fed Asteromonas (maximum 0.79) was statistically higher than that for rotifers fed Chlorella (maximium 0.61). The filtration and ingestion rates using different rotifer and algal densities exhibited certain maxima depending on the species, the cell density and the condition of the rotifers. The filtration rate was higher with Asteromonas and, although ingestion rate was lower than with Chlorella, the ingestion in terms of cell volume was 10-fold higher. It seems that B. plicatilis ingests the larger cell diameter algal species more efficiently than the smaller species that is usually used for its mass culture. 3aChlorella 3aanimal growth 3alive feeds 3aRotifera 3amass rearing 3amicroalgae 3afeeding preferences 3aingestion 3adimensions 0afeeds0 tAquaculture research.g2003 Aug. 20, v. 34, no. 10 p.793-802x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00868.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRHFe2004/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02146naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001900203245013600222300001600358520093600374650002101310650001201331650002001343650002101363650002101384650001001405650002601415653002901441700002601470700001701496700001601513773008201529852000901611856009201620945002501712946001101737655001201748IND4361605220221116231211.0040312e20030820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436160522DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00890.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGallardo, W.G.10aShell marking by artificial feeding of the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina Linne juveniles for sea ranching and stock enhancement  ap. 839-842.  aA method of marking abalone (Haliotis asinina Linne) for sea ranching and stock enhancement purposes was developed. Three-month-old abalone juveniles (11.8-mm shell length, 0.28 g) were fed artificial diets for 1, 2, or 3 weeks. The width of the bluish-green shell band produced by abalone juveniles was 1.7, 2.6, and 4.2 mm after 1, 2, or 3 weeks of feeding respectively. The growth and survival of juveniles fed artificial diets did not differ from that of juveniles fed the seaweed Gracilariopsis bailinae (control). Feeding the diet-fed juveniles with the seaweed thereafter produced the natural brownish shell, thus forming a sandwiched bluish-green band. An experimental release in outdoor tanks with natural growth of seaweeds and diatoms, and in a marine reserve showed that the shell band remained clear and distinct, indicating the usefulness of this shell marking method in sea ranching and stock enhancement of abalone. 3aHaliotis asinina 3aabalone 3amollusc culture 3aartificial diets 3ashell (molluscs) 3acolor 3aanimal identification 0aabalone shell color band1 aBautista-Teruel, M.N.1 aFermin, A.C.1 aMarte, C.L.0 tAquaculture research.g2003 Aug. 20, v. 34, no. 10 p.839-842x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00890.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRHFe2004/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03194naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001600220245017400236300001800410520181500428650001602243650001102259650002002270650001702290650002702307650001002334650001602344650001302360650001702373650001002390650001602400650001402416650001402430650001702444650002402461653001902485773008302504852000902587856009202596945002502688946001102713655001202724IND4361613220221116231442.0040315e20031104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436161322DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00965.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJobling  M.10aDo changes in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., fillet fatty acids following a dietary switch represent wash-out or dilution? Test of a dilution model and its application  ap. 1215-1221.  aThe fatty acid compositions of fish tissue lipids usually reflect those of the feed lipids, but few attempts have been made to predict the way in which the profiles change or assess the time required for the fatty acid profile to stabilize following a dietary change. The present focus on the influences of vegetable oils and fish oils on the fatty acid compositions and sensory attributes of fish fillets increases the interest in the ability to make such predictions. A dilution model was tested using data for the influences of feed oils (rape/linseed (V) vs. sand-eel (F)) and dietary fat concentrations (ca. 30% (H) vs. ca. 20% (L)) on the body growth and fatty acid compositions of the fillets of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., parr and post smolt. Fish given HV or LV feeds during freshwater rearing (mass increase from ca. 19 g to ca. 130 g) were switched to HF and LF feeds following parr-smolt transformation. The changes in fillet percentages of 18:1, 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3 (n-3) during 98 days of on-growing in seawater (mass increase from ca. 130 g to ca. 380 g) conformed closely to predictions made on the basis of the dilution model. Model applications require information about the proportionate increase in fillet fat over time, but the relative changes in body mass can be used as a surrogate provided that both fillet yield (as a % of body mass) and fillet fat percentage change little over time. This is not the case for small salmon, but does seem to apply to larger salmon as they approach harvest size. This means that, for large salmon, ratios of changes in body mass can be substituted for ratios in the quantitative change in fillet fat without the introduction of a large error in the prediction of the change in fillet fatty acid profile following the introduction of a novel feed. 3aSalmo salar 3asalmon 3adiadromous fish 3afish fillets 3afatty acid composition 3afeeds 3adietary fat 3aBrassica 3arapeseed oil 3aLinum 3alinseed oil 3aAmmodytes 3afish oils 3afish culture 3amathematical models 0adilution model0 tAquaculture research.g2003 Nov. 4, v. 34, no. 13 p.1215-1221x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00965.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/03/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02438naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001400203245007700217300001600294500008100310520096500391650001501356650002001371650002001391650002001411650002301431650001601454650001701470650002701487650002201514650001801536650001801554650001501572650001901587650001201606650001101618650001301629650001301642700001201655700001601667700001701683773008301700852000901783856009201792945002501884946001101909655001201920IND4361622120221116230948.0040316e20030912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436162212DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00947.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Koi (Cyprinus carpio L.) were used as the model species and the experiment was conducted outdoors in greenwater. When fish density was 9.7 kg per 2.08 m3 and they were eating 125 g day-1, the 20 L trickle filters were able to maintain acceptable water quality. Tanks with the same size submerged filters suffered significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels compared with tanks with trickle filters and control tanks with no biofilters exhibited significantly higher nitrite-nitrogen (about 20 mg L-1) and nitrate levels (about 400 mg L-1). As typical ornamental fish weigh 3 g, the trickle biofilter system described here can produce 1.55 fish L-1 (compared with the industry standard 0.25 fish L-1 very little water other than the water originally in the tanks. 3afish farms 3aCyprinus carpio 3aornamental fish 3afreshwater fish 3apopulation density 3afeed intake 3afish culture 3afreshwater aquaculture 3aaquaculture tanks 3awater quality 3awater filters 3abiofilters 3ahydrochemistry 3aammonia 3aoxygen 3anitrates 3anitrogen1 aAko, H.1 aShimizu, E.1 aTamaru, C.S.0 tAquaculture research.g2003 Sept. 12, v. 34, no. 11 p.937-941x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2003.00947.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRSCe2004/03/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03879naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002200182245014600204300001800350500002400368500001500392506007600407520159100483506003702074650002502111650002502136650003002161650002402191650001402215650002202229650002202251650001802273650002202291650001702313650001202330650002602342650001002368650002402378650004902402650004902451650001302500650004302513650006002556650004002616650002802656650003102684650005102715650002202766650004402788650002302832650003102855653001302886653001102899700002602910700002102936700001902957700002402976773011503000852000903115856008103124655001203205IND4417356020221207060203.0090306e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441735602DNAL7 a190746262pmid7 aPMC26494112pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.108.1304502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuggenthaler, Pia10aMicrotubule-Associated Protein AtMPB2C Plays a Role in Organization of Cortical Microtubules, Stomata Patterning, and Tobamovirus Infectivity  ap. 1354-1365.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAtMPB2C is the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homolog of MPB2C, a microtubule-associated host factor of tobacco mosaic virus movement protein that was been previously identified in Nicotiana tabacum. To analyze the endogenous function of AtMPB2C and its role in viral infections, transgenic Arabidopsis plant lines stably overexpressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-AtMPB2C were established. The GFP-AtMPB2C fusion protein was detectable in various cell types and organs and localized at microtubules in a punctuate pattern or in filaments. To determine whether overexpression impacted on the cortical microtubular cytoskeleton, GFP-AtMPB2C-overexpressing plants were compared to known microtubular marker lines. In rapidly elongated cell types such as vein cells and root cells, GFP-AtMPB2C overexpression caused highly unordered assemblies of cortical microtubules, a disturbed, snake-like microtubular shape, and star-like crossing points of microtubules. Phenotypically, GFP-AtMPB2C transgenic plants showed retarded growth but were viable and fertile. Seedlings of GFP-AtMPB2C transgenic plants were characterized by clockwise twisted leaves, clustered stomata, and enhanced drought tolerance. GFP-AtMPB2C-overexpressing plants showed increased resistance against oilseed rape mosaic virus, a close relative of tobacco mosaic virus, but not against cucumber mosaic virus when compared to Arabidopsis wild-type plants. These results suggest that AtMPB2C is involved in the alignment of cortical microtubules, the patterning of stomata, and restricting tobamoviral infections.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aYoucai mosaic virus 3aseedlings 3atransgenic plants 3adrought tolerance 3apathogenicity 3aNicotiana tabacum 3amicrotubules 3astomata 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3aroots 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxmetabolismxvirology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDroughts 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMicrotubule-Associated Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolismxvirology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolism 2aPlant Stomataxcytologyxmetabolismxvirology. 2aProtein Transport 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aTobamovirusxpathogenicity 0aproteins 0aleaves1 aFichtenbauer, Daniela1 aKrasensky, Julia1 aJonak, Claudia1 aWaigmann, Elisabeth0 tPlant physiology.g2009 Mar., v. 149, no. 3 p.1354-1365dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1304503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02695naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245014700168300001800315500002400333520125100357650001701608650002301625650001801648650002801666650002401694650000901718650001801727650002201745650002001767650002601787650002301813650002001836650001501856650001601871650001401887650002001901650002001921650001301941650001001954650001501964650001601979700002001995700001502015773010702030852000902137856005502146655001202201IND4450619120221116231202.0110311e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445061912DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00745.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBHATT, S.S.10aEvaluation of raw and hydrothermically processed Prosopis juliflora seed meal as supplementary feed for the growth of Labeo rohita fingerlings  ap. e164-e173.  aIncludes references  aHydrothermically processed Prosopis juliflora (PJ) seed meal as a supplementary diet for Labeo rohita is found to be rich in protein (330 g kg⁻¹) having antinutritional factors in permissible limits and containing essential amino acids adequately except lysine, methionine and cysteine. Ten iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic diets with crude, soaked and autoclaved seed meal at 20%, 35% and 50% replacement of fish meal were tested (D1-D9, respectively). The growth of fish (weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio) fed diet D4 (soaked seed meal at 20% replacement) was higher among the test diets, but lower than reference diet (RD). Diets with 50% seed meal resulted in lowering of growth, carcass composition, digestive enzyme activity and digestibility compared to test diets at 20% and 35% inclusion levels in the respective groups. Hydrothermically processed seed meal improved the growth compared to unprocessed one, though not up to RD level. This could be because of amino acid imbalance and presence of non-starch polysaccharides in seed meal. Looking to the easy availability and its nutritional quality, processed PJ seed meal can be incorporated in carp diet at lower inclusion level. 3aLabeo rohita 3aProsopis juliflora 3aanimal growth 3aantinutritional factors 3acarcass composition 3acarp 3adigestibility 3adigestive enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3aessential amino acids 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afeed meals 3afingerlings 3afish meal 3anutritive value 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3aseeds 3atest meals 3aweight gain1 aCHOVATIYA, S.G.1 aSHAH, A.R.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2011 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.e164-e173dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00745.x 7aarticle02216naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002300173245011100196300001400307500002400321520078300345650001201128650000901140650001901149650001601168650002601184650001601210650002001226650003501246650001201281650004801293650000901341650006401350650004601414650002601460700002101486700002601507700002401533773012201557852000901679856009401688655001201782IND4463332720221116231621.0120531e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446333272DNAL7 a126200542pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2003.tb01452.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmbrust, Laura J.10aUltrasonographic diagnosis of foreign bodies associated with chronic draining tracts and abscesses in dogs  ap. 66-70.  aIncludes references  aThis is a retrospective study that describes the historical, physical exam, radiographic, fistulographic, ultrasonographic, and surgical findings associated with non-gastrointestinal and extrathoracic foreign bodies in six dogs.

Benzoate and acetate were evaluated as primary substrates both in the presence and absence of nitrate as a potential electron acceptor. Each of the four resulting test conditions was first run under continuous-flow mode until a pseudo-steady state was achieved and then switched to batch mode. The longer residence time of the batch portion of the test resulted in more complete transformations and helped elucidate zones of variable activity within the column. Reductions in CT concentration and chloroform (CF) production were observed in all test conditions. Benzoate generally supported faster and more complete CT transformations than acetate, even though substrate use and denitrification was more rapid for acetate. Sulfate was present in all cases; yet, sulfate reduction was never observed, even during extended absences of nitrate and nitrite. CT transformation was most rapid near the point of injection, with rates decreasing toward the effluent end of the column. These results indicate that the microbial population at Hanford is capable of transforming CT in the subsurface. However, methods to control the production of CF may be necessary before this technology can be successfully implemented in the field. 3aacetates 3agroundwater contamination 3abioreactors 3abioremediation 3abenzoates 3aelectron transfer 3aequipment design 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3abiotransformation 3adrinking water 3adenitrification 3acarbon tetrachloride 0aWashington 0awater pollution1 aSemprini, L.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g2005 Summer, v. 25, no. 3 p.82-92x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.2005.00030.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle02982naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001600203245009400219300001400313500001500327520167300342650001302015650003002028650001502058650001302073650001302086650001002099650001502109650001502124651001302139653001602152700001702168700001402185700001902199700001702218700001202235773009302247852000902340856009202349930003302441945002502474946001302499655001202512IND4377492820221116231503.0060130e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.2005.00047.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMehnert, E.10aAquifer sensitivity to pesticide leaching: testing a soils and hydrogeologic index method  ap. 60-67.  a2019-12-04  aFor years, researchers have sought index and other methods to predict aquifer sensitivity and vulnerability to nonpoint pesticide contamination. In 1995, an index method and map were developed to define aquifer sensitivity to pesticide leaching based on a combination of soil and hydrogeologic factors. The soil factor incorporated three soil properties: hydraulic conductivity, amount of organic matter within individual soil layers, and drainage class. These properties were obtained from a digital soil association map. The hydrogeologic factor was depth to uppermost aquifer material. To test this index method, a shallow ground water monitoring well network was designed, installed, and sampled in Illinois. The monitoring wells had a median depth of 7.6 m and were located adjacent to corn and soybean fields where the only known sources of pesticides were those used in normal agricultural production. From September 1998 through February 2001, 159 monitoring wells were sampled for 14 pesticides but no pesticide metabolites. Samples were collected and analyzed to assess the distribution of pesticide occurrence across three units of aquifer sensitivity. Pesticides were detected in 18% of all samples and nearly uniformly from samples from the three units of aquifer sensitivity. The new index method did not predict pesticide occurrence because occurrence was not dependent on the combined soil and hydrogeologic factors. However, pesticide occurrence was dependent on the tested hydrogeologic factor and was three times higher in areas where the depth to the uppermost aquifer was <6 m than in areas where the depth to the uppermost aquifer was 6 to <15 m. 3asampling 3agroundwater contamination 3amonitoring 3aleaching 3aaquifers 3awells 3apesticides 3aprediction 3aIllinois 0amethodology1 aKeefer, D.A.1 aDey, W.S.1 aWehrmann, H.A.1 aWilson, S.D.1 aRay, C.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g2005 Fall, v. 25, no. 4 p.60-67x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.2005.00047.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/03/08  aOther US 7aarticle02065naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100002000203245008200223300001400305500001500319520092700334650002401261650002201285650001601307650001401323650002201337650001601359653001601375700002301391773009301414852000901507856009201516930003301608945002501641946001301666655001201679IND4377493120221116231138.0060130e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.2005.00050.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAlexander, M.D.10aToward a standard thermistor calibration method: data correction spreadsheets  ap. 75-81.  a2019-12-04  aTemperature is one of the most frequently measured physical phenomena in environmental research. Many laboratory and field investigations of temperature use commercially available temperature loggers that come from the manufacturer precalibrated. After-market calibration of temperature loggers provides more confidence in measured data. This paper proposes a general method for calibrating temperature loggers in order to obtain consistent, high-quality data. A procedure and derivation of equations for performing logger calibration is presented.

XRF permitted real-time acquisition of estimates for total metal content of soils. A trailer-mounted soil coring unit was used to recover soil samples for XRF analyses. This approach minimized the number of samples required for adequate characterization of the chromium distribution in the soils at the site and permitted immediate delineation of source 'hot spots.' The nondestructive nature of the XRF analyses permitted correlation analysis using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques. Correlation between XRF and ICP was very good (r(2) = 0.95) but the XRF analyses underestimated the total chromium concentrations, probably because of inappropriate calibration samples. 3asoil pollution 3achromium 3adetection 3anondestructive methods 0acontaminants 0ax ray fluorescence1 aClark, D.A.1 aCarlson, C.1 aVardy, J.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1994 Summer, v. 14, no. 3 p.111-115x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1994.tb00471.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02136naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245007200171300001600243520116400259650001301423650001601436650003001452650001901482650001501501651001801516653001701534773009701551852000901648856009401657930003301751945001301784946001301797655001201810IND2047760520221116223628.0950914e199506  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204776052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00546.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCullen, S.J.10aVadose zone monitoring: experiences and trends in the United States  ap. 136-143.  aThe vadose zone is the portion of the geologic profile above a perennial aquifer. Inclusion of mandatory vadose zone monitoring techniques as an approach to aquifer protection was first proposed under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States in 1978 and has since received increasing acceptance at federal and state levels. The goals of a vadose zone characterization and monitoring effort are to establish background conditions, identify contaminant transport pathways, identify the extent and degree of existing contamination, establish the basis for monitoring network design, measure the parameters needed in a risk assessment, and provide detection of contaminant migration toward ground water resources. The benefits of vadose zone monitoring include early warning of contaminant migration, potential reduction of ground water monitoring efforts, reduction of contaminant spreading and volume, and reduced time and cost of remediation once a contaminant release occurs. Vadose zone characterization and monitoring techniques should be considered as critical hydrologic tools in the prevention of ground water resource degradation. 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3asoil pollution 3amonitoring 3aUnited States 0acontaminants0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1995 Summer, v. 15, no. 3 p.136-143x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00546.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02524naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245011000173300001600283520141600299650001601715650001301731650001501744650001601759650001801775650002001793650001901813650001301832650001201845651001501857700001901872773009701891852000901988856009401997930003302091945001302124946001302137655001202150IND2047760220221116223854.0950914e199506  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204776022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00543.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoaiciga, H.A.10aSampling of agrochemicals for environmental assessment in rice paddies: dry tropical wetlands, Costa Rica  ap. 107-118.  aThis paper presents results from a preliminary sampling strategy developed to track agricultural contaminants found in surface and subsurface media and used commonly in rice paddy cultivation in the dry, tropical forest coastal region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The emphasis is on the impact of eight indicator pesticides, five forms of nitrogen and phosphorus that are common nutrients found in fertilizers. After the field sampling strategy was developed, soil and water samples were collected twice: once during the beginning of the wet season and once during the initiation of the dry season. Hydrological parameters, soil classifications, agricultural product toxicology, irrigation and drainage networks, cultivated areas, land ownership, and pristine environments have been studied, mapped, and entered into a database in order to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of potential contaminants and their pending ecological degradation. Alternative crops and agricultural practices are suggested to reduce or eliminate impacts on biological preserves. Database development and basin characteristics have been entered into a Geographic Information System (GIS) that is capable of fully integrating suggested site modeling. Field sampling results indicate that proposed rice paddy cultivation in a relatively undisturbed basin is likely to have minimal impact on downstream biological preserves. 3apaddy soils 3awetlands 3apesticides 3afertilizers 3awater quality 3awater pollution 3asoil pollution 3asampling 3atropics 3aCosta Rica1 aRobinson, T.H.0 tGround water monitoring & remediation.g1995 Summer, v. 15, no. 3 p.107-118x1069-36297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1995.tb00543.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle00911naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099245005200117300001000169500001500179520027400194650001700468650001900485651002500504651001100529773006700540852000900607939003300616945000800649655001200657991593449520742620221116223443.0780101e197710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799121332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aIsland Transit Co op exceeds first year targets  ap. 5.  a2019-12-06  aExtract: The article reports the successful first year of operation of the Island Transit Co operative Limited, which provides the only scheduled public transport service operating within Prince Edward Island. it describes the history and the services of the co op bus. 3acooperatives 3atransportation 3aPrince Edward Island 0aCanada0 pThe Atlantic Co operatorg1977 Oct., v. 45, no. 45 p.5-57nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780101c00000000  aAGC 7aarticle01165naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099072001700117100001800134245003200152300001300184520054200197650001700739651001100756653001300767653001400780773005500794852000900849930003300858945000800891655001200899991593449510742620221116223632.0780701e197804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7899122892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Based on the correlations observed for various vegetables, a simple model consisting of five types of basic pectin interactions in the tissues was proposed first. It includes S-type pectin extractable with cold water, A-type pectin extractable with cold chelating-agent solutions, B-type pectin extractable with hot water, C-type pectin extractable with hot chelating-agent solutions, and P-type pectin extractable with hot dilute acid or alkali solutions, among which C-type pectin was obtained by calculation rather than direct determination. It was found later that, in some cases, the amount of C-type pectin thus obtained came out as a negative value, which is apparently unreasonable. We therefore proposed, by speculation, an elaborate model consisting of twelve sub-types of complicated pectin interactions, which are based on the simple model, in order to explain the unreasonable situation resulting from the calculated value of C-type pectin content. Using snap-bean pods as sample, we now present several experiments to support the real existence of some of the complicated pectin interactions previously proposed. The supporting data came from the analysis and comparison of the amounts of bound calcium in the pectin fractions extracted and from the measurement and comparison of the size of pectin molecules extracted before and after further treatment by either heating or calcium removal. 3avegetables 3aplant tissues 3apectins 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3apods 3acooking 3amodels 3acell wall components 0aalcohol-insoluble solids1 aTsai, Y.R.1 aChang, W.H.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 2 p.145-157x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02227naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010200125300001600227520145600243650002301699650001301722650001601735650001201751650002601763700001501789773006701804852000901871930003301880945001301913946001101926655001201937IND2039659220221116223914.0940520s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203965922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuales, J.10aSaponins, phytic acid, tannins and protease inhibitors in qunoa (Chenopodium quinoa, Willd) seeds  ap. 137-143.  aThe seeds of quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa, Willd), a food crop of the Andean region of Latin America, contain protein of good quality and high amounts of carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and minerals. An industrial process for manufacturing infant food using quinoa as a basic raw material is being developed. The presence of antinutrients are of importance in this context, and this paper deals with saponins, phytic acid, tannins and protease inhibitors in quinoa seeds. The samples of quinoa analysed in this experiment contained two main types of saponins. The amount of saponin A (beta-D-glucopyranosyl-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 3)-alpha-L-arabino-pyranosyl-(1 leads to 3)]-3-beta-23-dihydroxy-12-en-28-oate methyl ester) was 0.7% of the dry weight and that of the saponin B (beta-D-glucopyranosyl-[beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 leads to 3)-alpha-L-arabino-pyranosyl-(1 leads to 3)]-3-beta-23-dihydroxyolean-12-en-28-oate) was 0.2% of the dry weight. These were the major saponins found in the quinoa bran collected while polishing the seeds. After scrubbing and washing, the level of saponin-A remaining in the seeds decreased to 0.31% of the dry weight, and saponin-B was completely removed by this process. The content of phytic acid in the quinoa seeds was about 1% of the dry matter, and scrubbing and washing reduced the phytic acid content of the seeds by about 30%. Neither protease inhibitor nor tannins were detected in the quinoa seeds. 3aChenopodium quinoa 3asaponins 3aphytic acid 3atannins 3aproteinase inhibitors1 aNair, B.M.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 2 p.137-143x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01612naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004000125300001600165520090100181650000901082650001001091650001301101650001801114650004301132700001401175773006701189852000901256930003301265945001301298946001101311655001201322IND2037849520221116223711.0940311s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203784952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnning, G.10aAnalysis of saponins in oat kernels  ap. 301-305.  aA method for analysis of oat kernel saponins is presented. The saponins were extracted from defatted oatmeal with methanol for 24 h in a Soxhlet apparatus. Separation of the saponins was accomplished by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an octyl-silica column and gradient elution with acetonitrile in water. Two main peaks, avenacoside A and B, were detected. The identification was achieved by comparing retention times and photodiode array UV spectra with those of an avenacoside A and B standard preparation from oat leaves. The identity of the avenacoside A and B peaks was further supported by incubation of oatmeal suspensions in water, after which the retention times were shifted to those obtained with the corresponding desglucoavenacoside standard. The saponin content in oatmeal containing a mixture of Swedish commercial oat varieties was 0.040% (dry matter basis). 3aoats 3aseeds 3asaponins 3afood analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography1 aAsp, N.G.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 3 p.301-305x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01896naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245008800132300001600220500001500236520099600251650002501247650002901272650002501301650002501326650001401351650001001365653001601375700001601391700001801407773006701425852000901492930003301501945001301534946001101547655001201558IND2039663820221116224316.0940520s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203966382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Aal, E.S.M.10aAdulteration of honey with high-fructose corn syrup: detection by different methods  ap. 209-212.  a2019-12-05  aPure honey was deliberately adulterated with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) at levels of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% (w/w). Sugar composition as a fingerprint was determined by HPLC for all samples. The following compositional properties were determined for pure and adulterated honey: moisture, total soluble solids, nitrogen, apparent viscosity, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), ash, sodium, calcium, potassium, proline, refractive index and diastatic activity. Statistical analysis revealed that the following compositional properties were highly significantly negatively correlated with sugar composition: dry matter, apparent viscosity, sodium, potassium, proline, and nitrogen. In contrast, ash, calcium, HMF, and moisture were highly significantly positively correlated with sugar composition for pure and adulterated honey. Accordingly, such simple tests can be applied as good indicators for detecting the adulteration of honey with HFCS at adulteration levels ranging from 10% to 50%. 3achemical composition 3ahigh fructose corn syrup 3aadulterated products 3astatistical analysis 3adetection 3ahoney 0amethodology1 aZiena, H.M.1 aYoussef, M.M.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 2 p.209-212x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02528naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245009400134300001600228500001500244520155500259650001101814650001401825650001401839650001101853650001601864650001801880653001001898653002101908653002901929653003101958700001501989700001702004773006702021852000902088930003302097945001302130946001102143655001202154IND2039664120221116223920.0940520s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203966412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoort, F.R. van de.12aA rapid FTIR quality-control method for determining fat and moisture in high-fat products  ap. 213-221.  a2019-12-05  aA general-purpose, automated Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) quality-control method was developed and evaluated for the rapid analysis of fat and/or moisture in high-fat products, typified by mayonnaise and peanut butter. 1-Propanol was used to solvate fat in peanut butter and fat and moisture in mayonnaise, and the sample was then pumped through a 100-micrometer CaF2 flow cell and the C=O stretching (1748 cm-1) and HOH bending (c. 1650 cm-1) absorptions were measured after the solvent spectrum had been ratioed out. Calibrations were based on relating the peak heights of the absorption bands to the known fat and moisture values of calibration standards prepared by dissolving pure components (peanut oil, canola oil/water) in propanol or by adding to propanol varying amounts of a representative sample pre-analyzed by the Mojonnier method. The time of sample preparation and analysis was 5-7 min per sample, and the predictions obtained by FTIR were within +/- 0.30% of values determined by the Mojonnier method. The FTIR portion of the method was automated by programming the instrument by using macro-command language, leaving the operator only to follow menu-driven instructions to carry out the calibration and analysis. As such, the method is rapid and routine and requires no knowledge of FTIR spectroscopy, which makes the procedure suitable for process-quality-control monitoring of high-fat products. Extension of this general approach to other high-fat food systems, such as butter, margarine, and chocolate, should be feasible. 3abutter 3achocolate 3amargarine 3alipids 3amethodology 3awater content 0afoods 0aquality controls 0ainfrared moisture meters 0afourier-transform infrared1 aSedman, J.1 aIsmail, A.A.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 2 p.213-221x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02241naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245006900167300001600236500010000252520098400352650001501336650001701351650002301368650001801391650001101409650001501420650001301435650002701448650001001475650001301485650001701498650001701515700001401532700001501546700001701561700001701578700001401595773014601609856005501755852000901810655001201819IND4533522020221116224241.0160212e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453352202DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidoni, S.10aDAFL: New Innovative Device to Monitor Fruit Ripening in Storage  ap. 549-554.  aPaper presented at the XII International Pear Symposium held Jul 14-18, 2014, Leuven, (Belgium)  aThe ripening stage reached by the fruits at harvest is linked to the fruit quality traits at consumption; it influences the postharvest management affecting storage length and fruit disease susceptibility. As a consequence, the knowledge of the ripening stage at harvest becomes essential, as well as the monitoring of the fruit ripening changes during cold storage. The index of absorbance difference (IAD) can follow the fruit ripening along the supply chain starting in the orchard, provided by the DA-Meter, a non-destructive device operating in VIS-NIR wavelenghts, and during cold storage, with the DAFL (difference absorbance fruit logger) that measures automatically the IAD at fixed intervals. The DAFL remote devices are positioned on a given number of fruits kept in cold storage and the IAD values are transmitted by radio to a server. The real time monitoring of these values gives indication on the management of the fruit as related to the ripening during storage. 3aabsorbance 3acold storage 3adisease resistance 3afruit quality 3afruits 3amonitoring 3aorchards 3apostharvest technology 3aradio 3aripening 3astorage time 3asupply chain1 aFiori, G.1 aRocchi, L.1 aSpinelli, F.1 aMusacchi, S.1 aCosta, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 15, , no. 1094 p.549-554dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.73  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011000166300001600276500010000292520145500392650002101847650001601868650001401884650001401898650001401912650001001926650002201936650001601958700001801974700001301992773014602005856005502151852000902206655001202215IND4533521820221116224252.0160212e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453352182DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugar, D.10aRelationship of Weather Factors to Russet Incidence in âComiceâ and âBoscâ Pear Fruit  ap. 533-538.  aPaper presented at the XII International Pear Symposium held Jul 14-18, 2014, Leuven, (Belgium)  aFruit russet incidence can be an important pear quality factor. Data on russet incidence on untreated âComiceâ and âBoscâ pear fruit were collected for 13 and 10 years, respectively. Russet in âComiceâ was quantified as the percentage of fruit with >6% of the fruit surface covered in russet, and in âBoscâ as the percentage of fruit with >97% russet. Russet incidence at harvest was correlated with records of various weather factors for the multi-year series. Beginning at each date from 21 days before full bloom until 50 days after full bloom, an 11-day moving window was calculated for each weather factor. Coefficients of correlation between weather factors and fruit russet at harvest were then plotted against dates relative to full bloom, and trends based on fifth-order polynomial equations were observed. High negative correlations with fruit russet were observed for temperature-related parameters (maximum and mean daily temperature, mean growing degree days base 10Â°C, intra-day temperature change). High positive correlations were observed with relative humidity (mean RH, accumulated hours with RH >80%). Peak correlation coefficient values for temperature and humidity factors typically occurred at 15-18 days after full bloom. Copper hydroxide applied to âBoscâ pears at petal-fall enhanced russet and efficacy correlated negatively with temperature and positively with humidity. 3acopper hydroxide 3acorrelation 3aequations 3aflowering 3aheat sums 3apears 3arelative humidity 3atemperature1 aVillardel, P.1 aAsin, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 15, , no. 1094 p.533-538dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.71  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245013700167300001600304500010000320500001500420520216700435650002202602650001402624650002602638650002402664650001102688650001302699650001002712650001102722650002102733650002302754650001502777650001502792650001802807650001302825650002102838650001802859650001102877650001302888650001202901650001202913650002102925650002302946650001302969653001402982700001602996700001603012700001703028773014603045856005503191852000903246655001203255IND4533520120221116224229.0160211e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453352012DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelien, T.10aStink Bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Pear Orchards: Species Complex, Population Dynamics, Damage Potential and Control Strategies  ap. 415-420.  aPaper presented at the XII International Pear Symposium held Jul 14-18, 2014, Leuven, (Belgium)  a2019-12-06  aPentatomid stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) include several species that occur in pear orchards where they cause feeding damage with their piercing-sucking mouthparts, resulting in deformed fruits. In the Belgian fruit growing area they used to be secondary pests, but over the last decade they have caused economically important losses, especially in organically managed orchards. During three consecutive years (2011-2013) an in-depth monitoring study was executed to elucidate the species complex and the population dynamics of stink bugs in Belgian pome fruit growing. The red-legged shieldbug (Pentatoma rufipes L.) was found to be the most represented. Other important but less frequently occurring species were the mottled shieldbug (Rhaphigaster nebulosi L.) and the common green shieldbug (Palomena prasina L.) The invasive exotic brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomporpha halys) was not found during these surveys. Population dynamics studies on P. rufipes revealed their univoltine life cycle, their overwintering in the orchard itself as second instar nymphs, and their presence within the orchard during the entire year. In addition, field trials were executed to test and compare the efficacy of several plant protection products applied at different timings during the season (before and/or after blossoming and after harvest). Interesting control efficacies were obtained for several compounds (including active ingredients compatible with organic production like spinosad and pyrethrum). The potential role of stink bugs in transmitting harmful organisms, like Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight, was also investigated. Under controlled laboratory conditions the adult stages of P. rufipes and P. prasina were able to transmit E. amylovora to a small extent from artificially inoculated pears or pear slices to injured healthy pears or pear slices. Bacteria of fire blight survived on both adult stink bug species up to 66 h. In summary, the outcomes of our studies have generated valuable insights in the species complex, population dynamics, damage potential, and control strategies of stink bugs in commercial pear growing. 3aErwinia amylovora 3aflowering 3afield experimentation 3apopulation dynamics 3aadults 3aorchards 3apears 3anymphs 3ainvasive species 3aorganic production 3amonitoring 3amouthparts 3afruit growing 3aPalomena 3aplant protection 3aoverwintering 3afruits 3aspinosad 3ainstars 3asurveys 3aunivoltine habit 3aactive ingredients 3abacteria 0aHemiptera1 aPeusens, G.1 aSchoofs, H.1 aBylemans, D.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 15, , no. 1094 p.415-420dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.53  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010700168300001600275500010000291520092000391650002401311650000801335650000901343650002001352650001001372650001301382650001001395650001301405650001501418700001501433700001601448700001601464700001501480700001801495773014601513856005501659852000901714655001201723IND4533520520221116223654.0160211e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453352052DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, J.

The quality of odors was not different between the infected plots and the non-infected ones, but the odor intensity in the infected plots was significantly lower than in the un-infected control. For the plot of the infected rootlets exposed to the air in partly open, plastic baskets, the dogs succeeded to detect 89% after five days special training, and reached 100% success after 10 days training. But the dogs failed to detect the infected rootlets for the plot of potting with soil and infected rootlets, and for the plot of burying the infected rootlets into pear orchards in 15 cm soil depth. Overall, it seemed impossible to employ detection dogs as early detector of white root rot in pear orchards. 3aRosellinia necatrix 3aair 3adogs 3aelectronic nose 3aodors 3aorchards 3apears 3aroot rot 3asoil depth1 aCho, Y.

A successful control of pear sucker relies on the control of both generations: the first generation (G1), which occurs before flowering, and the second generation (G2) occurring during May-June. The action of predatory bugs (Anthocoris spp.) as well as that of other beneficials is very important for the control of subsequent summer generations of the pear sucker, and must be supported by the use of selective insecticides, as soon as the predator populations appear in the orchards. Flupyradifurone applied during pre-flowering period offers a correction spray on the devastating first generation of pear sucker which compromises fruit set, and causes damage on the fruit skin. When applied at pre-flowering, flupyradifurone does not disrupt population dynamics of the Anthocoris population in summer due to the principle of time selectivity. Also for some other beneficial arthropods no harmful effects were observed by flupyradifurone when applied during pre-flowering. Spirotetramat applied on the G2 offers a good control of young and old larvae of Cacopsylla pyri, both on the shoot tips and on cluster leaves in the central part of the tree. Spirotetramat has no impact on Anthocoris spp. (IOBC 1). The long lastingness of spirotetramat in shoot tips is linked with its systemicity towards these growing parts of trees. In the older cluster leaves possibly a switch from sink to source may happen which may cause a decline in the spirotetramat-enol concentration. A directed spray in the central part of the tree guarantees a full control of C. pyri and avoids honeydew and sooty mold staining. On top of that, spirotetramat offers simultaneously control of other pests like Dasineura pyri midges and scales. For pears, spirotetramat offers a multi target control, avoiding the need for other multiple correction sprays. 3aAnthocoris 3aCacopsylla pyri 3aDasineura 3abeneficial arthropods 3aflowering 3afruit set 3ahoneydew 3ainsecticides 3aintegrated pest management 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amidges 3aorchards 3apears 3apests 3aplant damage 3apopulation dynamics 3apredatory insects 3asummer 3atrees1 aBangels, E.1 aVan Waetermeulen, X.1 aBelien, T.1 aHaas, M.1 aMaeyer, L. de1 aPetrÃ©, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Sept. 15, , no. 1094 p.463-470dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1094.61  aDNAL 7aarticle01677naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008700127300001400214520082000228650001101048650001701059650002101076650002101097650001301118653001301131700001601144700001601160700001701176700001501193773006501208852000901273930003301282945001301315946001101328655001201339IND2040023720221116223712.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallet, J.F.10aAntioxidant activity of plant leaves in relation to their alpha-tocopherol content  ap. 61-65.  aThe leaf alpha-tocopherol content of fifteen plant species was determined by a gas-chromatographic method with alpha-tocopherol acetate used as internal standard. Highest amounts were found in leaves of Pelargonium sp. (412 ppm) and Thalictrum flavum (371 ppm), which could represent an interesting source of alpha-tocopherol for different purposes, such as the stabilization of food products. Antioxidant activity of leaf extracts was evaluated spectrophotometrically by coupled oxidation of beta-carotene and linoleic acid. The species could thus be ranked on the basis of an antioxidant-activity coefficient. Correlation established between the alpha-tocopherol content and antioxidant activity yielded a coefficient of 0.93, suggesting that alpha-tocopherol is the major liposoluble antioxidant found in leaves. 3aleaves 3aantioxidants 3aalpha-tocopherol 3anutrient content 3aextracts 0aactivity1 aCerrati, C.1 aUcciani, E.1 aGamisans, J.1 aGruber, M.0 tFood chemistry.g1994, v. 49, no. 1 p.61-65x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01488naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013700130300001400267520048900281650002100770650002700791650001300818650001100831650002500842650004400867650002100911650001800932653000800950653003000958700001900988773006501007852000901072930003301081945001301114946001101127655001201138IND2040024720221116223500.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez, C.V.10aCharacterisation of cocoa masses: low resolution pulse NMR study of the effect of geographical origin and roasting on fluidification  ap. 83-93.  aThe evolution of solid percentage at 27.5 degrees C for cocoa masses of various geographical origins was studied by Low Resolution Pulse NMR.

Oxidative stabilities of the bass samples could be differentiated during the induction phase by monitoring the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and several headspace volatiles, as well as degradation of alpha-tocopherol equivalents. Chemical measurements which were successful at differentiating the oxidative susceptibilities of the bass samples during propagation included conjugated dienes, organic fluorescent pigments, total headspace volatiles and loss of alpha-tocopherol equivalents. Hybrid striped bass was less stable in early phases of storage because of lower concentrations of antioxidants. Higher rates of oxidation observed during propagation in striped bass samples could be due to the greater susceptibility of its phospholipid fraction to oxidize and/or its higher concentration of iron. 3abass 3afrozen fish 3afood storage 3aoxidation 3ameasurement 3avolatile compounds 3afood composition 3aphospholipids 3atriacylglycerols 3amineral content 3amuscle tissues 0astability0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 4 p.381-385x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01470naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009700124300001600221500001500237520063600252650002300888650002200911650001200933650001000945650000900955650001200964653001700976700001800993773006701011852000901078930003301087945001301120946001101133655001201144IND2040033820221116224351.0940603s1993    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204003382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, K.12aA new technique for the chemical processing of reddened florets from dyer's saffron capitula  ap. 387-389.  a2019-12-05  aA dilute solution of H2O2 expedites the reddening process of orange-yellow florets from dyer's saffron capitula, The catalysis proceeds stoichiometrically: both incubation time and H2O2 composition become crucial factors for the bathoshift reaction, and a value of 0.184 micromole H2O2 is calculated from the double-reciprocal plots of H2O2 concentration vs velocity of carthamin production at pH 5.0.

The aim of this work was to isolate and identify the causal agent of this pathology. The pathogen was isolated from pears with symptoms and incubated in the dark at 22Â°C. Pathogenicity tests were done in âAbate Fetelâ, âPackhamâs Triumphâ and âGolden Russet Boscâ. The microorganism was identified by its morphological characteristics. 95% of the isolates were pink colonies with irregular margins, which in time turned dark, with mycelium submerged in the cultivation media, slow growth (20 mm in 7 days), smooth, flat, covered with slimy masses of conidia. Hyaline conidia of variable shape and size, 2-3 Âµm, were observed through a microscope. These characteristics coincide with the description of Aureobasidium pullulans (de Bary) Arnaud. In the fruit, symptoms began with small irregular brown spots of 2 to 3 mm, with a depressed, circular darker center that slowly increased in size, firm, developing into the pulp a few mm. Pathogenicity tests with Aureobasidium were only positive in âAbate Fetelâ. Aureobasidium pullulans has been reported as a biocontrol agent. Generally, it is found in a saprophytic state and rarely as a pathogen. This is the first report as a pathogen in pears in the RÃ­o Negro Valley. 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3abiological control agents 3acold storage 3aconidia 3amycelium 3aorchards 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apears 3apulp 3asaprophytes 3avalleys 3aArgentina1 aDussi, M.

The peel of âManpungbaeâ fruit turned yellow, fruit increased in soluble solids concentration (SSC) as the harvest was delayed, however, firmness decreased and mealiness appeared after 170 days after full bloom (DAFB). The SSC increased but firmness did not change significantly during storage. Fruit SSC increased during storage of 5 weeks and fruit firmness decreased, however, the firmness remained higher than 12 N (N/5 mm Ã¸) irrespective of harvest maturity. Considering fruit quality after storage, the proper harvest time was from 160 until 167 DAFB. The larger fruit (850 g) had a tendency to be higher in SSC than smaller fruit (550 g) at harvest and after storage. There was no difference in firmness between the larger and smaller fruit before storage. The firmness of smaller fruit did not change during storage, but for larger fruit it decreased by about 2.1 N. 3afirmness 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3aharvest date 3apears 3astorage 3astorage conditions 3atotal soluble solids 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKwon, Y.

Chemical composition was determined (moisture, protein, fat, ash, hydroxyproline, chloride, phosphorus) together with some parameters related to the curing process (pH, water activity, lactobacillus and Micrococcaceae counts). Colour, measured by the formation of nitrous pigments, showed some variability, with Chemical Conversion Indexes between 66 and 79%. The sausages with higher Micrococcaceae content had better colour development. Likewise, low levels of these microorganisms are linked to higher pH, lower lipolysis (acidity value) and a larger amount of residual nitrate. The parameters related to the possible effects of the curing process on proteins and lipids were also determined. Proteins undergo variable proteolysis depending on brand, as can be seen from the non protein N and total free amino acids contents. Protein fractions undergo changes in solubility, thereby accentuating the differences in sarcoplasmic fraction (18.4-22.7%) and in the denatured protein fraction (30.3-37.1%). Fatty components undergo lipolysis (measured by acidity value) and oxidation (evaluated by the peroxide value, carbonyl compounds index and TBA value), with considerable variations between brands. A lower moisture content was observed in the products having lower values for protein, water activity, proteolysis and unsaturated fatty acids and higher values were present for fat, protein denaturation and indexes of fat oxidation. These trends were inverted in sausages with the highest moisture content. 3acured meats 3anutrient content 3aLactobacillus 3afatty acids 3anitrogen 3aMicrococcaceae 3aplate count 3aanimal fats and oils 3awater content 3apH 3afood composition 3asausages 3acolor 3aSpain 0aphysical properties 0achemical composition 0awater relations1 aPena, M.P.1 aBello, J.0 tFood chemistry.g1993, v. 48, no. 1 p.31-37x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01445naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012200126300001500248520061300263650001300876650001400889650001800903650002300921653001800944700001100962700001400973700001200987773006600999852000901065930003301074945001301107946001101120655001201131IND2040025320221116223838.0940603s1994    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204002532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHawer, W.S.10aEffective separation and quantitative analysis of major heat principles in red pepper by capillary gas chromatography  ap. 99-103.  aAn effective analytical method for the separation and quantitative analysis of the major heat principles in red pepper has been established.

Glucose was enzymatically determined in standard solutions and in samples of non-alcoholic beverages. After the measurement of glucose, the samples were spiked with different amounts of ascorbic acid, which was found to introduce serious errors even in low concentrations. A procedure for treating the samples containing ascorbic acid with ascorbase is proposed. The treatment completely removes the interference effect and ensures the recovery of the true concentration of glucose present in the measured samples. The method was applied to determinations of glucose and sucrose in soft drinks and in natural orange juice.

A pectate lyase-encoding gene (pelE) from Erwinia chrysanthemi was inserted between each one of these expression-secretion cassettes and a yeast gene terminator. generating recombinant yeast-integrating shuttle plasmids pAMS1 through pAMS9. These YIp5-derived plasmids were transformed and stably integrated into the genome of a laboratory strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the pectate lyase production was monitored. Transcription initiation signals for pelE expression were derived from the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADC1 p), the yeast mating pheromone alpha-factor (MFalpha 1 p,) and the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase (AMYp) gene promoters. The transcription termination signals were derived from the yeast tryptophan synthase gene terminator (TRP5T). Secretion of pectate lyase (PLe) was directed by the signal sequences of the yeast mating pheromone alpha-factor (MFalpha 1 s), B. amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase (AMYs) and Er. chrysanthemi pectate lyase (pelEs). The ADC1p-MFalpha 1 s expression-secretion system proved to be the most efficient control cassette for the expression of pelE and the secretion of PLe in S. cerevisiae. 3agenetic transformation 3apectate lyase 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant DNA 3astructural genes 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3apromoter regions 2aAlcohol Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacillusxenzymology 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Recombinant 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aDickeya chrysanthemixenzymology. 2aPeptidesxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxgeneticsxsecretion. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aTryptophan Synthasexgenetics 2aalpha-Amylasesxgenetics 0acloning 0avectors 0aPectobacterium chrysanthemi 0aexpression-secretion cassettes 0apeles gene1 aPretorius, I.S.0 tGene.g1992, v. 121, no. 1 p.35-45x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01971naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245006800155300001800223520092200241650001901163650001801182650004101200650000901241650001501250650001301265650003501278650002301313650001001336700001601346773010201362852000901464856007701473930003301550945001301583946001301596655001201609IND2124300020221116224028.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212430002DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960589e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReverchon, E.10aTuberose concrete fractionation by supercritical carbon dioxide  ap. 1356-1360.  aSupercritical CO2 extraction was used to postprocess a solid tuberose extract that was produced by liquid solvent extraction. The optimum extraction conditions to produce the tuberose volatile oil were found operating at 80 bar and 40 degrees C. At these conditions no undesired compounds have been coextracted except waxes. These latter compounds have been eliminated by adopting a stagewise separation procedure consisting of two separators operated in series. The first separator was set at 80 bar and -5 degrees C to allow the precipitation of waxes. The second separator operated at 15 bar and 0 degrees to recover tuberose volatile compounds. The oil yield was 24% by weight of the charged material. The process evolution has been monitored by performing GC-MS analysis of the extracts. A large modification in the composition of tuberose volatile oil has been observed with the increase of the extraction time. 3acarbon dioxide 3afractionation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aoils 3aseparators 3asolvents 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3avolatile compounds 3awaxes1 aPorta, G.D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1356-1360x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960589e3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02256naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245007100153300001800224520109300242650002301335650001401358650001401372650002201386650002401408650001301432650004401445650001801489650001501507650003701522700001701559700001601576700001901592773010201611852000901713856007701722930003301799945001301832946001301845655001201858IND2124292220221116223901.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212429222DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960427i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuard, C.L.10aMechanisms involved in Kjeldahl microwave digestion of amino acids  ap. 1202-1208.  aThe high flexibility of open vessel microwave digestion gives one the opportunity to follow the stepwise degradation of amino acids in the presence of H2SO4 and H2O2. Thus, it is possible to demonstrate, for several amino acids, that only a stoichiometric fraction of nitrogen (called the easy fraction) is digested when sulfuric acid is used alone. The other difficult fraction is totally dissolved when hydrogen peroxide is added. These first results confirm the use of two-step digestion procedures as described in earlier works. The first step consists in charring the matrix, the second in oxidizing. When considering amino acids that contain an aromatic ring, such as tryptophan and histidine, it is possible to use UV spectrometry to give indications on the intermediate products formed during the charring step. It was assumed that, at least, three compounds are formed and their probable structure, for tryptophan, can be confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR. It is then possible to propose a general digestion mechanism involving sulfonation followed by the opening of the aromatic ring. 3aaromatic compounds 3adigestion 3ahistidine 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amicrowave treatment 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asulfuric acid 3atryptophan 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aMourel, R.M.1 aDidenot, D.1 aFeinberg, M.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1202-1208x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960427i3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02456naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245014300145300001600288500001500304520116500319650002001484650002201504650001701526650002001543650002501563650001501588650002001603650001401623650001201637650001201649650003701661650001301698650003201711650001201743651001701755653002301772653001501795700002101810700001701831773009701848852000901945939003301954946001101987655001201998IND9300280720221116224051.0930115e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028072DNAL7 a14285082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrecek, R.C.12aA preliminary study of the effect of microclimate on third-stage larvae of Haemonchus contortus and Haemonchus placei on irrigated pasture  ap. 747-752.  a2019-12-04  aAssessments were made on the influence of several microclimatic variables on the availability of third-stage larvae of Haemonchus contortus and Haemonchus placei on four strata of irrigated Kikuyu pasture. Three replicates of these pasture samples were collected on 18 sample days over 12 months and the log10 mean counts of the larvae recovered were analysed by a stepwise regression model. Predictors for the log counts of the four strata for the two nematode species included relative humidity, illumination, air temperature and windspeed. The effect of air temperature on larvae of both Haemonchus species was similar, as air temperature increased, the number of larvae on pasture increased. The inverse was true for windspeed; as windspeed increased larval counts decreased. For H. contortus, relative humidity increased as the number of larvae increased on all strata except upper herbage. The R2 values ranged from 0.11 to 0.21 for H. contortus and from 0.04 to 0.12 for H. placei. Under the conditions of this study, only 21% of the effect on H. contortus and 12% on H. placei third-stage larvae on pasture can be explained by microclimatic conditions. 3asolar radiation 3arelative humidity 3amicroclimate 3aair temperature 3aHaemonchus contortus 3awind speed 3anematode larvae 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aHaemonchusxgrowth & development 2aHumidity 2aLarvaxgrowth & development 2aPoaceae 3aSouth Africa 0airrigated pastures 0aHaemonchus1 aGroeneveld, H.T.1 aMaritz, J.I.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1992 Sept., v. 22, no. 6 p.747-752x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01959naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012300128300001600251520096200267650001401229650001201243650003201255650002901287650001701316650002501333650001701358653001101375653001901386653002101405700001501426700001801441773009701459852000901556939003301565946001101598655001201609IND9300280920221116223653.0930115e199209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChilton, N.B.10aDifferences in attachment site of the Australian reptile tick Amblyomma limbatum (Acari: Ixodidae) on two host species  ap. 783-787.  aThe present study compared the site of attachment of larvae, nymphs and adults of the tick Amblyomma limbatum on two species of reptile host Tiliqua rugosa and Pogona vitticeps. The results showed that for each life cycle stage, the proportion of ticks attached to different sites differed on the two host species. In addition, on each host species, there were marked differences between life cycle stages in their choice of attachment site. These data do not support hypotheses raised to account for attachment site specificity, namely; intraspecific competition, adaptations to increase feeding efficiency or the retention of an ancestral trait. However, Amb. limbatum is flexible in its selection of an attachment site on hosts which may represent an adaptation to maximizing the number of host species it can infest. This would represent an important strategy for colonizing ticks either at the edge of the species range or in marginal population areas. 3aAmblyomma 3alizards 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahematophagous arthropods 3abody regions 3aspatial distribution 3ahost seeking 0asauria 0atiliqua rugosa 0apogona vitticeps1 aBull, C.M.1 aAndrews, R.H.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1992 Sept., v. 22, no. 6 p.783-787x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245009900153300001800252520118500270650001801455650001301473650001301486650001101499650001501510650002301525650001401548650002001562650001201582650001501594650001001609650001901619650001201638650001201650650001201662650001601674650000901690650003901699650001701738650002201755650002701777650001201804700001401816700001901830700001701849700001701866700001401883773010201897852000901999856007702008930003302085945001302118946001302131655001202144IND2124295920221116223531.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212429592DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960806b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrevieu, I.10aIdentification of resistant pea (Pisum sativum L.) proteins in the digestive tract of chickens  ap. 1295-1300.  aThis study was undertaken to determine if pea (Pisum sativum L.) protein structure could explain pea protein digestion. A nitrogen-free (NF) diet and two diets containing either whole ground peas or a globulin fraction purified from peas were fed to 3-week-old chickens. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to estimate the relative rates of degradation of proteins subfractions in the gastrointestinal contents of chicks. Proteins were quantified by image analysis of Coomassie blue stained bands. Convicilin disappeared already in the gizzard. Legumin alpha and vicilin were still present in gizzard but disappeared in jejunum. The polypeptides shown to persist until the end of digestive tract were albumin PA2, lectin, and polypeptides of MW in the range 19500-25000 originating presumably from legumin. An endogenous protein of about 57 000 was observed until terminal ileum. Apparent ileal protein digestibility was high and slightly lower for pea diet (89.5%) than for globulin diet (93.3%). Results suggested that, although some pea proteins appeared less susceptible to hydrolysis, they represented only a small amount at the terminal ileum. 3aPisum sativum 3aalbumins 3achickens 3achicks 3aconvicilin 3adigestible protein 3adigestion 3adigestive tract 3agizzard 3ahydrolysis 3aileum 3aimage analysis 3ajejunum 3alectins 3alegumin 3apea protein 3apeas 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolypeptides 3aprotein structure 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3avicilin1 aCarre, B.1 aChagneau, A.M.1 aQuillien, L.1 aGuéguen, J.1 aBerot, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1295-1300x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960806b3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02621naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245011000156300001800266520126100284650003801545650003001583650001201613650002701625650001301652650001801665650000901683650002601692650001801718650001401736650001301750650001201763650001101775650001501786650001201801650001801813650002001831650001301851650001501864650001301879773010201892852000901994856007702003930003302080945001302113946001302126655001202139IND2124289420221116223705.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212428942DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960573o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarkadas, C.G.10aAssessment of the protein quality of native white floury maize designated IAPO-13, by amino acid analysis  ap. 1062-1069.  aThe present study was designed to quantitatively measure the total protein and amino acid composition of a typical northern adapted (latitude > 45 degrees N) variety of native white floury maize, designated IAPO-13, and to assess its protein quality from its FAO/WHO protein digestibility-corrected amino acid scoring pattern. The native IAPO-13 maize results in the production of maize proteins that closely resemble the amino acid composition of floury-2 mutant maize. In IAPO-13 maize lysine, tryptophan, histidine, arginine, and aspartic acid are all higher than normal flint CO255 maize, while glutamic acid, leucine, alanine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine are significantly lower. The concentration of methionine is higher than in any other maize tested. As a result, the native IAPO-13 maize amino acid profile gives a good balance of total essential amino acids, limited only in lysine, and has a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score ranging from 37.0 to 40.0% compared to 27.5, 50.6, and 67.0% values found for flint CO255, floury-2, and QPM-C13, respectively. These results indicate that a potentially very useful method for evaluating the protein quality of maize is calculating their protein quality from their amino acid composition. 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aWorld Health Organization 3aalanine 3aamino acid composition 3aarginine 3aaspartic acid 3acorn 3aessential amino acids 3aglutamic acid 3ahistidine 3alatitude 3aleucine 3alysine 3amethionine 3amutants 3aphenylalanine 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3atryptophan 3atyrosine0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1062-1069x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960573o3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02300naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245010600153300001800259520111900277650001701396650001101413650002001424650001701444650001701461650001201478650001001490650001201500650001801512650001901530650001301549700001501562700002001577700001601597700001701613773010301630852000901733856007701742930003301819945001301852946001301865655001201878IND2138026220221116224150.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802622DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970393u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayne, L.D.10aHPLC-fluorescence method for the determination of eprinomectin marker residue in edible bovine tissue  ap. 3501-3506.  aA method was developed and validated to determine eprinomectin marker residue in bovine liver, kidney, muscle, and fat. The overall percent recovery (+/- CV) was 93 +/- 12% (n = 66) for liver, 100 +/- 13% (n = 34) for muscle, 87 +/- 13% (n = 42) for kidney, and 95 +/- 11% (n = 42) for fat. The limit of detection was 1 ng/g, the lower limit of quantitation was 2 ng/g, and the upper limit of quantitation was 5000 ng/g (microgram/kg). Accuracy, precision, linearity, selectivity, and ruggedness were demonstrated. For the determination, tissue is mixed with sodium sulfate, homogenized, and extracted. The reconstituted extract is loaded onto an aminopropyl cartridge. After solvent exchange, a portion of the eluate is derivatized precolumn via automated addition of TFAA in acetonitrile and analyzed using fluorescence detection. The method is rapid, sensitive, and selective and provides for determination of eprinomectin marker residue in edible bovine tissue from the low parts per billion (ng/g) level to the parts per million level. The method has been successfully performed by several different analysts. 3aacetonitrile 3acattle 3adetection limit 3aeprinomectin 3afluorescence 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscles 3arapid methods 3asodium sulfate 3asolvents1 aMayo, V.R.1 aMorneweck, L.A.1 aHicks, M.B.1 aWehner, T.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3501-3506x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970393u3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02139naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245012900155300001800284520109900302650001801401650001201419650002201431650001501453650001201468650001601480650001001496700001701506700001801523773010301541852000901644856007701653930003301730945001301763946001301776655001201789IND2138024620221116223613.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802462DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970137h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto, T.10aEffect of pressure on the mechanism of hydrolysis of maltoheptaose and amylose catalyzed by porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase  ap. 3431-3436.  aPressure effects over time on the products accompanying the hydrolysis of maltoheptaose (G7) and amylose catalyzed by porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA) were measured up to 300 MPa at 30 degrees C. Under moderate pressure up to 100 MPa, the initial rates of hydrolysis of G7 increased, and at the pressure range of 100-300 MPa, rates decreased gradually to produce maltose (G2), maltotriose (G3), maltotetraose (G4), and maltopentaose (G5). For amylose, the pressure dependence on the time course for G2, G3, and G4 is similar to that for G7. From the pressure dependence of the initial rates of hydrolysis of G7, the volume difference between enzyme-substrate (ES) complexes of G2 and G5 and the ES complex of G3 and G4 is 3.4 cm3/mol. At the multiple attacked process of amylose, the volume differences of ES complexes are -6.3 cm3/mol for G2 and G3, +4.8 cm3/mol for G3 and G4, and -1.5 cm3/mol for G2 and G4. These results suggest that pressure is a good tool to control the pathway of enzyme action of alpha-amylase and thus to produce the composition of products commercially desired. 3aalpha-amylase 3aamylose 3aenzyme substrates 3ahydrolysis 3amaltose 3amaltotriose 3aswine1 aMakimoto, S.1 aTaniguchi, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3431-3436x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970137h3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02452naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245009600158300001800254500001500272520115300287650001601440650001901456650001301475650001701488650001401505650001201519650002001531650001301551650002301564650001201587650002401599650001701623650001501640650001001655653001001665700002001675700001901695700002001714773010301734852000901837856007701846930003301923945001301956946001301969655001201982IND2138026920221116223941.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802692DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970227m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPylpiw, H.M.

Five crops consisting of beets, cucumbers, lettuce, peppers, and tomatoes were grown and treated in the field with seven pesticides, dacthal, chlorpyrifos, chlorothalonil, diazinon, permethrin, methoxychlor, and azinphos-methyl. Values were determined for the microwave extraction parameters, time and temperature, which resulted in efficient recovery over the selected pesticides and crops. The microwave settings were shown to be dependent on both crop matrix and pesticide. Recovery of the fungicide chlorothalonil was highly dependent on temperature, while the remaining pesticides tested were not so demanding. Using the selected microwave time and temperature values, pesticide recoveries from the microwave method were then compared with those of the conventional method. Statistical comparison of pesticide recoveries and method reproducibility of the microwave method versus the conventional blender extraction indicated that microwave extraction data compare favorably with conventional extraction data. 3atemperature 3achlorothalonil 3atomatoes 3achlorpyrifos 3acucumbers 3apeppers 3aazinphos-methyl 3adiazinon 3apesticide residues 3alettuce 3amicrowave treatment 3amethoxychlor 3apermethrin 3abeets 0acrops1 aArsenault, T.L.1 aThetford, C.M.1 aMattina, M.J.I.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3522-3528x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970227m3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02382naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100003000137245014800167300001800315520096200333650002701295650002401322650001901346650002101365650001601386650001201402650001501414650001601429650001401445650002401459650003201483650002101515650000701536650001301543650003901556650001601595650001101611700001501622700002701637773010301664852000901767856007701776930003301853945001301886946001301899655001201912IND2138024120221116224026.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802412DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970125w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez de Palencia, P.10aPurification and characterization of the cell wall proteinase of Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei IFPL 731 isolated from raw goat's milk cheese  ap. 3401-3405.  aA cell wall proteinase from Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei IFPL 731 has been released in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction, and ion exchange chromatography. Its molecular mass estimated by SDS-PAGE was about 150 kDa. Maximum activity was reached at pH 6.0 and 40 degrees C. Activity was completely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, suggesting that the enzyme belongs to the serine group of proteinases. It was very unstable even at 4 degrees C, and the Ca2+ ion was ineffective as a stabilizing agent. It preferentially hydrolyzed beta-casein and clove mainly bond 9-10 of the alpha S1-casein(1-23) peptide. On the basis of its specificity toward caseins, an alpha S1-casein(1-23) fragment, and two different charged chromophoric peptides, the proteinase can be classified as a mixed-type variant different from those identified with lactococcal proteinases. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aLactobacillus casei 3aalphaS1-casein 3aammonium sulfate 3abeta-casein 3acalcium 3acell walls 3acheese milk 3agoat milk 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aion exchange chromatography 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinases 3aserine1 aPelaez, C.1 aMartin-Hernandez, M.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3401-3405x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970125w3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02492naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245009600158300001800254520126500272650001701537650002501554650001701579650002101596650001401617650001101631650001301642650001601655650001101671650001301682650002801695650001301723650001401736653002501750700001701775700001801792773010301810852000901913856007701922930003301999945001302032946001302045655001202058IND2138023420221116223936.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802342DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970234a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatue-Gracia, M.10aAnthocyanins as antioxidants on human low-density lipoprotein and lecithin-liposome systems  ap. 3362-3367.  aThe antioxidant activity of several anthocyanins was tested in vitro on human low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and on a lecithin-liposome system. Samples were incubated at 37 degrees C, and the extent of oxidation was measured by determining the formation of conjugated diene and hexanal. The inhibition of oxidation increased with concentration of the antioxidant. In the LDL system, when the oxidation was catalyzed with 10 micromolar copper, malvidin was the best oxidation inhibitor, followed by delphinidin, cyanidin, and pelargonin. When the oxidation was catalyzed with 80 micromolar copper, the order of antioxidant activity changed and decreased in the following order at all concentrations tested: delphinidin, cyanidin, malvidin, and pelargonin. In the liposome system, catalyzed with either 3 or 10 micromolar copper, malvidin was the best inhibitor of both conjugated diene and hexanal formation. At 3 micromolar copper, delphinidin, cyanidin, and pelargonin showed prooxidant activity. At 10 micromolar copper, pelargonin followed malvidin in antioxidant potency, and cyanidin and delphinidin were prooxidants. Several antioxidant mechanisms may explain the effect of anthocyanins, including hydrogen donation, metal chelation, and protein binding. 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abinding proteins 3achelation 3acopper 3acyanidin 3adelphinidin 3ahumans 3ahydrogen 3alow density lipoprotein 3amalvidin 3aoxidation 0anatural antioxidatns1 aHeinonen, M.1 aFrankel, E.N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3362-3367x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970234a3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02270naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245016700150300001800317520111100335650002301446650001301469650003801482650001201520650001701532650000901549650002601558650001201584650002301596700001401619700001601633773010201649852000901751856007701760930003301837945001301870946001301883655001201896IND2124303720221116223548.0980728e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212430372DNAL7 a10.1021/jf95069042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbad, A.10aDevelopment of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to carbaryl. 1.

Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were subsequently obtained and characterized for their affinity to carbaryl. Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that showed the highest affinity (I50 < 3.0 nM) were chosen for immunoassay development and further tested in the coating conjugate and coating antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats, against both homologous and heterologous conjugates. Among several immunoassays developed, the combination of LIB-CNH36 MAb with the heterologous conjugate ovalbumin-N-(1-naphthoyl)-6-aminohexanoic acid in the coating conjugate ELISA format afforded the highest sensitivity for carbaryl determination (I50 = 1.1 nM). This work also provided some insights into the influence of the immunizing hapten structure on the affinity of the antibodies obtained, as well as into the effect of the ELISA format and hapten heterology on the assay sensitivity. 3aantibody formation 3acarbaryl 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahaptens 3ainsecticides 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3arabbits 3atransport proteins1 aPrimo, J.1 aMontoya, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.1486-1494x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf95069043Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01981naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245010100153300001800254520095200272650001101224650001601235650001901251650000701270650001201277650002101289650001401310650001401324700001801338700001501356773010301371852000901474856007701483930003301560945001301593946001301606655001201619IND2138024920221116224155.0980806e199709  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213802492DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970198f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereyra, R.10aInteraction and stabilization of acidified casein dispersions with low and high methoxyl pectins  ap. 3448-3451.  aThe ability of low (LMP) and high methoxyl pectins (HMP) to stabilize acidified sodium caseinate dispersions was evaluated. Samples of 2.5% casein, 1% pectin, and 2.5% casein-1% pectin were hydrated in a 0.1 constant ionic strength buffer and pH was adjusted to 3.8, 4.8, 5.8, and 6.8. Without pectin, casein precipitated at pH 3.8 and 4.8. In single-component dispersions, pH had little influence on turbidity, L values, sedimentation, and apparent viscosity. L values for dispersions of LMP-casein and HMP-casein at pH 3.8 and 4.8 were about twice those at pH 5.8 and 6.8 and were higher than those for pectin. Apparent viscosity of LMP-casein and HMP-casein dispersions was not influenced by pH as were turbidity and L values. At low pH, dispersions were less Newtonian and had greater consistency index. Increased stability and apparent viscosity were consistent with fewer interactive sites between HMP and casein than between LMP and casein. 3acasein 3adispersions 3aionic strength 3apH 3apectins 3asodium caseinate 3aturbidity 3aviscosity1 aSchmidt, K.A.1 aWicker, L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.3448-3451x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970198f3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02465naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245013500153300001800288520113700306650004201443650002001485650001801505650002001523650000901543650002401552650001101576650003401587650001101621650001501632650001501647650001801662650001601680700002601696700001701722700001701739700001701756773010101773852000901874856007701883930003301960945001301993946001302006655001202019IND2163491020221116223254.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216349102DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960866h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano, M.10aModified atmosphere packaging minimizes increases in putrescine and abscisic acid levels caused by chilling injury in pepper fruit  ap. 1668-1672.  aBell pepper fruit (Capsicum annuum L. cv.

The MG fruit showed evidence of chilling injury (surface pitting) when stored at 2 degrees C, while MR fruit were unaffected by cold. At the same time, differences in the evolution of plant regulators were detected: In chilling-sensitive MG peppers, ethylene evolution and levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), putrescine (Put), and abscisic acid (ABA) rose significantly during storage, while in MG fruits stored at 10 degrees C and MR fruit stored at both 2 and 10 degrees C the values were low and no changes were observed. Spermidine (Spmd) content remained low in fruits at both maturity stages and at both temperatures. Chilling injury was reduced in MG fruits stored at 2 degrees C when modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) was used, particularly with the less permeable film. MAP also led to less pronounced increases in ACC, Put, and ABA levels as compared with fruit stored without film. 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aCapsicum annuum 3aabscisic acid 3achilling injury 3acold 3aethylene production 3afruits 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3apepper 3aputrescine 3aspermidine 3asweet peppers 3atemperature1 aMartinez-Madrid, M.C.1 aPretel, M.T.1 aRiquelme, F.1 aRomojaro, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1668-1672x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960866h3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02272naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245010900155300001800264520109200282650000801374650001001382650001601392650001401408650001701422650001901439650000901458650002001467650000901487650003101496650001301527650001601540700001601556700001701572700001501589773010101604852000901705856007701714930003301791945001301824946001301837655001201850IND2163487020221116223359.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216348702DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960580c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInnocente, N.10aLangmuir film balance study of the surface properties of a soluble fraction of milk fat-globule membrane  ap. 1559-1563.  aViewed from its origin, composition, and physicochemical properties, milk fat-globule membrane (MFGM) appears to act as a good, natural emulsifier and should be also considered as a potential stabilizing agent in the preparation of certain foods, e.g. creams and emulsions, infant formulas, and reduced-fat products. The present work was undertaken in an attempt to gain further information on the physicochemical properties of MFGM. In particular, the purpose of this study was to determine surface properties of a soluble fraction of MFGM (SFMFGM) using a film balance and to investigate the changes in the surface activity at different temperatures, which may occur during milk cream ripening or during heat and mechanical treatments of dairy products. The results showed that film balance measurements at the air/water interface actually provided a useful method for the study of SFMFGM monolayers. It was deduced from the compression isotherms that the SFMFGM films spread at the air/water interface presented a different behavior when the temperature varied from 4 to 40 degrees C. 3aair 3acream 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3afat globules 3afermented milk 3aheat 3ainfant formulas 3amilk 3aphysicochemical properties 3aripening 3atemperature1 aBlecker, C.1 aDeroanne, C.1 aPaquot, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1559-1563x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960580c3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02296naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245009200154300001800246520116700264650001301431650002001444650001901464650002501483650001101508650000901519650001401528650004101542650001201583650001301595650001101608700001601619700001701635773010101652852000901753856007701762930003301839945001301872946001301885655001201898IND2163486320221116223941.0980819e199705  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216348632DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960875q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedman, M.10aStructure of the tomato glycoalkaloid tomatidenol-3-beta-lycotetraose (dehydrotomatine)  ap. 1541-1547.  aExperiments were carried out to establish the structure of the monosaccharides comprising the carbohydrate side chain of the tomato glycoalkaloid dehydrotomatine. This was accomplished by (a) isolating dehydrotomatine and alpha-tomatine from commercial tomatine, (b) derivatizing the monosaccharides formed on acid hydrolysis of commercial tomatine, dehydrotomatine, and alpha-tomatine to alditol acetates and methylated alditol acetates, and (c) determining the structures of the galactose, glucose, and xylose derivatives by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both dehydrotomatine and alpha-tomatine have the same tetrasaccharide side chain. They differ only by the presence in dehydrotomatine of a double bond at carbon atoms 5 and 6 of ring B and its absence in alpha-tomatine. Dehydrotomatine, or tomatidenol-3 beta-lycotetraose, appears to represent a new class of glycoalkaloids in which a lycotetraose carbohydrate side chain is attached to an aglycon containing a double bond. Biosynthetic pathways leading to the formation of dehydrotomatine and alpha-tomatine and the significance of the results to host-plant resistance and the diet are discussed. 3aacetates 3aacid hydrolysis 3aalpha-tomatine 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3adiet 3agalactose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglucose 3atomatoes 3axylose1 aKozukue, N.1 aHarden, L.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1541-1547x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf960875q3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle03441naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245008300193300001800276500002400294500001500318520138300333650002301716650001301739650001001752650000901762650001901771650001201790650001401802650001401816650003001830650002101860650001301881650001301894650001001907650001101917650002201928650001701950650001101967650002301978650001802001650001502019650002302034650001902057650001802076650004402094650005202138650002202190650007402212650002402286650001102310650004102321650002902362653003002391653001302421700002002434700002702454700002502481700001602506700001502522700001702537773011302554852000902667856005502676655001202731IND4442222120221116223945.0100910e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444222212DNAL7 a206363742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02297.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, Cedric N.10aFresh fruit and vegetables as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogens  ap. 2385-2397.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMuch research into food-borne human pathogens has focused on transmission from foods of animal origin. However, recent investigations have identified fruits and vegetables are the source of many disease outbreaks. Now believed to be a much larger contributor to produce-associated outbreaks than previously reported, norovirus outbreaks are commonly caused by contamination of foods from hands of infected workers. Although infections with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157 have been linked to beef more often than to any other food product, severe outbreaks have been traced to consumption of contaminated radish sprouts and pre-packaged spinach. Similarly, while infections with Salmonella have mainly been linked to consumption of foods of animal origin, many outbreaks have been traced to contaminated fresh produce. E. coli O157 binds to lettuce leaves by alternative mechanisms involving the filamentous type III secretions system, flagella and the pilus curli. Association of Salmonella with fresh produce appears to be serovar-specific involving flagella, curli, cellulose, and O antigen capsule. A better understanding of plant, microbiological, environmental, processing and food handling factors that facilitate contamination will allow development of evidence-based policies, procedures and technologies aimed at reducing the risk of contamination of fresh produce. 3adevelopment policy 3aradishes 3alabor 3arisk 3araw vegetables 3aspinach 3aflagellum 3acellulose 3atype III secretion system 3afood consumption 3afimbriae 3aantigens 3ahands 3ahumans 3adisease outbreaks 3aleaf lettuce 3afruits 3aanimal-based foods 3afood handling 3aSalmonella 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3asalmonellosis 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & control 2aEscherichia coli O157xisolation & purification 2aFood Microbiology 2aFoodborne Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aSalmonellaxisolation & purification 2aVegetablesxmicrobiology 0aType III secretion system 0avehicles1 aSodha, Samir V.1 aShaw, Bobq(Robert K.)1 aGriffin, Patricia M.1 aPink, David1 aHand, Paul1 aFrankel, Gad0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2010 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.2385-2397dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2010.02297.x 7aarticle03100naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245008600190300001600276500002400292500001500316520172400331650002002055650001202075650001102087650001802098650002502116650001302141650001602154650001802170650001602188650003802204650001402242650002202256650002202278650002002300650004402320650002802364651001902392651001502411651001502426700002102441773009202462852000902554856005502563655001202618IND4397137920221116223300.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439713792DNAL7 a179737532pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00365.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFritz, Brad G.10aEffect of Rapidly Changing River Stage on Uranium Flux through the Hyporheic Zone  ap. 753-760.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMeasurement of ground water/surface water interaction within the hyporheic zone is increasingly recognized as an important aspect of subsurface contaminant fate and transport. Understanding the interaction between ground water and surface water is critical in developing a complete conceptual model of contaminant transport through the hyporheic zone. At the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington, ground water contaminated with uranium discharges to the Columbia River through the hyporheic zone. Ground water flux varies according to changes in hydraulic gradient caused by fluctuating river stage, which changes in response to operation of dams on the Columbia River. Piezometers and continuous water quality monitoring probes were installed in the hyporheic zone to provide long-term, high-frequency measurement of hydraulic gradient and estimated uranium concentrations. Subsequently, the flux of water and uranium was calculated for each half-hour time period over a 15-month study period. In addition, measurement of water levels in the near-shore unconfined aquifer enhanced the understanding of the relationship between river stage, aquifer elevation, and uranium flux. Changing river stage resulted in fluctuating hydraulic gradient within the hyporheic zone. Further, influx of river water caused lower uranium concentrations as a result of dilution. The methods employed in this study provide a better understanding of the interaction between surface and ground water in a situation with a dynamically varying vertical hydraulic gradient and illustrate how the combination of relatively standard methods can be used to derive an accurate estimation of water and contaminant flux through the hyporheic zone. 3awater pollution 3auranium 3arivers 3awater quality 3asurface interactions 3aaquifers 3ariver water 3asurface water 3agroundwater 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeography 2aRiversxchemistry 2aUraniumxanalysis 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Radioactivexanalysis 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 3aColumbia River 0aWashington 0aWashington1 aArntzen, Evan V.0 tGround water.g2007 , v. 45, no. 6 p.753-760dBlackwell Publishing Incx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2007.00365.x 7aarticle02490naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001300142245010200155300001600257500002400273520159700297650002301894650002901917650000801946650001001954700001501964700001501979700001501994773012502009852000902134856004502143655001202188IND4436429220221116223342.0100430e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443642922DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2009000402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Li10aGender and age differences in the distribution of the HDL subclasses among the Chinese population  ap. 502-510.  aIncludes references  aBackground and aims: to analyze the gender and age differences in the distribution of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses among the Chinese population, and to clarify the mechanism of these changes. Methods and results: the apoA-I contents of the plasma HDL subclasses were determined by 2-DE coupled with immunodetection in 324 men (including 186 normolipidemic subjects) and 186 women (including 114 normolipidemic subjects). The contents of preβ₁-HDL and HDL₃ (HDL₃c, HDL₃b, HDL₃a) were significantly lower, whereas the contents of HDL₂a and HDL₂b were higher for women than for men in the <50 years age group. Moreover, the contents of preβ₁-HDL and HDL₃ were higher for female subjects; the HDL₂a and HDL₂b contents were lower for both female and male subjects in the 50-59, 60-69, and ≥70 years age groups versus the subjects of the same gender in the <50 years age group. When compared to the normolipidemic premenopausal women, preβ₁-HDL, HDL₃b, and HDL₃a increased while HDL₂b decreased significantly in normolipidemic men and postmenopausal women. Conclusions: the contents of the large-sized HDL particles HDL₂b were higher, but the contents of the small-sized HDL particles (preβ₁-HDL, HDL₃b, HDL₃a) were lower for women versus men in the <50 years age group. Meanwhile, the gender difference in distribution of the HDL subclass narrowed obviously with advancing age. Moreover, the characteristics of the HDL subclass distribution profile for the normolipidemic postmenopausal women resembled those for the normolipidemic men. 3agender differences 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3amen 3awomen1 aYang, Yuye1 aFu, Mingde1 aXu, Yanhua0 tEuropean journal of lipid science and technology.g2010 Apr., v. 112, no. 4 p.502-510dWiley-VCH Verlagx1438-76977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejlt.200900040 7aarticle03707naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245007500157300001600232500002400248500001500272520240200287650001502689650001002704650001802714650001702732650001102749650001802760650002402778650001102802650002402813650002202837650001202859650001402871650001102885650001302896650001402909650001102923650001402934651001202948653001602960700002602976700002003002700002603022700001803048773008803066852000903154856003803163655001203201IND4441161220221116223038.0100813s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444116122DNAL7 a10.1071/WR091772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolland, Virginie10aImpact of harvest on survival of a heavily hunted game bird population  ap. 392-400.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aContext. Despite their economic importance and intensive management, many game bird species, including the northern bobwhite Colinus virginianus, are in decline. Declines may be explained, at least in part, by low survival due perhaps to poor habitat quality, high predation or excessive hunting pressure. Aims. This study sought to estimate and model annual/seasonal survival probabilities, to evaluate factors influencing them and to determine the cause-specific mortality rates for northern bobwhites subject to varying levels of harvest on the Babcock-Webb Wildlife Management Area (BW area), south Florida, USA. Methods. We applied Cox's proportional hazard models to data collected from 2066 radio-tagged bobwhites during 2002-2008 to test for intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting survival and the non-parametric cumulative incidence function estimator to estimate cause-specific mortality rates. Key results. Mean annual survival (0.091±0.006) in the BW area was lower than most estimates reported for other bobwhite populations. Annual survival differed between adults (0.111±0.008) and juveniles (0.052±0.008), and varied among years. Survival in winter (October-March; 0.295±0.014) was similar to that in summer (April-September; 0.307±0.013). Density of food strips (i.e. long and narrow food plots) did not influence survival, but hunting effort (number of hunters per day per km²) had a substantial negative impact on survival. In the lightly hunted field trial zone, winter (October-March) survival was significantly higher (0.414±0.035) than in the other more heavily hunted management zones (0.319±0.016). Cause-specific mortality analyses revealed that bobwhite mortality during summer (April-September) was mainly due to raptor (39.7%) and mammalian predation (35.6%), whereas hunting was the primary cause of mortality during winter (47.1%). Conclusions. Our results highlight the potential role of harvest as an important cause of the northern bobwhite population declines in south Florida. High mortality during winter may reduce recruitment of juveniles to the reproductive segment of the population, and ultimately the population growth. Implications. Our results suggest that reduction in hunting pressure may be necessary to reverse the declining population trends in heavily hunted game species in public lands, such as the northern bobwhites in the BW area. 3agame birds 3afoods 3aoverwintering 3apublic lands 3awinter 3abirds of prey 3aColinus virginianus 3amodels 3awildlife management 3apopulation growth 3amammals 3apredation 3asummer 3ahabitats 3amortality 3aadults 3ajuveniles 3aFlorida 0arecruitment1 aHostetler, Jeffrey A.1 aHines, Tommy C.1 aPercival, H.

The extracted materials were characterized by SDS-PAGE. The potential of kafirin as a tablet matrix for pharmaceutical applications was studied. Tablets composed of kafirin, calcium hydrogen orthophosphate, caffeine and magnesium stearate were prepared by direct compression. The tablets showed appropriate levels of hardness and friability. Drug release studies showed that caffeine dissolution was greater in 0.1 M HCl than in either phosphate buffer (pH = 6.8) or distilled water. Deamidation of the protein in acid conditions might explain this observation. FTIR analysis showed that the secondary structure of kafirin was found to be mainly governed by α helices with some β sheets. Upon tabletting, there was a change in protein conformation, which was recovered upon dissolution irrespective of the dissolution media. This might be explained by the loss of protein coil to coil interaction during tabletting (possibly due to the diluting effect of calcium hydrogen orthophosphate). This was later recovered when tablets were dissolved due to the hydrophobic interactions between the kafirin proteins. In summary, this work has shown that kafirin has a potential for use as a tablet for drug delivery. 3akafirins 3agrain sorghum 3aphysicochemical properties 3adrugs 3aindustrial applications 3aprotein secondary structure 3aprocessing technology 0atablet matrix1 aGeorget, Dominique M.R.1 aBarker, Susan A.1 aBelton, P.

To investigate the reasons for the increase, we examined the development of red maple and oak (Quercus spp.) seedlings and stump sprouts following the harvest of oak-dominated stands. Within 7 years after harvest, red maple seedlings were present in far greater numbers and captured more growing space than all oaks combined. Growing space occupied by red maple stump sprouts exceeded oak sprouts by a ratio of 3.5:1. Through stump sprouts alone, red maple fully recaptured the amount of growing space it had previously occupied in the overstory 7 years after harvest. Results from similar but older stands show that red maple dominance is sustained into the third decade of stand development. Red maple surpassed all oaks combined in rapid site capture through both seed-origin and sprout-origin regeneration. Red maple's superior ability to regenerate by sprouts is particularly favored by timber harvesting following a history of management and disturbance regimes that permit the accumulation of suppressed small-diameter red maple stems. Among the events and processes that promote stand conversion, timber harvesting may be the major proximal cause of the widespread, increasing dominance of red maple. 3ainterspecific variation 3alogging 3aQuercus montana 3aforest trees 3aQuercus rubra 3asprouting 3aseeds 3aAcer rubrum 3aseedlings 3aadventitious shoots 3aforest succession 3aQuercus coccinea 3aforest stands 3aQuercus alba 3aplant competition 3astand composition 3anatural regeneration 3aQuercus velutina 3astand basal area 3astumps 0aspecies differences 0abasal area 0aspecies dominance1 aSteiner, Kim C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1444-1452dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0653Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02429naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002000176245009300196300001800289500002400307520095800331650002601289650002301315650001201338650002501350650001901375650001801394650001801412650002201430650002101452650002601473650003001499650002401529650003401553650002001587700001701607700001801624700001701642773012201659852000901781856008801790930003301878945002501911946001101936655001201947IND4425685120221116223200.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568512DNAL7 a195766682pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aJiang, Jian-guo10aContinuous CO2 capture and MSWI fly ash stabilization, utilizing novel dynamic equipment  ap. 2933-2938.  aIncludes references  aNovel dynamic equipment with gas in and out continuously was developed to study the capture capacity of CO₂. Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash has a high capture rate of CO₂ in CO₂-rich gas. Fly ash can sequester pure CO₂ rapidly, and its capacity is 16.3 g CO₂/100 g fly ash with no water added and 21.4 g CO₂/100 g fly ash with 20% water added. For simulated incineration gas containing 12% CO₂, the capture rate decreased and the capacity was 13.2 g CO₂/100 g fly ash with no water added and 18.5 g CO₂/100 g fly ash with 20% water added. After accelerated carbonation, the C and O contents increased, indicating CO₂ capture in the fly ash; CO₂ combines with Ca(OH)₂ to form CaCO₃, which increased the CaCO₃ content from 12.5 to 54.3%. The leaching of Pb markedly decreased from 24.48 to 0.111 mg/L. Novel dynamic equipment designed to capture CO₂ by fly ash is more suitable for engineering application. 3amunicipal solid waste 3awaste incineration 3afly ash 3achemical composition 3acarbon dioxide 3agas emissions 3aair pollution 3apollution control 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 2aCarbon Dioxidexchemistry 2aCoal Ashxchemistry 2aIncinerationxinstrumentation 2aRefuse Disposal1 aDu, Xue-juan1 aChen, Mao-zhe1 aZhang, Chang0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2933-2938dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.06.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090924b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03091naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002100194245016700215300001800382500002400400500001500424520117900439650002001618650001801638650001901656650001101675650000901686650001701695650000901712650002501721650001201746650001601758650001901774650001901793650001501812650001201827650002901839650002801868650004901896650001501945650002801960650001101988650004701999650003002046651001002076653001402086700002402100700001902124700002202143773012202165852000902287856008802296930003302384945002502417946001102442655001202453IND4425685220221116223305.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568522DNAL7 a195866982pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ100 0aX1001 aCaruso, Tancredi10aSpatial patterns and autocorrelation in the response of microarthropods to soil pollutants: The example of oribatid mites in an abandoned mining and smelting area  ap. 2939-2948.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlthough exogenous factors such as pollutants can act on endogenous drivers (e.g. dispersion) of populations and create spatially autocorrelated distributions, most statistical techniques assume independence of error terms. As there are no studies on metal soil pollutants and microarthropods that explicitly analyse this key issue, we completed a field study of the correlation between Oribatida and metal concentrations in litter, organic matter and soil in an attempt to account for spatial patterns of both metals and mites. The 50-m wide study area had homogenous macroscopic features, steep Pb and Cu gradients and high levels of Zn and Cd. Spatial models failed to detect metal-oribatid relationships because the observed latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in oribatid assemblages were independent of the collinear gradients in the concentration of metals. It is therefore hypothesised that other spatially variable factors (e.g. fungi, reduced macrofauna) affect oribatid assemblages, which may be influenced by metals only indirectly. Small-scale spatial analysis suggests that metal pollution in soil may not directly affect the distribution of oribatid mites. 3asoil arthropods 3alinear models 3asoil pollution 3acopper 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aspatial distribution 3acadmium 3amined soils 3aSarcoptiformes 3apolluted soils 3ametallurgy 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollution 2aInsectaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMetallurgy 2aMetals, Heavyxtoxicity 2aMining 2aMitesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSoil Pollutantsxtoxicity 3aItaly 0aOribatida1 aMigliorini, Massimo1 aBucci, Charlie1 aBargagli, Roberto0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2939-2948dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.06.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090924b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02163naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011000166300001600276500002400292520111700316650001501433650001701448650001501465650002001480650001101500650002101511650002001532650001901552650000901571700001601580700001801596700001701614773010601631852000901737856005501746655001201801IND4393096620221116223757.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439309662DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.00912.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Liwei10aOsEXPA4 and OsRWC3 are involved in asymmetric growth during gravitropic bending of rice leaf sheath bases  ap. 560-571.  aIncludes references  aExpression of an expansin gene (OsEXPA4) and a plasma membrane aquaporin (OsRWC3) were differentially induced in the abaxial (lower) side of rice leaf sheath bases during gravitropism. Expression of both of these genes was induced by GA₃. β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in transgenic rice expressing a GUS reporter gene under the control of the gibberellin (GA)-responsive OsRWC3 promoter was investigated during gravitropic curvature and found to be enhanced in the abaxial side of graviresponding leaf sheath bases. Ancymidol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, reduced the expression gradient of OsEXPA4 and OsRWC3. The osmotic potential was transiently lower on the abaxial side of gravistimulated leaf sheath bases, and the gravitropic curvature was inhibited by HgCl₂ and phloretin, two known inhibitors of aquaporins. These data suggest that asymmetric GA redistribution following gravistimulation results in the localized expression of OsEXPA4 and OsRWC3, that in turn might bring about differential cell wall loosening, cell expansion and water influx via aquaporins, thus leading to gravitropic bending. 3aaquaporins 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3agene expression 3aleaves 3aosmotic pressure 3aplasma membrane 3areporter genes 3arice1 aCui, Dayong1 aNeill, Steven1 aCai, Weiming0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2007 Aug., v. 130, no. 4 p.560-571dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.00912.x 7aarticle01427naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009600163300001800259500002400277520052300301650001600824650002600840650001000866650003000876650002200906650001200928700001900940773010900959852000901068856004801077655001201125IND4430110820221116223429.0091218e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443011082DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738090801442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuneva, T.

The Feitsui and Shihmen reservoirs are the most important water supply reservoirs in Northern Taiwan supplying the domestic and industrial water supply needs for over 7 million residents. A daily operational simulation model is developed to guide the releases of the reservoir system and then to calculate the shortage indices (SI) of both reservoirs over a long-term simulation period. The NSGA-II is used to minimize the SI values through identification of optimal joint operating strategies. Based on a 49year data set, we demonstrate that better operational strategies would reduce shortage indices for both reservoirs. The results indicate that the NSGA-II provides a promising approach. The pareto-front optimal solutions identified operational compromises for the two reservoirs that would be expected to improve joint operations. 3aalgorithms 3asimulation models 3awater reservoirs 3awater supply 3aTaiwan1 aChang, Fi-John0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Oct. 20, v. 377, no. 1-2 p.12-20dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.07.061 7aarticle02663naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245010200191300001800293500002400311500001500335520104900350650001601399650001801415650002301433650002401456650001201480650002201492650001101514650002301525650002101548650002401569650001001593650001401603651001001617653002101627653001501648653003001663653001801693700002401711700002301735700002401758700002101782700002901803773010201832852000901934856008501943930003302028945002502061946001102086655001202097IND4425634320221116222958.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442563432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-008-9372-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aM001 0aM3101 aYoung, Kyle A.14aThe diversity of juvenile salmonids does not affect their competitive impact on a native galaxiid  ap. 1955-1961.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe used an invaded stream fish community in southern Chile to experimentally test whether the diversity of exotic species affects their competitive impact on a native species. In artificial enclosures an established invasive, rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and a potential invader, Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, reduced the growth rate of native peladilla, Aplochiton zebra, by the same amount. In enclosures with both exotic salmonids, the growth rates of all three species were the same as in single exotic treatments. While neither species identity nor diversity appeared to affect competitive interactions in this experiment, the impact of salmonid diversity may vary with the type of interspecific interaction and/or the species identity of the exotics. Our experiment links two prominent concepts in invasion biology by testing whether the result of invasional meltdown, an increase in the diversity of exotic species, affects their impact through interspecific competition, the mechanism invoked by the biotic resistance hypothesis. 3aSalmo salar 3aanimal growth 3aintroduced species 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3astreams 3aspecies diversity 3asalmon 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3atrout 3ajuveniles 3aChile 0aAplochiton zebra 0aGalaxiidae 0ainterspecific competition 0aSalmoniformes1 aStephenson, Jessica1 aTerreau, Alexandre1 aThailly, Anne-Flore1 aGajardo, Gonzalo1 ade Leaniz, Carlos Garcia0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Oct., v. 11, no. 8 p.1955-1961dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9372-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20090929b20091106c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/09/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03563naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100003200149245010200181300001800283500001500301520163800316650002201954650001601976650002901992650002002021650001002041650002502051650001602076650001202092650001102104650001502115650001702130650003402147650002602181650004402207650002202251650004502273650004202318650003102360650002802391650002802419650002502447650002602472650002402498650004502522650004902567650004202616650002302658650001602681650002702697653003202724700001802756700002302774773008502797852000902882939003302891946001302924655001202937IND9300284220221116223746.0930114e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028422DNAL7 a14471472pmid7 aPMC2074972pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat, N.10aEnvironmental conditions affect transcription of the pectinase genes of Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937  ap. 7807-7818.  a2019-12-04  aTo depolymerize plant pectin, the phytopathogenic enterobacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi produces a series of enzymes which include a pectin-methyl-esterase encoded by the pem gene and five isoenzymes of pectate lyases encoded by the five genes pelA, pelB, pelC, pelD, and pelE. We have constructed transcriptional fusions between the pectinase gene promoters and the uidA gene, encoding beta-glucuronidase, to study the regulation of these E. chrysanthemi pectinase genes individually. The transcription of the pectinase genes is dependent on many environmental conditions. All the fusions were induced by pectic catabolic products and responded, to different degrees, to growth phase, catabolite repression, temperature, and nitrogen starvation. Transcription of pelA, pelD, and pelE was also increased in anaerobic growth conditions. High osmolarity of the culture medium increased expression of pelE but decreased that of pelD; the other pectinase genes were not affected. The level of expression of each gene was different. Transcription of pelA was very low under all growth conditions. The expression of the pelB, pelC, and pem genes was intermediate. The pelE gene had a high basal level of expression. Expression of pelD was generally the most affected by changes in culture conditions and showed a low basal level but very high induced levels. These differences in the expression of the pectinase genes of E. chrysanthemi 3937 presumably reflect their role during infection of plants, because the degradation of pectic polymers of the plant cell walls is the main determinant of tissue maceration caused by soft rot erwiniae. 3apolygalacturonase 3ametabolites 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3agenes 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3atemperature 3astrains 3aoxygen 3aosmolarity 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Repression 2aErwiniaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGlucuronidasexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPectinsxmetabolism 2aPolygalacturonasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 2aRepressor Proteins 2aTemperature 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aPectobacterium chrysanthemi1 aDominguez, H.1 aRobert-Baudouy, J.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1992 Dec., v. 174, no. 23 p.7807-7818x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01738naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245012200164300001800286520040100304650001900705650001200724650001000736650001800746650001100764650001600775650002000791650001500811650001700826650002800843650002100871650002400892650003600916650003000952650004300982650006401025650004601089700001701135773008501152852000901237939003301246946001301279655001201292IND9300284420221116223812.0930114e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028442DNAL7 a14471522pmid7 aPMC2075022pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGore, R.S.10aCell surface carbohydrates of microaerobic, nitrogenase-active, continuous cultures of Bradyrhizobium sp. strain 32H1  ap. 7838-7840.  aA continuous culture system was developed to examine the cell surface carbohydrates of Bradyrhizobium sp. strain 32H1.

Our results showed that in both types of tissue the fractional rates (Ks) and efficiency, (K(RNA)) of protein synthesis significantly increased when fishes were fed four times compared to those fed only twice. The considerable differences between the fractional rates of protein synthesis (Ks) and protein degradation (KD) in white muscle compared to hepatic tissue explains the high percentage of protein deposition in the former. Thus, about ninety-three percent of the protein synthesized in white muscle contributes to growth. while only, eleven percent goes towards growth in the liver. 3amessenger RNA 3adietary protein 3aliver 3afeeding frequency 3aDNA 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3amuscle tissues 3aphenylalanine 3aprotein content 0aprotein turnover 0aamino acids1 aOrtega-Garcia, F.1 aBarroso, J.B.1 aHiguera, M. de la.1 aLupianez, J.A.0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g1992, v. 36, no. 3/4 p.217-224x0277-22487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01987naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008400125300001600209520111200225650001301337650001701350650001201367650001801379650002301397650003001420651001001450653001601460653002001476700001601496773009601512852000901608939003301617946001101650655001201661IND9300282820221116223132.0930114s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurand, G.10aEnvironmental degradation of atrazine, linuron and fenitrothion in soil samples  ap. 225-234.  aThe persistence of atrazine, linuron and fenitrothion in soil samples from an estuarine area (Ebro delta, Tarragona, Spain) has been studied. Soil samples from the top surface (10 cm) were collected during 1989-91, freeze-dried, sieved through 200 micrograms. Soxhlet extracted with methanol, cleaned-up with Florisil and analysed either by gas chromatography-nitrogen phosphorus detection (GC-NPD), in the case of atrazine and fenitrothion, or by liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD), for linuron. Confirmation of the samples analysed by GC-NPD was carried out using GC-mass spectrometric detection (MS) in the electron impact mode. The soil half lives obtained under the real environmental conditions have been calculated and the values obtained have been correlated with the physicochemical properties of each pesticide and the soil type. Degradation was affected by volatilization since temperatures in the area of study are relatively high, ca. 30 degrees C, in the summer period. In the case of atrazine it has been shown that deethylatrazine is formed in all the samples studied. 3aatrazine 3afenitrothion 3alinuron 3asoil analysis 3apesticide residues 3aenvironmental degradation 3aSpain 0apersistence 0aestuarine soils1 aBarcelo, D.0 tToxicological and environmental chemistry.g1992, v. 36, no. 3/4 p.225-234x0277-22487nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01427naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008800124300001600212520070300228650001100931650002300942650001300965650001200978653001600990773010201006852000901108939003301117946001101150655001201161IND9300283320221116222939.0930114e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930028332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamp, M.10aDetermination of resistant starch in foods and food products: interlaboratory study  ap.

Principally, two methods derived from Berry (1986, Journal of Cereal Science, 4, 301-314) (method A) and Bjorck et al. (1986, Journal of Cereal Science, 4, 1-11) (method B) were used to analyse four samples containing various forms of RS. Several methods were also used to determine total starch. The RS yield by method A compared to method B was higher in all samples except unmilled bean flakes. When the starch was a raw B-type (potato starch), method B failed to detect any RS because of its initial heating step, whereas method A yielded 48% RS on an 'as is' basis. 3astarch 3aanalytical methods 3aaccuracy 3amilling 0acomparisons0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Oct., v. 46, no. suppl.2 p.S51-S62x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02622naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001500185245011000200300001800310500002400328520110800352650001301460650001801473650001901491650002301510650002501533650002701558650002901585650002901614650002901643650004001672650001201712651001001724651001001734700001501744700001401759700001801773700002101791700001601812773012201828852000901950856008801959930003302047945002502080946001102105655001202116IND4425691620221116223634.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569162DNAL7 a194823952pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ5001 aShen, J.L.10aHigh concentrations and dry deposition of reactive nitrogen species at two sites in the North China Plain  ap. 3106-3113.  aIncludes references  aAtmospheric concentrations of major reactive nitrogen (Nr) species were quantified using passive samplers, denuders, and particulate samplers at Dongbeiwang and Quzhou, North China Plain (NCP) in a two-year study. Average concentrations of NH₃, NO₂, HNO₃, pNH₄+ and pNO₃- were 12.0, 12.9, 0.6, 10.3, and 4.7 μg N m⁻³ across the two sites, showing different seasonal patterns of these Nr species. For example, the highest NH₃ concentration occurred in summer while NO₂ concentrations were greater in winter, both of which reflected impacts of N fertilization (summer) and coal-fueled home heating (winter). Based on measured Nr concentrations and their deposition velocities taken from the literature, annual N dry deposition was up to 55 kg N ha⁻¹. Such high concentrations and deposition rates of Nr species in the NCP indicate very serious air pollution from anthropogenic sources and significant atmospheric N input to crops. High concentrations and deposition rates of reactive N species in the North China Plain imply a serious air pollution problem from anthropogenic sources. 3anitrogen 3aair pollution 3adry deposition 3aseasonal variation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3aanthropogenic activities 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aReactive Nitrogen Speciesxanalysis 2aSeasons 3aChina 0aChina1 aTang, A.H.1 aLiu, X.J.1 aFangmeier, A.1 aGoulding, K.T.W.1 aZhang, F.S.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3106-3113dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02862naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002200185245013200207300001800339500002400357500001500381520122800396650002001624650002301644650002101667650002401688650001001712650002501722650001901747650002401766650001601790650002901806650001201835650003901847650002301886650002401909650002401933650001701957650005301974653002902027773012202056852000902178856008802187930003302275945002502308946001102333655001202344IND4425693120221116223319.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569312DNAL7 a194823932pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM3001 aAngeler, David G.10aSpecies-specific and context-dependant disruption of temporal population fluctuations resulting from hypereutrophication events  ap. 3174-3182.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study quantifies the disruption of zooplankton population fluctuations in relation to two magnitudes of fire retardant contamination events using artificial ponds as model systems. Population time series were analysed using redundancy analysis where time was modelled with a principal coordinate of neighborhood matrices approach that identified relevant scales of fluctuation frequencies. Analyses of temporal coherence provided insight whether population fluctuations correlated with system intrinsic or extrinsic forces. Responses to stress were species-specific and context-dependant. Contamination changed temporal structure in some species. These alterations were associated with an increased intrinsic control of dynamics. In some cases the magnitude of impact was unrelated to contamination severity. Some populations were less tolerant of pollution in the low relative to the high concentration treatment. Results suggest that population-level monitoring of degraded sites may be suboptimal because disparate population responses complicate the selection of specific sentinel organisms to monitor stress. Contamination disrupts temporal population fluctuations in a species-specific and context-dependant way. 3awater pollution 3atemporal variation 3aflame retardants 3acommunity structure 3aponds 3atime series analysis 3aeutrophication 3apopulation dynamics 3azooplankton 3aenvironmental monitoring 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aZooplanktonxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 0aflame retardant finishes0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3174-3182dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20090928b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02650naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001700185245013600202300001800338500002400356520098700380650002701367650003701394650002001431650002001451650001101471650002301482650002501505650005701530650003301587650004501620650002001665650003301685650004101718651001001759651001001769653001901779700001501798700001901813700001201832773012201844852000901966856008801975930003302063945002502096946001102121655001202132IND4425686020221116223842.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568602DNAL7 a195640682pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aP3001 aLiu, Guoqing10aSedimentary record of hydrophobic organic compounds in relation to regional economic development: A study of Taihu Lake, East China  ap. 2994-3000.  aIncludes references  aSediment cores taken from Taihu Lake, East China were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polybrominated biphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The results showed a general sharp increase of HCH, DDT, PAH and PBDE concentrations in the surface layers, corresponding to a sedimentation time of 1980 and 1990 onward in the Meiliang Bay and Xukou Bay, respectively. The source of PAHs has largely transferred from petrogenic to pyrogenic origin, and good relationships were observed between sediment PAH concentrations and the regional gross domestic product. The sharp increase of DDTs in recent years may be related to the mobilization and migration of these chemicals from surface soil to lake sediment, as a result of enhanced soil run-off due to large scale land transform, as well as the contribution of current usage of dicofol and DDT-containing anti-fouling paints. PAHs, DDTs and PBDEs are still increasing in the Taihu Lake sediment. 3asediment contamination 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aDDT (pesticide) 3arunoff 3atemporal variation 2aEconomic Development 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxadverse effectsxeconomics. 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aLakesxanalysis 2aOrganic Chemicalsxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina 0atrend analysis1 aZhang, Gan1 aJin, Zhangdong1 aLi, Jun0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.2994-3000dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0563Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03132naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002100194245014900215300001800364500002400382500001500406520108400421650002001505650001101525650001801536650001501554650002201569650002201591650002001613650001501633650001901648650002001667650001601687650002101703650001201724650002601736650005301762650003801815650003401853650003401887650002201921650003001943650001801973651001401991651001402005653002502019653001702044653001702061700002102078700002102099700002502120700002502145773012202170852000902292856008802301930003302389945002502422946001102447655001202458IND4425686720140725000000.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568672DNAL7 a195896322pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL600 0aM0011 aCazenave, Jimena10aMultiple biomarkers responses in Prochilodus lineatus allowed assessing changes in the water quality of Salado River basin (Santa Fe, Argentina)  ap. 3025-3033.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis field study assessed water quality of Salado River basin by using a set of biomarkers in the fish Prochilodus lineatus. Multiple biomarkers were measured, including morphological indexes (condition factor, liver somatic index), hematological (red and white blood cells) and biochemical (glucose, total protein and cholinesterase activity) parameters. Besides, detoxication and oxidative stress markers (antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation) were measured in liver, gills and kidney. Despite water quality assessment did not show marked differences among sites, biomarkers responses indicate that fish are living under stressful environmental conditions. According to multivariate analysis glucose, glutathione S-transferase activity, lipid peroxidation levels and the count of white blood cells are key biomarkers to contribute to discrimination of sites. So, we suggest use those biomarkers in future monitoring of freshwater aquatic systems. A battery of biomarkers was successfully applied to assess the health of the fish Prochilodus lineatus from Salado River basin. 3awater pollution 3arivers 3awater quality 3abiomarkers 3aindicator species 3aanimal morphology 3afreshwater fish 3ahematology 3acholinesterase 3aenzyme activity 3aProchilodus 3aoxidative stress 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aCharaciformesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGillsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLiverxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutionxanalysis 2aWater Quality 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0aProchilodus lineatus 0abiochemistry 0achemometrics1 aBacchetta, Carla1 aParma, María J.1 aScarabotti, Pablo A.1 aWunderlin, Daniel A.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2009 Nov., v. 157, no. 11 p.3025-3033dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0553Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02639naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001500185245012700200300001800327500002400345520118300369650001801552650001001570650002001580650002201600650002901622650001801651650002901669650003801698650002001736650001601756651001101772651001101783700001801794700002201812700001901834700001601853773012201869852000901991856008802000930003302088945002502121946001102146655001202157IND4425687320221116223722.0090908e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568732DNAL7 a195019392pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2009.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aB2001 aPiikki, K.10aEstimates of AOT ozone indices from time-integrated ozone data and hourly air temperature measurements in southwest Sweden  ap. 3051-3058.  aIncludes references  aSurface ozone concentration and surface air temperature was measured hourly at three coastal sites, four low elevation inland sites and two high elevation inland sites in southwestern Sweden. Diurnal ozone concentration range (DOR) and diurnal temperature range (DTR) were strongly correlated, both spatially and temporally, most likely because both depended on atmospheric stability. Accumulated ozone exposure above a threshold concentration of x nmol mol⁻¹ (AOTx) was estimated from time-integrated ozone concentration (as from diffusive sampling) and measures of ozone concentration variability. Two methods both estimated 24-h AOTx with high accuracy (modelling efficiencies >90% for x less than or equal to40 nmol mol⁻¹). Daytime (08:00-20:00) AOTx could not be equally well estimated. Estimates were better for lower AOT thresholds. Diffusive ozone concentration sampling, combined with hourly temperature monitoring, could be a valuable complement to ozone concentration monitoring with continuous instruments. Ozone indices could be estimated from time-integrated ozone data, using the coupling between surface ozone dynamics and surface air temperature dynamics. 3aair pollution 3aozone 3aair temperature 3adiurnal variation 3aenvironmental monitoring 2aAirxanalysis 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aOzonexanalysis 2aTemperature 3aSweden 0aSweden1 aKlingberg, J.1 aKarlsson, G.

Franco) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) was measured in dry Douglas-fir forest at the Opax Mountain Silvicultural Systems site and a nearby burned area as one component of understanding limited natural regeneration in these sites. Seeds were placed in plots surrounded by a physical barrier to invertebrates, enclosed in mesh impermeable to small mammals, covered by litter, or unprotected in clear-cut, partially harvested, uncut, and burned areas and monitored for three several-day sessions in 2 years. Daily survival rates of unprotected seeds of both species were equally low: 0.63 in uncut forest, 0.45 in partially harvested and clear-cut sites, and 0.03 in the burned area. Experimental reductions of coarse woody debris reduced seed predation moderately in patch cuts but not in uncut forest. Litter cover or selective exclosure of ground-dwelling invertebrates reduced seed losses only slightly, whereas small mammal exclosures eliminated most seed loss. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus Wagner) are likely the most important seed predators. High rates of seed predation in dry Douglas-fir forests likely limit natural regeneration in harvested and burned stands. 3aseeds 3aseed predation 3aforest litter 3aconiferous forests 3aPinus ponderosa 3acoarse woody debris 3anatural regeneration 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3asmall mammals 3aclearcutting 3aBritish Columbia 0asilvicultural practices 0aexclosure 0apartial cutting 0apatch cutting1 aArsenault, André.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1548-1556dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0843Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02992naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100002300162245013900185300001800324500002400342500002300366500001500389520136400404650001901768650002601787650001601813650002501829650002301854650001401877650000901891650001801900650002501918650002301943650001801966650002301984651003102007651003802038700002402076700002402100700002602124700002502150773013402175852000902309856007502318930003302393945002502426946001102451655001202462IND4425689120221116222943.0090908e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442568912DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK810 0aW0001 aStephens, Scott L.10aFuel treatment effects on stand-level carbon pools, treatment-related emissions, and fire risk in a Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forest  ap. 1538-1547.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aPolicies have been enacted to encourage carbon (C) sequestration through afforestation, reforestation, and other silvicultural practices; however, the effects of wildfires on forest C stocks are poorly understood. We present information from Sierran mixed-conifer forests regarding how control, mechanical, prescribed-fire, and mechanical followed by prescribed-fire treatments affected C pools. Secondly, we report CO2 emissions from machinery and burning associated with the treatments. Lastly, the effects of treatments on the potential for C loss to wildfire are presented. The amount of aboveground C in live trees was significantly reduced in mechanical-only and mechanical plus fire treatments; C contained in dead trees was not significantly different. There was no significant difference in aboveground live and dead tree C between the fire-only and control treatments. Fire-only and mechanical plus fire treatments emitted significantly more CO2 than the mechanical treatment and control. Modeling results for the control demonstrated 90% of the live tree C had a high (>75%) chance of being killed in a wildfire; in contrast, all three active treatments had low vulnerabilities to C loss. With wildfire severity increasing in most Sierran forests, management actions designed to increase fire resistance are justified for long-term C sequestration. 3acarbon dioxide 3afire hazard reduction 3afire hazard 3afuels (fire ecology) 3aconiferous forests 3awildfires 3asoil 3aforest stands 3acarbon sequestration 3aforestry equipment 3agas emissions 3aprescribed burning 3aSierra Nevada (California) 0aSierra Nevada region (California)1 aMoghaddas, Jason J.1 aHartsough, Bruce R.1 aMoghaddas, Emily E.Y.1 aClinton, Nicholas E.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1538-1547dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0813Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02834naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001900162245011700181300001800298500002400316500002300340500001500363520144100378650001901819650001401838650001701852650001601869650003101885650001801916650002201934650001801956650001601974651001001990653001702000653000902017700001902026700002002045773013402065852000902199856007502208930003302283945002502316946001102341655001202352IND4425691220221116223232.0090908e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442569122DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF300 0aK0011 aFukasawa, Yū.10aMicrofungus communities of Japanese beech logs at different stages of decay in a cool temperate deciduous forest  ap. 1606-1614.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aFallen logs of Japanese beech (Fagus crenata Blume) at various stages of decomposition were sampled from a cool temperate deciduous forest in Japan and studied for differences in the associated microfungus communities. Wood samples were directly plated onto each of two different media for the identification of fungal species. Approximately 1500 isolations were made, which represent 96 species of filamentous microfungi, consisting of 16 zygomycetes and 80 anamorphic ascomycetes. The number of species per log (α-diversity) increased with log decomposition, while dissimilarity of species composition among logs (β-diversity) showed a unimodal response with the optimum at the intermediate decay stage. The water content and nitrogen concentration of the wood were positively correlated, while the lignocellulose index and relative density were negatively correlated with α-diversity. Stepwise regression models suggested that lignocellulose index was the single most important determinant of variation in α-diversity and explained 31% of variation. Eighteen fungal species frequently isolated from the logs were classified into four groups based on their occurrence patterns. These groups occurred successively during log decomposition, and the succession in early stage of log decomposition was related with relative density, while the succession in late stage was related with water content and nitrogen concentration of wood. 3alignocellulose 3adead wood 3adecayed wood 3adecay fungi 3aphysicochemical properties 3aFagus crenata 3aspecies diversity 3awater content 3adegradation 3aJapan 0adecay stages 0alogs1 aOsono, Takashi1 aTakeda, Hiroshi0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 8 p.1606-1614dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-0803Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02796naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002000191245010600211300001400317500002400331520113200355650002301487650001901510650000901529650000901538650001601547650003001563650002401593650002301617650003001640650003501670650003401705650002701739650002701766650002001793700001601813700001401829700001301843700001401856700001301870773010201883852000901985856008501994856010602079930003302185945002502218946001102243655001202254IND4425708120221116223847.0090908e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442570812DNAL7 a247849722pmid7 a10.1080/026520309030425252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aQ203 0aH0001 aFernandes, A.R.10aPolybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and brominated dioxins (PBDD/Fs) in Irish food of animal origin  ap. 86-94.  aIncludes references  aBrominated dioxins (PBDD/Fs) and 17 polybrominated diphenylether (PBDE) congeners including BDE-209 were analysed in 100 composite samples of commonly consumed foods of animal origin, prepared from ten to 40 individual subsamples of each type.

The detection of these compounds, in particular PBDD/Fs, is consistent with the increased use and disposal of brominated organic compounds. 3aanimal-based foods 3alivers as food 3amilk 3aeggs 3adietary fat 3aWorld Health Organization 3aon-farm food safety 3apesticide residues 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3aenvironmental exposure 3amaximum residue limits 3aquality control1 aTlustos, C.1 aSmith, F.1 aCarr, M.1 aPetch, R.1 aRose, M.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.86-94dTaylor & Francisx1939-32107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520309030425253Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t783462596~db=all3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090926b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02692naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245008300153300001800236500002400254520162600278650001201904650001601916650001601932650002101948650002101969650002001990650000902010650001302019650001202032650002302044650001502067650001502082650001002097651001102107700001702118773011102135852000902246856003902255655001202294IND4458669720221116223726.0110603e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445866972DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.79462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodhe, Allan10aGroundwater dynamics in a till hillslope: flow directions, gradients and delay  ap. 1899-1909.  aIncludes references  aKnowledge of groundwater dynamics is important for the understanding of hydrological controls on chemical processes along the water flow pathways. To increase our knowledge of groundwater dynamics in areas with shallow groundwater, the groundwater dynamics along a hillslope were studied in a boreal catchment in Southern Sweden. The forested hillslope had a 1- to 2-m deep layer of sandy till above bedrock. The groundwater flow direction and slope were calculated under the assumption that the flow followed the slope of the groundwater table, which was computed for different triangles, each defined by three groundwater wells. The flow direction showed considerable variations over time, with a maximum variation of 75°. During periods of high groundwater levels the flow was almost perpendicular to the stream, but as the groundwater level fell, the flow direction became gradually more parallel to the stream, directed in the downstream direction. These findings are of importance for the interpretation of results from hillslope transects, where the flow direction usually is assumed to be invariable and always in the direction of the hillslope. The variations in the groundwater flow direction may also cause an apparent dispersion for groundwater-based transport. In contrast to findings in several other studies, the groundwater level was most responsive to rainfall and snowmelt in the upper part of the hillslope, while the lower parts of the slope reached their highest groundwater level up to 40 h after the upper parts. This can be explained by the topography with a wetter hollow area in the upper part. 3abedrock 3adispersions 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahigh water table 3aprocess control 3arain 3asnowmelt 3astreams 3atemporal variation 3atopography 3awatersheds 3awells 3aSweden1 aSeibert, Jan0 tHydrological processes.g2011 June 15, v. 25, no. 12 p.1899-1909dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7946 7aarticle01355naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245007900153300001600232520039800248650002200646650001100668650004400679650001100723700001700734700001800751700001500769773010000784852000900884856007700893930003300970945001301003946001301016655001201029IND2124058720221116223854.0980717e199703  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212405872DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960331o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArnoldi, A.10aNew colored compounds from the Maillard reaction between xylose and lysine  ap. 650-655.  aAn aqueous xylose-lysine model system was heated for 1 h under reflux, and the colored ethyl acetate-extractable compounds were separated.

Two types of TGase with molecular weights of the 84 000 (TG-1) and 90 000 (TG-2) were obtained. The optimum pH was 8.0 for both TGases, and the optimum temperature for TG-1 and TG-2 was 40 and 25 degrees C, respectively. The activity of TG-1 increased with NaCl concentrations, whereas that of TG-2 was inhibited by NaCl. In the absence of NaCl, the activity of TG-1 increased with CaCl2 concentrations up to 100 mM, but the concentration required to express full activity of TG-2 was 25 mM. This CaCl2 concentration was lowered to 25 mM for TG-1 in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, but not changed for TG-2. The epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine was not detected in fresh oyster but was detected in processed oyster, suggesting the possibility that the intrinsic TGases react in the manufacturing process of oyster products. 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aammonium sulfate 3acalcium chloride 3achromatography 3afractionation 3agills 3alysine 3amanufacturing 3amolecular weight 3aoysters 3apH 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3asodium chloride 3atemperature1 aSano, K.1 aSeguro, K.1 aYasueda, H.1 aNio, N.1 aMotoki, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.604-610x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf96045963Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02735naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001600182245007900198300001400277500002400291500001500315520124400330650001301574650001301587650001101600650002701611650002301638650001001661650001301671650002601684650001201710650001801722650001201740651001601752653001801768653001501786653001201801700001701813700001601830773010201846852000901948856008501957856010602042930003302148945002502181946001102206655001202217IND4425706720221116223339.0090908e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442570672DNAL7 a247849632pmid7 a10.1080/026520308026840962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aH0001 aCressey, P.10aPesticide residues in conventionally grown and organic New Zealand produce  ap. 21-26.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA study was carried out to determine the prevalence and concentrations of pesticide residues in conventionally grown and organic produce (bananas, broccoli, grapes, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, wine). Sampling was stratified, with organic produce being over-sampled, when available. All food samples were analysed, as received, by a multi-residue pesticide residue screen. Residues were found in 130 of 307 conventionally grown food samples (42%) and in nine of 41 organic food samples (22%), including six of eleven (55%) organic tomato samples. Only four organic samples (9.8%) contained multiple residues, while 24% of conventionally grown food samples contained multiple residues. Nine conventionally grown food samples (2.6%) contained pesticide residues that exceeded the maximum residue limit (MRL). Where direct comparisons were possible between conventionally grown and organic produce, the mean concentration of residues was usually lower in the organic produce, but was generally higher than would be expected from spray drift or other adventitious sources. While the presence of these residues does not represent a significant risk to human health, their presence is inconsistent with consumer expectations for organic produce. 3atomatoes 3abroccoli 3agrapes 3amaximum residue limits 3apesticide residues 3awines 3apotatoes 3amultiresidue analysis 3alettuce 3aorganic foods 3abananas 3aNew Zealand 0afruits (food) 0avegetables 0aproduce1 aVannoort, R.1 aMalcolm, C.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 June, v. 2, no. 1 p.21-26dTaylor & Francisx1939-32107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520308026840963Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t783462596~db=all3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090926b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03905naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002400182245010900206300001800315500002400333500001500357520153400372650002501906650002601931650001001957650002701967650002401994650002102018650001702039650002002056650003102076650001702107650002002124650001802144650001502162650001002177650000902187650002802196650001302224650003002237650002402267650008702291650002402378650003302402650002802435650002502463650003602488650001102524650002002535650001102555650000902566650001602575650002502591650001302616650002802629653002602657653002302683700001902706700002202725700002402747700001802771700001402789700002602803700002102829773008402850852000902934856008502943930003303028945002503061946001303086655001203099IND4397101620221117212002.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439710162DNAL7 a177138042pmid7 a10.1007/s11745-007-3098-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT2001 aArterburn, Linda M.10aBioequivalence of Docosahexaenoic Acid from Different Algal Oils in Capsules and in a DHA-Fortified Food  ap. 1011-1024.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDocosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a long-chain omega-3 fatty acid, is important for eye and brain development and ongoing visual, cognitive, and cardiovascular health. Unlike fish-sourced oils, the bioavailability of DHA from vegetarian-sourced (algal) oils has not been formally assessed. We assessed bioequivalence of DHA oils in capsules from two different algal strains versus bioavailability from an algal-DHA-fortified food. Our 28-day randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study compared bioavailability of (a) two different algal DHA oils in capsules (“DHASCO-T” and “DHASCO-S”) at doses of 200, 600, and 1,000 mg DHA per day (n = 12 per group) and of (b) an algal-DHA-fortified food (n = 12). Bioequivalence was based on changes in plasma phospholipid and erythrocyte DHA levels. Effects on arachidonic acid (ARA), docosapentaenoic acid-n-6 (DPAn-6), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) were also determined. Both DHASCO-T and DHASCO-S capsules produced equivalent DHA levels in plasma phospholipids and erythrocytes. DHA response was dose-dependent and linear over the dose range, plasma phospholipid DHA increased by 1.17, 2.28 and 3.03 g per 100 g fatty acid at 200, 600, and 1,000 mg dose, respectively. Snack bars fortified with DHASCO-S oil also delivered equivalent amounts of DHA on a DHA dose basis. Adverse event monitoring revealed an excellent safety and tolerability profile. Two different algal oil capsule supplements and an algal oil-fortified food represent bioequivalent and safe sources of DHA. 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aalgae 3afatty acid composition 3aplant fats and oils 3aarachidonic acid 3aerythrocytes 3ahuman nutrition 3arandomized clinical trials 3ablood plasma 3afortified foods 3aphospholipids 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aArachidonic Acidxblood 2aCapsules 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturated 2aDietary Supplements 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxpharmacokinetics. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxblood 2aErythrocytesxchemistry 2aEukaryotaxchemistry 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxblood 2aFemale 2aFood, Fortified 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aPlacebos 2aTherapeutic Equivalency 0adocosapentaenoic acid 0aalgae and seaweeds1 aOken, Harry A.1 aHoffman, James P.1 aBailey-Hall, Eileen1 aChung, Gloria1 aRom, Dror1 aHamersley, Jacqueline1 aMcCarthy, Deanna0 tLipids.g2007 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.1011-1024dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-007-3098-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20071226b20080102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/12/26  aOther US 7aarticle03258naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100002000200245012900220300001600349500002400365500001500389520127000404650002101674650001801695650001601713650001101729650001401740650001601754650001601770650002101786650001601807650000901823650002001832650002001852650002101872650000901893650001201902650000901914650003701923650006101960650001102021650002702032650003902059650002702098650000902125650002502134650002702159650000902186650003302195653002302228653001802251653003202269653001202301773008202313852000902395856008502404930003302489945002502522946001302547655001202560IND4397102220221117212009.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439710222DNAL7 a177138022pmid7 a10.1007/s11745-007-3106-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT000 0aT200 0aL500 0aL6001 aFritsche, Kevin10aImportant Differences Exist in the Dose-Response Relationship between Diet and Immune Cell Fatty Acids in Humans and Rodents  ap. 961-979.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOmega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) are noted for their ability to diminish inflammatory and immune responses in vitro and in a variety of animal-based models of autoimmunity and inflammation. Yet, recent systematic reviews suggest that the evidence for these fatty acids having beneficial effects on inflammation or autoimmunity in humans is equivocal. A possible explanation for these disappointing and somewhat paradoxical findings emerged from the analyses described in this review. The available data on the changes in immune cell fatty acid profiles in mice, rats and humans, fed various forms and amounts of n-3 PUFA are summarized and displayed graphically. The dose-response curves generated provide new insights into the relationship between dietary n-3 PUFA and immune cell fatty acid profiles. The author suggests that the poor predictive value of most in vitro as well as many animal trials may, in part, be a consequence of the frequent adoption of experimental conditions that create differences in immune cell fatty acid profiles that far exceed what is possible in free-living humans through dietary intervention. Recommendations for improving the preclinical value of future in vitro and animal-based studies with n-3 PUFA are provided. 3aanimal nutrition 3adose response 3adietary fat 3ahumans 3amonocytes 3alymphocytes 3amacrophages 3aarachidonic acid 3aneutrophils 3amice 3aimmune response 3ahuman nutrition 3alipid metabolism 3arats 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aHumans 2aImmunityxdrug effects 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxchemistry 2aLymphocytesxchemistry 2aMice 2aMonocytesxchemistry 2aNeutrophilsxchemistry 2aRats 2aSpleenxchemistryxcytology. 0aliterature reviews 0aimmune system 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0arodents0 tLipids.g2007 Nov., v. 42, no. 11 p.961-979dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-007-3106-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20071226b20080102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/12/26  aOther US 7aarticle02112naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001200163245010600175300001600281500002400297520071800321650002001039650001101059650001001070650001901080650002001099650001901119650001901138650002201157650001801179650002101197650001301218650002101231650001901252653002201271700002001293700001801313700001901331773011701350852000901467856008501476930003301561945002501594946001101619655001201630IND4397114920221117211958.0071028e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439711492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-007-9283-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF1101 aAli, N.10aRadical disinfestation protocol eliminates in vitro contamination in Guava (Psidium guajava L.) seeds  ap. 295-298.  aIncludes references  aControlling contamination in vitro is one of the basic requirements for successful tissue culture technology. In preliminary studies, in vitro contamination of guava seeds was almost 100%, even when disinfested with bleach. To overcome this problem, we developed a unique method to control contamination using bleach and strong acids. Submerging guava seeds in 10% HCl for 24-72 h followed by a 30 min treatment with 10% bleach (NaOCl) reduced contamination rates from 98 to 0%. Substituting 5% H₂SO₄ for 12 h for 10% HCL gave similar results. In addition to eliminating contamination, acid-treated seeds germinated faster in vitro than control seeds germinated in a greenhouse (15 vs. 40 days, respectively). 3aPsidium guajava 3aguavas 3aseeds 3adisinfestation 3adecontamination 3aseed treatment 3aacid treatment 3ahydrochloric acid 3asulfuric acid 3aseed germination 3aexplants 3amicropropagation 3atissue culture 0ahypochlorous acid1 aMulwa, R.

Rangelands, produced by grazing herbivores, are important for a variety of agricultural, hunting, recreation and conservation objectives world-wide. Typically, there is little quantitative evidence regarding the magnitude of the grazing impact of different herbivores on rangeland habitats to inform their management. 2. We quantified the grazing and trampling impact of sheep, cattle, red deer Cervus elaphus, rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, mountain hares Lepus timidus and red grouse Lagopus lagopus on open-hill habitats in 11 areas of upland Scotland. The degradation of heather in upland Scotland Calluna vulgaris-dominated habitats, of conservation significance at a European scale, has been attributed, anecdotally, to increasing sheep and red deer populations. 3. Field indicators of habitat condition were used to generate a five-point scale of impact in vegetation polygons of seven habitats. The presence of each herbivore species was attributed on the basis of 'signs' of occupancy. A Bayesian regression model was used to analyse the association of herbivore species with grazing impact on plant communities, controlling for environmental attributes. 4. Overall the presence of sheep was associated with the largest increase (7/11 areas) in grazing and trampling impact of all herbivores. Cattle had the second largest impact but generally this was restricted to fewer areas and habitats than sheep. In contrast, impacts associated with wild herbivores tended to be small and only significant locally. 5. Although red deer presence was associated with a significantly lower impact than sheep, this impact increased with increasing deer density at both land-ownership and regional scales. For sheep there was little or no evidence of density dependence. 6. Synthesis and applications. The higher impact associated with sheep presence probably reflects their greater aggregation because of their limited ranging behaviour, exacerbated by sheep being herded in places convenient for land managers. Consequently, future reductions in sheep numbers as a result of reform of European Union farming policies may limit the extent of their impact, but not necessarily the local magnitude. However, reductions in sheep stocks may lead to increases in deer densities, with greater impact, particularly in heather-dominated habitats. Where habitat conservation is a priority this may well require a reduction in deer numbers. 3arangelands 3aherbivores 3agrazing 3asheep 3acattle 3aCervus elaphus 3aOryctolagus cuniculus 3aLepus timidus 3aLagopus lagopus 3atrampling damage 3ahabitat destruction 3aenvironmental impact 3aScotland1 aBREWER, M.J.1 aO'BRIEN, S.1 aNOLAN, A.J.1 aCope, D.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2007 Dec., v. 44, no. 6 p.1176-1187dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01318.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03638naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171100002000188245015500208300001600363500002400379520170300403650001502106650001502121650002102136650001702157650002402174650001202198650001702210650001102227650004402238650001102282650000902293650004602302650005502348650005602403650003402459650003002493650003002523650004302553700002702596700002302623700002102646700002602667700002102693773013102714852000902845856009202854856005502946930003303001945002503034946001303059655001203072IND4397178120221117211652.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439717812DNAL7 a180187222pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2007.00289.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The goal of this study was to determine if mean quantitative CT density and mean voxel standard deviation are associated with the presence and severity of osteochondral lesions in the palmar aspect of the distal third metacarpal bone in racing horses. Metacarpophalangeal joints from nine racehorses were imaged using CT and scored for gross damage. Four-millimeter-thick sagittal and 30° palmar dorsal plane sections were cut, decalcified and stained with hematoxylin and eosin from the distal third metacarpal bone. Microscopic osteochondral lesions and subchondral remodeling were scored on a scale of 0-3. Percent subchondral bone, expressed as the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume, was also measured. Mean quantitative CT density and mean voxel standard deviation were measured from three-dimensional models of CT images comparable with histologic sections. Mean quantitative CT density was not associated with lesion severity or number of lesions. A weak correlation between mean quantitative CT density and gross score was found, but mean quantitative CT density was not predictive for gross score. Mean voxel standard deviation was not correlated with gross or histopathologic measures, but was predictive of mild osteochondral lesions. Results support the association of subchondral remodeling with the development of palmar metacarpal lesions. However, there was not a strong correlation between mean quantitative CT density or mean voxel standard deviation and histopathologic lesions of the distal third metacarpal bone. 3aracehorses 3ametacarpus 3alesions (animal) 3abone density 3acomputed tomography 2aAnimals 2aBone Density 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxpathologyxradiography. 2aHorses 2aMale 2aMetacarpal Bonesxpathologyxradiography. 2aMetacarpophalangeal Jointxpathologyxradiography. 2aOsteoarthritisxpathologyxradiographyxveterinary. 2aPhysical Conditioning, Animal 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aTomography, X-Ray Computedxveterinary1 aKawcak, Christopher E.1 aNORRDIN, ROBERT W.1 aPARK, RICHARD D.1 aMcIlwraith, C.

Eight dogs with varying size nasal tumors (5.8-110.9 cc) were replanned to 42 Gy to the nasal cavity and integrated dose boosts to gross disease of 45.2, 48.3, and 51.3 Gy in 10 fractions. EUD values were calculated for tumors and mean normalized total doses (NTDmean) for organs at risk (OAR). Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) values were obtained for OARs, and estimated TCP values were computed using a logistic dose-response model and based on deliverable EUD boost doses. Significant increases in estimated TCP to 54%, 74%, and 86% can be achieved with 10%, 23%, and 37% mean relative EUD boosts to the gross disease, respectively. NTCP values for blindness of either eye and for brain necrosis were <0.01% for all boosts. Values for cataract development were 31%, 42%, and 46% for studied boost schemas, respectively. Average NTDmean to eyes and brain for mean EUD boosts were 10.2, 11.3, and 12.1 Gy₃, and 7.5, 7.2, and 7.9 Gy₂, respectively. Using helical tomotherapy, simultaneously integrated dose boosts can be delivered to increase the estimated TCP at 1-year without significantly increasing the NTDmean to eyes and brain. Delivery of these treatments in a prospective trial may allow quantification of a dose-response relationship in canine nasal tumors. 3adogs 3aneoplasms 3anasal cavity 3aradiography 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxradiotherapy 2aDogs 2aModels, Biological 2aNose Neoplasmsxradiotherapyxveterinary. 2aRadiotherapy Dosage 2aRadiotherapy, Computer-Assistedxveterinary 2aTomography, Spiral Computedxveterinary1 aDEVEAU, MICHAEL1 aFORREST, LISA J.1 aTOMÉ, WOLFGANG A.1 aMACKIE, THOMAS R.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2007 , v. 48, no. 6 p.594-602dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2007.00304.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2007.00304.x  a20080630b20080704c00000000  aINDdDFXe2008/06/30  aOther US 7aarticle04165naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245015700213300001600370500002400386500001500410520189400425650002802319650001402347650002002361650001702381650002302398650002902421650002202450650001302472650001302485650001102498650002502509650001902534650001102553650002002564650001202584650001302596650005602609650003602665650001102701650006602712650002502778650005602803650001102859650000902870650006902879650001502948651001702963651002602980653000903006653004203015653002003057653002703077700002203104700001903126700002003145773010803165852000903273856009203282930003303374945002503407946001103432655001203443IND4397198920221117211348.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439719892DNAL7 a179709982pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00572.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aL2001 aSandmeyer, Lynne S.10aClinical and electroretinographic characteristics of congenital stationary night blindness in the Appaloosa and the association with the leopard complex  ap. 368-375.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo determine the prevalence of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in Appaloosa horses in western Canada, investigate the association with the leopard complex of white spotting patterns, and further characterize the clinical and electroretinographic aspects of CSNB in the Appaloosa. Three groups of 10 Appaloosas were studied based on coat patterns suggestive of LpLp, Lplp, and lplp genotype. Neurophthalmic examination, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, measurement of corneal diameter, streak retinoscopy, scotopic and photopic full-field and flicker ERGs and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were completed bilaterally. All horses in the LpLp group were affected by CSNB, while none in the Lplp or lplp groups was affected. The LpLp and Lplp groups had significantly smaller vertical and horizontal corneal diameters than the lplp group had. Median refractive error was zero for all groups. Scotopic ERGs in the LpLp (CSNB-affected) group were consistent with previous descriptions. The CSNB-affected horses had significantly longer photopic a-wave implicit times, greater a-wave amplitudes, and lower b-wave amplitudes than the Lplp and lplp (normal) groups did. No differences were present in photopic flicker amplitude or implicit times. Scotopic flickers in the CSNB-affected horses were markedly reduced in amplitude and abnormal in appearance. No differences were noted in OP implicit times; however, amplitudes of some OPs were reduced in CSNB-affected horses. There were no differences in scotopic and photopic or flicker ERGs or OPs between the normal groups. CSNB was present in one-third of horses studied and there was a significant association between CSNB and the inheritance of two Lp alleles. ERG abnormalities support the hypothesis that CSNB is caused by a defect in neural transmission through the rod pathway involving the inner nuclear layer. 3aepidemiological studies 3aAppaloosa 3anight blindness 3apigmentation 3adisease prevalence 3acongenital abnormalities 3agenetic disorders 3aallelism 3agenotype 3aretina 3aclinical examination 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3aanimal genetics 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aDiagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmologicalxveterinary 2aElectroretinographyxveterinary 2aFemale 2aGenetic Diseases, Inbornxepidemiologyxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aHair Colorxgenetics 2aHorse Diseasesxcongenitalxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aHorses 2aMale 2aNight Blindnessxcongenitalxepidemiologyxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aPrevalence 3aSaskatchewan 0aCanadaxepidemiology. 0askin 0acongenital stationary night blindness 0aleopard complex 0ainheritance (genetics)1 aBreaux, Carrie B.1 aArcher, Sheila1 aGrahn, Bruce H.0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2007 Nov., v. 10, no. 6 p.368-375dBlackwell Publishing Incx1463-52167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2007.00572.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/12/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03003naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002100189245007800210300001600288500002400304520132400328650001401652650001101666650001401677650001501691650002801706650002101734650002001755650001101775650002101786650002201807650003101829650007401860650001201934650002301946650006501969650002402034650002002058653001002078653001602088653001402104700002202118700001902140773012002159852000902279856009202288930003302380945002502413946001102438655001202449IND4397208520221117211355.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439720852DNAL7 a176969712pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2007.00348.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8001 aBidwell, Lori A.10aLack of systemic absorption of lidocaine from 5% patches placed on horses  ap. 443-446.  aIncludes references  aTo measure concentrations of lidocaine serum after application of two 5% patches on horses. Prospective experimental trial Six client-owned, systemically healthy horses. The hair was clipped on the medial aspect above the carpus of both fore limbs and 2 patches of 5% lidocaine were applied within 30 minutes of jugular catheter placement and the area was then bandaged. Venous blood was drawn from a jugular vein catheter that was inserted using lidocaine as a local block. Samples were drawn immediately before and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after patch application. The presence of lidocaine in serum was determined using an ELISA test. Lidocaine was detected in the serum of three horses at 0 hours immediately following the local block for catheter placement. Lidocaine was not detected at any other time from 2 to 12 hours. There was mild erythema at the site of patch placement at 12 hours in one horse but this resolved within 1 hour of patch removal. There were no other apparent adverse effects from the patches on any other horse. Five percent lidocaine patches applied proximally to the carpus did not result in detectable systemic concentrations of lidocaine. Any analgesic effects that might be produced by application of 5% lidocaine patches on horses will not be due to systemic absorption of the drug. 3aanalgesia 3ahorses 3alidocaine 3aabsorption 3atransdermal application 3aveterinary drugs 3adrug evaluation 3acarpus 3aanalgesic effect 3ahematologic tests 2aAdministration, Cutaneous. 2aAnesthetics, Localxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aAnimals 2aHorsesxmetabolism 2aLidocainexadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aProspective Studies 2aSkin Absorption 0apatch 0atransdermal 0aenoximone1 aWilson, Debbie V.1 aCaron, John P.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2007 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.443-446dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2007.00348.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle04231naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001900189245009800208300001600306500002400322500001500346520185800361650001002219650002102229650001502250650002002265650001902285650001802304650002602322650001502348650001902363650001902382650007002401650006902471650002702540650005302567650001202620650003302632650003302665650002602698650003302724650005502757650001102812650002302823650003102846650003902877650004002916650000902956650005902965650001803024650002403042650004303066653001503109653002103124653002703145700002203172700002503194773012003219852000903339856009203348930003303440945002503473946001103498655001203509IND4397206420221117211332.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439720642DNAL7 a176969762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2006.00304.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8001 aCraig, Cary A.14aThe cardiopulmonary effects of dobutamine and norepinephrine in isoflurane-anesthetized foals  ap. 377-387.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo evaluate the cardiovascular effects of norepinephrine (NE) and dobutamine (DB) in isoflurane-anesthetized foals. Prospective laboratory study. Norepinephrine (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.40 μg kg⁻¹ minute⁻¹) and dobutamine (2.5, 5.0, and 10 μg kg⁻¹ minute⁻¹) were alternately administered to seven healthy, 1- to 2-week-old isoflurane-anesthetized foals. Arterial and pulmonary arterial blood pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, heart rate, body temperature, cardiac output, arterial and mixed venous blood pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of oxygen [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) and mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen ( [graphic removed] )], and packed cell volume were measured. Standard base excess, bicarbonate concentration, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac index (CI), stroke volume, left and right stroke work indices, oxygen delivery (&Ddot;O₂), consumption, and extraction were calculated. Norepinephrine infusion resulted in significant increases in arterial and pulmonary arterial pressure, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indices, and PaO₂; heart rate was decreased. Dobutamine infusion resulted in significant increases in heart rate, stroke volume index, CI, and arterial and pulmonary arterial blood pressure. Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indices were decreased while the ventricular stroke work indices increased. The PaO₂ decreased while &Ddot;O₂ and oxygen consumption increased. Oxygen extraction decreased and [graphic removed] increased. Norepinephrine primarily augments arterial blood pressure while decreasing CI. Dobutamine primarily augments CI with only modest increases in arterial blood pressure. Both NE and DB could be useful in the hemodynamic management of anesthetized foals. 3afoals 3aveterinary drugs 3aanesthesia 3adrug evaluation 3acardiac output 3aacute effects 3acardiovascular system 3aisoflurane 3ablood pressure 3anorepinephrine 2aAdrenergic alpha-Agonistsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAdrenergic beta-Agonistsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnesthesiaxveterinary 2aAnesthetics, Inhalationxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxphysiology 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aCarbon Dioxidexblood 2aCardiac Outputxdrug effects 2aDobutaminexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInfusions, Intravenousxveterinary 2aIsofluranexadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aNorepinephrinexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aOxygenxblood 2aProspective Studies 2aPulmonary Wedge Pressurexdrug effects 0adobutamine 0asympathomimetics 0amean arterial pressure1 aHaskins, Steve C.1 aHildebrand, Susan V.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2007 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.377-387dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2006.00304.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02984naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245012400167300001600291500002400307520181800331650001202149650002402161650002202185650001902207650002402226650001102250650001902261650001702280650003302297650001602330700001902346700001702365700001402382700001902396773011902415852000902534856005502543655001202598IND4458914420221117211500.0110610e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445891442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2009.00430.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Jian.10aEffect of ultra high hydrostatic pressure on concentrations of limonene, α-terpineol and carvone in navel orange juice  ap. 728-745.  aIncludes references  aResponse surface methodology (RSM) was used to compare the effects of the selected variables on the changes of concentrations of limonene,α-terpineol and carvone by ultra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) treatment. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used with control variables of pressure (100-500 MPa), temperature (20-40C) and treatment time (10-20 min). Pressure, temperature and treatment time were found to be critical factors influencing changes of concentrations. Both pressure and temperature could cause limonene degradation, resulting in significant increase ofα-terpineol and carvone concentrations. Limonene degradation was increased with increasing processing pressure or temperature. An interaction effect of pressure and temperature on limonene degradation was also found. This study showed that Box-Behnken design and RSM could be used to model the changes in concentrations of limonene,α-terpineol and carvone in orange juice by UHP treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: As we know, ultra-high hydrostatic pressure (UHP) processing has been an attractive way to replace conventional heat treatments for the preservation of foods. In our study, models of changes in the key aroma compounds in orange juice under UHP process were established. The changes of these aroma compounds in orange juice under UHP process could be understood further by these models. An improved understanding of the effect of UHP on critical aroma quality compounds of orange juices was helpful for us to facilitate industrial adoption of this technology. An effective research way to study the effect on aroma compounds by UHP process was also offered. Base on the data, there was a reference for us to establish an establishment of UHP processing criteria for commercial production of high-aroma-quality orange juice. 3acarvone 3aexperimental design 3afood preservation 3aheat treatment 3ainnovation adoption 3amodels 3aodor compounds 3aorange juice 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature1 aWANG, HAIXIANG1 aXIE, HUIMING1 aYang, Yi.1 aZeng, Qingmei.0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2011 June, v. 34, no. 3 p.728-745dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2009.00430.x 7aarticle02165naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245010800164300001800272500002400290520113800314650001501452650001201467650002301479650001501502650002201517650001801539650001301557650000901570651001501579700001401594700001401608700001301622773010801635852000901743856005101752655001201803IND4443110520221117211519.0101001e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444311052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2010.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, S.D.13aAn optimal and near-optimal strategy to selecting individuals for transfer in captive breeding programs  ap. 2858-2863.  aIncludes references  aAs species extinction rates continue to rise, zoos have adopted a more active role in the conservation of endangered species. A central concern is to preserve genetic diversity of zoological populations. Accordingly, when selecting individuals to transfer to new or existing populations, zoo managers must consider the genetic effects on all populations involved. We propose a quadratic integer programming (IP) model to identify a group of individuals to transfer that maximizes genetic diversity within two subpopulations. We then reduce this model to a linear IP formulation and apply it to the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) studbook. After simplifying the linear IP model, optimality is achieved within a reasonable time limit when a limited number of individuals are relocated. We also develop a local improvement algorithm (LIA) to efficiently provide near-optimal solutions when we increase the number of transferred individuals. The LIA quickly obtains optimal solutions when few individuals are transferred and in most cases, the LIA outperforms MetaMK, an existing program used to select animals for transfer. 3aalgorithms 3aanimals 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3agenetic variation 3alinear models 3amanagers 3azoos 3aCalifornia1 aFathi, Y.1 aGross, K.1 aMace, M.0 tBiological conservation.g2010 Nov., v. 143, no. 11 p.2858-2863dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2010.08.003 7aarticle01127naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245002600130300001400156520040000170650002400570650001800594650002500612650002000637653002200657773008200679852001300761939003300774945000800807946001300815852000900828655001200837991621479640742620221117212250.0920221e199101  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920003022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNutt, K.10aSWOT before you start  ap. 48-51.  aTaking time to assess the Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) before embarking on any business or professional venture can enhance the quality of health promotion, as well as business, decisions.

Offals were microbiologically and organoleptically assessed at intervals of 3 weeks until they were grossly spoiled. After 6 weeks storage, vacuum-packaged livers had a low pH and were spoiled by autolytic and microbial activities. Carbon-dioxide packaging delayed the fall in tissue pH and the development of microbial spoilage, but did not obviously retard the autolytic deterioration of livers. After 6 weeks storage, vacuum-packaged kidneys were spoiled by lines of white granules (presumably tyrosine crystals) on organ surfaces and, after 12 weeks storage, by offensive odours and flavours of microbial origin. Carbon-dioxide packaging delayed the appearance of blemishes for a further 9 weeks and microbial spoilage of kidneys for a further 3 weeks. After 12 weeks storage, vacuum-packaged sweetbreads were spoiled by green discolouration and spoilage odours and flavours as results of microbial activities. Carbon-dioxide packaging prevented the development of green discolouration and extended the time before spoilage odours and flavours were evident to 18 weeks. However, after storage for 9 weeks the appearance of sweetbreads packaged under CO2 deteriorated because of staining of surfaces with blood pigments. 3asweetbreads 3alivers as food 3akidneys as food 3avacuum packaging 3acarbon dioxide 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3atemperature 3afood spoilage 3afood microbiology 3asensory properties 3aduration1 aJeremiah, L.E.0 tFood microbiology.g1991 Dec., v. 8, no. 4 p.339-353x0740-00207nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02830naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245007500168300001600243500002400259520150200283650001201785650001301797650002401810650001101834650001801845650001101863650000901874650001401883650001401897650001101911650001301922650001301935650001301948650001401961651001501975653002701990653002402017653001702041653002302058700001902081700002202100700002002122700002402142773011302166852000902279856004802288655001202336IND4444675620221117211618.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444467562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10641-010-9698-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishimoto, Mary M.10aOtolith elemental signatures reflect residency in coastal water masses  ap. 341-356.  aIncludes references  aWe examined variability in otolith chemistry of wild caught fish in relation to in situ temperature and salinity within the California Current System. Barium, magnesium, and iron from the most recent growth zone in otoliths differentiated pelagic juvenile shortbelly rockfish (Sebastes jordani) residing in water masses with distinct temperature and salinity properties from central and southern California spanning nearly 500 km of coastline. The 3-element signature also discriminated fish that resided in different water masses that were associated with mesoscale cyclonic eddy circulation in the Santa Barbara Channel. Variability in otolith chemistry reflected the spatial patterns of both horizontal gradients and vertical gradients in water mass properties related to circulation. Although we found that the concentrations of particular elements in otoliths were correlated to ambient temperature or salinity, we suggest that these parameters are more useful as an identifying signature of distinct water masses associated with unique otolith signatures rather than as factors directly affecting otolith chemistry. Other factors varying among the water masses or among the fish populations residing in the water masses may also affect otolith chemistry. We discuss how oceanographic phenomena associated with the 1997-1998 El Niño and the persistent, recirculating eddy in the Channel may have affected coastal ocean conditions and variation in otolith chemistry of fish in the study area. 3aEl Nino 3aSebastes 3aambient temperature 3abarium 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3airon 3ajuveniles 3amagnesium 3aoceans 3aotoliths 3arockfish 3asalinity 3awild fish 3aCalifornia 0aOtolith microchemistry 0aCoastal circulation 0aWater masses 0aEarly life history1 aWashburn, Libe1 aWarner, Robert R.1 aLove, Milton S.1 aParadis, Georges L.0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2010 Nov., v. 89, no. 3-4 p.341-356dSpringer Netherlandsx0378-19097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-010-9698-6 7aarticle02803naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245011500195300001800310500002400328520132100352650001801673650001801691650001901709650003701728650001601765650001701781650000701798650002201805650003201827650002401859650002301883650003101906650003101937650003601968650004202004650004502046700002202091700002602113700002802139773011402167852000902281856005502290655001202345IND4411124520221117212125.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441112452DNAL7 a187212672pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01872.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGONUGUNTA, VIJAY K.10aNitric oxide production occurs after cytosolic alkalinization during stomatal closure induced by abscisic acid  ap. 1717-1724.  aIncludes references  aAbscisic acid (ABA) raised the cytosolic pH and nitric oxide (NO) levels in guard cells while inducing stomatal closure in epidermis of Pisum sativum. Butyrate (a weak acid) reduced the cytosolic pH/NO production and prevented stomatal closure by ABA. Methylamine (a weak base) enhanced the cytosolic alkalinization and aggravated stomatal closure by ABA. The rise in guard cell pH because of ABA became noticeable after 6 min and peaked at 12 min, while NO production started at 9 min and peaked at 18 min. These results suggested that NO production was downstream of the rise in cytosolic pH. The ABA-induced increase in NO of guard cells and stomatal closure was prevented by 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (cPTIO, a NO scavenger) and partially by N-nitro-L-Arg-methyl ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase). In contrast, cPTIO or L-NAME had only a marginal effect on the pH rise induced by ABA. Ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA, a calcium chelator) prevented ABA-induced stomatal closure while restricting cytosolic pH rise and NO production. We suggest that during ABA-induced stomatal closure, a rise in cytosolic pH is necessary for NO production. Calcium may act upstream of cytosolic alkalinization and NO production, besides its known function as a downstream component. 3aPisum sativum 3aabscisic acid 3aalkalinization 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3aguard cells 3anitric oxide 3apH 3astomatal movement 2aAbscisic Acidxpharmacology 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCytosolxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesis 2aPeasxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Stomataxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aSRIVASTAVA, NUPUR1 aPULI, MALLIKARJUNA R.1 aRAGHAVENDRA, AGEPATI S.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2008 Nov., v. 31, no. 11 p.1717-1724dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01872.x 7aarticle03831naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002200192245014200214300001800356500002400374506007600398520175900474506003702233650002602270650002102296650002302317650001302340650001302353650001402366650001202380650001302392650000902405650000902414650002002423650002202443650001302465650001202478650004002490650001502530650001702545650003502562650004202597650003702639650001202676650005202688650003302740650003402773650002402807650006202831650001502893650002602908700002302934700001502957773013302972852000903105856009103114655001203205IND4379489220221207103107.0060408e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437948922DNAL7 a165979992pmid7 aPMC14490392pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.4.2925-2935.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuebush, Shane S.10aReduction of Soluble and Insoluble Iron Forms by Membrane Fractions of Shewanella oneidensis Grown under Aerobic and Anaerobic Conditions  ap. 2925-2935.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of iron substrates and growth conditions on in vitro dissimilatory iron reduction by membrane fractions of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was characterized. Membrane fractions were separated by sucrose density gradients from cultures grown with O₂, fumarate, and aqueous ferric citrate as the terminal electron acceptor. Marker enzyme assays and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrated the high degree of separation between the outer and cytosolic membrane. Protein expression pattern was similar between chelated iron- and fumarate-grown cultures, but dissimilar for oxygen-grown cultures. Formate-dependent ferric reductase activity was assayed with citrate-Fe³⁺, ferrozine-Fe³⁺, and insoluble goethite as electron acceptors. No activity was detected in aerobic cultures. For fumarate and chelated iron-grown cells, the specific activity for the reduction of soluble iron was highest in the cytosolic membrane. The reduction of ferrozine-Fe³⁺ was greater than the reduction of citrate-Fe³⁺. With goethite, the specific activity was highest in the total membrane fraction (containing both cytosolic and outer membrane), indicating participation of the outer membrane components in electron flow. Heme protein content and specific activity for iron reduction was highest with chelated iron-grown cultures with no heme proteins in aerobically grown membrane fractions. Western blots showed that CymA, a heme protein involved in iron reduction, expression was also higher in iron-grown cultures compared to fumarate- or aerobic-grown cultures. To study these processes, it is important to use cultures grown with chelated Fe³⁺ as the electron acceptor and to assay ferric reductase activity using goethite as the substrate.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aShewanella oneidensis 3aWestern blotting 3aaerobic conditions 3achelates 3acitrates 3aelectrons 3aenzymes 3agoethite 3aheme 3airon 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asucrose 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCentrifugation, Density Gradient 2aCytosol 2aIntracellular Membranesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aIronxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aShewanellaxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSolubility 2aSubstrate Specificity1 aBrantley, Susan L.1 aTien, Ming0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.2925-2935dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.4.2925-2935.20063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03742naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001700161245014400178300001800322500002400340520153500364650002501899650002501924650002201949650002101971650002001992650001002012650001102022650002002033650002602053650001102079650001302090650001502103650003902118650002202157650002602179650001002205650000902215650002202224650002102246650003202267650004702299650001102346650005102357650004402408650001602452650002102468650004502489650001402534650003702548650003102585650005302616650001402669700001702683700001402700700001702714700001602731700002002747700001602767700001802783700002402801700002702825773011402852852000902966856004502975655001203020IND4412624920221117212155.0081114e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441262492DNAL7 a184354902pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2007003312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tianhong10aExpression of selenium-binding protein 1 characterizes intestinal cell maturation and predicts survival for patients with colorectal cancer  ap. 1289-1299.  aIncludes references  aTo identify candidate genes involved in the development of colorectal cancer, we used cDNA microarrays to analyze gene expression differences between human colorectal tumors and paired adjacent normal mucosa. We identified [thick similar]3.5-fold significant downregulation of selenium-binding protein 1 (SBP1) in colorectal tumors compared to normal mucosa (p = 0.003). Importantly, stage III colorectal cancer patients with low tumor-SBP1 expression had significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival as compared with those patients with high tumor-SBP1 expression (p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). We further characterized the role of SBP1 in colorectal cancer in vivo and in vitro. In normal tissue, SBP1 was maximally expressed in terminally differentiated epithelial cells on the luminal surface of crypts in the large intestine. Consistent with this in vivo localization, SBP1 was upregulated during in vitro colonic cell differentiation along the absorptive (Caco-2) and secretory (HT29 Clones 16E and 19A) cell lineages. Downregulation (approximately 50%) of SBP1 expression by small interfering RNA in colonic cancer cells was associated with reduced expression of another epithelial differentiation marker, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), although PCNA and p21WAF¹/cip¹ expression were not altered. These data demonstrate that higher expression of SBP1 is associated with differentiation of the normal colonic epithelia and may be a positive prognostic factor for survival in stage III colorectal carcinoma. 3acell differentiation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acomplementary DNA 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3alarge intestine 3amicroarray technology 3amucosa 3apatients 3aprediction 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aprotein synthesis 3asmall interfering RNA 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aColonic Neoplasmsxgenetics 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxgeneticsxpathology. 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Mucosaxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aIntestinesxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasm Staging 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPrognosis 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aRectal Neoplasmsxgenetics 2aSelenium-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSurvivors1 aYang, Wancai1 aLi, Maomi1 aByun, Do-Sun1 aTong, Chang1 aNasser, Shannon1 aZhuang, Min1 aArango, Diego1 aMariadason, John M.1 aAugenlicht, Leonard H.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2008 Nov., v. 52, no. 11 p.1289-1299dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700331 7aarticle02000naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245004500164300001600209520116800225650001401393653002101407653002201428653001801450773011601468852000901584856008501593930003301678946001101711655001201722IND4438535920221117210958.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443853592DNAL7 a10.1007/s12187-009-9056-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrønes, Ivar 10aStatus Zero Youth in the Welfare Society  ap. 313-326.  aThe term “Status Zer0” is often associated with teenage dropouts, young people with low educational achievement and poor living conditions, who are separated from the world of jobs and opportunities and consigned to a future of social exclusion. The article focuses on young men who have been marginalised in the transition from school to work, that is, those who have not completed upper secondary education and are outside the labour market at age 25. Divergent welfare regimes shape different lives for those on the margins, data from Norway indicate that young men who leave school for work in their mid-teens tend to be employed when they reach their mid-twenties, while a significant percentage of young men who are not involved in either school or work in their teens are disconnected from both when they reach their mid-twenties. Immigrant youth on non-western background is overrepresented in the Zer0 category. The Status Zer0 group, although relatively small, is also characterized by involvement with crime and drugs, which is understood as part of the process contributing to the Status Zer0 position as well as a consequence of social exclusion. 3aeducation 0aSocial exclusion 0aSocial indicators 0aSocialization0 tChild indicators research.g2010 July, v. 3, no. 3 p.313-326dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1874-89887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12187-009-9056-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02457naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245006200166300001600228520129700244650000801541650002301549650001501572650002001587650001901607650001501626650001201641650003001653650002101683650002001704700002201724700002201746700002001768700002101788773011001809852000901919856008501928930003302013946001302046655001202059IND4438526520221117211029.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443852652DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-010-9278-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontiller, Jens 10aIdentification of CHO Endogenous Gene Regulatory Elements  ap. 235-240.  aThe objective of this approach was to identify new CHO endogenous gene regulatory elements that are capable of regulating foreign gene expression in recombinant CHO host cells. The standard technology for the production of many biopharmaceutical products is frequently based on expression vectors that utilize strong mammalian viral promoters like SV40 or CMV which allow for very high expression rates but this may lead to constitutive over-expression resulting in a permanent stress for the cell. In addition, some heterologous promoters are cell-cycle dependent and can be subject to gene silencing generating heterogeneity within the cell population. Here, we describe the construction of a genomic CHO library and the subsequent identification and isolation of selected target sequences that are believed to be responsible for high level expression of the associated genes. The method that was used to isolate these regions of interest relies on gene specific amplification with primer pairs binding on different genes and the vector sequence. Flanking regions of these fragments were identified through Inverse PCR from fragmented and self-ligated genomic DNA. Expression levels of both the initially derived and the mapped fragments were determined through a luciferase reporter assay. 3aDNA 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acell cycle 3agene expression 3agene silencing 3aluciferase 3amammals 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3aregulator genes1 aMaccani, Andreas 1 aBaumann, Martina 1 aKlancnik, Ingo 1 aErnst, Wolfgang 0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2010 July, v. 45, no. 3 p.235-240dNew York : Humana Press Incx1073-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-010-9278-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03613naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245008900162300001600251500001500267520195200282650001702234650002302251650002002274650002602294650001602320650001602336650002102352650003802373650002002411650001802431650001402449650001502463650001102478650003402489650001502523650001902538650002502557650001402582650001802596650001202614650000702626650001402633650002302647653003602670700001902706700002102725700002102746700001802767773011002785852000902895856008502904930003302989946001303022655001203035IND4438526720221117211157.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443852672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-010-9272-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Weiduan 10aLectin Binding Assays for In-Process Monitoring of Sialylation in Protein Production  ap. 248-256.  a2019-12-04  aMany therapeutic proteins require appropriate glycosylation for their biological activities and plasma half life. Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) is a glycoprotein which has extensive post-translational modification by N-linked glycosylation. The terminal sialic acid in the N-linked glycans of FVIII is required for maximal circulatory half life. The extent of FVIII sialylation can be determined by high pH anion-exchange chromatography coupled with a pulse electrochemical detector (HPAEC-PED), but this requires a large amount of purified protein. Using FVIII as a model, the objective of the present study was to develop assays that enable detection and prediction of sialylation deficiency at an early stage in the process and thus prevent downstream product quality excursions. Lectin ECA (Erythrina Cristagalli) binds to unsialylated Galβ1-4 GlcNAc and the ECA-binding level (i.e., terminal Gal(β1-4) exposure) is inversely proportional to the level of sialylation. By using ECA, a cell-based assay was developed to measure the global sialylation profile in FVIII producing cells. To examine the Galβ1-4 exposure on the FVIII molecule in bioreactor tissue culture fluid (TCF), an ELISA-based ECA-FVIII binding assay was developed. The ECA-binding specificity in both assays was assessed by ECA-specific sugar inhibitors and neuraminidase digestion. The ECA-binding specificity was also independently confirmed by a ST3GAL4 siRNA knockdown experiment. To establish the correlation between Galβ1-4 exposure and the HPAEC-PED determined FVIII sialylation value, the FVIII containing bioreactor TCF and the purified FVIII samples were tested with ECA ELISA binding assay. The results indicated an inverse correlation between ECA binding and the corresponding HPAEC-PED sialylation value. The ECA-binding assays are cost effective and can be rapidly performed, thereby making them effective for in-process monitoring of protein sialylation. 3asialic acids 3abiopharmaceuticals 3apolysaccharides 3asmall interfering RNA 3afactor VIII 3abioreactors 3aelectrochemistry 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aproduct quality 3aglycoproteins 3ahalf life 3amonitoring 3amodels 3aanion exchange chromatography 3aprediction 3atissue culture 3abioactive properties 3aErythrina 3aglycosylation 3alectins 3apH 3asialidase 3acost effectiveness 0apost-translational modification1 aChen, Jianmin 1 aYamasaki, Glenn 1 aMurphy, John E. 1 aMei, Baisong 0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2010 July, v. 45, no. 3 p.248-256dNew York : Humana Press Incx1073-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-010-9272-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02293naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245014700181300001800328520092300346650002201269650001801291650002501309650002401334650002601358650002501384650001101409650001001420650001001430650001701440650001601457650002301473650002301496650001501519700002801534700003101562700002401593700002001617773017401637856005101811852000901862655001201871IND60619993920221117211215.0181105e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061999392DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-5332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabibi Najafi, Mohammad B.10aIn Vitro Evaluation of Antimold Activity of Annatto Natural Dye and Its Effects on Microbial, Physicochemical, and Sensory Properties of Bread  ap. 1598-1604.  aIn vitro antimold activity of annatto natural dye against Aspergillus niger, Neurospora sitophila, and Rhizopus stolonifer was evaluated with agar well diffusion and agar dilution assays.

Fresh vegetables are often contaminated with enterotoxigenic B. cereus and have been implicated as a vehicle for the transmission of this bacterium. This study reports on the occurrence, virulence gene profile, and antibiotic resistance of B. cereus in fresh vegetables. Of 102 examined samples, 48 (47%) of the samples were contaminated with B. cereus (>1 log CFU/g) and 7 (6.8%) of the samples showed more than 3 log CFU/g. In total, 118 B. cereus isolates were examined for the virulence genes nheA, nheB, nheC, hblA, hblC, hblD, cytK, and entFM and for resistance to antibiotics. Of these B. cereus isolates, 70% harbored nheA, nheB, nheC, and cytK. Eighteen (80%) of 21 isolates from bell peppers possessed eight enterotoxin genes. B. cereus isolates were susceptible to imipenem, vancomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol, whereas 22.4% of isolates from garlic chives, 48.7% from perilla leaf, and 40.5% from romaine lettuce showed antibiotic resistance to rifampin and 6% of isolates from garlic chives exhibited resistance to tetracycline. Three isolates from garlic chives were resistant to both tetracycline and rifampin. Raw vegetables were revealed to be major sources of B. cereus containing multiple toxin genes and exhibiting antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the potential health risks of consuming these vegetables raw or undercooked should not be underestimated. This study provides basic information for monitoring the antibiotic resistance and toxigenicity of B. cereus in the food chain during vegetable distribution and for developing food safety management to reduce the contamination with and transmission of B. cereus. 3aBacillus cereus 3aPerilla 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3achives 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3aenterotoxins 3aerythromycin 3afood chain 3afood safety 3agarlic 3agenes 3agentamicin 3aimipenem 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apoisoning 3araw vegetables 3arifampicin 3arisk 3aromaine lettuce 3asweet peppers 3avancomycin 3avirulence 3aKorean Peninsula1 aJeong, Mooncheol1 aPark, Kee Jai1 aKoo, Minseon0 tJournal of food protection.g2018 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1590-1597dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-205  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010500166300001600271520130600287650002201593650001401615650002101629650001101650650001501661650001601676650001801692651001001710653003001720653002801750653001801778653002001796700003201816700002301848773013101871852000902002856008502011930003302096946001102129655001202140IND4438534720221117210431.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443853472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-010-0368-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdame, Patricia 10aIngrowth model for pyrenean oak stands in north-western Spain using continuous forest inventory data  ap. 669-678.  aIn this paper, a two stage ingrowth model is presented for predicting periodic, 10 years ingrowth for pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) grown in medium to fully stocked coppice stands in north-western Spain. Data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory was used to develop the model, extracting the information from two inventories taken in 222 permanent plots. The first stage of the model predicts the probability of ingrowth occurrence, and in the second stage, the number of recruits is predicted using a conditional model. Both models were biologically realistic and presented logical behaviour. The ingrowth occurrence probability model was dependent on quadratic mean diameter and average height. The recruitment quantification model included stand density and average diameter as explanatory variables. Although the occurrence probability of ingrowth was predicted correctly in 71.7% of cases, the predictions of the number of recruitment are poorer, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.358. The evaluation criteria included qualitative and quantitative examinations and a testing with independent data from another region. The proposed ingrowth model is the first to be developed for mediterranean oak species in Spain and is an essential feature in any stand growth system. 3aQuercus pyrenaica 3acoppicing 3aforest inventory 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability 3astand density 3aSpain 0aNational Forest Inventory 0aQuercus pyrenaica Willd 0aCoppice stand 0aTwo-stage model1 aRío Gaztelurrutia, M. del.1 aCañellas, Isabel 0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2010 July, v. 129, no. 4 p.669-678dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-010-0368-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01625naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245012600151300001600277520063600293650001700929650001100946650002200957700001300979700001700992700001901009700001501028700001601043773011101059852000901170856007601179930003301255946001101288655001201299IND4438543420221117210649.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443854342DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.17482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Juan10aSelective cleavage of protonated penetratin and its substitutes under low-energy collision-induced dissociation condition  ap. 627-634.  aAn understanding of the dissociation of penetratin is important for improving its metabolic stability and cargo-delivery efficiency. In this study, we describe the selective cleavage of the K15-K16 amide bond of penetratin under the low-energy collision-induced dissociation condition in mass spectrometry. A variety of penetratin substitutes have been studied in which key basic amino acids have been substituted within the sequence. The calculated structure indicates that an α-helix structure prevents the fragmentation of the central peptide domain and the side chain of lysine is involved in the proton translocation process. 3adissociation 3alysine 3amass spectrometry1 aZu, Lily1 aFang, Weihai1 aHuang, Lingyun1 aWang, Yaru1 aHe, Dacheng0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2010 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.627-634dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.17483Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03067naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001300136245015400149300001600303520186500319650001202184650001002196650001202206650001702218650004602235650001502281650000902296650001202305650001302317650002902330700001502359700001602374700001902390700002002409773011102429852000902540856007602549930003302625946001102658655001202669IND4438543720221117210707.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443854372DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.17562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaju, G.10aDifferentiation of Boc-protected α,δ-/δ,α- and β,δ-/δ,β-hybrid peptide positional isomers by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 651-663.  aTwo new series of Boc-N-α,δ-/δ,α- and β,δ-/δ,β-hybrid peptides containing repeats of L-Ala-δ⁵-Caa/δ⁵-Caa-L-Ala and β³-Caa-δ⁵-Caa/δ⁵-Caa-β³-Caa (L-Ala = L-alanine, Caa = C-linked carbo amino acid derived from D-xylose) have been differentiated by both positive and negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MSn spectra of protonated isomeric peptides produce characteristic fragmentation involving the peptide backbone, the Boc-group, and the side chain. The dipeptide positional isomers are differentiated by the collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the protonated peptides. The loss of 2-methylprop-1-ene is more pronounced for Boc-NH-L-Ala-δ-Caa-OCH₃ (1), whereas it is totally absent for its positional isomer Boc-NH-δ-Caa-L-Ala-OCH₃ (7), instead it shows significant loss of t-butanol. On the other hand, second isomeric pair shows significant loss of t-butanol and loss of acetone for Boc-NH-δ-Caa-β-Caa-OCH₃ (18), whereas these are insignificant for its positional isomer Boc-NH-β-Caa-δ-Caa-OCH₃ (13). The tetra- and hexapeptide positional isomers also show significant differences in MS² and MS³ CID spectra. It is observed that 'b' ions are abundant when oxazolone structures are formed through five-membered cyclic transition state and cyclization process for larger 'b' ions led to its insignificant abundance. However, b₁ ⁺ ion is formed in case of δ,α-dipeptide that may have a six-membered substituted piperidone ion structure. Furthermore, ESI negative ion MS/MS has also been found to be useful for differentiating these isomeric peptide acids. Thus, the results of MS/MS of pairs of di-, tetra-, and hexapeptide positional isomers provide peptide sequencing information and distinguish the positional isomers.

Despite the importance of olive resistance to environmental stresses, studies in this field are still limited relative to the progress achieved in other cultivated species.

We have investigated olive irrigation regimes, including severe deficit strategies, on two Israeli cultivars (‘Souri’ and ‘Barnea’) in a two year field experiment. Trees received 25, 50, 75, 100 or 125% of potential evapotranspiration throughout the dry seasons. Increasing irrigation increased stem water potential, vegetative growth, and olive fruit yield with the increases tapering off at application rates above the 75-100% treatments. Increases in oil yield as a function of increased irrigation were measured only after the second year of treatments, and only for the cultivar ‘Barnea’ that had been in an ‘off’ year during the first season in which the treatments lead to higher vegetative growth. Increasing irrigation lead to fruits with greater water content (lower oil percentage) as well as to relative decreases in total polyphenol content and to increased free fatty acids in the ‘off’ years. These preliminary results suggest a number of methods that could be beneficial to irrigation management including cultivar specific irrigation regimes and irrigation systems. Stress levels and water requirements are highly dependent on fruit load and best irrigation management should account for biennial bearing effects. Of specific interest is that oil quality of trees in ‘off’ years is particularly negatively affected by excess water. More work is necessary in order to determine optimum water stress scheduling (stress levels and timing) for best yield-quality combinations and to further develop methods for monitoring and maintaining water stress levels. 3aBarnea 3acultivars 3aevapotranspiration 3afield experimentation 3afree fatty acids 3afruit yield 3afruits 3airrigation rates 3airrigation systems 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aorchards 3atrees 3avegetative growth 3awater content 3awater potential 3awater requirement 3awater stress1 aYermiyahu, U.1 aZipori, I.1 aPresnov, E.1 aAgam, N.1 aDag, A.1 aKerem, Z.1 aBasheer, L.1 aHanoch, E.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Feb., , no. 888 p.47-52dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/888/888_4.htm 7aarticle01727naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013900126300001400265500013200279500002400411520051400435650001400949650002300963650002600986650001101012650001301023650000901036650002701045651001001072700001301082700001801095700001501113700001401128700001601142773013801158852000901296856004801305655001201353IND4456606220221117210741.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445660622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidalgo, J.10aResponses to Different Irrigation Strategies of a Traditional and an Intensive Olive Orchard Cultivar ‘Picual’ in Andalusia, Spain  ap. 53-61.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Olive Irrigation and Oil Quality, held December 6-10, 2009, Nazareth, Israel.  aIncludes references  aWater availability for irrigation is insufficient to meet the requirements of most Spanish olive-growing areas.

Six different drip irrigation water levels were tested using Class A pan evaporation technique (I0 (kpc:0), I0.25 (kpc:0.25), I0.50 (kpc:0.50), I0.75 (kpc:0.75), I1.00 (kpc:1.00), I1.25 (kpc:1.25). Fruit characteristics such as ripening index, percent oil extraction and quality indices, K232 and K270 values, bitterness index and fatty acid composition were analyzed. Most of the parameters varied significantly with irrigation water level. The ripening index of olives responded linearly to the amount of water. I0.25 olives had the highest oil content (24.4%). The free acidity of the oils varied between 0.21 and 0.60% and responded negatively to irrigation level and the peroxide value of the oils ranged from 1.29 to 1.64 meq O2/kg oil with no effect of irrigation treatment. The I1.25 application had a low maturation index, which corresponded to the lowest chlorophyll value. The bitterness index and polyphenol content of the oils varied from 0.71 to 1.71 and 179.83 to 281.83 mg/kg, respectively, and both responded negatively to increasing water dosage. While there were significant differences with amount of irrigation water in palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic and oleic acids, and MUFAs, PUFAs, MUFA/PUFA, there were no significant differences in linolenic and arachidic acids, or in SFAs or the PUFA/SFA ratio. 3aOlea europaea 3aacidity 3abitterness 3achlorophyll 3aevaporation 3afatty acid composition 3airrigation rates 3airrigation water 3alipid content 3amicroirrigation 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aperoxide value 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aKaya,  U.1 aNergiz, C.1 aCamoglu, G.1 aAkkuzu, E.1 aAsik, S.1 aAvci, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Feb., , no. 888 p.73-80dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/888/888_7.htm 7aarticle01895naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005800126300001400184500013200198500002400330500001500354520079100369650001601160650002201176650001101198650002101209650002601230650002701256653001801283700002101301700001401322700001401336773013801350852000901488856004801497655001201545IND4456605820221117210754.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445660582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFereres, E.10aWater Requirements and Irrigation Scheduling in Olive  ap. 31-39.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Olive Irrigation and Oil Quality, held December 6-10, 2009, Nazareth, Israel.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAccurate determination of crop water needs is a prerequisite for adequate irrigation management. Contrary to the wealth of information regarding water requirements (ET) of the major herbaceous crops, the ET of tree crops such as olives has been less studied. We present here two approaches to determining olive ETc. One follows the traditional crop coefficient approach, while the other uses a model to partition the ET into its two components, E and T. Olive ETc estimates are needed to schedule irrigation using the water budget approach, a robust and simple method that is described here. The uncertainties involving the water budget components of an olive orchard are explored, in particular the one related to the capacity of the tree to extract water from the potential root zone. 3arhizosphere 3awater requirement 3aolives 3acrop coefficient 3airrigation scheduling 3airrigation requirement 0awater balance1 aVillalobos, F.J.1 aOrgaz, F.1 aTesti, L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Feb., , no. 888 p.31-39dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/888/888_2.htm 7aarticle02347naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245008500161300001800246500002400264520128400288650001601572650002001588650001301608650002001621650001601641650003301657650001701690650002501707650001601732650000901748651001801757700002101775773009501796852000901891856008501900655001201985IND4456525920221117210839.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445652592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-010-0773-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Bei-Wei10aNonlinear relation of the Arctic oscillation with the quasi-biennial oscillation  ap. 1491-1504.  aIncludes references  aA nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) is applied to a set of monthly mean time series from January 1956 to December 2007 consisting of the Arctic oscillation (AO) index derived from 1,000-hPa geopotential height anomalies poleward of 20°N latitude and the zonal winds observed at seven pressure levels between 10 and 70 hPa in the equatorial stratosphere to investigate the relation of the AO with the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The NLPCA is conducted using a new, compact neural network model. The NLPCA modeling of the dataset of the AO index and QBO winds offers a clear picture of the relation between the two oscillations. In particular, the phase of covariation of the oscillations defined by the two nonlinear principal components of the dataset progresses with a predominant 28.4-month periodicity. This predominant cycle is modulated by an 11-year cycle. The variation of the AO index with the QBO phase also shows that the average AO index is positive when the westerly QBO phase descends past 30 hPa and, conversely, the average AO index is negative when the easterly QBO phase descends past 30 hPa. This relationship is evident during the boreal cold season from November to April but non-existent during the boreal warm season from May to October. 3acold season 3adata collection 3alatitude 3aneural networks 3aperiodicity 3aprincipal component analysis 3astratosphere 3atime series analysis 3awarm season 3awind 3aArctic region1 aPandolfo, Lionel0 tClimate dynamics.g2011 Apr., v. 36, no. 7-8 p.1491-1504dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-010-0773-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03749naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245011900169300001800288500002400306520220700330650001202537650002502549650001702574650001902591650001602610650001202626650001502638650001702653650002102670650001302691650000902704650001002713650001102723650001602734650001102750650002002761651001702781651002102798651001802819700002502837700002702862700001802889700002202907700002402929700002202953700002102975700002202996773009503018852000903113856008503122655001203207IND4456526020221117210856.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445652602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-009-0723-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristie, Duncan A.10aAridity changes in the Temperate-Mediterranean transition of the Andes since ad 1346 reconstructed from tree-rings  ap. 1505-1521.  aIncludes references  aThe Andes Cordillera acts as regional “Water Towers” for several countries and encompasses a wide range of ecosystems and climates. Several hydroclimatic changes have been described for portions of the Andes during recent years, including glacier retreat, negative precipitation trends, an elevation rise in the 0° isotherm, and changes in regional streamflow regimes. The Temperate-Mediterranean transition (TMT) zone of the Andes (35.5°-39.5°S) is particularly at risk to climate change because it is a biodiversity hotspot with heavy human population pressure on water resources. In this paper we utilize a new tree-ring network of Austrocedrus chilensis to reconstruct past variations in regional moisture in the TMT of the Andes by means of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The reconstruction covers the past 657 years and captures interannual to decadal scales of variability in late spring-early summer PDSI. These changes are related to the north-south oscillations in moisture conditions between the Mediterranean and Temperate climates of the Andes as a consequence of the latitudinal position of the storm tracks forced by large-scale circulation modes. Kernel estimation of occurrence rates reveals an unprecedented increment of severe and extreme drought events during the last century in the context of the previous six centuries. Moisture conditions in our study region are linked to tropical and high-latitude ocean-atmospheric forcing, with PDSI positively related to Niño-3.4 SST during spring and strongly negatively correlated with the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) during summer. Geopotential anomaly maps at 500-hPa show that extreme dry years are tightly associated with negative height anomalies in the Ross-Amundsen Seas, in concordance with the strong negative relationship between PDSI and AAO. The twentieth century increase in extreme drought events in the TMT may not be related to ENSO but to the positive AAO trend during late-spring and summer resulting from a gradual poleward shift of the mid-latitude storm tracks. This first PDSI reconstruction for South America demonstrates the highly significant hindcast skill of A. chilensis as an aridity proxy. 3aEl Nino 3aLibocedrus chilensis 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3adrought 3aecosystems 3agrowth rings 3ahuman population 3alatitude 3arisk 3aseeds 3aspring 3astream flow 3asummer 3awater resources 3aAndes region 3aAntarctic region 3aSouth America1 aBoninsegna, José A.1 aCleaveland, Malcolm K.1 aLara, Antonio1 aLe Quesne, Carlos1 aMorales, Mariano S.1 aMudelsee, Manfred1 aStahle, David W.1 aVillalba, Ricardo0 tClimate dynamics.g2011 Apr., v. 36, no. 7-8 p.1505-1521dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-009-0723-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01978naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005800125300001600183500011200199500002400311520094100335650002001276650001401296650001301310650001101323650001201334650001401346700001601360700001401376700001301390700001101403700001601414773014001430852000901570856004901579655001201628IND4456625920221117210711.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, W.X.10aLeaf Anatomical Structure of Natural Triploid Loquats  ap. 247-250.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aLeaf anatomical structure of diploid cultivars of loquat (Eriobotyra japonica Lindl.) and 13 triploid seedlings were studied by paraffin sectioning protocol.

Triploids had thicker leaves (29.6%) and palisade tissue (57.6%), and higher CTR value than diploids. The number of cell layers of palisade tissue of triploids increased over diploids. Except for ‘Zaozhong No.6’ and ‘Luzhou No.6’, CTR of other triploids increased 21.4% than diploids. In addition, spongy tissue of triploids and diploids had differences, but no regularity. The cell structure looseness of mesophyll tissue (spongy ratio) was reduced by 8.7% in triploids but this difference was not significant. 3acell structures 3acultivars 3adiploidy 3aleaves 3aloquats 3atriploidy1 aXiang, S.Q.1 aGuo, Q.G.1 aLi, X.L.1 aHe, Q.1 aLiang, G.L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 887 p.247-250dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/887/887_41.htm 7aarticle02499naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013800163300001600301500002400317520114700341650002201488650001601510650001001526650001201536650001401548650002001562650001801582650001401600650001601614650001101630650002101641650001401662650002101676650001401697650001001711650001301721700003001734700002401764700002801788700002101816773011001837852000901947856008501956655001202041IND4456619920221117210640.0110412s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445661992DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797100009062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuinones, Ana10aMethyl xanthine as a potential alternative to gibberellic acid in enhancing fruit set and quality in clementine citrus trees in spain  ap. 159-171.  aIncludes references  aCitrus clementine cv. ‘Nules’ is a seedless mandarin with excellent quality for consumption as fresh fruit; however, its poor fruit set leads to an excess of small-sized fruits. Currently, the only available practice to increase fruit set is the use of the growth regulator gibberellic acid (GA3) as a foliar spray. A trial was conducted to compare an environmentally friendly new bioregulator (MX), containing methyl-xanthine, to GA3 in terms of increasing fruit set and yield of clementine cv. Nules mandarin trees. Fruit yield was significantly increased in treated trees from 17.4 to 25.7% for GA3 and MX treatments, respectively, compared to untreated control trees, without any significant differences between the growth regulators. At the tested doses, MX performed similarly to GA3 in terms of fruit quality and nutrient content, while colour index was not affected significantly by this new bioregulator. A single foliar application of MX was enough to increase fruit set. Spray application of MX on clementine mandarins at the end of the flowering period, when all petals have fallen showed a similar response to GA3 treatments. 3aCitrus clementina 3aclementines 3acolor 3acorolla 3aflowering 3afoliar spraying 3afruit quality 3afruit set 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agibberellic acid 3amandarins 3anutrient content 3araw fruit 3atrees 3axanthine1 aMartinez-Alcantara, Belen1 aSan-Francisco, Sara1 aGarcia-Mina, Jose Maria1 aLegaz, Francisco0 tExperimental agriculture.g2011 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.159-171dCambridge University Pressx0014-47977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797100009063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02694naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002000161245011700181300001400298500002400312520085600336650003901192650001901231650001801250650000901268650002501277650003601302650003101338650003201369650001201401650006101413650002601474650003601500650003001536650000901566650002401575650002101599650002701620650006201647650005401709650005801763650002701821650004201848650004401890700002101934700001601955700002101971773006901992852000902061856008202070655001202152IND4456621020221117210719.0110412s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662102DNAL7 a206452422pmid7 a10.1055/s-0030-12501192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyu, Kwon-Ryeol10aAnti-scratching behavioral effect of the essential oil and phytol Isolated from Artemisia princeps Pamp. in mice  ap. 22-26.  aIncludes references  aThe anti-scratching behavioral effect of the essential oil and phytol isolated from Artemisia princeps Pamp.

Treatment of mice with AP essential oil (APEO) and phytol inhibited histamine- and compound 48/80-induced scratching behaviors. The anti-scratching behavioral effects of APEO and phytol are in proportion to their vascular permeability-inhibitory effects. These agents also inhibited the level of allergic cytokines, IL-4, and TNF-α, and the activation of transcription factors, NF-κB and c-jun (AP-1), in histamine-treated skin tissues. Based on these results, APEO and phytol may improve scratching behavior in skin by inhibiting the expression of allergic cytokines via the regulation of NF-κB and AP-1 activation. 3aArtemisia indica var. maximowiczii 3aessential oils 3ainterleukin-4 3amice 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptional activation 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAnimals 2aAntipruriticsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAsteraceaexchemistry 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aInterleukin-4xmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPhytolxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPlant Oilsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aPruritusxdrug therapy 2aTranscription Factor AP-1xmetabolism 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism1 aChoi, Jong Youl.1 aChung, Suna1 aKim, Tong-hyŏn.0 tPlanta medica.g2011 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.22-26x0032-09437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-12501193Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02958naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245013000185300001600315520113600331650001101467650000901478650001401487650001601501650001101517650000901528650002301537650001401560650001301574650001401587650001201601650000901613650001201622650001201634650005401646650002901700650002301729650002201752650002401774650004301798650004201841650004101883650002401924650006001948651001002008651001902018651001002037653001202047653002902059773014002088852000902228856008502237930003302322946001302355655001202368IND4438461120221117210632.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443846112DNAL7 a204404712pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-0019-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssumang, D.

The use of chondrichthyan fish has permitted the study of trace levels of Platinum group metals (PGMs) which have travelled very far into the sea. The analysis showed that Ghana's coastline is fairly polluted with these platinum group metals (PGMs). PGM concentration in manta ray recorded a range of (0.15-0.85) μg/g for Pt, (0.033-0.67) μg/g for Pd and (0.007-0.145) μg/g for Rh. Comparing these values to the UK dietary intake of 0.2 μg/day for Pt and Rh and 1.0 μg/day for Pd, its indicates that the values obtained from the analysis for Pt was above the required level. This is the first study to show the accumulation of PGM in chondrichthyan fish, although the sources of this pollution are not clear as manta birostris is migratory and therefore need to be investigated further. The presence of the PGM is very significant, since manta ray meat is consumed in Ghana. This may presents a health risk, due to a possible accumulation of PGMs in humans. 3acoasts 3afish 3afishermen 3afood intake 3ahumans 3ameat 3amigratory behavior 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3apollution 3arhodium 3arisk 3atissues 2aAnimals 2aElasmobranchiixgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aPalladiumxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aPlatinumxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aRhodiumxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aTissue Distribution 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 3aGhana 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGhana 0aDixcove 0aManta birostris and Kako0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.720-725dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-010-0019-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02885naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001300161245008200174300001400256500002400270520134700294650001201641650001001653650001001663650002501673650001801698650001601716650002601732650001101758650002401769650001101793650001301804650001701817650001801834650001401852650002301866650001201889650006601901650002201967650002401989650001102013650005802024650001602082650000902098700001402107700002002121700001502141700001502156773006902171852000902240856008202249655001202331IND4456620820221117210631.0110412s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662082DNAL7 a206452462pmid7 a10.1055/s-0030-12501172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Sen10aAntitussive effect of naringin on experimentally induced cough in guinea pigs  ap. 16-21.  aIncludes references  aThe mechanism of action of naringin has been investigated in different models of experimentally induced cough in guinea pigs. In contrast to codeine phosphate (6 mg/kg, intravenous administration [i. v.]), naringin (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg, i. v.) had no central antitussive effect on cough elicited by electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve. Naringin (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 µmol) could not prevent the cough reflex induced by stimulation of the trachea after intracerebroventricular injection (i. c. v.), while codeine phosphate (0.5 µmol) was highly effective. Further characterizing the peripheral mechanism of naringin, we found that its effect (50 mg/kg, i. v.) was not affected by the depletion of sensory neuropeptides, whereas levodropropizine (10 mg/kg, i. v.) lost its capacity to prevent cough in the apsaicin-desensitized guinea pig. Furthermore, pretreatment with glibenclamide (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i. p.]) significantly reduced the antitussive effect of pinacidil (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous [s. c.]), but could not antagonize the antitussive effect of naringin (30 mg/kg, s. c.). Our present results suggest that naringin is not a central antitussive drug. And naringin does not exert its peripheral antitussive effect through either the sensory neuropeptides system or the modulation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. 3acodeine 3acough 3adrugs 3aelectrical treatment 3aglibenclamide 3aguinea pigs 3aintravenous injection 3alarynx 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3anaringin 3anerve tissue 3aneuropeptides 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 2aAnimals 2aAntitussive Agentsxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCitrusxchemistry 2aCoughxdrug therapy 2aFemale 2aFlavanonesxchemistryxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aGuinea Pigs 2aMale1 aLi, Peibo1 aYang, Hongliang1 aFang, Siqi1 aSu, Weiwei0 tPlanta medica.g2011 Jan., v. 77, no. 1 p.16-21x0032-09437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-12501173Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03500naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245015400172300001400326500019200340520196800532650001002500650001202510650001902522650002002541650001502561650002402576650001402600650001502614650002202629650001902651650001502670650002302685650001102708650002402719650001502743651001702758700001902775773014302794856005402937856004502991961000903036852000903045655001203054IND60752007620221117211213.0210929e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075200762DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1276.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouthey, T.

Reliable climate data can be costly, and currently requires intensive data validation; hence the study aimed to find an alternative resource to quantify the climate over the spatial extent of the Western Cape, for possible semi-real time applications. This study focused on integrating climate and thermal satellite remote sensing data to assess the reaction of the grapevine to a changing environment. Sites were selected over a geographical climatic band; multiple factor analysis was used to evaluate the interaction of weather, specifically temperature, relative humidity and wind speed with grapevine phenology. The aims of the study were to quantify climate change and seasonal variability in the Western Cape with the best station network possible within the limits of the spatial and temporal resolution availability. The satellite land surface temperature and weather station data exhibited a significant linear relationship with a good prediction accuracy. Simple statistical models where employed, with robust resampling techniques achieving a high accuracy in the complex terrain of the Western Cape. Land surface temperature maps are intrinsically spatialised, providing daily temperature values that in the past would have only been possible by spatial interpolation of sparse weather station networks, which could only be as accurate as the input data. This study has provided insights into grapevine and environmental interactions being driven by seasonal variability within the climate shifts in the Western Cape. Grapevine responses such as flowering date were driven most prominently by climate, specifically the summer months of the previous harvest, emphasising the need and the potential use of thermal satellite products to supplement weather station networks. 3aVitis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afactor analysis 3alandscapes 3ameteorological data 3aphenology 3aprediction 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3awind speed 3aSouth Africa1 aStrever, A.

The key to this bloom advancement is the restrain of shoot growth and earlier summer bud dormancy. The optimization of deficit irrigation strategies in loquat demands a better knowledge of when the apical meristems commit to flowering (flower induction). With the aim of determining flower induction date, and the role that apical bud dormancy plays in flower transition, we have biweekly defoliated different sets of shoots in ‘Algerie’ loquat and recorded the plant response. Two sets of intact shoots and of shoots in which the new leaves were continuously removed were studied for comparison. The results show that defoliation performed before July always caused the emergence of new leaves. This vegetative response was reduced on defoliation carried out on mid-July, while defoliation on July 31PP resulted in the prompt appearance of an inflorescence in 30% of the shoots. This percentage increased up to 65% in mid-August. The complete defoliation every two weeks enhanced the formation of more leaves per shoot and prevented summer rest. Complete leaf removal slightly delayed but did not preclude bloom. These results inform that flowering transition in ‘Algerie’ occurs around mid-July, when the apical buds of intact shoots were entering in dormancy. Widespread blooming in completely defoliated shoots that did not enter in summer rest indicates that apical bud dormancy is not needed for flowering transition. 3aEriobotrya japonica 3aapical meristems 3abuds 3adeficit irrigation 3adefoliation 3adormancy 3aflowering 3airrigation management 3aleaves 3aloquats 3aplant response 3ashoots1 aGrosso, L. del0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 887 p.185-190dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/887/887_30.htm 7aarticle02422naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003000110245005700140300001600197500011200213500002400325520124300349650001001592650001301602650001401615650001201629650002701641650002401668650001201692650001001704650001301714650001201727650001701739700001301756700001501769700002501784700001701809773014001826852000901966856004901975655001202024IND4456616720221117210350.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445661672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgustí Fonfría, Manuel,10aPhysiology of Growth and Development in Loquat Fruit  ap. 179-183.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aIn the northern hermisphere, loquat fruit sets at the beginning of December and grows for four months. Loquat fruit has a sigmoidal pattern of growth. From fruit set to February, fruit grows slowly and seeds are the main relative fruit component, contributing in a high proportion to the total dry weight. From early March to maturity, fruit growth accelerates, showing two peaks of growth-rate, early in March and from the late March to harvest, reaching 80% of its final weight in 45 d. Two weeks before colour break, flesh exceeds seed in weight and becomes the main contributor to fruit weight, both fresh and dry weight. At harvest, the flesh tissue represents, approximately, 80 and 45% of total fresh and dry fruit weight, respectively. Flesh cell expansion is depending on turgor pressure due to water uptake, which takes place very fast during the last three weeks of fruit development. This increase in water uptake is also due to the accumulation of carbohydrates, particularly sucrose and, in a lower proportion, fructose, glucose and sorbitol, and mineral elements, = mainly K and N. There is still no convincing demonstration that loquat is a climacteric fruit. Hormonal control plays an important role in fruit development. 3acolor 3afructose 3afruit set 3aglucose 3agrowth and development 3ahormonal regulation 3aloquats 3aseeds 3asorbitol 3asucrose 3awater uptake1 aReig, C.1 aMesejo, C.1 aMartinez-Fuentes, A.1 aGariglio, N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 887 p.179-183dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/887/887_29.htm 7aarticle02211naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245005800165300001200223520069000235650001500925650001300940650001200953650000900965650001000974650001600984650002101000650001501021650001401036650001401050650001401064650002401078650001101102651003101113700001901144700001801163700002201181700003001203700002601233700002501259700002201284700001901306700001701325700002601342700002001368700001901388773012401407852000901531856008301540930003301623946001301656655001201669IND4414797220221117210414.0090109e20090109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441479722DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11638742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlehert, David S.10aBat White-Nose Syndrome: An Emerging Fungal Pathogen?  ap. 227.  aWhite-nose syndrome (WNS) is a condition associated with an unprecedented bat mortality event in the northeastern United States.

Almost 57% of grapes are used to make wine, 36% are consumed as fresh table grapes and 7% as dried grapes. Drying is one of the most traditional methods of preserving fruits and world dried grapes production is 1.5 MT in 2017. The rate of internationalization of trade for dried grape is very high and it is particularly suited to international trade because of its low transportation cost and easy storage requirements. Today, according to the UN, there are 7.3 billion people and we may reach 9.7 billion by 2050. This growth, along with rising incomes in developing countries, are driving up global food demand, which will shape agricultural markets and dried grape industry. While Turkey and USA dominate global dried grape production, Turkey is the leading dried grape exporter in the world. Turkey's annual dried grape production is approximately 0.30 MT and its export reaches 0.27 MT. In this paper, current and future trends, challenges and Turkey's role in dried grape sector is discussed and information will be given about works and efforts of Turkish dried grape sector at national and international level. 3aexports 3afruits 3aindustry 3ainternational trade 3apeople 3atransportation 3aviticulture 3awines1 aAsciogul, O.1 aYilmaz, E.1 aAlmis, N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2020 Apr. 15, , no. 1276 p.1-6dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2020.1276.140uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/7522141  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245009500198300001600293506007600309520121600385506003701601650000801638650003501646650002301681650001501704650001701719650001101736650001501747650002201762700002401784700001801808700001901826700002001845700001801865700002201883773008001905852000901985856007801994930003302072946001102105655001202116IND4414806220221207115120.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441480622DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9382doi7 aPMC26156092pmcid7 a190367932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValkov, Eugene10aFunctional and structural characterization of the integrase from the prototype foamy virus  ap. 243-255.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEstablishment of the stable provirus is an essential step in retroviral replication, orchestrated by integrase (IN), a virus-derived enzyme. Until now, available structural information was limited to the INs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), avian sarcoma virus (ASV) and their close orthologs from the Lentivirus and Alpharetrovirus genera. Here, we characterized the in vitro activity of the prototype foamy virus (PFV) IN from the Spumavirus genus and determined the three-dimensional structure of its catalytic core domain (CCD). Recombinant PFV IN displayed robust and almost exclusively concerted integration activity in vitro utilizing donor DNA substrates as short as 16 bp, underscoring its significance as a model for detailed structural studies. Comparison of the HIV-1, ASV and PFV CCD structures highlighted both conserved as well as unique structural features such as organization of the active site and the putative host factor binding face. Despite possessing very limited sequence identity to its HIV counterpart, PFV IN was sensitive to HIV IN strand transfer inhibitors, suggesting that this class of inhibitors target the most conserved features of retroviral IN-DNA complexes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRous sarcoma virus 3aSpumavirus 3aactive sites 3amodels 3aproviruses 3asequence analysis1 aGupta, Saumya Shree1 aHare, Stephen1 aHelander, Anna1 aRoversi, Pietro1 aMcClure, Myra1 aCherepanov, Peter0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.243-255x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9383Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02412naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245006800195300001600263506007600279520135700355506003701712650000801749650002201757650001601779650001501795700002501810700001601835773008001851852000901931856007801940930003302018946001102051655001202062IND4414806020221207101955.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441480602DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9112doi7 aPMC26156042pmcid7 a190367882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaeger, Luc14aThe UA_handle: a versatile submotif in stable RNA architectures  ap. 215-230.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStable RNAs are modular and hierarchical 3D architectures taking advantage of recurrent structural motifs to form extensive non-covalent tertiary interactions. Sequence and atomic structure analysis has revealed a novel submotif involving a minimal set of five nucleotides, termed the UA_handle motif (5'XU/ANnX3'). It consists of a U:A Watson-Crick: Hoogsteen trans base pair stacked over a classic Watson-Crick base pair, and a bulge of one or more nucleotides that can act as a handle for making different types of long-range interactions. This motif is one of the most versatile building blocks identified in stable RNAs. It enters into the composition of numerous recurrent motifs of greater structural complexity such as the T-loop, the 11-nt receptor, the UAA/GAN and the G-ribo motifs. Several structural principles pertaining to RNA motifs are derived from our analysis. A limited set of basic submotifs can account for the formation of most structural motifs uncovered in ribosomal and stable RNAs. Structural motifs can act as structural scaffoldings and be functionally and topologically equivalent despite sequence and structural differences. The sequence network resulting from the structural relationships shared by these RNA motifs can be used as a proto-language for assisting prediction and rational design of RNA tertiary structures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3anucleotide motifs 3anucleotides 3aprediction1 aVerzemnieks, Erik J.1 aGeary, Cody0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.215-230x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02051naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245006100198300001600259506007600275520085600351506003701207650001801244650002001262650003101282650001201313650001801325650002101343650001401364650001701378700002401395773008001419852000901499856007801508930003301586946001101619990002301630655001201653IND4414805720221207102003.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441480572DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9242doi7 aPMC26156132pmcid7 a190333672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLynch, Sean A.12aA flow cytometry-based screen for synthetic riboswitches  ap. 184-192.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRiboswitches regulate gene expression through direct, small molecule-mRNA interactions. The creation of new synthetic riboswitches from in vitro selected aptamers benefits from rapid, high-throughput methods for identifying switches capable of triggering dramatic changes in gene expression in the presence of a desired ligand. Here we present a flow cytometry-based screen for identifying synthetic riboswitches that induce robust increases in gene expression in the presence of theophylline. The performance characteristics of our newly identified riboswitches exceed those of previously described natural and synthetic riboswitches. Sequencing data and structure probing experiments reveal the ribosome binding site to be an important determinant of how well a switch performs and may provide insights into the design of new synthetic riboswitches.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding sites 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aligands 3anucleic acids 3aoligonucleotides 3aribosomes 3atheophylline1 aGallivan, Justin P.0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.184-192x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9243Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01930naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010500163300001800268500002400286520110000310650001201410650001201422650002401434700001701458773009501475852000901570856008501579655001201664IND4456524520221117210713.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445652452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-010-0743-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHam, Yoo-Geun10aImprovement of seasonal forecasts with inclusion of tropical instability waves on initial conditions  ap. 1277-1290.  aIncludes references  aPositive impacts of tropical instability waves (TIWs) in initial conditions on seasonal forecasts are investigated using a air-sea coupled GCM. Due to coarse observational networks and deficiencies in widely-used initialization methods (e.g. 3DVAR or OI methods), TIW variability in oceanic initial conditions is excessively suppressed. It ruins the interaction between TIWs and climate states, therefore, degrades the climate forecast skills. To settle this problem, TIW patterns obtained from free integration is added to the spatially-smoothed initial conditions to simulate realistic seasonal TIW variability (TIWV). Through 20-year ensemble forecast experiments, it is shown that seasonal TIWV with TIWs-seeded initial conditions is significantly stronger until 2-month lead time. In addition, enhanced TIWV amplifies nonlinear relationship between TIWs and ENSO, which leads realistic simulation of the El Niño-La Niña asymmetry. As a result of better ENSO simulation, correlation improvement of simulated NINO3 index with TIWs-seeded initial conditions is over 0.1 at 4-month lead time. 3aEl Nino 3atropics 3aweather forecasting1 aKang, In-Sik0 tClimate dynamics.g2011 Apr., v. 36, no. 7-8 p.1277-1290dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-010-0743-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02936naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010200132300001600234500011200250500002400362520165000386650002402036650001702060650001402077650001602091650002202107650002102129650001202150650001202162650002302174650001102197650002002208650001702228700001302245700001502258700001402273700001502287700001402302773014002316852000902456856004902465655001202514IND4456616220221117210647.0110411s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445661622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIntrigliolo, D.S.10aUsefulness of Stem Dendrometers as Continuous Water Stress Indicators of Loquat Tree Water Status  ap. 149-154.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  aIn the Mediterranean culture of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), some growers apply a summer water withholding cycle in order to achieve earlier flowering and harvest in the next season. Generally, the first fruit that reach the market have higher commercial value. It has been shown that the duration and severity of the plant water stress imposed is a determinant factor in the flowering time response. Stem water potential ((psi)stem), is a useful indicator of plant water status. However, because this measurement cannot be automated it is important to look for alternatives to determine plant water status with plant sensors. In many fruit trees it has been shown that stem dendrometers could be employed as a plant water status indicator. However, in Loquat trees, the usefulness of this technique has not been yet investigated. The experiment was carried out in 2009 with ‘Cardona’ where control fully irrigated trees were compared with trees submitted to water withholding during the summer. Results showed that under mild plant water stress, daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) was a sensitive indicator of plant water status and MDS was able to detect soil water deficit even before that clear differences in (psi)stem could be detected. However, when plant water stress became more severe ((psi)stem lower than -1.4 MPa), MDS did not increase further. Results suggest that growers can use MDS as a sensitive indicator of the early stage of plant water stress. However, once plant water stress becomes more severe ((psi)stem<-1.4 MPa), as it is required to advance flowering, (psi)stem is a more useful indicator of plant water stress. 3aEriobotrya japonica 3adendrometers 3aflowering 3afruit trees 3aindicator species 3airrigation rates 3aloquats 3amarkets 3asoil water deficit 3asummer 3awater potential 3awater stress1 aReig, C.1 aMesejo, C.1 aBonet, L.1 aFerrer, P.1 aSoler, E.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 887 p.149-154dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/887/887_24.htm 7aarticle02430naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002000179245010100199300001400300506007600314520108800390506003701478650002801515650002101543650002501564650002201589650001501611650001001626650000901636700001701645700001801662700001801680700001501698700002001713700001901733773007801752852000901830856007801839930003301917946001101950990002301961655001201984IND4414806420221207101954.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441480642DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn8932doi7 aPMC26156162pmcid7 a190109622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Kyung-Chul10aMouse period 2 mRNA circadian oscillation is modulated by PTB-mediated rhythmic mRNA degradation  ap. 26-37.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCircadian mRNA oscillations are the main feature of core clock genes. Among them, period 2 is a key component in negative-feedback regulation, showing robust diurnal oscillations. Moreover, period 2 has been found to have a physiological role in the cell cycle or the tumor suppression. The present study reports that 3'-untranslated region (UTR)-dependent mRNA decay is involved in the regulation of circadian oscillation of period 2 mRNA. Within the mper2 3'UTR, both the CU-rich region and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) are more responsible for mRNA stability and degradation kinetics than are other factors. Depletion of PTB with RNAi results in mper2 mRNA stabilization. During the circadian oscillations of mper2, cytoplasmic PTB showed a reciprocal expression profile compared with mper2 mRNA and its peak amplitude was increased when PTB was depleted. This report on the regulation of mper2 proposes that post-transcriptional mRNA decay mediated by PTB is a fine-tuned regulatory mechanism that includes dampening-down effects during circadian mRNA oscillations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3' untranslated regions 3aRNA interference 3aRNA-binding proteins 3abiological clocks 3acell cycle 3agenes 3amice1 aKim, Tae-Don1 aLee, Kyung-Ha1 aKim, Do-yeon.1 aKim, Wanil1 aLee, Kyung-Yeol1 aKim, Kyong-Tai0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.26-37x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn8933Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02925naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012700125300001600252500020300268500002400471520160100495650000902096650001202105650001702117650001502134650002402149650001202173650002002185650001402205650002002219650001202239650001002251651001302261700001702274700002102291700001702312773014002329852000902469856004902478655001202527IND4456453920221117210602.0110410s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445645392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMowo, J.G.10aTracking the Spillover of Introduced Technologies: the Case of Improved Banana (Musa spp.) Germplasm in Northeast Tanzania  ap. 695-703.  aPaper presented at the International Conference on Banana and Plantain in Africa: Harnessing International Partnerships to Increase Research Impact, Volume 2, held October 5-9, 2008, Mombasa, Kenya.  aIncludes references  aThis paper reviews a methodology for tracking the pattern and extent of spillover of introduced technologies, using improved banana (Musa spp.) germplasm in Lushoto, Northeast Tanzania, as a case study. Such tracking is important in understanding the factors responsible for the spread of technologies and the accompanying farmer innovations. Spillover of technologies, as used here, refers to the spontaneous flow, or spread, of technologies between farmers using their social networks without external interference. Formal surveys, farmers' records and focus group discussions were used to establish the path taken and distance covered by the technology, the barriers encountered, and modifications made by farmers on the technology. Lessons derived from the study show that farmers made different modifications to the introduced technologies in order to fit them into the existing farming systems. The pattern of spillover is very much related to existing social networks in the community. Kin (nuclear and extended families) accounted for 53% of the spillover of improved banana germplasm, compared to 47% in non-kin (friends and neighbor) social networks. Improved banana suckers, introduced in Lushoto, were found as far as in Dar es Salaam; more than 300 km away. Gender bias was exhibited in the spontaneous sharing of cash generating technologies (cash crops) like banana, with exchanges between women being negligible. This paper highlights the key challenges and lessons, as well as illustrates the application of the findings, in improving delivery of research and extension services. 3aMusa 3abananas 3acase studies 3acash crops 3aextension education 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3agermplasm 3asocial networks 3asurveys 3awomen 3aTanzania1 aGerman, L.A.1 aKingamkono, M.N.1 aMasuki, K.F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2010 Nov., , no. 879 p.695-703dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/879/879_75.htm 7aarticle02529naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245009100202300001600293506007600309520129600385506003701681650003201718650001701750650002001767650001101787650001201798650001901810650002401829700002601853700002101879700002001900773008001920852000902000856007802009930003302087946001102120655001202131IND4414805820221207120827.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441480582DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn9282doi7 aPMC26156002pmcid7 a190333682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Irene.10aInvolvement of the TPR2 subdomain movement in the activities of {phi}29 DNA polymerase  ap. 193-203.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe polymerization domain of {phi}29 DNA polymerase acquires a toroidal shape by means of an arch-like structure formed by the specific insertion TPR2 (Terminal Protein Region 2) and the thumb subdomain. TPR2 is connected to the fingers and palm subdomains through flexible regions, suggesting that it can undergo conformational changes. To examine whether such changes take place, we have constructed a {phi}29 DNA polymerase mutant able to form a disulfide bond between the apexes of TPR2 and thumb to limit the mobility of TPR2. Biochemical analysis of the mutant led us to conclude that TPR2 moves away from the thumb to allow the DNA polymerase to replicate circular ssDNA. Despite the fact that no TPR2 motion is needed to allow the polymerase to use the terminal protein (TP) as primer during the initiation of {phi}29 TP-DNA replication, the disulfide bond prevents the DNA polymerase from entering the elongation phase, suggesting that TPR2 movements are necessary to allow the TP priming domain to move out from the polymerase during transition from initiation to elongation. Furthermore, the TPR2-thumb bond does not affect the equilibrium between the polymerization and exonuclease activities, leading us to propose a primer-terminus transference model between both active sites.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aactive sites 3adisulfide bonds 3amodels 3amutants 3apolymerization 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aLázaro, José María1 aSalas, Margarita1 ade Vega, Miguel0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.193-203x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn9283Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02044naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001600207500001500223520092800238650001701166650005501183650003001238650002301268650001801291650001101309650003901320650001401359653003701373653002001410653003401430700001501464700002001479773009301499852000901592930003301601945001301634946001101647655001201658IND2061373020221117210528.0980120e199706  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206137302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeimfohr, C.10aRapid genotypic differentiation of Lactococcus lactis subspecies and biovar  ap. 216-221.  a2019-12-05  aA highly efficient, rapid and reliable PCR-based method for distinguishing the subspecies and biovar of Lactococcus lactis (Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris) is described.

PCR analysis with extracted DNA or with cells of different Lactococcus lactis strains resulted in specific fragments which could be visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis. The length polymorphisms of the PCR fragments allowed a clear distinction of the L. lactis subspecies and biovar. In our study we have also included strains which in contrast to their 16S rRNA sequence belong to a different subspecies as determined by their phenotype.

The strains represented the species Mortierella alpina, Mucor circinelloides, Mucor flavus and Thamnostylum piriforme. The strains were cultivated in synthetic media, devoid of long-chain fatty acids, containing 2.00 g/l carbon. The biomass was periodically harvested, freeze dried and the total lipids were extracted. The long-chain fatty acids in the lipids were analysed as methyl esters by gas chromatography. Generally the highest percentages 18:3(omega 6), relative to other long-chain fatty acids, were obtained on disaccharides and polysaccharides as carbon sources, compared to other carbohydrates which include pentoses and trisaccharides. Higher percentages 18:3(omega 6) were obtained on alcohols as carbon sources in the case of the representatives of Mucor and Mortierella, and on organic acids as carbon sources for the representative of Thamnostylum. The representatives of M. circinelloides and M. flavus respectively utilized 25 and 23 of the 38 carbon sources in the series. The highest percentages 18:3(omega 6) obtained with the representatives of M. circinelloides and M. flavus were 27.17% and 36.40% respectively. In contrast, the highest percentages 18:3(omega 6) obtained with the representatives of M. alpina and T. piriforme were only 5.61% and 12.84% respectively. These two strains could respectively utilize only 7 and 17 of the carbon sources. 3aMucor 3abiosynthesis 3alinolenic acid 3aMortierella 3acarbon 3abiomass production 0amucor flavus 0athamnostylum piriforme 0amortierella alpina 0amucor circinelloides 0anutrient sources 0aMucorales 0agrowth1 aStrauss, T.1 aKock, J.L.F.1 aPohl, C.H.1 aCoetzee, D.J.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.165-170x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03777naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100002000178245014200198300001800340500002400358500001500382520209200397650001702489650002002506650002102526650001602547650001502563650001902578650001102597650002202608650001902630650001002649650001302659650001702672650001102689650002002700650001902720650002702739650000902766650002202775650001502797651001002812653001602822653002702838700001602865700001502881773012002896852000903016856009103025930003303116945002503149946001303174655001203187IND4414556620221117210603.0090105e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aJ100 0aF6001 aMyklebust, M.C.10aComparison of eddy covariance, chamber, and gradient methods of measuring soil CO₂ efflux in an annual semi-arid grass, Bromus tectorum  ap. 1894-1907.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEddy covariance measures net ecosystem exchange of CO₂ (NEE) at a scale between chamber-based measurements of CO₂ exchange processes and large-scale models of CO₂ flux dynamics. As the intermediate, it represents a link between small and large-scale estimates of NEE. Accuracy is therefore critical. However, estimates of nighttime ecosystem respiration based on scaled-up measurements of soil and leaf CO₂ exchange are most often larger than from eddy covariance. Identifying the source of the discrepancy is difficult due to large measurement uncertainties associated with high variability of fluxes in complex ecosystems. This study compared measurements in a simple system that allowed for minimal uncertainty. We compared measurements of soil efflux using (1) soil chambers, (2) the soil CO₂ gradient technique and ecosystem respiration using the (3) the eddy covariance method from a surface that was covered with living vegetation, straw, and snow in turn through a year. Results showed general agreement among measurements in a range of conditions during canopy absence indicating that each measurement technique is theoretically sound. However, we found disagreement among measurements in specific conditions that indicated certain limitations with each method. Nighttime eddy covariance measurements of ecosystem respiration were below the uncertainty limits of soil respiration measurements during the period of active canopy growth (leaf area index from approx. 0.3-1.0m² m⁻². This raises questions about the accuracy of nocturnal eddy covariance measurements over more complex surfaces. There was indication that the chamber method estimates were unrepresentative of the footprint in certain conditions due to within collar surface treatment and due to collar interaction with the environment. Lastly, the gradient method failed to represent surface fluxes during summer rain. To measure soil efflux in all conditions typical of this site, a combination of all three methods is recommended. A combined NEE estimate for 2005 for soil efflux was 406±73gCm⁻². 3agas exchange 3aleaf area index 3asoil respiration 3ameasurement 3aestimation 3acarbon dioxide 3aleaves 3asurface roughness 3aforage grasses 3astraw 3aaccuracy 3aforage crops 3acanopy 3aBromus tectorum 3asemiarid zones 3anet ecosystem exchange 3asnow 3adiurnal variation 3avegetation 3aIdaho 0amethodology 0aeddy covariance method1 aHipps, L.E.1 aRyel, R.J.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2008 Oct., v. 148, no. 11 p.1894-1907dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.06.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090305b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/04  aOther US 7aarticle02737naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001700158245008400175300001600259500002400275500001500299520115700314650002701471650001901498650001201517650000901529650001401538650001901552650002701571650002101598650001901619650002801638650001301666650002001679650002201699650002501721650002001746651001001766653002801776653002401804700002001828700001801848700001501866700001801881700001601899773010101915852000902016856008902025930003302114945002502147946001102172655001202183IND4414557020221117210410.0090105e20081104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2008.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aRajesh, M.K.10aGenetic survey of 10 Indian coconut landraces by simple sequence repeats (SSRs)  ap. 282-287.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA rich genetic diversity of coconut exists in farmer's fields, which represent valuable genetic resource for breeding. The study was conducted to assess the pattern of diversity in 102 coconut palms representing 10 landraces from 3 coconut-growing communities of India using 14 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A total of 90 alleles were detected with an average of 6.42 alleles per locus and an average polymorphism information content of 0.61. Expected heterozygosity (H e) was highest for the two tall landraces from Pallikkara community, while the least heterozygosity was observed for the dwarf coconut landraces from Vayalar community. Mean fixation index (F ST) of 0.42 indicates a high level of population differentiation. A low gene flow (N m) of 0.37 was observed. Based on molecular data, genetic similarities were calculated. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) cluster analysis grouped the landraces according to their geographical locations and breeding behaviour. The practical implications of this study in farmer participatory evaluation and conservation of coconut genetic resources are highlighted. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant breeding 3aalleles 3aloci 3alandraces 3aCocos nucifera 3ageographical variation 3agenetic distance 3aheterozygosity 3aplant genetic resources 3acoconuts 3adwarf cultivars 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aIndia 0amolecular sequence data 0apopulation genetics1 aArunachalam, V.1 aNagarajan, P.1 aLebrun, P.1 aSamsudeen, K.1 aThamban, C.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2008 Nov. 4, v. 118, no. 4 p.282-287dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2008.06.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02670naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245009900187300001800286520118000304650002501484650001801509650001901527650003801546650003501584650001601619650003301635650001101668650005201679650002401731650004101755651001801796653003401814653002401848653003001872653001001902700002301912700002301935773011401958852000902072856008502081930003302166946001302199655001202212IND4438475820221117210956.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443847582DNAL7 a202251252pmid7 a10.1007/s10439-010-9982-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubin, Jessica B. 10aAre We Studying What Matters? Health Priorities and NIH-Funded Biomedical Engineering Research  ap. 2237-2251.  aWith the founding of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) in 1999, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) made explicit its dedication to expanding research in biomedical engineering. Ten years later, we sought to examine how closely federal funding for biomedical engineering aligns with U.S. health priorities. Using a publicly accessible database of research projects funded by the NIH in 2008, we identified 641 grants focused on biomedical engineering, 48% of which targeted specific diseases. Overall, we found that these disease-specific NIH-funded biomedical engineering research projects align with national health priorities, as quantified by three commonly utilized measures of disease burden: cause of death, disability-adjusted survival losses, and expenditures. However, we also found some illnesses (e.g., cancer and heart disease) for which the number of research projects funded deviated from our expectations, given their disease burden.

From the mid 40’s of the 20th century the inspection programs on quarantine organisms for the different crops were extended with an inspection on quality aspects. This was on request of the growers of flower bulbs. The aim of these quality inspections was and is to improve the quality of the grown flower bulbs. The system of quality inspections, with its standards, exists for some crops for more than 50 years. In 1980 the system of voluntary quality inspections has been changed into an obligatory system. Due to the quality of the flower bulbs, depending on the crop 97 up to 99% of the lots meet the standards of the Flower bulb Inspection Service (BKD), and due to the recent change of the financing of the inspections, there is discussion about the obligatory quality inspections. The BKD states that the grower must take more responsibility in the quality of lots and growers want to have more influence on the inspections by the BKD. Also questions have been raised on the necessity of the intensive inspection programs, because yearly only 1-3% of the inspected lots, depending on the crop, is rejected by the BKD. In the coming years the BKD will develop a system with emphasis on controlling activities of the growers and less on the physical inspections of planted lots. On the other hand various important importing countries of flower bulbs demand additional regulation or specific demands, for instance China and the United States of America. This will lead to the development of special certification schemes for various crops with low tolerances for especially viruses and special programs to meet these low tolerances. Not only the health of a crop will be important, but also under what conditions it has been grown and how the tracking and tracing is safeguarded. 3aDitylenchus dipsaci 3aNarcissus 3abulbs 3acertification 3acrops 3aflowers 3afunding 3agrowers 3aquarantine 3aviruses 3aChina 3aUnited States0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 886 p.147-151dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/886/886_18.htm 7aarticle02860naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015700165300001600322500001500338520149200353650002101845650001001866650001501876650001001891650001401901650001301915650002401928650001101952650001401963650001501977651001101992651001002003653001002013700002902023700002702052700003002079700003002109700002402139773010102163852000902264856008502273930003302358946001102391655001202402IND4414827920221117210921.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441482792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-008-0091-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrivas, Costas 13aAn audio-visual nest monitoring system for the study and manipulation of siblicide in bearded vultures Gypaetus barbatus on the island of Crete (Greece)  ap. 105-116.  a2019-12-04  aWe describe here an automated surveillance system that was installed in a bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) nest in Crete during 2003-2006 with the aim of studying siblicide in this species. The system caused only minimal levels of disturbance to the birds and was capable of operating autonomously for more than 1 week. It comprised (1) a nest monitoring subsystem (camera, microphone, battery with a charge controller and a transmitter together with an antenna), which was supported by a solar panel, and (2) a recording subsystem (antenna receiver, video signal controller and a remote controlled PC through a GSM modem) that compressed the audio-video signal and provided real time monitoring. Two-egg clutches with a 7-day laying and hatching interval were recorded while hatching asynchrony was also determined through an analysis of the bioacoustic data. Food delivery rate and number of feeds to the first chick increased after the hatching of its sibling although not significantly so. Of the aggressive interactions recorded, 98% were initiated by the dominant chick and resulted in an average of 246 ± 157 peckings per day. Supplementary feeding did not produce any significant correlation between feeding rate and sibling aggression. The second chick survived 5 days and died as a result of starvation accelerated by sibling aggression. Intervention measures aimed at increasing the survival chance of the second chick should be undertaken when the latter is 1-2 days old. 3asolar collectors 3afeeds 3amonitoring 3anests 3asiblicide 3ahatching 3adietary supplements 3achicks 3abatteries 3astarvation 3aGreece 3aCrete 0abirds1 aXirouchakis, Stavros M. 1 aChristodoulou, Costas 1 aCarcamo-Aboitiz, Beatriz 1 aGeorgiakakis, Panagiotis 1 aProbonas, Michalis 0 tJournal of ethology.g2009 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.105-116dJapan : Springer Japanx0289-07717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-008-0091-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090109b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006800124300001600192500011200208500002400320500001500344520131400359650001401673650003901687650001201726650001401738650002401752650001101776650003401787653001201821700001101833700001101844700001101855700001401866700001501880700001301895700001601908773014001924852000902064856004902073655001202122IND4456626320221117211207.0110413s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445662632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Q.G.10aAnalysis on the Anther and Pollen Morphology of Triploid Loquat  ap. 265-270.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Loquat, held May 3-6, 2010, Antakya, Hatay, Turkey.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAnthers of triploid loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl. Rosaceae) were observed with laser confocal scanning microscopy which was treated by hological trans-illumination. Pollen morphologies of triploid loquat were examined by scanning electron microscope. The result showed that: (1) anthers of triploid loquat have three different morphologies: elongated elliptic-shape, crescent-shape, and spindle-shape. The quantity of pollens in the three forms’ anther is different, but there is no direct correlation between the quantity of pollen and anther morphology. Moreover, the anther form and size have significant difference in different triploid cultivars; (2) the pollens of diploid loquat plant belonging to N3P4C5 model. While the volume of natural triploid loquat pollen increased, and most of the pollens had no significant equatorial axis and polar axis, the plumpness of the whole pollen was uneven. The proportion of abnormal pollen was high. There was significant differences between pollens, most of thems were abortive. The morphological characteristics of a few triploid pollens were close to diploid pollen. Differences in size, shape and exine ornamentation of the pollen grains were found among cultivars, providing a basic information to predict fertility of cultivars and natural triploids. 3acultivars 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aloquats 3atriploidy 3aEriobotrya japonica 3apollen 3ascanning electron microscopes 0aanthers1 aHe, Q.1 aJi, K.1 aWu, Q.1 aZhang, C.1 aWang, W.X.1 aLi, X.L.1 aLiang, G.L.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 Jan., , no. 887 p.265-270dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/887/887_45.htm 7aarticle02114naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012900127300001600256500001500272520097700287650004501264650004701309650001801356650002301374650002001397650001401417650002201431651001101453653003001464700002301494700001801517700001701535700001701552773009301569852000901662930003301671945001301704946001101717655001201728IND2198862620221117211304.0990522e199812  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219886262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosato, Y.B.10aDiversity of a Xylella fastidiosa population isolated from Citrus sinensis affected by citrus variegated chlorosis in Brazil  ap. 593-598.  a2019-12-05  aDiversity of a population of Xylella fastidiosa isolated from sweet orange plants showing citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) symptoms was assessed by PCR-based techniques. Thirty-seven strains were isolated throughout the 1997 year in the orange belt of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Strains isolated from coffee, grape, oleander and plum were also included as outgroup reference strains. PCR amplification of the spacer sequence between the 16-23S rDNA yielded one fragment of 1.2 kb. Digestion with restriction enzymes, DdeI, HinfI or Sau3AI generated identical RFLP patterns for citrus and coffee strains, which could be distinguished from the strains isolated from the other hosts. Eight RAPD primers were also used and the results showed similarity from 80 to 100% within the CVC population. Three prevalent haplotypes comprising 24 CVC strains showed a high level of similarity (95%). Strains from the other hosts clustered apart from CVC strains, forming distinct groups. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aribosomal DNA 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aCitrus sinensis 3achlorosis 3agenetic variation 3aBrazil 0apolymerase chain reaction1 aRodrigues Neto, J.1 aMiranda, V.S.1 aCarlos, E.F.1 aManfio, G.P.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1998 Dec., v. 21, no. 4 p.593-598x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02156naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014900129300001600278520108400294650001601378650002101394650001401415650001701429650002001446650002701466650002301493650001401516651001601530653001901546653002101565700001701586700002001603773009301623852000901716930003301725945001301758946001101771655001201782IND2198862720221117211137.0990522e199812  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219886272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernardo, E.B.10aCharacterization, differentiation and identification of wild-type cellulose-synthesizing Acetobacter strains involved in Nata de Coco Production  ap. 599-608.  aCellulose-producing bacteria used for Nata de Coco production in the Philippines were isolated and characterized. Two distinct wild-type strains (ITDI 2.1 and PA 2.2) were selected from thirty-eight isolates obtained. The two strains, and the rest of the cellulose producers, were established to be members of the genus Acetobacter based on rapid phenotypic characterization. They were characterized and differentiated based on pellicle type and colony morphology, carbon-utilization pattern (Biolog assay), amount of cellulose production and 16S rDNA sequence. The thick pellicle cellulose-producing strain (ITDI 2.1) has a stable and consistent production of a very thick pellicle in any sugar-based, acidic medium, with a dry weight up to twenty-six times that of the thin pellicle cellulose-producing strain (PA 2.2) after 7-8 days static batch culture. Species identification using 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the two strains belong to two different species of Acetobacter, Acetobacter xylinus and A. hansenii and may be new subspecies under these species designation. 3aAcetobacter 3astarter cultures 3acellulose 3abiosynthesis 3afermented foods 3aanatomy and morphology 3astrain differences 3aphenotype 3aPhilippines 0aidentification 0acharacterization1 aNeilan, B.A.1 aCouperwhite, I.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1998 Dec., v. 21, no. 4 p.599-608x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02081naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012100128300001600249500001500265520112300280650003001403650001301433650002301446650001401469650002501483650002301508650002201531653001601553700001501569773009301584852000901677930003301686945001301719946001101732655001201743IND2205733320221117211128.0000713e199912  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220573332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalandrin, L.10aSerological and molecular size characterization of flagellins of Pseudomonas syringae pathovars and related bacteria  ap. 534-545.  a2019-12-05  aFlagella from a total of 118 strains representing mostly pathovars of the phytopathogenic group Pseudomonas syringae, but also P. chlororaphis, P. cichorii, P. corrugata, P. fluorescens, P. fuscovaginae, P. stutzeri, P. viridiflava, as well as related phytopathogenic genera (Burkholderia cepacia and Ralstonia solanacearum) were characterized by immuno-fluorescent staining, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting.

Nodulation tests performed on 5 plant species demonstrated host specificity among the strains studied. 3aBradyrhizobium 3aFabaceae 3ataxonomy 3abacterial proteins 3aribosomal DNA 3aphylogeny 3anodulation 3ahost specificity 3aspecies diversity 3aSenegal1 aSy, A.1 aWillems, A.1 aTorck, U.1 aDreyfus, B.1 aGillis, M.1 aLajudie, P. de.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1999 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.647-661x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle04646naa a2200949 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100001900178245012100197300001800318500002400336520179400360650001502154650001902169650001702188650001502205650001602220650002702236650001202263650001802275650001902293650001502312650001502327650002302342650002602365650002702391651001802418653002702436653004602463700002002509700002502529700002002554700002602574700001702600700001402617700001902631700001902650700001402669700002102683700001902704700002102723700002102744700001902765700001902784700002102803700001902824700001902843700002102862700002102883700001702904700002202921700002402943700002202967700001802989700002303007700002003030700001903050700002203069700002303091700002303114700002203137700002003159700002403179700002203203700001203225700002203237700002203259773012003281852000903401856009103410856011203501930003303613945002503646946001303671655001203684IND4414556120221117203849.0090105e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aF600 0aX6201 aXiao, Jingfeng10aEstimation of net ecosystem carbon exchange for the conterminous United States by combining MODIS and AmeriFlux data  ap. 1827-1847.  aIncludes references  aEddy covariance flux towers provide continuous measurements of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) for a wide range of climate and biome types. However, these measurements only represent the carbon fluxes at the scale of the tower footprint. To quantify the net exchange of carbon dioxide between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere for regions or continents, flux tower measurements need to be extrapolated to these large areas. Here we used remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument on board the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Terra satellite to scale up AmeriFlux NEE measurements to the continental scale. We first combined MODIS and AmeriFlux data for representative U.S. ecosystems to develop a predictive NEE model using a modified regression tree approach. The predictive model was trained and validated using eddy flux NEE data over the periods 2000-2004 and 2005-2006, respectively. We found that the model predicted NEE well (r =0.73, p <0.001). We then applied the model to the continental scale and estimated NEE for each 1kmx1km cell across the conterminous U.S. for each 8-day interval in 2005 using spatially explicit MODIS data. The model generally captured the expected spatial and seasonal patterns of NEE as determined from measurements and the literature. Our study demonstrated that our empirical approach is effective for scaling up eddy flux NEE measurements to the continental scale and producing wall-to-wall NEE estimates across multiple biomes. Our estimates may provide an independent dataset from simulations with biogeochemical models and inverse modeling approaches for examining the spatiotemporal patterns of NEE and constraining terrestrial carbon budgets over large areas. 3aecosystems 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3aestimation 3ameasurement 3ageographical variation 3abiomass 3adata analysis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3abiogeochemical cycles 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aUnited States 0aeddy covariance method 0amoderate resolution imaging spectrometers1 aZhuang, Qianlai1 aBaldocchi, Dennis D.1 aLaw, Beverly E.1 aRichardson, Andrew D.1 aChen, Jiquan1 aOren, Ram1 aStarr, Gregory1 aNoormets, Asko1 aMa, Siyan1 aVerma, Shashi B.1 aWharton, Sonia1 aWofsy, Steven C.1 aBolstad, Paul V.1 aBurns, Sean P.1 aCook, David R.1 aCurtis, Peter S.1 aDrake, Bert G.1 aFalk, Matthias1 aFischer, Marc L.1 aFoster, David R.1 aGu, Lianhong1 aHadley, Julian L.1 aHollinger, David Y.1 aKatul, Gabriel G.1 aLitvak, Marcy1 aMartin, Timothy A.1 aMatamala, Roser1 aMcNulty, Steve1 aMeyers, Tilden P.1 aMonson, Russell K.1 aMunger, J.

Probiotics may provide a potential alternative method to protect larvae from opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria and promote a balanced environment. This study was designed to search for new probiotics to target this critical period in cod rearing. Potential probionts were selected from the natural microbiota of cod aquacultural environment. The selection was based on several criteria: pathogen inhibition potential, growth characteristics, strain identification, metabolite production and adhesion to fish cell lines. Our study demonstrated that 14% of screened bacteria (n =188) had antagonistic properties towards fish pathogens. The majority of these isolates were Gram-positive (81%), belonging to Firmicutes (69.2%) and Actinobacteria (11.5%) phyla based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 6 (3.2%) of 188 isolates could inhibit all three pathogens tested: Vibrio anguillarum, Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. achromogenes and Vibrio salmonicida. Differences observed in activity intensity and spectrum among inhibitory isolates emphasise the need to develop probiotic mixtures for efficient prophylactic methods. Comparison of growth behaviour of inhibitory isolates and pathogens at cod rearing temperatures, metabolite production and adhesion capacity were considered for final probiont selection. Four promising isolates that could be used as a mixed supplement to rearing water were identified as putative probiotic bacteria. This study emphasises the importance and potential of lactic acid bacteria in aquaculture. 3afish culture 3aprotective effect 3ascreening 3abacterial colonization 3acell adhesion 3aantagonists 3adisease prevention 3alactic acid bacteria 3aAliivibrio salmonicida 3atherapeutics 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aprobiotics 3afish diseases 3afish larvae 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3amicrobial growth 3acod (fish) 3abacterial infections 3ametabolites 3afarmed fish 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aCell Line 2aFish Diseasesxprevention & control 2aGadus morhuaxmicrobiology 2aProbioticsxisolation & purification 0aVibrio salmonicida 0ainhibitors1 aGudmundsdottir, S.1 aPedersen, M.H.1 aBudde, B.B.1 aGudmundsdottir, B.K.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Dec. 10, v. 132, no. 3-4 p.328-339dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.05.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02560naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001600213500001500229520119900244650002501443650002101468650002301489650001401512650001401526650000801540650003001548650001401578650002501592650001401617650002801631650001801659653002001677653001601697653001901713653002201732653001401754653001901768653002801787653001701815653002801832653001901860700001601879773009301895852000901988930003301997945001302030946001102043655001202054IND2058840520221117204200.0970806e199701  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205884052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLudwig, M.L.10aSpecific identification of Fusarium graminearum by PCR with gaoA targeted primers  ap. 111-113.  a2019-12-05  aA duplex PCR procedure for the specific identification of Fusarium graminearum was set up and optimized for high sensitivity. The specific primer pair used was originally designed for the detection of a galactose oxidase producing F. graminearum-strain previously designated Cladobotryum dendroides NRRL 2903. Results obtained in this study suggest identification of this strain as F. graminearum. The PCR procedure gave a specific 900 bp amplificate with DNA isolated from F. graminearum (and from C. dendroides NRRL 2903). No amplification occurred with DNA from closely related Fusarium species, fungi of other genera, bacteria and cereals. The method was used for screening of 22 strains originally designated F. graminearum. Results were compared to morphological characteristics of the isolates, red pigmentation on mannitol-PCNB-agar, and production of galactose oxidase by a novel colorimetric detection system for this enzyme. Negative results in specific amplification with some of the isolates were in good accordance with physiological and morphological characterization. The value of this highly specific method for the detection of F. graminearum in natural habitats is discussed. 3aFusarium graminearum 3astructural genes 3asequence alignment 3agalactose 3adetection 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aHypomyces 3anucleotide sequences 3ascreening 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3achemotaxonomy 0aGibberella zeae 0acomparisons 0aidentification 0agalactose oxidase 0agaoa gene 0agenbank/u51093 0amolecular sequence data 0aCladobotryum 0acladobotryum dendroides 0agenbank/u501941 aVogel, R.F.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.111-113x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02646naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010300124300001400227500001500241520138900256650001801645650001501663650002001678650001401698650001401712650001101726650002701737650001601764650002101780653001401801653001301815653001701828653001901845653001701864653001101881700001501892700001501907700001201922700001701934700001401951700001501965700001501980773009101995852000902086930003302095945001302128946001102141655001202152IND2058838020221117204218.0970806e199701  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205883802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeile, L.10aBifidobacterium lactis sp. nov., a moderately oxygen tolerant species isolated from fermented milk  ap. 57-64.  a2019-12-05  aA selection procedure was developed to isolate Bifidobacterium strains from food and faeces which are able to grow under oxidative stress conditions. Strain UR1, an isolate from a French yoghurt, was able to grow at elevated oxygen concentrations above 5% oxygen in liquid media containing 0.3 mM paraquat (methylviologen). In fermenter cultures, strain UR1 produced considerable amounts of formate (up to 23 mM) depending on the oxygen-stress conditions. We sequenced the 16S rRNA gene cloned from UR1 genomic DNA, compared it with that from 21 Bifidobacterium species and constructed a phylogenetic tree by alignment analysis. The most related species of strain UR1 was calculated to be Bifidobacterium animalis DSM 20104. DNA-DNA hybridizations between the genomes of strain UR1, B. animalis DSM 20104 and B. longum DSM 20219 showed only weak homology (27% and <10%, respectively). Both findings strongly supported a distinct species-status for strain UR1. In addition, properties like enzyme profiles (API ZYM), utilization of carbohydrates (API CH 50), the G+C content of 61.9 mol% and the high tolerance towards oxygen stress differ from those of B. animalis. Therefore, we concluded that strain UR1 has to be regarded as a new species which we named Bifidobacterium lactis. This name honours the fact that the species has been isolated on several occasions from fermented milk. 3aribosomal RNA 3aphysiology 3aBifidobacterium 3aphylogeny 3aoxidation 3ayogurt 3aanatomy and morphology 3anew species 3aoxidative stress 0atolerance 0ataxonomy 0adescriptions 0agenbank/x89111 0abiochemistry 0astress1 aLudwig, W.1 aRueger, U.1 aGut, C.1 aKaufmann, P.1 aDasen, G.1 aWenger, S.1 aTeuber, M.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.57-64x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03893naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003800133040001800171072000900189100002100198245014100219300001600360500002400376506007600400520157600476506003702052650000902089650003402098650002302132650001702155650002502172650001302197650001402210650001902224650001602243650002002259650001402279650001402293650001502307650000702322650001202329650002102341650002202362650001202384650002802396650001602424650002702440650000902467650001402476650005302490650004002543650003102583650001502614650003902629650002402668650003602692650004002728653001802768653003102786700002202817700002202839700002302861773009702884852000902981856008802990930003303078945002503111946001103136655001203147IND4414558220221207115945.0090105e20081210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441455822DNAL7 a186065062pmid7 aPMC25884662pmcid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aRegan, Andrew D.10aDifferential role for low pH and cathepsin-mediated cleavage of the viral spike protein during entry of serotype II feline coronaviruses  ap. 235-248.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a terminal disease of cats caused by systemic infection with a feline coronavirus (FCoV). FCoV biotypes that cause FIP are designated feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and are distinguished by their ability to infect macrophages and monocytes. Antigenically similar to their virulent counterparts are FCoV biotypes designated feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), which usually cause only mild enteritis and are unable to efficiently infect macrophages and monocytes. The FCoV spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell and has previously been shown to determine the distinct tropism exhibited by certain isolates of FIPV and FECV, however, the molecular mechanism underlying viral pathogenesis has yet to be determined. Here we show that the FECV strain WSU 79-1683 (FECV-1683) is highly dependent on host cell cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity for entry into the host cell, as well as on the low pH of endocytic compartments. In addition, both cathepsin B and cathepsin L are able to induce a specific cleavage event in the FECV-1683 spike protein. In contrast, host cell entry by the FIPV strains WSU 79-1146 (FIPV-1146) and FIPV-DF2 proceeds independently of cathepsin L activity and low pH, but is still highly dependent on cathepsin B activity. In the case of FIPV-1146 and FIPV-DF2, infection of primary feline monocytes was also dependent on host cell cathepsin B activity, indicating that host cell cathepsins may play a role in the distinct tropisms displayed by different feline coronavirus biotypes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acats 3afeline infectious peritonitis 3aFeline coronavirus 3apathogenesis 3abiochemical pathways 3abiotypes 3aserotypes 3aviral proteins 3aproteolysis 3acell physiology 3amonocytes 3ainfection 3acathepsins 3apH 3aacidity 3ain vitro studies 2aAmmonium Chloride 2aAnimals 2aCathepsin Bxmetabolism 2aCathepsin L 2aCathepsinsxmetabolism 2aCats 2aCell Line 2aCoronavirus, Felinexclassificationxphysiology. 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMacrolides 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aMonocytesxvirology 2aSpike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxmetabolism 0aspike protein 0afeline enteric coronavirus1 aShraybman, Renata1 aCohen, Rebecca D.1 aWhittaker, Gary R.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2008 Dec. 10, v. 132, no. 3-4 p.235-248dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.05.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20090304b00000000c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01264naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008200127300001600209520041300225650002900638650001800667650001000685650002500695653001900720653001900739700001500758700001800773773009300791852000900884930003300893945001300926946001100939655001200950IND2040177420221117203235.0940609e199311  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204017742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpringer, N.12aA 23S rRNA targeted specific hybridization probe for Bradyrhizobium japonicum  ap. 468-470.  aThe complete nucleotide sequences of 23S rRNA genes from Bradyrhizobium japonicum DSM 30131 and from closely related Rhodopseudomonas palustris DSM 126 were determined.

The reviewed studies do not offer a consensus regarding the verification or falsification of the rational expectation hypotheses in agricultural markets. Small sample sizes and the low power of statistical tests in the presence of alternative expectation hypothesis contribute to the variability in conclusions. An additional and confounding source of the variability is specification searching. With a wide variability in specifications, divergent results are to be expected. Despite the lack of consensus, rational expectations modeling aimproved our knowledge of both expectation formation in agricultural markets, and the processes of agricultural market equilibrium and price determination. 3aagricultural economics 3aeconomic theory 3aeconometric models 3amarkets 0aliterature reviews1 aThraen, C.S.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1994 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.133-158x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01868naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010500123300001300228500001500241520072300256650001700979650002200996650001601018650002001034650001601054650002901070651001301099653001701112653002901129653002601158653001701184653001801201653001201219653002201231653002501253700001301278773008701291852000901378930003301387945001301420946001301433655001201446IND2041698420221117202709.0940830e199401  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204169842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLohr, L.10aDiscrete/continuous choices in contingent valuation surveys: soil conservation decisions in Michigan  ap. 1-15.  a2019-12-05  aA discrete/continuous model of participation in environmental programs is developed. A conditional expectation correction model is used to overcome the selectivity bias inherent in single-equation approaches used to describe participation. The two-equation model proposed explicitly recognizes the linkage between the discrete decision (participate or not) and the continuous decision (level of participation for enrollees). This approach yields a measure of willingness to accept payment for program participation that is not obtainable when level of participation alone is considered. A moel using contingent valuation survey data assessing participation in the filter strip program in Michigan serves as an example. 3afarm surveys 3asoil conservation 3aland policy 3afarm management 3aland values 3aenvironmental protection 3aMichigan 0arental costs 0asingle equation analysis 0awillingness to accept 0avalue theory 0aparticipation 0aacreage 0adecision analysis 0aprogram participants1 aPark, T.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1994 Jan., v. 16, no. 1 p.1-15x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02802naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001600200520188600216650002702102650002302129650001302152650002902165650002502194651001802219653001502237653002202252653001202274653001902286773009102305852000902396930003302405945001302438946001302451655001202464IND2054721120221117202708.0970102e199509  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205472112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerry, G.M.10aObjective measures of Ph.D. program quality in agricultural economics  ap. 245-408.  aMany studies have ranked graduate programs in agricultural economics. Most have relied on departmental publications, publication records of graduates, or subjective assessments. This study focuses on four measures of quality for 18 of the top Ph.D. programs in the United States. These four quality measures are: (1) Graduate Record Exam (ORE) and undergraduate grade point average (GPA) scores of students recently entering these Ph.D. programs; (2) refereed journal articles of faculty during the 1991 to 1992 period; (3) rankings provided by current Ph.D. students of 14 different aspects of their graduate program; and (4) placement data for graduates between 1991 and 1993. Twelve of the 18 departments provided GRE and GPA data for their students. Based on these data, students at UC-Berkeley and Cornell ranked substantially above students at the other schools. Florida students also ranked high, but a small sample size renders this conclusion more tenuous. Survey results for the other six schools suggest Michigan State and Stanford students may also belong in this group of three. The remaining schools were similar. UC-Berkeley, Iowa State, Minnesota, and Ohio State had the greatest number of publications per faculty member. Iowa State was the top program in terms of articles in economics journals, with Minnesota and Ohio State faculty leading the publication output in noneconomics journals. Graduate students at Maryland, Michigan State, and Purdue seemed most satisfied with their programs. Graduate student placements in academic institutions were highest (in percentage terms) for graduates of Oregon State and Penn State. Cornell, Florida, Maryland, and Ohio State placed 50 percent or more of their domestic students in government or institute positions. A greater percentage of international graduates were placed in government and private sector positions. 3aagricultural economics 3aeducation programs 3ateachers 3aemployment opportunities 3aacademic achievement 3aUnited States 0aevaluation 0aachievement tests 0aquality 0agraduate study0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 Sept., v. 17, no. 3 p.245-408x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01625naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008200126300001400208500001500222520057600237650000900813650001800822650001000840650001800850650002400868650002300892651001800915651001000933653001000943653006600953653002601019653002201045700001601067773008801083852000901171930003301180945001301213946001301226655001201239IND2041700920221117202750.0940830e199401  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204170092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayne, T.S.14aThe effect of risk on price levels and margins in international wheat markets  ap. 63-73.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of price risk on equilibrium price levels and marketing margins in U.S.-Japan wheat trade are analyzed in ths article.

Due to loopholes, they have been ineffective in restricting direct payments to producers. Nevertheless, considerable interest continues for legislation to effectively cap program payments, and proposals are expected to surface in the 1995 farm bill debate. Because of the ineffectiveness of past legislation, the impact of payment limits on supply response has not been addressed previously. However, past failures do not preclude the possibility of new legislation being effective in the future. This article develops a simple graphical model of supply impacts that would be caused by legislation that effectively limits farm program payments to individual producers. The analysis contrasts the supply curve under government intervention with that under a free market. The impact on the "intervention" supply curve from an effective payment limitation is assessed, both for firms stratified by size and for the aggregate. Consideration is also given to the effects of alternative loan rates, target prices, acreage reduction provisions, and types of government payments subject to limitation. The analysis both benefits from and is limited by its simplicity. Its graphical approach makes it accessible to all readers. However, it lacks the formality of mathematical rigor, and no empirical analysis is included. Despite these limitations, it is clearly determined that an appropriately imposed payment limit could shift portions of the aggregate supply curve to the left and could be effective as a supply control mechanism. In addition, even if the market supply curve is linear, an effective payment limitation would introduce several kinks and nonlinearities into the effective supply curve. Hypotheses are also generated that will be relevant for subsequent empirical testing, one of which provides a possible explanation why some firms move in and out of farm programs. 3amathematical models 3aownership 3afarms 3aUnited States 0alaws and regulations 0agraphical models 0asupply functions 0adeficiency payments 0asupply response 0atarget prices1 aSmith, E.G.1 aRichardson, J.W.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 May, v. 17, no. 2 p.104-191x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03057naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004400125300001600169520201600185650001602201650001202217650002202229650002302251650003902274650002202313650002502335653003402360653001602394653002002410653002402430653002102454700002102475700001802496773008902514852000902603930003302612945001302645946001302658655001202671IND2055051420221117202952.0970125e199505  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205505142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, A.W.10aFarm-level impacts of revenue assurance  ap. 103-183.  aThe United States has a 60 year tradition of government intervention in stabilizing farm prices and incomes. The issue of government intervention has been complicated in recent years by increasing budget pressure, and the debate is certain to continue with the onset of the 1995 "Farm Bill." The purpose of this research is to compare the current farm program to two alternative revenue assurance programs in terms of stability and support of producer revenues and the associated level of government costs. A simulation model is developed to estimate distributions of producer returns and government costs under the current program and two revenue assurance programs. Stochastic national yields and prices are used along with individual producer yields to generate producer receipts from the market place. The simulation model is run to develop the distributions of producer returns and government costs for eight different farms including an Iowa dryland feed grain farm, a Texas Northern Plains irrigated feed grain farm, a Texas Rolling Plains dryland cotton farm, a Kansas dryland wheat farm, a Colorado dryland wheat farm, a California irrigated cotton farm, a Texas rice farm, and an Arkansas rice farm. The yield parameters and crop mixes were developed through interviews with producers in each of the eight regions. The initial results indicate that the current program is the most efficient at stabilizing producer returns when the primary source of revenue instability is price variability. At 90 percent, the revenue assurance plan stabilizes producer returns best when the primary source of revenue instability is yield variability. Other results indicate that a 70 percent revenue assurance guarantee would provide the lowest government cost. The current program provides the most revenue support and stability, but at the highest cost. A revenue assurance guarantee at 90 percent indicates that some common ground between government costs and farm revenue stability and support may be obtainable. 3afarm income 3afunding 3acosts and returns 3afederal government 3agovernmental programs and projects 3asimulation models 3aprobability analysis 0aagricultural financial policy 0acomparisons 0aproducer prices 0aagricultural prices 0agovernment costs1 aRichardson, J.W.1 aMcClaskey, J.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 May, v. 17, no. 2 p.103-183x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02219naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007200127300001300199520144800212650002401660650002701684650002701711650002601738653002201764773008701786852000901873930003301882945001301915946001301928655001201941IND2048508620221117203023.0951030e199501  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204850862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, S.C.10aRemembering the role of research in developing a university student  ap. 7-11.  aBeattie and Watts recently asserted that "a distinguishing characteristic of university professors should be a continuing commitment to active participation in research in support of their principal function, teaching". This thesis is also appropriate for undergraduate students who, upon graduation, should value the research attitude, process, and product. Agricultural economists have traditionally been liaisons between agriculture, business, economics, and government. They have also functioned as teaching liaisons connecting students to the importance of economic reasoning. The teaching function should encourage a change in a student's perception to include a belief that continuous learning is a crucial ingredient to a successful life. A crucial step to changing students' perceptions is to introduce them to the research process. Thus, a senior research paper is an appropriate requirement of every university undergraduate. Several avenues are available to accomplish the above requirement. These include papers within a class, departmental research projects, and departmental competitions similar to the Student Paper Competition of the Student Section of the American Agricultural Economics Association. Based on current events, it is especially important for agricultural economics departments to graduate economically literate students as it appears they will be severely tested as citizens of the United States and the world. 3aeducational methods 3aagricultural economics 3aagricultural education 3aagricultural research 0aapplied economics0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.7-11x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02756naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006600124300001400190520182700204650002302031650001702054650002502071650001902096650002502115650001402140650002302154650001302177651001802190653001902208653002302227773008802250852000902338930003302347945001302380946001302393655001202406IND2048509120221117203032.0951030e199501  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204850912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFox, J.A.10aDeterminants of consumer acceptability of bovine somatotropin  ap. 51-62.  aBovine somatotropin (bST), a growth hormone that boosts milk production in dairy cows, was introduced in February, 1994 when a Congressional moratorium on commercial sales expired. Much of the research on bST has focused on the effects of additional production on the viability of small dairy farms, and on the cost of supporting prices in the dairy sector. Less attention has been given to potential impacts on consumer demand for dairy products; most studies assume that demand will be unchanged. The potential impact on demand has been investigated in consumer surveys, some of which suggested reductions in milk consumption of up to 20 percent in the event of bST being approved. Surveys, however, are hypothetical and subject to many biases. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of bST on milk demand in a non-hypothetical setting. Randomly-selected participants (undergraduate students) at four locations were given a glass of "bST milk," i.e., milk produced by a cow treated with bST. They were then given the opportunity to bid in an auction for a glass of typical milk. Participants were paid $18 under the condition that they had to drink a glass of milk at the end of the auction. The winning bidder paid for the option of drinking the typical milk, while all other participants were required to drink their glasses of bST milk. Additional information, which informed participants that "bST milk" was no different from typical milk, was introduced half way through the experiment. This information caused: (1) bids for typical milk to fall; and (2) female participants to be less likely to bid for typical milk than males. The results indicate that about 15 percent of participants would pay a substantial premium to avoid bST milk, pointing to a profitable niche market for "bST-free" milk. 3aconsumer attitudes 3asomatotropin 3aconsumer preferences 3adairy products 3astatistical analysis 3aequations 3awillingness to pay 3aauctions 3aUnited States 0amilk marketing 0asealed-bid auction0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1995 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.51-62x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01579naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245002500128300001600153520079200169650001200961650001700973650002400990651001801014653001301032653001101045653003301056700001701089773009101106852000901197930003301206945001301239946001301252655001201265IND2044188920221117203025.0950120e199409  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204418892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnutson, R.D.10aExtension's decline?  ap. 465-475.  aThe perception that extension funding has materially declined is not borne out in aggregate U.S. funding data. However, many states experienced substantial reductions in real terms in 1992 and 1993. The pattern of reductions appears to be most extensive in the East, South, and West and in states dependent on extractive industries, although major agricultural states are not immune. In a time of tighter budgets, one might question the extension strategy of continually broadening its clientele. Extension may be better served by concentrating in areas of comparative advantage where experiment station research results serve as crucial input to extension programs in agriculture, forestry, and consumer/family sciences. County support is argued to be crucial to survival of the system. 3afunding 3auniversities 3aextension education 3aUnited States 0aprograms 0atrends 0aland-grant univeristy system1 aOutlaw, J.L.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1994 Sept., v. 16, no. 3 p.465-475x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19950203b19950222c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02326naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245012700171300001600298520119400314650002601508650001501534650001701549650002501566650002001591650001201611650002001623653002301643653003201666700002001698700001401718700001701732773006001749852000901809856007801818939003301896946001101929655001201940IND9204446520221117202953.0920715s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444652DNAL7 a241779732pmid7 a10.1007/BF002016302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStich, K.10aEnzymatic conversion of dihydroflavonols to flavan-3,4-diols using flower extracts of Dianthus caryophyllus L.

The instability in the variegated strain involves the same step and is obviously caused by the multiple allele a(var). In confirmation of these results, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase activity could be demonstrated in enzyme extracts from cyanic flowers and cyanic parts of variegated flowers but not in preparations from acyanic flowers or acyanic parts. The enzyme catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of (+)dihydrokaempferol to (+)-3,4-leucopelargonidin with NADPH as cofactor. A pH optimum around 7.0 and a temperature optimum at 30 degrees C was determined, but the reduction reaction also proceeded at low temperatures. (+)Dihydroquercetin and (+)dihydromyricetin were also reduced to the respective flavan-3,4-cis-diols by the enzyme preparations from carnation flowers, and were even better substrates than dihydrokaempferol. 3aDianthus caryophyllus 3aflavonoids 3abiosynthesis 3abiochemical pathways 3aenzyme activity 3aalleles 3aoxidoreductases 0agenetic regulation 0adihydroflavonol 4-reductase1 aEidenberger, T.1 aWurst, F.1 aForkmann, G.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 1 p.103-108x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002016303Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03129naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245011300172300001400285500001500299520196100314650002402275650001502299650002502314650002502339650002502364650001202389650002502401650001802426650001102444653002402455653002102479700001402500700001602514773005802530852000902588856007802597939003302675946001102708655001202719IND9204445420221117203037.0920715s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444542DNAL7 a241779622pmid7 a10.1007/BF002016192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlovik, S.10aCompartmental distribution and redistribution of abscisic acid in intact leaves. I. Mathematical formulation  ap. 14-25.  a2019-12-04  aUsing experimental information obtained in earlier studies on the permeabilities of mesophyll and guard-cell membranes to abscisic acid (ABA), and on stress-induced pH shifts in the apoplasm and in symplasmic compartments (Hartung et al., 1988, Plant Physiol. 86, 908-913; Hartung et al. 1990, BPGRG Monogr. 215-235), a mathematical model is presented which will permit computer analysis of the stress-induced redistribution of ABA amongst different leaf cell types (mesophyll, epidermis, guard cells, phloem cells) and their compartments (cell wall, cytosol, chloroplast stroma, vacuole). Metabolism and conjugation of ABA and its transport in the xylem and the phloem are also taken into consideration. We ask whether the stress-induced redistribution of ABA is fast and intensive enough to induce stomatal closure within a few minutes. The model can be adapted to any other weak acid or base, e.g. to other phytohormones (auxins, gibberellins), which differ from ABA, e.g. by their membrane conductances, anion permeabilities and pKa values. Our whole-leaf model can predict the time course and the compartmentation of, for example, phytohormone concentrations as a function of changing source-sink patterns (e.g. by compartmental pH shifts in the leaf lamina). An analysis of the present knowledge of the ABA physiology of leaves and studies on stress effects are presented in subsequent publications. In this communication we describe the whole-leaf model and present and discuss all necessary morphological (volumes, surfaces etc.) and physiological (pH, membrane conductances etc.) parameters of an unstressed leaf of Valerianella locusta L. We draw fundamental conclusions by comparing determined and calculated ABA concentrations in the leaf-cell compartments. We found that the model predictions are close to measured data, and we conclude that in unstressed leaves ABA is close to flux equilibrium amongst the different tissues and compartments. 3amathematical models 3ametabolism 3astomatal conductance 3aspatial distribution 3aValerianella locusta 3adrought 3abiochemical pathways 3aabscisic acid 3aleaves 0acomputer simulation 0aplant physiology1 aBaier, M.1 aHartung, W.0 tPlanta.g1992, v. 187, no. 1 p.14-25x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002016193Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02397naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014400128300001800272500015400290520108500444650002601529650002101555650002001576650003301596650002601629650002301655650002601678650001101704650001201715650001101727650001501738650002501753650001401778650002001792700002001812700001801832773008201850852000901932939003301941946001301974655001201987IND9204445120221117203209.0920716s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920444512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacques, D.J.14aThe effect of calcium spray on leaf and bract distortion, bound:unbound calcium ratio, and calcium distribution in two poinsettia cultivars  ap. 1391-1410.  aThis is a corrected copy of the same article that appeared in Journal of Plant Nutrition 14(7), 637-652, 1991, which appeared without several plates.  aTo determine if direct Ca sprays could affect the distribution and binding of Ca in the leaves and the severity of leaf/bract distortion in two varieties of poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherimma Willd.), we applied either 100 mg.l-1 or 400 mg.l-1 of Ca either one time or weekly to leaves of distortion-susceptible ('V-14 Glory') and nonsusceptible ('Annette Hegg Dark Red,' AHDR) cultivars. Only weekly spraying with 400 mg.l-1 Ca reduced distortion in V-14 plants, compared to controls or AHDR plants. Both bound and unbound Ca concentrations were higher in AHDR leaves than in V-14 leaves, but these differences were not correlated with distortion severity. EDX analysis demonstrated that distorted regions of V-14 leaves and bracts had lower Ca concentrations than did undistorted regions or AHDR leaves; weekly spraying with 400 mg.l-1 Ca produced relatively uniform leaf Ca distribution in V-14 leaves. Localized Ca deficiencies appear to produce the bract/leaf distortion in 'V-14 Glory' plants, and these deficiencies can be partially overcome by weekly Ca spray applications. 3aEuphorbia pulcherrima 3acalcium chloride 3afoliar spraying 3aplant diseases and disorders 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrient transport 3anutrient availability 3aleaves 3acalcium 3abracts 3aadsorption 3aspatial distribution 3acultivars 3amineral content1 aBoerner, R.E.J.1 aPeterson, JC.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1991, v. 14, no. 12 p.1391-1410x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02541naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007200127300001600199500001500215520110000230650001301330650001601343650001701359650002201376650002201398650002501420650002201445650003701467650001501504650002401519650002101543650002601564650002801590650002701618650002501645650002001670650002001690651001401710653001001724653002001734653002001754653002801774700001501802700001701817700001901834773009001853852000901943930003301952945001301985946001301998655001202011IND2061908320221117203211.0980218e199610  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206190832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOriade, C.A.12aA bioeconomic analysis of site-specific management for weed control  ap. 523-535.  a2019-12-05  aEnvironmental awareness concerning pesticide hazards is kindling interest in pest control strategies that are both environmentally friendly and profitable. One such strategy is site-specific management (SSM) for weed control. SSM prescribes spot application of pesticides based on the distribution of pest populations in the field rather than a single standard control applied to the entire field. This study examines the potential economic and environmental benefits of SSM as a weed control instrument, using a variant of the computer-based dynamic bioeconomic model, WEEDSIM. Simulations with the model were carried out within a dynamic but deterministic framework. Differences in model performance under SSM when compared to performance under standard practices impute value to SSM. Findings show that patchiness in weed distributions plays a key role in the usefulness of SSM as a weed control tool. SSM seems to be a promising tool for enhancing profit and reducing the environmental hazards of herbicide use once the technology for its implementation can be provided at a reasonable cost. 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3aweed control 3asimulation models 3aSetaria (Poaceae) 3aspatial distribution 3aChenopodium album 3aSinapis arvensis subsp. arvensis 3aherbicides 3aapplication methods 3acropping systems 3aprecision agriculture 3aPersicaria pensylvanica 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3aenvironmental impact 3aeconomic impact 3adecision making 3aMinnesota 0ausage 0afarm management 0acrop management 0aPolygonum pensylvanicum1 aKing, R.P.1 aForcella, F.1 aGunsolus, J.L.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.523-535x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02920naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009100130300001600221520186000237650002202097650002002119650002502139650001802164650002002182650001902202650001402221650002102235653002102256653002902277653004802306700001602354700001802370773009002388852000902478930003302487945001302520946001302533655001202546IND2061909620221117203156.0980218e199610  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206190962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernhardt, K.J.10aUsing cluster analysis to classify farms for conventional/alternative systems research  ap. 599-611.  aA multidisciplinary project, Agriculture in Concert with the Environment, is being conducted at the University of Nebraska. The project's goals are to use a farming systems approach to estimate and compare economic, environmental, and sociological performance/characteristics of conventional versus alternative production systems. Although a systems approach is often advocated, operationalizing initial classification of farm systems can be problematic. This is especially true in a multidisciplinary project where incentives for team members' active involvement are influenced by the appropriateness of methods and results for disciplinary publication. The initial classification of farming system observational units has to be robust enough to withstand critical review of each discipline. This study describes problems of classifying observational units for multidisciplinary conventional versus alternative agriculture research and presents cluster analysis, along with other farming systems concepts, to solve the problem. Farming systems research recognizes that decisions are made for a "system" of reasons and economic, environmental, and sociological outcomes result from a "system" of factors. The approach meets many objectives of a multidisciplinary team studying conventional versus alternative production systems -- fields for the soil scientist, economic flows for the economist, and people for the sociologist. However, standards for operationalizing this type of research effort are not well developed. The article describes the specific classification goals that team members had, how well cluster analysis met those goals, and the solution to various problems encountered. The final grouping is based on 59 cropping variables cluster analyzed into five groups ranging from an irrigated monocrop corn system to one that is near organic. 3aresearch projects 3aeconomic impact 3aenvironmental impact 3asocial impact 3afarm management 3aclassification 3aequations 3acluster analysis 0asystems approach 0afarming systems research 0aagriculture in concert with the environment1 aAllen, J.C.1 aHelmers, G.A.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.599-611x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03086naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008500127300001600212500001500228520195900243650000902202650001602211650002002227650001302247650000902260650002302269650001502292650002302307650002002330651001802350653002002368653002002388653001102408653002002419653002002439700001802459700001702477773009002494852000902584930003302593945001302626946001302639655001202652IND2061908920221117203234.0980218e199610  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206190892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckman, D.T.10aFactors effecting written marketing plan adoption by large-scale grain producers  ap. 565-574.  a2019-12-05  aWritten marketing plans are receiving increased attention from producers and others as a means of guiding producers' marketing decisions. This study analyzed the adoption of written marketing plans by participants in the 1994 Top Farmer Crop Workshop held at Purdue University. Although not a random sample of farmers, these large-scale producers may provide information about the potential for marketing plan use by commercial farmers. Nearly 45 percent of respondents used written marketing plans in their farm operations. Producers with written marketing plans forward priced more of their expected 1994 production and had higher price objectives for 1994 crops. Producers with written marketing plans were also willing to price more of their production at any one time. However, producers with written marketing plans had not received significantly higher prices for their crops. Similar results were obtained from a smaller survey in 1995. A logit model, estimated with maximum likelihood procedures, was used to analyze factors affecting whether an individual producer has a written marketing plan. Few producer and farm characteristics expected to affect marketing plan adoption were statistically significant. Age of the operator, debt-to-asset ratio, and number of decision makers were significant. Self-assessed marketing skills, education, attitude toward losses, and use of marketing consultants were not significant. It was unclear whether written marketing plans were a complement to or a substitute for a producer's marketing skills. Written marketing plans do not automatically have positive effects for producers. Price enhancement aspects may be especially difficult for producers to achieve. Furthermore, many variables expected to affect marketing plan adoption have both complementary and substitutional effects on producers' marketing behavior. Recognition of these aspects of behavior can focus future research on their separation. 3arisk 3alarge farms 3afarm management 3asoybeans 3acorn 3alinear programming 3acash crops 3afarmers' attitudes 3adecision making 3aUnited States 0aprice formation 0aproducer prices 0agrains 0aforward trading 0amarket planning1 aPatrick, G.F.1 aMusser, W.N.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.565-574x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03008naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006400128300001600192500001500208520194800223650000902171650001602180650001102196650002002207650001302227650000902240650001002249650002502259650001502284650002302299650002202322651001102344653002102355653001402376653002002390700001802410773009002428852000902518930003302527945001302560946001302573655001202586IND2061909220221117203249.0980218e199610  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206190922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoodwin, B.K.13aAn analysis of marketing frequency by Kansas crop producers  ap. 575-584.  a2019-12-05  aRecent research focused on producers' adoption of forward and futures pricing methods. This research examines a different aspect of producer's marketing practices -- how often they market their crops. Market advisory firms depend on producers willing to frequently market portions of their crops. Those firms should be interested in this objective, which is to determine factors related to marketing frequency. A conceptual framework is developed for consideration of marketing frequency and its determinants. Several classes of information are identified as potentially important determinants. Using negative binomial regression models, appropriate for integer count data, the conceptual framework is used to evaluate marketing frequency of a sample of 572 Kansas crop producers. Kansas producers generally market each of their crops infrequently, typically two or three times per year. However, some annually market a crop as many as 20 times or more. In general, capital constraints, represented by leverage, increased irrigation, larger portions of farms being rented, and decreased profitability each led to decreased marketing frequency. Increased specialization towards crops led to increased marketing frequency. Partnerships marketed more often than sole proprietorships or corporations. Older, more experienced farmers marketed less often than younger farmers. Generally, time spent reading farm publications was positively associated with marketing frequency. Producers' risk attitudes had little effect on their marketing frequencies. Overall, several robust determinants of marketing frequency were found -- information that should aid marketing advisory services in targeting producers who purchase their marketing advice. However, this study applies to Kansas. Farmers in other regions less dependent on wheat, with fewer commercial feedlots than Kansas, or that are closer to major terminals may market their crops differently. 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aprices 3afarm management 3asoybeans 3acorn 3awheat 3aprobability analysis 3acrop yield 3aeconometric models 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3aKansas 0acrop enterprises 0amarketing 0aforward trading1 aKastens, T.L.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Oct., v. 18, no. 4 p.575-584x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03003naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005700125300001400182520202900196650000902225650003902234650002002273650001302293650001902306650001802325650002302343651000902366653002502375653002402400700001502424700001802439700001602457773008802473852000902561930003302570945001302603946001302616655001202629IND2061003020221117202411.0971222e199601  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206100302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaxter, S.10aCorn program participation and farm program opinions  ap. 43-51.  aA national debate is occurring on whether to reduce and/or eliminate the programs that provide income deficiency payments to farmers. Participation in these programs is voluntary. Therefore, the impacts of downsizing the deficiency payment programs will be greatest for those farmers who currently participate. Past studies of farm program participation have included neither the conceptually-important variable, profitability of participation, nor the potential interrelationship between participation and opinion toward farm programs. This study addresses both omissions. Data from a 1991 survey of Ohio farmers are used to jointly analyze their: decisions to participate in the corn program and opinions toward farm programs. Empirical results imply that a recursive system exists in which a farmer first determines whether to participate, then forms an opinion on farm programs. The probability of participation is found to increase as owned corn base acres increase, percent of total corn acres rented increases, share of total farm sales from milk decreases, break-even price between nonparticipation and participation increases, and the debt-to-asset ratio increases. Thus, reducing or eliminating the corn program will have a greater impact on farms that are larger, do not sell milk, and are more leveraged. The finding on break-even price implies that farmers who will lose the most are those with the highest variable costs of production and the highest farm program yield relative to expected yield. The finding on the debt-to-asset ratio supports arguments that reducing farm programs will cause farms to adjust how risk is handled. All farm structure variables that significantly affect participation also significantly affect farm program opinion. In contrast, characteristics of the farmers, as represented by age and education, do not influence participation, but do influence farm program opinion. Economic self-interest as measured by break-even price, is marginally insignificant with respect to opinion. 3acorn 3agovernmental programs and projects 3adecision making 3aland use 3apublic opinion 3aprofitability 3afarmers' attitudes 3aOhio 0aprogram participants 0adeficiency payments1 aZulauf, C.1 aSchnitkey, G.1 aForster, L.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.43-51x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02924naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245011800121300001400239520174800253650001902001650002002020650001602040650002202056650001502078650001502093650002002108650001802128650001802146650003902164650002502203650004002228650002302268651001302291653001602304700001402320700001202334773008802346852000902434930003302443945001302476946001302489655001202502IND2061003120221117202351.0971222e199601  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206100312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, F.10aEffects of distribution assumptions for sediment yields on farm returns in a chance-constrained programming model  ap. 53-64.  aThe statistical distribution assumed for factors being constrained in a chance-constrained programming (CCP) model can have important impacts. Normality is often implicitly, if not explicitly, assumed; however, it needs to be tested. The CCP model is utilized to evaluate the optimal farming systems (FSs) for reducing sediment yields at the watershed scale for two probability distributions (nominal and lognormal) of sediment yields. The choice of an appropriate CCP model for farming system selection depends on this probability distribution. The CCP framework is used to quantify the impacts of FS changes using data from experimental results for the Missouri Management Systems Evaluation Area, or MSEA. Assuming a normal distribution for sediment delivery coefficients when the actual distribution is lognormal generates biased results. The CCP model using the normal distribution consistently underestimates the total net returns to land and management in the watershed when the deterministic equivalent of a chance constraint becomes binding. The marginal effects on net returns (i.e., reductions in net returns) are over-estimated when the normal distribution is used and the underlying distribution is lognormal. Policy implications are twofold. First, net returns with a lognormal distribution are not as low as with a normal distribution when using a CCP model. Second, if subsidies are needed to achieve water quality improvements, then the magnitude of the subsidies may not be as high with a lognormal distribution as with a normal distribution when using a CCP model. Future studies on applied research using CCP should be cautious about the bias of assuming a normal distribution when the underlying distribution is lognormal. 3asediment yield 3afarming systems 3afarm income 3acosts and returns 3acrop yield 3awatersheds 3afarm management 3aprofitability 3awater quality 3agovernmental programs and projects 3aprobability analysis 3aManagement Systems Evaluation Areas 3alinear programming 3aMissouri 0aconstraints1 aPrato, T.1 aZhu, M.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.53-64x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02957naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006100127300001400188520196500202650000902167650001302176650001802189650002002207650002402227650002102251650001602272650000902288651001802297653002502315653002002340653002002360700001802380700001702398773008802415852000902503930003302512945001302545946001302558655001202571IND2061003220221117202328.0971222e199601  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206100322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusser, W.N.10aRisk and grain marketing behavior of large-scale farmers  ap. 65-77.  aPre-harvest marketing techniques to reduce price and income risk are receiving greater attention in response to greater globalization of agricultural markets and reductions in government stabilization programs. Past research has found farmers' uses of these techniques are much lower than "optimal" hedging strategies. This article examines the relationship between farm characteristics and the use of forward pricing techniques by large-scale Midwestern corn and soybean producers. Data for the study were obtained from a survey of pre-harvest marketing behavior, farm characteristics, and risk attitudes of participants in the 1993 Top Farmer Crop Workshop at Purdue University. The maximum percentage that producers would consider marketing by August 1 was about 59 percent for both corn and soybeans. They reported that they had marketed about 24 and 39 percent of expected 1993 corn and soybean production, respectively, by July 15, 1993. The study used Tobit regression techniques to determine the factors that affected farmers' pre-harvest marketing behavior. Results were mixed. Only dummy variables for the use of options or minimum-price contracts and for the use of hedges had positive significant coefficients for all equations. Yield variability, percent of income from government payments, and a variable related to prospect theory were not significant in any of the equations. Age, education, gross income, location and futures price expectations were significantly related to the percent corn marketed in 1993. The maximum percent of corn marketed by August 1 was significantly related to percent of income from livestock and futures price expectations. Farm location significantly affected the percent soybeans marketed in 1993, while the maximum percent marketed was significantly related to the debt/asset ratio. A safety-first risk attitude toward the losses variable significantly affected the maximum percent marketed of both commodities. 3acorn 3asoybeans 3amarket prices 3acrop production 3aregression analysis 3acommercial farms 3alarge farms 3arisk 3aUnited States 0amarketing techniques 0acharacteristics 0aforward trading1 aPatrick, G.F.1 aEckman, D.T.0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.65-77x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02366naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006200125300001600187520156400203650001301767650001101780650002001791650001801811650002501829650000901854651001401863653001701877773009001894852000901984930003301993945001302026946001302039655001202052IND2061003520221117202344.0971222e199601  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206100352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuhr, B.L.10aHedging Holstein steers in the live cattle futures market  ap. 103-114.  aFinishing Holstein steers for beef has become common largely because the market for veal, which was the primary use of dairy calves in the past, has contracted. In addition, changes in consumer preferences for leaner meat products have made beef from finished Holstein steers more acceptable. Other desirable production characteristics of raising Holstein steers include uniform growth rates and carcass composition. However, significant cash price differences between finished Holstein steers and traditional beef breeds exist. These price differences reflect yield and quality differences of Holstein steers compared to beef steers. This study investigates whether these cash price differences affect the risk reduction potential for hedging Holstein steers compared to hedging beef-type steers in the live cattle futures market. Hedging Holstein steers represents a form of cross-hedging when using the live cattle futures market, and this may result in differences in hedging risk and hedging ratios for Holstein steers compared to their beef breed counterparts. Hedge ratios and hedge riskiness are calculated and compared for finished Holstein steers and finished beef-type steers using cash prices observed in the South St. Paul terminal market for the years 1988 to 1994. Hedge ratios between Holstein and beef steers do not differ significantly, and the riskiness of hedging is similar for Holstein steers and beef-type steers. Hence, Holstein steer feeders may find hedging in the live cattle futures markets a useful tool for price risk protection. 3aHolstein 3asteers 3afutures trading 3amarket prices 3astatistical analysis 3arisk 3aMinnesota 0acash markets0 tReview of agricultural economics.g1996 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.103-114x1058-71957nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle02208naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013000127300001600257500001500273520108700288650001601375650000801391650002901399650001601428650001201444650001801456650001801474653002601492653001801518653001701536653002801553653003701581700001801618700001501636773009301651852000901744930003301753945001301786946001101799655001201810IND2124283520221117202848.0980727e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212428352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumov, G.I.10aGenetic study of natural introgression supports delimination of biological species in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex  ap. 595-601.  a2019-12-05  aWine Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains having high nDNA/nDNA homology with sibling species S. paradoxus or S. bayanus (RODRIGUES DE SOUSA Ct al.

Oligonucleotide primers targeted to the L. sanfrancisco 16S rRNA gene sequence provided a means of easily differentiating these lactic acid bacteria from other microorganisms including those naturally occurring in sourdough and closely related species. A 1460 bp region of 16S rRNA gene was specifically amplified when either purified DNA or whole cells of L. sanfrancisco strains were used. The identity of PCR product was confirmed by nested PCR and restriction analysis. PCR assays on DNA extracted from sourdough samples allowed the detection of less than 10 cells within 6 hours. The procedure established is sensitive, specific, simple and rapid, therefore it can be considered a valuable tool for monitoring L. sanfrancisco in mixed microbial populations. 3aLactobacillus 3aribosomal RNA 3aDNA 3adetection 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3adough 0aidentification 0agenbank/763271 aTorriani, S.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 Nov., v. 20, no. 4 p.640-644x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02487naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006900129300001600198500001500214520104500229650002301274650001801297650001501315650001101330650001401341650001401355650002501369650002501394650001601419650001901435650001801454650001201472653002801484653001601512653001701528653002801545653002801573653002601601653002501627653002701652700001801679700001701697700002201714700001501736700001601751700001901767773009301786852000901879930003301888945001301921946001101934655001201945IND2124283320221117202816.0980727e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212428332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrillinger, H.10aNew species of Fellomyces isolated from Epiphytic lichen species  ap. 572-584.  a2019-12-05  aFive new species of Fellomyces, F. borneensis, F. chinensis, F. lichenicola, F. sichuanensis, and F. thailandicus isolated from lichens growing on tree barks are described. Species delimitation was performed using RAPD-PCR and partial sequencing of ribosomal DNA. A fragment of 385 nucleotides, corresponding to the gene position 547 through 931 of the 18S rDNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used. Based on phylogenetic data it was not possible to separate the ballistosporous genus Kockovaella from the sterigma forming genus Fellomyces. Species reproduce by enteroblastic budding or by forming one or more conidia on sterigmata per cell. Sterigmatoconidia are delivered by an end break in distal position of the sterigmata. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the major ubiquinone component in all species. The presence of xylose in purified yeast cell walls was characteristic for all strains investigated. It was not possible to separate the five different Fellomyces species by phenotypic criteria of the physiological standard characterization only. 3asequence alignment 3aribosomal DNA 3aphysiology 3ayeasts 3aphylogeny 3aepiphytes 3anucleotide sequences 3acell wall components 3anew species 3afungal anatomy 3achemotaxonomy 3alichens 0afellomyces sichuanensis 0acomparisons 0adescriptions 0afellomyces thailandicus 0amolecular sequence data 0afellomyces borneensis 0afellomyces chinensis 0afellomyces lichenicola1 aKraepelin, G.1 aLopandic, K.1 aSchweigkofler, W.1 aMolnar, O.1 aWeigang, F.1 aDreyfuss, M.M.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 Nov., v. 20, no. 4 p.572-584x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02928naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009400127300001600221520199000237650001802227650002302245650001502268650000802283650001902291650001502310650002402325653001602349653001702365700001702382700002002399773009302419852000902512930003302521945001302554946001102567655001202578IND2124283020221117202913.0980727e199711  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212428302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlum, S.A.E.10aMechanism of retarded DNA degradation and prokaryotic origin of DNase in nonsterile soils  ap. 513-521.  aDNA released from organisms exits at considerable quantities in water, sediment and soil. Such DNA can serve as genetic information for transformable bacteria. It is not clear so far how DNA persists in an environment such as soil where DNase activity is present. The fate of linear duplex DNA (41.5 kbp) introduced into non-sterile soil microcosms was followed by monitoring the distribution of DNA to solid and liquid soil constituents and by measuring the degradation of DNA in each of the two fractions by DNases produced by microorganisms indigenous to the soils. Three non-sterile soils collected from agricultural field plots including a brown earth, a loamy soil and a podzol were examined using [3H]-thymidine-labeled DNA. Depending on the soil type, DNA adsorption reached an equilibrium within 1 to 3 h at 23 degrees C. The capacity of the three soils to bind DNA (>13 micrograms per g of soil) was sufficiently high to adsorb the total DNA of the microbial community living in them. The introduced DNA distributed between the solids and the liquid phase in soil-specific proportions. Kinetic analysis indicated that introduced DNA remaining non-adsorbed was rapidly rendered acid-soluble (within 24 h at 23 degrees C). In contrast, a large portion of the DNA that bound to the soil particulate material was of high molecular size (up to several kbp) still 5 days after introduction as determined by Southern transfer hybridization. The observations indicate that adsorption of DNA on solid soil components and the concomitant protection against DNases is the mechanism of DNA persistence in soil. Upon hydration of dry soil in the microcosms it was observed that growth of prokaryotes was associated with increased DNase activity in the interstitial soil solution. Suppression of growth by rifampicin and chloramphenicol, but not by cycloheximide, prevented the appearance of DNases. This suggests growing prokaryotes as the main producers of DNases in the soil microcosms. 3asoil bacteria 3aagricultural soils 3aloam soils 3aDNA 3abiodegradation 3aadsorption 3adeoxyribonuclease I 0apersistence 0abrown earths1 aLorenz, M.G.1 aWackernagel, W.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g1997 Nov., v. 20, no. 4 p.513-521x0723-20207nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle01382naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008300130300001600213500001500229520045800244650002000702650002400722650001600746650002500762650002600787650002100813651001800834653001500852700001800867773009100885852000900976930003300985945001301018946001301031655001201044IND2044186620221117202409.0950120e199409  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204418662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNayga, R.M.

In theory, concerted evolution homogenizes multicopy genes so that little or no variation exists within populations or individuals. However, contrary to theory, ITS variation has been confirmed in populations and individuals from a diverse range of eukaryotes. The presence of intraspecific and intra-individual variation in multicopy genes has important implications for ecological and phylogenetic studies, yet relatively little is known about natural variation of these genes, particularly at the community level. In this study, we examined intraspecific and intra-sporocarp ITS variation by DNA sequencing from sporocarps and pooled roots from 68 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi collected at a single site in a Quercus woodland. We detected ITS variation in 27 species, roughly 40% of the taxa examined. Although intraspecific ITS variation was generally low (0.16–2.85%, mean = 0.74%), it was widespread within this fungal community. We detected ITS variation in both sporocarps and ectomycorrhizal roots, and variation was present within species of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, two distantly related lineages within the Fungi. We discuss the implications of such widespread ITS variability with special reference to DNA-based environmental sampling from diverse fungal communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiomycota 3aQuercus 3aanimals 3aconcerted evolution 3aectomycorrhizae 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungal communities 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintraspecific variation 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3awoodlands 2aAscomycotaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aMycorrhizaexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aQuercusxmicrobiology 0aCalifornia1 aDouhan, GregW.1 aRizzo, DavidM.0 tMycorrhiza.g2007 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.15-22dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58547x0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-007-0148-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02843naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010100170300001400271520148800285592002801773650002001801650002501821650002001846650002001866650002201886650001401908650002401922650001201946650002301958650001101981650002101992650000902013650001102022651003102033653001302064653002202077653002602099653003002125700002002155700002002175773009602195856008502291852000902376655001202385IND60770146820221122173147.0220929e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077014682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2022.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelkash, Madjid10aDiurnal landfill methane flux patterns across different seasons at a landfill in Southeastern US  ap. 76-86.  aDiurnal patterns of methane flux are examined at a landfill in the Southeastern US. Methane fluxes are measured by an eddy covariance (EC) tower during representative one-week periods in three seasons: summer, fall, and winter. Measured methane fluxes are compared with atmospheric pressure, temporal variation of atmospheric pressure, wind shear velocity, and air temperature. Landfill methane flux varies significantly with shear velocity and temporal changes in atmospheric pressure when the atmosphere is neutral. Under unstable atmospheric conditions, air temperature correlates best with methane flux, which is corroborated with an independent dataset of tracer correlation method (TCM) measurements for similar measurement periods. These field data support a mathematical model previously proposed to describe atmospheric effects on methane flux from landfills. The field data also indicate significant diurnal methane flux variations, with daytime fluxes up to 23 times greater than nighttime fluxes. Because the majority of historical TCM measurements of whole landfill methane flux are between 12 pm and 6 pm at this landfill, when daily emissions are highest because of atmospheric effects, average diurnal fluxes might have been overestimated by as much as 73%. Methane emissions are most representative of diurnal average emissions when atmospheric stability is near-neutral, which occurs in the late morning (∼11 am) and in the early evening (∼5 pm) at this site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3adata collection 3aeddy covariance 3afriction velocity 3alandfills 3amathematical models 3amethane 3amethane production 3asummer 3awaste management 3awind 3awinter 3aSoutheastern United States 0aLandfill 0aFlux measurements 0aDiurnal flux patterns 0aMeteorological parameters1 aChow, Fotini K.1 aImhoff, Paul T.0 tWaste management.g2022 May 01, v. 144 p.76-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2022.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013000167300001800297520196200315592002802277650002002305650001002325650001302335650001502348650001202363650000902375650001902384650001102403650001302414700002002427700001902447700001902466700002002485700005802505700006302563773013802626856008302764852000902847655001202856IND60780300020221118184702.0220618e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078030002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-022-04084-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Moo Chan14aThe Unstable Restorer-of-fertility locus in pepper (Capsicum annuum.

The use of cytoplasmic-genic male sterility (CGMS) systems greatly increases the efficiency of hybrid seed production. Although marker development and candidate gene isolation have been performed for the Restorer-of-fertility (Rf) gene in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), the broad use of CGMS systems has been hampered by the instability of fertility restoration among pepper accessions, especially sweet peppers, due to the widespread presence of the Unstable Restorer-of-fertility (Rfᵤ) locus. Therefore, to investigate the genetic factors controlling unstable fertility restoration in sweet peppers, we developed a segregation population (BC₄F₅) from crosses using a male-sterile line and an Rfᵤ-containing line. Segregation did not significantly deviate from a 3:1 ratio for unstable fertility restoration to sterility, indicating single dominant locus control for unstable fertility restoration in this population. Genetic mapping delimited the Rfᵤ locus to a 398 kb genomic region on chromosome 6, which is close to but different from the previously identified Rf-containing region. The Rfᵤ-containing region harbors a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) gene, along with 10 other candidate genes. In addition, this region is syntenic to the genomic region containing the largest number of Rf-like PPR genes in tomato. Therefore, the dynamic evolution of PPR genes might be responsible for both the restoration and instability of fertility in pepper. During genetic mapping, we developed various molecular markers, including one that co-segregated with Rfᵤ. These markers showed higher accuracy for genotyping than previously developed markers, pointing to their possible use in marker-assisted breeding of sweet peppers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amale sterility 3apepper 3atomatoes1 aKang, Hwa-Jeong1 aJung, So-Young1 aLee, Hae-Young1 aKang, Min-Young1 aJo, Yeong Deuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9018-73951 aKang, Byoung-Cheorl1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7606-72580 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2022 June, v. 135, no. 6 p.1923-1937dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-022-04084-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245008300159500001400242520105300256592002801309650001301337650001801350650001501368650001701383650002301400650001201423651001001435653001901445653002001464653001401484700002201498700001501520773011301535856007701648852000901725655001201734IND60727252920221122095843.0210308e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072725292DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e537862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Huayan10aNotes on the hosts of Trissolcus Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) from China  aNAL-light  aTrissolcus Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) is a cosmopolitan genus of egg-parasitoid wasps associated with stink bugs (Pentatomidae, Scutelleridae, Urostylididae), many of which are important insect pests.

In Indonesia with high rainfall, nutrient loss is still a major problem. The application of zeolite and manure as a soil amendment is expected to increase nutrients available in soil and cation exchange capacity of the soil in the long term. The results on the first planting season showed a significant increase in chemical soil fertility. The objective of this study is to research the effect of residue zeolite and manure on soil chemical fertility and yields of the second planting season. This study used a complete randomized block design. The factors were a dose of zeolite (Z1: 2.5 tons ha -1; Z2: 5 tons ha-1) and kind of manure (P1: quail manure; P2: cow manure), with three replications. The result showed that zeolite treatment of 5 tons ha-1 and cow manure increased the total N soil by 27.78% and 45.4% compared to the control. The treatment of quail manure increased soil organic matter 78.78% compared to the control. The treatment of cow manure increased the green bean yield 28.76% compared to the control.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlfisols 3acation exchange capacity 3acow manure 3agreen beans 3aorganic production 3aquails 3arain 3aresidual effects 3asoil amendments 3asoil fertility 3asoil organic matter 3asustainable agriculture 3atotal nitrogen 3azeolites 3aIndonesia 0aalfisol 0acation exchange capacity 0amanure 0aresidue 0azeolite1 aMinardi, Slamet1 aHartati1 aSyamsiyah, Jauhari0 tSains Tanah: Jurnal Penelitian Ilmu Tanah dan Agroklimatologi.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 2 p.181-190dSebelas Maret UniversitywJournal:27757x2356-14247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20961/stjssa.v16i2.301903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013400168520189700302592002802199653001402227653001302241653000802254653002202262653002502284700002102309700002002330700001602350700002002366700002502386700001302411700002002424700001502444773010402459856005002563852000902613655001202622IND60761691020221117233046.0220102e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076169102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prmcm.2021.1000022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalaimathi, K.10aMolecular docking and network pharmacology-based approaches to explore the potential of terpenoids for Mycobacterium tuberculosis  aMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is quickly countered by the host immune system; but, the pathogen is never eradicated. In this infection, 10% of infections are considered as open tuberculosis, while the remaining 90% are becoming latent, a state that can persist in the host for decades until immune control is lost. To date, more than 350 plant species have been studied in mycobacterial research.In this research, we used a mixture of software and database explorations to find the anti-mycobacterial possibilities of phytoconstituents. Maestro v12.7 and Cytoscape v3.8.0 were applied as software. In addition, the String v11.0, KEGG, Reactome and Pass Server databases assisted us in understanding TB cellular processes and phytoconstituent drug possibilities.The racemosol and pacharin have registered higher docking scores of 7.823 and -7.715 respectively. Furthermore, these compounds have substantial binding affinities in the active pocket of Mtb, and their docking metrics have consisted close to that of an approved drug (Rifampin). The network pharmacological exploration is also revealed possible connections with all of the TB-associated genes and other important signaling pathways.This computational study found that racemosol and pacharin were the safest anti-mycobacterial drugs for tuberculosis. Following comprehensive research of the pharmacological properties of racemosol and pacharin, we decided that this would be the first study to focus on anti-mycobacterial activity utilizing those compounds. Also, we believe that racemsosol and pacharin compounds will reveal potential actions when used in mycobacterial research. Furthermore, the derivatives of these compounds will be acted as possible drugs for tuberculosis and associated diseases. More pharmacological and toxicological explorations are required to have a better understanding of these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 0aRacemosol 0aPacharin 0aMtb 0aMolecular docking 0aNetwork pharmacology1 aThiyagarajan, G.1 aVijayakumar, S.1 aBhavani, K.1 aKarthikeyan, K.1 aMaria Jancy Rani, J.1 aDass, K.1 aSureshkumar, J.1 aPrabhu, S.0 tPharmacological research.g2021 Dec., v. 1 p.100002-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28563x2667-14257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prmcm.2021.100002  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245016500169300001600334520170300350536013002053592002802183650000902211650002102220650001102241650001002252650001902262650001502281650001602296650001102312700002402323700001702347700002202364700001802386700002202404700002202426700001902448773012502467856008002592852000902672655001202681IND60623552120221118232054.0181127e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062355212DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X145220482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuglielmini, Carlo10aDiagnostic accuracy of the vertebral heart score and other radiographic indices in the detection of cardiac enlargement in cats with different cardiac disorders  ap. 812-825.  aA retrospective search was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the vertebral heart score (VHS) and other related radiographic indices in the detection of cardiac enlargement associated with different cardiac disorders in the cat. One hundred and five cats with a complete echocardiographic examination and radiographic examination of the thorax with at least two orthogonal views were enrolled. Eighty-three cats had different cardiac disorders, 72 with left-sided cardiac disorders (LSCD) and 11 with right-sided cardiac disorders; 22 cats were free of cardiovascular abnormalities. Measurements of VHS and cardiac long and short axes on lateral (L) and dorsoventral or ventrodorsal radiographs were obtained. Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each radiographic index in differentiating between cats with cardiac disorders or cats with LSCD and cats without cardiac abnormalities and, among cats with LSCD, between those with no or mild left atrial enlargement (LAE) or those with moderate-to-severe LAE and healthy cats. The L-VHS at the cut-off of 7.9 had high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing cats with LSCD and moderate-to-severe LAE from healthy cats, but all the other radiographic indices were moderately accurate in distinguishing between cats with overall cardiac disorders or LSCD, either with no or mild LAE and moderate-to-severe LAE, and healthy cats. The considered radiographic indices were also moderately accurate in predicting different degrees of LAE in cats with LSCD. Radiographic indices are reasonably specific, but less sensitive predictors of cardiac enlargement in cats with heart disorders.  aFunding This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3aechocardiography 3agraphs 3aheart 3aheart diseases 3aprediction 3aradiography 3athorax1 aBaron Toaldo, Marco1 aPoser, Helen1 aMenciotti, Giulio1 aCipone, Mario1 aCordella, Alessia1 aContiero, Barbara1 aDiana, Alessia0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 16, no. 10 p.812-825dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X145220483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01990naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245006500165300001600230520076900246592002801015650001501043650001901058650002201077650001301099650001901112650001301131650001501144653002401159653001201183653001501195653001901210653002801229700002001257700001801277700002201295700005501317773011401372856008501486852000901571655001201580IND60610695820221119222555.0180829e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061069582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lili,10aCr(VI) removal via anion exchange on a silver-triazolate MOF  ap. 622-628.  aGram-scale synthesis of a silver-triazolato framework − {[Ag8(tz)6](NO3)2·6H2O}n (1-NO3; tz⁻=3,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazolate) − has been achieved, enabling the systematic investigation of its anion-exchange properties.

The aim of this study was to assess the extent of this problem based on analyses of a wide set of herbal-based dietary supplements intended for various purposes: (i) treatment of liver diseases (milk thistle); (ii) reduction of menopause effects (red clover, flax seed, and soy); and (iii) preparations for general health support (green barley, nettle, goji berries, yucca, etc.) The analytical method including 57 mycotoxins was based on a QuEChERS-like (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe) approach and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The main mycotoxins determined were Fusarium trichothecenes, zearalenone and enniatins, and Alternaria mycotoxins. Co-occurrence of enniatins, HT-2/T-2 toxins, and Alternaria toxins was observed in many cases. The highest mycotoxin concentrations were found in milk thistle-based supplements (up to 37 mg/kg in the sum). 3aAlternaria 3aFusarium 3aSilybum marianum 3aTrifolium pratense 3aYucca 3abarley 3adietary supplements 3ahuman health 3alinseed 3aliver diseases 3amenopause 3apeople 3arisk 3asmall fruits 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atrichothecenes 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3azearalenone1 aZachariasova, Milena1 aDzuman, Zbynek1 aZachariasova, Alena1 aFenclova, Marie1 aSlavikova, Petra1 aVaclavikova, Marta1 aMastovska, Katerina1 aHengst, Daniel1 aHajslova, Jana0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 July 29, v. 63, no. 29 p.6633-6643dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02105  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012300167300001600290520117700306592002801483650002201511650001501533650000901548650002101557650001201578650001701590650002401607650001901631650001601650650001401666653002201680653002101702653001501723653002001738700001701758700001801775700001401793700001901807700001201826700001801838773011401856856008501970852000902055655001202064IND60610695920221119222534.0180829e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061069592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Haomiao10aStabilization of mercury over Mn-based oxides: Speciation and reactivity by temperature programmed desorption analysis  ap. 745-752.  aMercury temperature-programmed desorption (Hg-TPD) method was employed to clarify mercury species over Mn-based oxides. The elemental mercury (Hg⁰) removal mechanism over MnOx was ascribed to chemical-adsorption. HgO was the primary mercury chemical compound adsorbed on the surface of MnOx. Rare earth element (Ce), main group element (Sn) and transition metal elements (Zr and Fe) were chosen for the modification of MnOx. Hg-TPD results indicated that the binding strength of mercury on these binary oxides followed the order of Sn-MnOx<Ce-MnOx∼MnOx<Fe-MnOx<Zr-MnOx. The activation energies for desorption were calculated and they were 64.34, 101.85, 46.32, 117.14, and 106.92eV corresponding to MnOx, Ce-MnOx, Sn-MnOx, Zr-MnOx and Fe-MnOx, respectively. Sn-MnOx had a weak bond of mercury (Hg-O), while Zr-MnOx had a strong bond (HgO). Ce-MnOx and Fe-MnOx had similar bonds compared with pure MnOx. Moreover, the effects of SO2 and NO were investigated based on Hg-TPD analysis. SO2 had a poison effect on Hg⁰ removal, and the weak bond of mercury can be easily destroyed by SO2. NO was favorable for Hg⁰ removal, and the bond strength of mercury was enhanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adesorption 3airon 3amanganese oxides 3amercury 3anitric oxide 3arare earth elements 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3azirconium 0aElemental mercury 0aManganese oxides 0aAdsorption 0aMercury species1 aMa, Yongpeng1 aHuang, Wenjun1 aMei, Jian1 aZhao, Songjian1 aQu, Zan1 aYan, Naiqiang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Jan. 05, v. 321 p.745-752dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245009900165300001600264520143800280536013001718592002801848650001901876650000901895650001401904650002501918650001401943650002001957700001901977700002501996700001902021700002702040700002202067773012502089856008002214852000902294655001202303IND60623552220221118232039.0181127e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062355222DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X145220492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCombes, Anaïs10aUltrasonographical examination of feline adrenal glands: intra- and inter-observer variability  ap. 937-942.  aInterpretation of ultrasonographical measurements requires an understanding of the source and the magnitude of variation. A substantial part of the variation can be attributed to the observer, the equipment or the animal. The aim of this study was to evaluate which adrenal gland measurement is the least variable within and between observers. Three experienced ultrasonographers examined six cats at three different times on the same day, more than 1 h apart, according to a strict scanning protocol. Seven ultrasonographical measurements were performed on each adrenal gland (maximal length on sagittal images, maximal height at the cranial and caudal poles on sagittal and transverse images, and maximal width of the cranial and caudal poles on transverse images). Height measurements in both planes showed the lowest variability within and between observers compared with length and width measurements. Descriptive ultrasonographical features, such as echogenicity of the gland, presence of hyperechoic spots or layering assessment, demonstrated satisfactory-to-good intra- and inter-observer agreement, whereas the shape assessment showed very poor inter-observer agreement. The results of this study describe a reliable scanning protocol that can be the basis for future adrenal ultrasonographical examinations for cats suspected of adrenal disease (eg, hyperaldosteronism, hyperadrenocorticism, sex hormone-producing tumours).  aFunding This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal glands 3acats 3aequipment 3ahyperadrenocorticism 3aneoplasms 3aultrasonography1 aStock, Emmelie1 aVan der Vekens, Elke1 aDuchateau, Luc1 aVan Ryssen, Bernadette1 aSaunders, Jimmy H0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 16, no. 12 p.937-942dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X145220493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02038naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245005900168300001300227520096100240592002801201650002901229650001301258650001001271650001501281650002301296650002201319650001201341650000901353700001601362700001601378700001501394700001701409700001701426773013001443856008201573852000901655655001201664IND50067121420221119125335.0220206e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006712142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1585-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEleftheratos, K.10aOzone Variations Derived by a Chemical Transport Model  ap. 1585.  aThe results of a comparison between monthly mean ozone column variations calculated from the chemical transport model Oslo CTM2 and those derived from solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV) satellite observations are presented for the period 1998–2009. Monthly mean total ozone derived from improved model simulations were used to compute monthly zonal means over 10° latitude zones over the northern and southern hemispheres. Ozone column variations from Oslo CTM2 are highly correlated with SBUV retrievals at all latitude zones. Equatorial zonal winds at 30 hPa were used as index to study the impact of quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on ozone. Correlations between modeled ozone and the QBO were found to be the order of +0.8 in the tropics. The impact of QBO was most pronounced at equatorial latitudes with amplitudes of +4 to −4 %. Seasonal variations in surface ozone and tropospheric ozone column calculated by the model are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical polymorphism 3alatitude 3aozone 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asimulation models 3atropics 3awind1 aIsaksen, I.1 aZerefos, C.1 aNastos, P.1 aTourpali, K.1 aRognerud, B.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2013 June, v. 224, no. 6 p.1585-1585dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1585-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245010800196300002000304500001900324520184400343592002802187650003202215650002302247650001502270650001002285650002402295650001602319650002002335650001502355650001502370653001502385653002402400653003702424653002002461653004002481700005202521700005202573773014202625856007802767852000902845655001202854IND60711079820221118172115.0200916e20200821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071107982DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c114432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1155-096X10aMultiwavelength Phototactic Micromotor with Controllable Swarming Motion for “Chemistry-on-the-Fly”  ap. 41495-41505.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aArtificial nano/micromotors that represent the next-generation automotive microdevices hold considerable promise in various potential applications. However, it is a great challenge to design light-powered micro/nanomotors with effective propulsion that can fulfill diverse tasks. Herein, a multilight-responsive micromotor is fabricated by in situ precipitation of photothermal Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles (NPs) onto different microparticles. The composites exhibit phototactic swarming movement by irradiation at 320–550 nm, which can be reversibly and remotely manipulated by irradiation position, “on/off” switch, and light intensity. The micromotor made of Fe₃O₄@poly(glycidyl methacrylate)/polystyrene (Fe₃O₄@PGS) core–shell particles presents a propulsion speed as high as 270 μm/s under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Using an array of experimental methods and numerical simulations, thermal convection mechanism is proposed for the propulsion. Namely, under light irradiation, the photogenerated heat on Fe₃O₄ NPs decreases the density of the irradiated spot, leading to the swarming motion of the composite particles propelled by a “hydrodynamic drag” toward the light spot. Then, Fe₃O₄@PGS is exploited as a platform for performing “chemistry-on-the-fly” using both the catalytic efficiency of Fe₃O₄ NPs and an immobilized enzyme (lipase). It is found that the propulsion increases the catalytic efficiency of Fe₃O₄ NPs for rhodamine B degradation by over 10 times under sunlight. Moreover, it is proved to accelerate the enzymatic reactions of lipase on Fe₃O₄@PGS in both aqueous and organic systems by more than 50%. Such a multiwavelength phototactic swimmer paves the way to the design of advanced micromotors for various applications, such as drug delivery, microsurgery, and sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3aconvection 3adrugs 3aimmobilized enzymes 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3aphototaxis 3arhodamines 0amicromotor 0aFe3O4 nanoparticles 0amultiwavelength light-responsive 0aswarming motion 0aaccelerated (bio)chemical reactions1 aLiu, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2921-77751 aSun, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5256-95710 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 21, v. 12, no. 37 p.41495-41505dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c114433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245007500176300001600251520125500267536020201522592002801724596007001752596004301822596001101865650002501876650001201901650002201913650002101935650001501956650002201971650001101993650001802004650001402022651001102036653001902047653001802066653003002084653001302114653002002127653001002147700002002157773013502177856008602312852000902398655001202407IND60595490020221121091851.0180619e20180704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059549002DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2018.14277872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aI. Kallio, A. Maarit10aLeakage of forest harvest changes in a small open economy: case Norway  ap. 502-510.  aThe effect of changes in roundwood harvests in Norway on the harvests in rest of the world is examined using a global forest sector model. About 60–100% of the harvest change in Norway is offset by an opposite change in the rest of the world. Such leakage rates vary over time, wood category, background scenario, and the size of the harvest change. Asymmetries between the effects of increasing and decreasing the harvests also exist. Hence, the magnitude of leakage rate is case specific, though considerable. Under tightening wood supply there is less need/room to respond to harvest increase/decrease in Norway with incremental/reduced harvests elsewhere. When the use of global forest resources intensifies with increasing wood demand in the future, leakage rates can be smaller than today. It is important to account for harvest leakage in order to avoid overestimating the climate benefits of policies that decrease or increase roundwood harvests. For instance, for full carbon sequestration benefits of increasing harvests for harvested wood products, creating fresh additional demand for these products should be prioritized. Else the origin of raw material and the place of production for these products may change instead of their stock.  aThe research leading to these results has been partly funded by Cenbio – Bioenergy Innovation Centre.

S123-S132.  aThe Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertrophy virus (GpSGHV) is a rod-shaped, non-occluded double-stranded DNA virus that causes salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) and reduced fecundity in the tsetse fly G. pallidipes. High GpSGHV prevalence (up to 80%) makes it impossible to mass-rear G. pallidipes colonies for the sterile insect technique (SIT). To evaluate the feasibility of molecular-based GpSGHV management strategies, we investigated the prevalence and genetic diversity of GpSGHV in wild populations of G. pallidipes collected from ten geographical locations in eastern and southern Africa. Virus diversity was examined using a total sequence of 1497 nucleotides (∼1% of the GpSGHV genome) from five putative conserved ORFs, p74, pif1, pif2, pif3 and dnapol. Overall, 34.08% of the analyzed flies (n=1972) tested positive by nested PCR. GpSGHV prevalence varied from 2% to 100% from one location to another but phylogenetic and gene genealogy analyses using concatenated sequences of the five putative ORFs revealed low virus diversity. Although no correlation of the virus diversity to geographical locations was detected, the GpSGHV haplotypes could be assigned to one of two distinct clades. The reference (Tororo) haplotype was the most widely distributed, and was shared by 47 individuals in seven of the 11 locations. The Ethiopian haplotypes were restricted to one clade, and showed the highest divergence (with 14–16 single nucleotide mutation steps) from the reference haplotype. The current study suggests that the proposed molecular-based virus management strategies have a good prospect of working throughout eastern and southern Africa due to the low diversity of the GpSGHV strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA viruses 3aGeographical Locations 3aGlossina pallidipes 3afecundity 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahypertrophy 3amutation 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation 3asalivary glands 3asterile insect technique 3aviruses 0aTsetse flies 0aGlossinidae 0aSalivary gland hypertrophy virus 0aPrevalence 0aGenetic diversity1 aAḥmadī, Manūchihr,1 aParker, A.G.1 aFranz, G.1 aRos, V.I.D.1 aHaq, I.1 aElashry, A.M.1 aVlak, J.M.1 aBergoin, M.1 aVreysen, M.J.B.1 aAbd-Alla, A.M.M.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2013 Mar., v. 112 p.S123-S132dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2012.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245023100165500001400396520056500410536027200975592002801247650002201275650001701297650001101314650001501325651001701340651001001357653002801367653002101395653002401416653002001440653003401460653002201494700002301516700002201539700002301561700002001584773011301604856007701717852000901794655001201803IND60727253320221122071120.0210308e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072725332DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e539502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZangaro, Francesco12aA new extralimital sighting of Monachus monachus (Hermann, 1779) in the Aquatina di Frigole NATURA 2000 site (IT9150003) beach (Salento peninsula, Apulia Region, Italy) after two decades: strategies for conservation are needed  aNAL-light  aThe Mediterranean monk seal Monachus monachus (Hermann, 1779) is the most endangered pinniped in the world.

Fe-Mt showed significant increases in the available iron content, surface area and pore volume, along with a slight increase in the basal spacing from d001=1.26 (Na-Mt) to 1.53nm (Fe-Mt). The Fenton process was efficient for phenol removal using Fe-Mt as a catalyst under visible light irradiation, and the process had two-stage pseudo-first order kinetics. The overall reaction had a higher degradation rate even when it was only irradiated with visible light for the first 40min period. Further investigation confirmed that the irradiation increased the presence of certain intermediates. Among them, 1,4-benzoquinone, hydroquinone, and catechol all enhanced the Fenton reaction rates. Either catechol or hydroquinone was added to the Fenton system with Fe-Mt/H2O2 with or without visible light irradiation, and they both accelerated phenol degradation because catechol and hydroquinone are capable of reductively and effectively transforming Fe(III) into Fe(II). The concentrations of dissolved total Fe increased with the increase in the oxalic acid concentration, which can strongly chelate Fe(III). Hence, iron was released from Fe-Mt, and reductive transformation played an important role in promoting the Fenton reaction process for phenol removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoquinones 3acatalysts 3acatechol 3ahydroquinone 3airon 3airon oxides 3airradiation 3aoxalic acid 3aphenol 3asurface area 0aPhoto-Fenton 0aIron-montmorillonite 0aPhenol 0aIntermediate 0aKinetics1 aWu, Honghai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7169-313X1 aHe, Guangping1 aGuan, Yufeng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Jan. 05, v. 321 p.408-416dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.09.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007600172300001400248520106300262592002801325650001601353650001201369651001001381653001301391653001501404653001301419653001001432653003001442653001001472773010501482856008701587852000901674655001201683IND60532834720221122031722.0190405e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053283472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaniagua, Angel10aRurality, identity and morality in remote rural areas in northern Spain  ap. 49-58.  aThe aim of this work is to conduct a micro comparative study of the identities and moral discourses in remote rural areas. It is divided into two main parts: the first analyses the different approaches to rurality, rural others and moral approaches from a sociocultural perspective; the second corresponds to a comparative analysis of the spatial identities and moral discourses in remote rural areas affected by depopulation processes.The empirical objective is to study, in two adjacent valleys, how rural micro identities arise and how the moral lives of individuals and social groups are configured. The qualitative methodology is based on an extensive stay in the area (casual and systematic observations and exchanges with local populations), and conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews.The main results suggest that different group identities appear from a similar material base and, from these identities, a range of moral lives based on daily life. Materiality, identity and moral lives are three superimposed but distinct interacting layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3arural areas 3avalleys 3aSpain 0aMorality 0aIdentities 0aRurality 0aSpace 0aComparative microanalysis 0aSpain0 tJournal of rural studies.g2014 July, v. 35 p.49-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245007000205300002000275500001900295520076500314592002801079650001001107650002101117650002101138650001401159650001701173653001701190653001801207653001901225653002801244653001601272653003001288700001601318700006501334700001801399700006201417700006101479773014301540856007801683852000901761655001201770IND60711079920221118172056.0200916e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071107992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c114782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaschuk, Nadia O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6095-352210aMultichromic Monolayer Terpyridine-Based Electrochromic Materials  ap. 41749-41757.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe article describes novel electrochromic materials (ECMs) that are based on a monolayer consisting of two or three isostructural metal complexes of 4′-(pyridin-4-yl)-2,2’:6′,2’’-terpyridine simultaneously deposited on surface-enhanced support.

From April to November, 18 balsam fir samples were obtained each month and evaluated for postharvest needle abscission characteristics. Soil samples were collected simultaneously and evaluated for moisture, pH, organic matter, cation exchange capacity, and mineral nutrition. Needle tissue samples were also evaluated for mineral nutrition. Many parameters were found to vary based on month throughout the study, but not all were associated with needle abscission. Soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, Ca, and Mn all had a significant (P < .01) positive relationship with needle retention; soil Al had a significant (P < .01) negative relationship with needle retention. Needle N, Ca, and Fe were also associated with needle abscission. The strongest positive relationship was found between needle Ca and needle retention (R² > .50), suggesting that higher concentrations of tissue Ca were linked to superior needle retention in balsam fir. Overall, this study provides evidence that changes to soil management, such as the inclusion of organic matter and certain minerals, may improve needle retention in balsam fir.  aThis work was funded by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CRDPJ-364061-07/09) and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (195310).  aPublisher supplied data  aCRDPJ-364061-07/09cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  a195310cAtlantic Canada Opportunities Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004952  cChristmas Tree Council of Nova Scotia  cNova Scotia Department of Natural Resources 3aharvest date 3amanganese 3acation exchange capacity 3aAbies balsamea 3acalcium 3asoil organic matter 3airon 3aseasonal variation 3aaluminum 3apH 3aleaf abscission 3asoil management 3aminerals 3asoil sampling 3atree nutrition 0aorganic matter 0afluorescence 0aneedle retention1 aLada, Rajasekaran R.0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2018 July 4, v. 33, no. 5 p.426-436dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39219x1651-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2018.14277883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012200160300001600282500001500298520104000313592002801353650001901381650001601400650001201416650001601428650001501444650002201459650002201481650001201503650001001515650001901525650001601544650001001560653001701570700001401587700002001601700001201621700001501633700001901648700001601667700001701683700001901700700001901719700001601738700002001754700001601774700001901790700001601809773010101825856004801926852000901974655001201983IND50067866720221120230311.0130716e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006786672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11816-012-0269-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Hua10aExpression of the Arabidopsis vacuolar H⁺-pyrophosphatase gene AVP1 in peanut to improve drought and salt tolerance  ap. 345-355.  a2019-12-05  aThe Arabidopsis gene AVP1 encodes an H⁺-pyrophosphatase that functions as a proton pump at the vacuolar membranes, generating a proton gradient across vacuolar membranes, which serves as the driving force for many secondary transporters on vacuolar membranes such as Na⁺/H⁺-antiporters. Overexpression of AVP1 could improve drought tolerance and salt tolerance in transgenic plants, suggesting a possible way in improving drought and salt tolerance in crops. The AVP1 was therefore introduced into peanut by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Analysis of AVP1-expressing peanut indicated that AVP1-overexpression in peanut could improve both drought and salt tolerance in greenhouse and growth chamber conditions, as AVP1-overexpressing peanuts produced more biomass and maintained higher photosynthetic rates under both drought and salt conditions. In the field, AVP1-overexpressing peanuts also outperformed wild-type plants by having higher photosynthetic rates and producing higher yields under low irrigation conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3asalt tolerance 3aArabidopsis 3apeanuts 3agreenhouses 3airrigation 3atransgenic plants 3adrought tolerance 3adrought 3agenes 3aphotosynthesis 3aproton pump 3acrops 0atransporters1 aGu, Qiang1 aKuppu, Sundaram1 aSun, Li1 aZhu, Xunlu1 aMishra, Neelam1 aHu, Rongbin1 aShen, Guoxin1 aZhang, Junling1 aZhang, Yizheng1 aZhu, Longfu1 aZhang, Xianlong1 aBurow, Mark1 aPayton, Paxton1 aZhang, Hong0 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2013 July, v. 7, no. 3 p.345-355dSpringer-Verlagx1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-012-0269-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009100168300001400259500001900273520120400292592002801496650001301524650001601537650002401553650001801577650001501595650001401610650001501624653002501639653001301664653001601677653001701693653001801710653002001728653001801748700001801766700001901784773010101803856008401904852000901988655001201997IND60715903720221118042406.0210415e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071590372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGritti, Nicola10aRethinking embryology in vitro: A synergy between engineering, data science and theory  ap. 48-61.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPluripotent stem cells, in the recent years, have been demonstrated to mimic different aspects of metazoan embryonic development in vitro. This has led to the establishment of synthetic embryology: a field that makes use of in vitro stem cell models to investigate developmental processes that would be otherwise inaccessible in vivo. Currently, a plethora of engineering-inspired techniques, including microfluidic devices and bioreactors, exist to generate and culture organoids at high throughput. Similarly, data analysis and deep learning-based techniques, that were established in in vivo models, are now being used to extract quantitative information from synthetic systems. Finally, theory and data-driven in silico modeling are starting to provide a system-level understanding of organoids and make predictions to be tested with further experiments. Here, we discuss our vision of how engineering, data science and theoretical modeling will synergize to offer an unprecedented view of embryonic development. For every one of these three scientific domains, we discuss examples from in vivo and in vitro systems that we think will pave the way to future developments of synthetic embryology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnimalia 3abioreactors 3acomputer simulation 3aembryogenesis 3aembryology 3aorganoids 3astem cells 0aSynthetic embryology 0aModeling 0aEngineering 0aData science 0aMicrofluidics 0aHigh-throughput 0aDeep learning1 aOriola, David1 aTrivedi, Vikas0 tDevelopmental biology.g2021 June, v. 474 p.48-61dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012400187300001600311520162900327592002801956650001101984650001801995650001602013650002102029650001102050650001802061650001802079650001502097650001402112650001302126650001102139650002102150650002202171650002502193650000902218650003202227650001402259650002402273650001902297650002102316650001602337650001402353650000902367651001602376653001502392653002102407653002302428653000802451700001902459700002002478700001902498700001802517700002302535700002102558773013602579856008102715852000902796655001202805IND60654874520221120111125.0190726e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065487452DNAL7 a264819492pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150041222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Rachel C.10aNut consumption is associated with better nutrient intakes: results from the 2008/09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey  ap. 105-112.  aA limited number of studies have examined associations between nut consumption and nutrient intakes or diet quality. None has investigated these associations in the Southern Hemisphere. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between nut consumption and nutrient intakes among adult New Zealanders. Data from the 24-h recalls of 4721 participants from the cross-sectional 2008/09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey (2008/09 NZANS) were used to determine whole nut intake and total nut intake from all sources as well as nutrient intakes. Regression models, both unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounders, were used to estimate differences in nutrient intakes between those consuming and those not consuming nuts. From adjusted models, compared with non-whole nut consumers, whole nut consumers had higher intakes of energy and percentage of energy from total fat, MUFA and PUFA, whereas percentage of energy from SFA and carbohydrate was lower (all P≤0·025). After the additional adjustment for energy intake, whole nut consumers had higher intakes of dietary fibre, vitamin E, folate, Cu, Mg, K, P and Zn (all P≤0·044), whereas cholesterol and vitamin B₁₂ intakes were significantly lower (both P≤0·013). Total nut consumption was associated with similar nutrient profiles as observed in whole nut consumers, albeit less pronounced. Nut consumption was associated with better nutrient profiles, especially a lower intake of SFA and higher intakes of unsaturated fats and a number of vitamins and minerals that could collectively reduce the risk for chronic disease, in particular for CVD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acarbohydrates 3acholesterol 3achronic diseases 3acopper 3adietary fiber 3aenergy intake 3afolic acid 3amagnesium 3aminerals 3amodels 3anutrient content 3anutrition surveys 3anutritional adequacy 3anuts 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3arisk reduction 3aunsaturated fats 3avitamin B12 3avitamin E 3azinc 3aNew Zealand 0aNut intake 0aNutrient intakes 0aPopulation surveys 0aCVD1 aTey, Siew Ling1 aGray, Andrew R.1 aChisholm, Alex1 aSmith, Claire1 aFleming, Elizabeth1 aParnell, Winsome0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 Jan. 14, v. 115, no. 1 p.105-112dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150041223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245005600165300001600221520150700237536015201744592002801896650001801924650002201942650001701964650001901981650000902000650002002009650002102029650000902050650001502059650001402074650003402088650002602122650002402148700002502172700001802197773012502215856008002340852000902420655001202429IND60623552520221118232052.0181127e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062355252DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X145220522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHourani, Layla10aEvaluation of a novel feline AB blood typing device  ap. 826-831.  aThis prospective study evaluated a novel immunochromatographic (IC) blood typing test for the AB blood group system. Typing was conducted comparatively on ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid-anticoagulated blood samples from 89 sick and 16 healthy cats with the IC test, as well as two tests as reference methods, a tube agglutination and a gel column test. The samples were between 0 and 10 days old (median 3 days) and were tested for haemolysis and agglutination; the packed cell volume ranged from 0.07 to 0.57 l/l (median 0.40 l/l). The reference methods agreed with each other in 100% of the test runs. Of the 85 samples tested as blood type A by the two reference methods, 80 were correctly identified by the IC test, four were misidentified as AB and one was rated inconclusive. All B samples were correctly typed. Two of the three AB samples were correctly identified by the IC test and one was rated inconclusive. The sample quality had no influence on test performance. Of 30 repeats, 28 were readable and showed agreement in 27 cases. The agreement of the IC test with the control methods was 96.1% for the 103 conclusive tests, and it showed high sensitivity and specificity for A and B antigen detection. It is suggested that AB results be reconfirmed with a laboratory method and that a ‘back-typing’ be performed with plasma from B samples to detect the presence of alloantibodies. Given its very good performance and ease of use, the IC test can be recommended for clinical settings.  aFunding Dr Kohn received research support in the form of test kits and financial reimbursement for laboratory materials from DMS Laboratories, USA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagglutination 3aantigen detection 3ablood groups 3ablood sampling 3acats 3acontrol methods 3aethylenediamines 3agels 3ahematocrit 3ahemolysis 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3alaboratory techniques 3aprospective studies1 aWeingart, Christiane1 aKohn, Barbara0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 16, no. 10 p.826-831dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X145220523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245005800203300002000261520111300281592002801394650002201422650003001444650002101474650002101495650001401516650001901530650001901549700002901568700002201597773013801619856008001757852000901837655001201846IND60675801220221119142938.0191108e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067580122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b058582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaraib, Iflah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0731-179510aEffects of Doping on the Crystal Structure of BiVO₄  ap. 26752-26757.  aThe search for efficient photoelectrochemically active materials has led to several studies on BiVO₄, which has shown higher photocurrent than most typical semiconductors under photoelectrochemical (PEC) operation. BiVO₄ can be stabilized in different crystal structures, yet high PEC efficiency is found only for n-type doped monoclinic phase. The theoretical description of the monoclinic polymorph is difficult because of spontaneous transformation to a tetragonal phase. The cause of such instability of the monoclinic phase has yet to be resolved. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we explore how the concentration of excess electrons in this material affects its phase stability. We analyze the unit-cell structure, local bonding, and band structure of BiVO₄ at different concentrations of excess electrons. We find that as the concentration of excess electrons increases, the tetragonal phase spontaneously transforms into the monoclinic phase, suggesting a crucial role of doping in the structure and, thus, the photoelectrochemical performance of BiVO₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3aphotochemistry 3asemiconductors1 aCarneiro, Marciano Alves1 aJanotti, Anderson0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 09, v. 123, no. 44 p.26752-26757dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b058583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01430naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245005900160500001400219520052400233592002800757650001500785650001700800650001700817650001600834653001100850653002100861653001500882700002000897773011300917856007701030852000901107655001201116IND60727253520221122071123.0210308e20200804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072725352DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.8.e542222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Edward10aStandardisation of bioacoustic terminology for insects  aNAL-light  aAfter reviewing the published literature on sound production in insects, a standardised terminology and controlled vocabularies have been created.

Methods used to obtain tissue samples range from those that are minimally invasive, such as fine-needle aspiration (FNA), to more invasive techniques such as surgical biopsy. FNA and cytological examination can be a useful diagnostic tool and is commonly used for hepatic, splenic and lymph node specimens. FNA is an easy and cheap procedure that is best suited to diffuse disease and can be performed at low risk to the patient. However, its accuracy and agreement with the histopathological findings vary depending on the underlying disease and it often fails to provide information on parenchymal architecture. Importantly, FNA for cytological examination of the liver has serious limitations when used to identify the primary disease process due to the small sample size obtained. This review is aimed at clinicians undertaking more detailed and specialist investigation of diseases of feline parenchymal abdominal organs and provides practical guidance on the different methods used to obtain hepatic, renal, pancreatic and splenic specimens in cats. The information presented is based on peer-reviewed publications and the clinical experience of the author.  aFunding The author received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors for the preparation of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3acat diseases 3acats 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3alymph nodes 3apatients 3arisk0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 16, no. 3 p.216-230dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X145231843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010400154300002000258520194300278592002802221650001502249650002402264650001902288650002102307650001102328650002002339650001602359700001502375700001402390700001602404700001702420700001502437773012302452856007502575852000902650655001202659IND60558274220221119172801.0161113e20121025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055827422DNAL7 a10.1021/jp305619n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Pei10aDilational Properties of Novel Amphiphilic Dendrimers at Water–Air and Water–Heptane Interfaces  ap. 12760-12768.  aIn this work, a series of novel amphiphilic dendrimers taking polyamidoamine dendrimer as the core with different hydrophobic tails QPAMCₘ were synthesized and the dilational properties were studied as monolayers by dilational rheological measurements at the water–air and water–n-heptane interfaces to explore the nature of adsorption behaviors. The results showed that the maximum values of the dilational modulus seemed to have no obvious variation in a wide change of hydrophobic chain length at the surface. However, there was considerable variability in the tendency of the influence of bulk concentration on the dilational modulus at the two different interfaces. It was interestingly found that the diffusion-exchange process slowed down with the increase of alkyl chain length leading to more elastic nature of adsorption film, which was contrary to the tendencies of conventional single chain and gemini surfactants. It is reasonable to consider that, in the case of the molecule having short chain length such as QPAMC₈, the alkyl chains are too short to overlap across the headgroup, enable the intermolecular hydrophobic interaction to be predominant with increasing of surface concentration, which enhances the elasticity and shows the slowest diffusion-exchange process. Whereas, when the chain length increases to 12 or 16, the alkyl chains are long enough to act intramolecularly to form intracohesion conformation, which results in enhancing the diffusion-exchange process. In conclusion, the interfacial behaviors are dictated by the size ratio between the tail and headgroup. A reasonable model with respect to the molecular interaction was proposed on the basis of experimental data. The results of interfacial tension relaxation and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments, in accord with the proposed mechanism, also present the unusual tendency comparing to the traditional single or gemini surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3alight scattering 3amodels 3asurface tension 3asurfactants1 aZhang, Lei1 aZhang, Lu1 aZhou, Jizhu1 aWang, Jinben1 aYan, Haike0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 25, v. 116, no. 42 p.12760-12768dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp305619n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245005100168300001600219500001400235520149800249592002801747650001601775650001401791650001401805650001201819650001401831650001001845650001501855650000901870650001201879650000901891651001301900653001801913653001801931653001601949653001701965653001601982653001901998653001502017653001702032653001602049653001602065773007902081856008202160852000902242655001202251IND60711175720221120212741.0200917s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071117572DNAL7 a10.1163/1568541067779987372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoof, P.

Twenty species were found, of which seven are new to science, although one of these (Iotonchulus sp. A) is not formally named as only a single female was found. Parahadronchus selangorensis n. sp. is a didelphic species over 3 mm long, the female possessing advulvar papillae. Hadronchoides maximus n. sp. differs from H. microdenticulatus by much longer body, buccal cavity and tail, and by the more posteriorly placed dorsal tooth. Miconchus parathornei n. sp. resembles M. thornei but is bisexual, the lip region is narrower and the dorsal tooth lies more anterior in the buccal cavity. Iotonchus abrahmani n. sp. is characterised by the reduced, but differentiated, posterior genital branch. Iotonchus pusillus n. sp. resembles I. chantaburensis but differs by the subacute tail terminus, absence of distinct caudal glands, and values of c and anal body diameter, and V. Mylonchulus williamsi n. sp. resembles M. incurvus in tail shape but differs from it in having much lower values of L, buccal cavity length and lip region diameter. The other species found were: Parahadronchus yuenae; Iotonchus trichurus; I. cf. trichurus; I. silvallus; I. basidontus; I. indicus; I. chantaburensis; I. cf. rinae; Iotonchulus longicaudatus; Mylonchulus brachyuris; M. minor; M. mulveyi; and Sporonchulus ibitiensis. Paramylonchulus indistinctus is proposed as a junior synonym of Mylonchulus mulveyi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDorylaimida 3aIotonchus 3aMiconchus 3afemales 3agenitalia 3amouth 3anematology 3asoil 3asurveys 3atail 3aMalaysia 0aHADRONCHOIDES 0aMORPHOMETRICS 0aMYLONCHULUS 0aSPORONCHULUS 0aNEW SPECIES 0aPARAHADRONCHUS 0aMORPHOLOGY 0aDESCRIPTIONS 0aNEW SYNONYM 0aIOTONCHULUS0 tNematology.g, v. 8, no. 2 p.287-310dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568541067779987373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245015300186300001600339520158600355592002801941650001101969650002301980650001402003650002502017650001502042650001502057650001402072650003002086650001302116650001502129650002102144650001602165653002902181653001102210653001502221653002702236700001902263700001902282700001702301700002002318700001702338700001802355773013602373856008102509852000902590655001202599IND60654874720221120111121.0190726e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065487472DNAL7 a265154332pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150041462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Fang-fang10aFolate, vitamin B₆, vitamin B₁₂ and methionine intakes and risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Chinese adults: a matched case–control study  ap. 121-128.  aMany studies have suggested that folate-related one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients may play a role in certain cancer risks, but few studies have assessed their associations with the risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we investigated the association between four folate-related one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients (folate, vitamin B₆, vitamin B₁₂ and methionine) and NPC risk in Chinese adults. A total of 600 patients newly diagnosed (within 3 months) with NPC were individually matched with 600 hospital-based controls by age, sex and household type (urban v. rural). Folate, vitamin B₆, vitamin B₁₂ and methionine intakes were measured using a validated seventy-eight-item FFQ. A higher dietary folate or vitamin B₆ intake was associated with a lower NPC risk after adjusting for potential confounders. The adjusted OR of NPC for quartiles 2–4 (v. 1) were 0·66 (95 % CI 0·48, 0·91), 0·52 (95 % CI 0·37, 0·74) and 0·34 (95 % CI 0·23, 0·50) (P ₜᵣₑₙd<0·001) for folate and 0·72 (95 % CI 0·52, 1·00), 0·55 (95 % CI 0·39, 0·78) and 0·44 (95 % CI 0·30, 0·63) (P ₜᵣₑₙd<0·001) for vitamin B₆. No significant association with NPC risk was observed for dietary vitamin B₁₂ or methionine intake. The risk for NPC with dietary folate intake was more evident in the participants who were not exposed to toxic substances than in those who were exposed (P ᵢₙₜₑᵣₐcₜᵢₒₙ=0·014). This study suggests that dietary folate and vitamin B₆ may be protective for NPC in a high-risk population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aat-risk population 3acarcinoma 3acase-control studies 3afolic acid 3amethionine 3anutrients 3anutrition risk assessment 3apatients 3apyridoxine 3atoxic substances 3avitamin B12 0aNasopharyngeal carcinoma 0aFolate 0aB vitamins 0aCase–control studies1 aLiu, Yuan-ting1 aLin, Xiao-ling1 aFan, Yuying,1 aZhang, Xing-lan1 aXu, Chun-hua1 aChen, Yu-ming0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 Jan. 14, v. 115, no. 1 p.121-128dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150041463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008200161300001800243520080400261592002801065650001401093650001201107650001501119650001101134650001101145650001801156650002001174650001301194650002101207650001601228700003101244773012101275856007401396852000901470655001201479IND60664036020221119021306.0190910e20120227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066403602DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra00782g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hsueh-Shih10aSol–gel TiO₂ in self-organization process: growth, ripening and sintering  ap. 2294-2301.  aTiO₂ nanoparticles were synthesised by a self-organization method using a continuous water vapour hydrolysis system without mixing.

The effect of ethanol was proved to increase aggregation and packing of primary particles, leading to a significant size enlargement of secondary particles in a post annealing process above 500 °C. A new model to describe sol–gel TiO₂ growth has been proposed, which considers the formation of secondary particles to be the result of nucleation of oversaturated primary particles, while the primary particles are the result of irreversible oligomerization of Ti oxo molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aethanol 3ahydrolysis 3amixing 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aoligomerization 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3awater vapor1 aKumar, Ramachandran Vasant0 tRSC advances.g2012 Feb. 27, v. 2, no. 6 p.2294-2301dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ra00782g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012200162300002000284520180900304592002802113650002202141650002502163650001102188650001302199650001302212650001902225650002302244700002202267700006102289773013802350856008002488852000902568655001202577IND60675801420221119142828.0191108e20190722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067580142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b060132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenny, Alfy10aIn Silico Exploration for Maximal Charge Transport in Organized Tetrabenzoacenes through Pitch and Roll Displacements  ap. 26758-26768.  aA series of π-conjugated tetrabenzoacenes (TBA), including nitrogen-(un)doped derivatives, are computationally evaluated to comprehend the correlation between intrinsic structural arrangements and charge-transport characteristics. The central charge-transport parameters such as reorganization energy and electronic coupling are individually tuned through peri substitutions, core substitutions, and/or π extension in TBA derivatives. On the basis of reorganization energies, nitrogen doping impeded the electron transport in TBA analogs owing to significant structural changes associated with the reduction process. Our approach employing mapping of dimeric arrangements of TBA, modulated via long (pitch) and short (roll) axes displacements of the molecular entities, versus charge transfer coupling disclosed potential charge-transport regions in addition to the ideal cofacial modes. Charge transport characteristics of molecular packing arrangements of TBA mimicking the different orientations of graphene bilayers were analyzed, providing insights into the possible material applicability of TBA derivatives. The transition from completely aligned graphitic AA packing sequence to slip-stacked AB and AA′ stacking domains revealed a dent in the charge-transport map owing to node–antinode interaction of the frontier molecular orbitals. TBA analogs encompassing the expanded π-system materialized highly displaced dimeric orientation from AB-type packing to occupy a hierarchy favoring higher charge transfer coupling than the AB type. Thus, realizing stable interchromophoric arrangements of small organic molecules through chemical or physical techniques to control their charge-transporting efficiencies is an indispensable step toward the generation of better organic electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3aelectronic equipment 3aenergy 3agraphene 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphysical chemistry1 aSasikumar, Devika1 aHariharan, Mahesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3237-62350 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 22, v. 123, no. 44 p.26758-26768dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b060133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245009900162506002800261520106100289592002801350506003701378650001601415650001301431650001601444650001801460650001501478650001601493650001101509650001101520650002001531650001401551650001401565653001601579653002201595653002701617700001101644700002301655700001801678700002501696773011701721856007701838852000901915655001201924IND60774131220221207052611.0171211e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077413122DNAL7 a10.14692/jfi.9.5.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamdan, Evan P.10aCendawan Endofit Nonpatogen Asal Tanaman Cabai dan Potensinya sebagai Agens Pemacu Pertumbuhan  aResource is Open Access  a<p>Endophytic fungi have been reported to have mutual symbiosis with their host.

The experimental results suggest that d-Lysine (d-Lys) plays a pivotal role in the self-assembly and conformation of collagen fibrils than d-Alanine (d-Ala) and d-Glutamic acid (d-Glu). The SDS-PAGE, absorption spectrum and viscosity measurements indicate significant differences in the d-Lys crosslinked collagen when compared to other systems. The CD spectra show an increase in the peak intensity at 220nm in the presence of d-Lys, which could be due to increase in propensity of the structure to form a triple helix. Modelling studies indicated that d-Lys bind with collagen-like peptide (CLP) through multiple H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. d-Lys has the lowest binding energy (−4.2kcal/mol, indicating strongest interactions) when compared to d-Ala and d-Glu (−3.6 and −3.7kcal/mol, respectively). Orientational changes in the collagenase on CLP-d-Lys are observed which may decrease its accessibility to degradation and stabilise CLP against the action of the former. d-Lys has the lowest binding energy and improved fibrillar-assembly and staggered alignment without the undesired structural stiffness and aggregations. The information derived from the present study could help in designing heterochiral collagen-based biomaterial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aamino acids 3acollagen 3acollagenase 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amodels 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aviscosity 0aCollagen 0aCollagenase 0aCollagen like peptide 0ad-Amino acids1 aSelvakumar, Rajendran1 aSastry, Thotapalli Parvathaleswara1 aMandal, A.

With the increased knowledge of the genetics of many crop species and the availability of new molecular techniques, we can expect that the development of genetically based resistance to nematodes will become a major means of controlling plant-parasitic nematodes. Arabidopsis thaliana has been proposed as a model plant to study plant-nematode interactions (Sijmons et al. , 1991; Niebel et al. , 1994). Although studies using A. thaliana have led to important findings, A. thaliana does have serious limitations as a model to study plant- nematode interactions. It is a good host for root-knot ne- matodes and certain cyst nematodes but it is considered a poor host for potato cyst nematodes. For migratory nema- todes like Radopholus similis and Pratylenchus coffeae it is considered a good host (Elsen et al. , 2001; Elsen & De Waele, 2004), but the high variability in nematode repro- duction hampers the use of A. thaliana as a model plant for these nematodes (Carlens et al. , 2005). Arabidopsis thaliana seems to be an inadequate model plant for trop- ical nematodes since the optimal temperature range for A. thaliana (20-25 ◦ C) differs from the optimal tempera- ture for the reproduction of tropical nematodes (27-30 ◦ C) (Carlens et al. , 2005). In addition, A. thaliana does not form symbiotic associations with either rhizobia or arbus- cular mycorrhizae. Therefore, Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus were suggested as an alternative to A. thaliana to compen- sate for its limitations as a model plant. Medicago trunca- tula and L. japonicus are considered to be good hosts for 1 Laboratory of Tropical Crop Improvement, Department of Biosystems, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kasteelpark Arenberg 13, 3001 Leuven, Belgium 2 University of Southern Mindanao, Kabacan, North Cotabato 9407, Philippines ∗ Corresponding author, e-mail: annemie.elsen@biw.kuleuven.be Received: 8 February 2006; revised: 21 February 2006 Accepted for publication: 27 February 2006 Keywords: host status, Pratylenchus coffeae , Pratylenchus penetrans , Radopholus similis. sedentary plant-parasitic nematodes (Koltai et al ., 2001; Favery et al. , 2002; Lohar & Bird, 2003). However, no information is available on their host status for migratory plant-parasitic nematodes. Pratylenchus spp. and Radopholus spp. are migratory endoparasites of the roots. They enter the cortex with the aid of a well-developed stylet and feed on the cytoplasm of ruptured cells. All developmental stages can move freely between the root and the soil. Eggs are laid both inside and outside the plant tissue. Plants are damaged by extensive damage of the cortical root tissue. The physiology of parasitism and host-plant relationship involve an active role for nematode secretions and host response (Manzanilla-López et al. , 2004). The objective of the present study was to examine if three migratory endoparasitic nematodes, R. similis , P. coffeae and P. penetrans , could reproduce on M. trunculata and L. japonicus . Wild-type (cv. Jemalung, reference line A17) M. trun- catula and wild-type (ecotype Gifu B129) L. japoni- cus were treated identically. The seeds were surface- sterilised with a 10-min soak in 12% NaOCl followed by three rinses with sterile, distilled water. Sterile 1-week-old seedlings, produced on water agar, were transferred indi- vidually to 6-well plates containing a modified Strullu- Romand (MSR) medium (Elsen et al. , 2000). After 2 weeks incubation at 26 ± 1 ◦ C (16 h light / 8 h dark cycle), root development of both M. truncatula and L. japonicus was sufficient to allow nematode inoculation. Three nematode species were used: Radopholus similis (Indonesian population), Pratylenchus coffeae (Ghanese population) and P. penetrans (Belgian population).

Rural decline is defined as comprising loss of rural youth, reduced human capital and increasing rural poverty. Since the start of the current century, the unconventional natural gas industry has been expanding around the world, often in close proximity to pre-existing agricultural communities. The social impacts of this new industry represent a growing area of interest in rural studies. We contribute to this new research area through a case study of coal seam gas (CSG) development in Queensland, Australia, comparing regions where gas development occurred between 2001 and 2011 against a control group of similar regions without gas development. The study eliminated the influence of non-resident workforces by analysing census data based on place of usual residence as well as place of enumeration. A key finding of the study is that regions with CSG development have experienced a growing youth share of the population and, of particular note, a growing female youth share of the population. CSG regions had a higher proportion of youth with university degrees and advanced technical training compared to other rural regions. Poverty reduction was also observed in some specific CSG regions. The extensive spatial footprint of unconventional gas and increased female rural youth populations indicate a diversion from traditional boomtown social impacts observed in previous energy booms. Taken together, the results show signs of mitigating and reversing rural community decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acensus data 3acoalbed methane 3aenergy 3afemales 3ahuman capital 3arural areas 3arural communities 3arural development 3arural poverty 3arural youth 3asocial impact 3aQueensland 0aUnconventional natural gas 0aCSG 0aCoal-bed methane 0aRural decline 0aRegional development 0aRural youth1 aFleming, David J.,0 tJournal of rural studies.g2014 Oct., v. 36 p.376-385dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010000170300001600270500001400286520127700300592002801577650001801605650002301623650001801646650002701664650001901691650001001710650001201720650001101732650001501743650000901758650002401767650001801791653001901809653000901828653001101837653002601848653002201874653001801896653000801914700001901922700001901941773007901960856008202039852000902121655001202130IND60711175920221120181731.0200917s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071117592DNAL7 a10.1163/1568541067786139302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPudasaini, Mahesh10aEffect of marigold (Tagetes patula) on population dynamics of Pratylenchus penetrans in a field  ap. 477-484.  aNAL-light  aThe effect of a sequence of host and non-host crops on the population dynamics of Pratylenchus penetrans was monitored for 2 years in a field. The sequence was pea (Pisum sativum, 25% cv. Colombia and 75% cv. Coca), French marigolds (Tagetes patula nana cv. Sparky); fallow; carrot (Daucus carota, cv. Amsterdamse bak); bean (Phaseolus vulgaris, cv. Avignon) and again fallow. Samples were taken every 21 days during the marigold crop and following fallow, and at planting and harvest for the other crops. From five 2 × 5 m2 plots, 15 cores were taken per plot to a depth of 70 cm and split into seven segments of 10 cm each. Within the plots, segments from corresponding depths were pooled and nematodes were estimated from a 200 g subsample. Densities of P. penetrans increased 2.2-fold under pea, but decreased by 90% after marigolds had been grown for 105 days. The P. penetrans population was reduced by about 90% in the soil layer above 40 cm while the reduction was about 80% below 50 cm after 105 days of marigold culture. Densities of P. penetrans declined exponentially in time under marigold and fallow. The effect of marigold was persistent as no increase in P. penetrans densities over the whole soil profile was noticed after two crop cycles of host plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPisum sativum 3aPratylenchus penetrans 3aTagetes patula 3abeans 3acarrots 3afallow 3anematology 3apeas 3apopulation dynamics 3asoil profiles 0aSAMPLING DEPTH 0aBEAN 0aCARROT 0aROOT LESION NEMATODES 0aEXPONENTIAL MODEL 0aCROP SEQUENCE 0aPEA1 aViaene, Nicole1 aMoens, Maurice0 tNematology.g, v. 8, no. 4 p.477-484dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568541067786139303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008700161300002000248520143700268592002801705650002001733650002101753650002201774650001701796650001901813650001301832650002301845650001801868650001301886700001901899700001601918773012301934856007502057852000902132655001202141IND60558274520221119172730.0161113e20121025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055827452DNAL7 a10.1021/jp306299x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParthasarathi, R.10aEmbedded Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Locally Perturb DOPC Phospholipid Bilayers  ap. 12769-12782.  aUnderstanding and controlling how carbon nanotubes interact with phospholipid membranes is necessary for preventing adverse effects of these relatively new, but still exciting, materials. Futuristic applications envision incorporating carbon nanotubes in liposomes for personalized medicine, controlled delivery, and imaging. Because of their ability to penetrate phospholipid bilayers, nanotubes could serve as nanoscale syringes to deliver molecular cargo and develop gene therapy. Several experimental reports available on the subject demonstrate the need for a better understanding, at the molecular level, of whether carbon nanotubes penetrate, reside, and perturb phospholipid bilayers. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we quantify how short carbon nanotubes (∼6 nm in length) embedded within a DOPC phospholipid membrane perturb the structure, organization, and dynamics of the lipid molecules within the membrane. It is found that the structural perturbation is very short-ranged, although it becomes pronounced when bundles of carbon nanotubes are formed within the membrane. The presence of the nanotubes is found to reduce the mobility of lipid molecules within the membrane and to perturb the structure of interfacial water. Our observations suggest that the local perturbations in the lipid structure caused by the nanotubes could lead to enhanced penetration of molecular compounds across the membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical elements 3agene therapy 3aimage analysis 3amedicine 3amolecular dynamics 3aphospholipids 3asyringes1 aTummala, N.

Three regions of the multicopy rDNA gene were examined in order to investigate the relationships among five Nosema isolates from various regions of China. Ribosomal DNA alleles are present on each of the 18 chromosomes of N. bombycis and show a high degree of variation. In this study the small subunit (SSU) rDNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and intergenic spacer (IGS) regions for up to 10 different rDNA copies from each N. bombycis isolate were cloned and sequenced. As expected we see greater polymorphism in the ITS region (88 variable sites in 179 nucleotides) and IGS (200 variable sites in 279 nucleotides) than in the SSU rDNA (24 variable sites in 1232 nucleotides). Phylogenetic analysis shows greater differences between alleles within an isolate than between the same alleles from different isolates. The data reveal two very different groups, one from the Sichuan province and the other with a broad distribution including four provinces in southeast China and Japan. The Sichuan isolate does not have any rDNA alleles with sequences identical to those in the other isolates, implying that it is a separate, non-intermixing, population or perhaps a separate species from the other isolates. In light of the polymorphic nature of the rDNA alleles in N. bombycis and their presence on every chromosome, the rDNA gene may be useful for understanding the movement and ultimately the source of pébrine infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aNosema bombycis 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3ainfectious diseases 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3asilkworms 3aChina 3aJapan 0aNosema bombycis 0aGenetic polymorphism 0aGeographic differentiation 0arDNA 0aIntergenic region1 aPan, Guoqing1 aLuo, Bo1 aLi, Tian1 aYang, Qiong1 aVossbrinck, Charles R.1 aDebrunner-Vossbrinck, Bettina A.1 aZhou, Zeyang0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2013 May, v. 113, no. 1 p.63-69dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2013.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008300169300001400252520114500266592002801411650001101439650001701450650002001467650002201487650001501509650002101524650001201545650001601557650001801573650001901591651001001610653001601620653002301636653002701659653001801686653002701704700002101731700002101752700001801773700001401791773010501805856008701910852000901997655001202006IND60532835320221122035537.0190405e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053283532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenling10aLow carbon rural housing provision in China: Participation and decision making  ap. 80-90.  aUnder the national strategy of ‘building a new socialist countryside’, concentrated rural housing is increasing in some rural regions in China. In this research we use three case studies to analyze decision making on concentrated rural housing and the potential for future low carbon rural housing. The empirical results show that concentrated rural housing can improve both the energy efficiency of houses and the living conditions of households, compared to traditional stand-alone modes of housing. Providers are the major decision makers with regard to the kind of materials, technologies and energy networks applied in rural housing development. Local governments, private property developers and local (energy) authorities in principle have the power to select and apply low carbon alternatives. The involvement of Chinese householders in concentrated housing project turns out to be low or non-existent. The introduction of market incentives, stricter building regulations, better decision making processes and communication with householders are relevant social factors for improving low carbon housing provision in rural China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aenergy efficiency 3ahouseholds 3alocal government 3amarkets 3arural areas 3arural housing 3asocial factors 3aChina 0aRural China 0aLow carbon housing 0aDecision making models 0aParticipation 0aEnergy infrastructures1 aSpaargaren, Gert1 aMol, Arthur P.J.1 aHeerink, Nico1 aWang, Can0 tJournal of rural studies.g2014 July, v. 35 p.80-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2014.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013500172520186200307592002802169650001302197650001202210650002602222650001502248650002102263650001002284650002302294653002302317653004002340653001102380700001302391700001602404700001502420773010302435856008802538852000902626655001202635IND60715904320221118042151.0201223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071590432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.1034202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Tongcheng10aTheoretical correlations between the elastic and electrical properties in layered porous rocks with cracks of varying orientations  aCracks that are widely existing in geological formations play an important role in affecting the elastic and electrical rock properties, which are remotely measured for detecting and characterizing cracked rocks. Joint interpretation of the complementary elastic and electrical data is expected to give a better assessment of the cracks. However, the correlations between the elastic and electrical rock properties, which are the key to the successful joint interpretation, remain poorly understood in layered porous rocks with cracks of varying orientations. We reviewed and summarized the most recent advances in the theoretical models for the elastic and electrical properties of layered porous rocks with inclined and rotated cracks as well as with randomly orienting cracks. The limitations of the models were identified by comparing the modeling results with available experimental data, and we applied the models within their validity range to obtaining theoretically the correlations between the elastic and electrical properties in layered porous rocks with cracks of the above-mentioned orientations, in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. We showed that the elastic and electrical properties are systematically correlated with cracks of varying crack densities and aspect ratios, different cracks orientations affect the correlations in varying ways. The results not only illustrate the link between the elastic and electrical properties in cracked rocks but also have important practical applications when the seismic and electromagnetic exploration data are jointly interpreted to gain better knowledge about the subsurface Earth, although future work is required to extend the models to more realistic cracked formations and to experimentally test the validity of the models and the theoretically obtained joint correlations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acracking 3adensity 3aelectrical properties 3ageophysics 3amodel validation 3arocks 3atheoretical models 0aElastic properties 0aJoint elastic-electrical properties 0aCracks1 aYan, Han1 aXu, Denghui1 aFu, Li-Yun0 tEarth-science reviews.g2020 Dec., v. 211 p.103420-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.1034203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009500158300002000253520084700273592002801120650001301148650002201161650001101183650004401194650002301238650001401261700001501275700002001290700001801310700002701328700002101355700002101376700002101397773012301418856007501541852000901616655001201625IND60558274720170927000000.0161113e20121025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055827472DNAL7 a10.1021/jp306829c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Craig
A.10aMacroscopic and Microscopic Study of 1-Ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium Acetate–Water Mixtures  ap. 12810-12818.  aMixtures of 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) and water across the entire composition range, from pure [C2mim][OAc] to pure water, have been investigated using density, viscosity, and NMR spectroscopy, relaxometry, and diffusion measurements. These results have been compared to ideal mixing laws for the microscopic data obtained from the NMR results and macroscopic data through the viscosity and density. It was also found that the mixing of the two fluids is exothermal. The proton spectra indicate though that [C2mim][OAc] and water are interacting without the formation of new compounds. The maximal deviations of experimental data from theoretical mixing rules were all found to occur within the range 0.74 ± 0.06 mol fraction of water, corresponding to approximately three water molecules per [C2mim][OAc] molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3achemical elements 3amixing 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3aviscosity1 aLe, Kim A.1 aRudaz, Cyrielle1 aRadhi, Asanah1 aLovell, Christopher S.1 aDamion, Robin A.1 aBudtova, Tatiana1 aRies, Michael E.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 25, v. 116, no. 42 p.12810-12818dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp306829c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245019000138300001600328506002800344520237500372592002802747506003702775650001202812650001202824650002402836650001602860650001102876650001802887650001502905650002302920650001402943650002302957650001302980650001102993653002403004653002003028653002203048653002603070653003003096700004103126700002503167700004003192700002703232700003003259773012503289852000903414655001203423IND60774131820221215142355.0130925e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077413182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModa, Leandro Rosatto10aGypsum application in the soybeans no-tillage system with and without potassium fertilization. = Gessagem na cultura da soja no sistema de plantio direto com e sem adubação potássica  ap. 129-135.  aResource is Open Access  aThe gypsum can be used as a sulfur source, thereby improving nutrition and promoting gains in yield of soybeans in no-tillage system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sulfur applied as gypsum in the soybean culture under the no-tillage system with and without potassium fertilization. The experiment was conducted in the city of Guaíra-SP in an OXISOL. The experimental design used was randomized blocks in factorial scheme 2 x 5 with four replications. The treatments were obtained by combining two levels of K (0 and 60 kg ha-1 K2O), applied as potassium chloride, and five doses of sulfur (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg ha-1 S) applied in the form of gypsum. Foliar potassium, calcium and sulfur, in addition to grain yield and oil content in the grains were evaluated. It was observed that the application of sulfur in the soil improved the nutritional status of soybean in potassium, calcium and sulfur, without affecting grain yield, independent of potassium fertilization. The presenceof sulfur in the soil increased the oil content in soybean grain with or without potassium fertilization. = O gesso agrícola pode ser utilizado como fonte de enxofre, desta forma, melhorando a nutrição e promovendo ganhos na produtividade da cultura da soja em sistema de plantio direto.

We used a comparative phylogenetic framework, data synthesis and case study approach to investigate how swimming performance differs among larvae of fish species across latitude. First, we investigated how swimming performance changed with body length, and we found that temperate reef fishes have the greatest increases in swimming performance with length. Secondly, we compared differences in three swimming performance metrics (critical swimming speed, in situ swimming, and endurance) among post‐flexion larvae, whilst considering phylogenetic relationships and morphology, and we found that reef fishes have higher swimming capacity than non‐reef (pelagic and non‐reef demersal) fishes, which is likely due to larger, more robust body sizes. Thirdly, we compared swimming performance of late‐stage larvae of tropical fishes with oceanographic data to better understand the ecological relevance of their high‐capacity swimming. We found that reef fishes have high swimming performance and grow larger than non‐reef fish larvae, which we suggest is due to the pressures to find a specific, patchily distributed habitat upon which to settle. Given the current bias towards studies on percomorph fishes at low latitudes, we highlight that there is a need for more research on temperate reef fish larvae and other percomorph lineages from high latitudes. Overall, our findings provide valuable context to understand how swimming and morphological traits that are important for dispersal and recruitment processes are selected for among teleost fish larvae.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody length 3acase studies 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3aphylogeny1 aLeis, Jeffrey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0603-34471 aCowman, Peter F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5977-53271 aMcCormick, Mark I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9289-16451 aRummer, Jodie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6067-58920 tFish and fisheries.g2021 Nov., v. 22, no. 6 p.1187-1212dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867077x1467-29607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.125803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245011000196300001600306520100700322592002801329596001801357596001301375596001601388596001601404596005101420650001801471650001301489650000901502650001801511650003301529650001301562653001801575653003201593653002501625653003901650653001801689700001701707700001401724700001801738700001701756700001401773700001601787700001301803700001201816700002001828773013001848856007901978852000902057655001202066IND60754772920221123033147.0211023e20210929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075477292DNAL7 a10.1515/ijfe-2020-00462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zeyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1173-729710aEvaluation of physico-chemical properties of tomato powder produced by an optimized freeze drying process  ap. 805-814.  aIn this study, the physico-chemical properties of tomato powder produced by an optimized freeze drying process (FDP) were evaluated. With the lycopene content as the dependent variable, the optimum FDP conditions (i.e., thermal cracking time of 62 s, ascorbic acid addition amount [0.13%], and particle size [Dv₉₀] of 163 μm) were obtained through response surface methodology (RSM). The results showed that the content of lycopene in the prepared tomato powder was higher than that in two commercial products. Aldehydes were the main components among 25 kinds of aromatic substances detected in tomato powder. The values of a * and a */b *, the hydration properties including water holding capacity (WHC) and oil binding capacity (OBC), and the content of total acid, ascorbic acid, and soluble solids were improved compared to commercial spray dried and freeze dried samples. All the above results suggested that FDP was an adequate procedure for the production of high-quality tomato powder.  aPublisher supplied data  a1704a07020094  aC2017070  a18030701161  a1808085MC77  aJZ2019YYPY0028aPA2019GDPK0084aPA2019GDZC0099 3aascorbic acid 3alycopene 3aoils 3aparticle size 3aresponse surface methodology 3atomatoes 0afreeze drying 0aphysico-chemical properties 0aprocess optimization 0aresponse surface methodology (RSM) 0atomato powder1 aWang, Haiyan1 aZhang, Li1 aXian, Zhaojun1 aLi, Honghong1 aHe, Yiwen1 aHui, Ailing1 aZhou, An1 aGuo, Li1 aZhang, Wencheng0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2021 Sept. 29, v. 17, no. 10 p.805-814dDe GruyterwJournal:2183x1556-37587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijfe-2020-00463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245018000175300001400355500001500369520102900384592002801413650001401441650001601455650001301471650002601484650002701510650002001537653002701557653002201584653002001606653003501626653001701661653001001678700002701688700002201715773009801737856008101835852000901916655001201925IND60085457120221118200226.0161024e20130615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008545712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bej.2013.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrigón, José Manuel10aSearching the best operational strategies for Rhizopus oryzae lipase production in Pichia pastoris Mut+ phenotype: Methanol limited or methanol non-limited fed-batch cultures?  ap. 47-54.  a2019-12-06  aTwo different operational strategies, methanol limited (MLFB) and methanol non-limited fed-batch (MNLFB) cultures, have been compared for the production of the recombinant Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) expressed in Pichia pastoris Mut+ phenotype. Yields, productivities and specific production rate in all MLFB conditions were very low, obtaining the best results at the lower specific growth rates. Similar results were obtained for MNLFB strategy at methanol set-point concentrations up to 2gl−1. However, for methanol set-points higher than 2gl−1 a significant increase in the production was observed. Methanol set-point of 3gl−1 was the optimum to maximize product yield (YP/X), both volumetric and specific productivity and mean specific production rate (qP,mean), although in terms of ROL production high values were obtained in the range of 3–10gl−1. An inhibitory effect of methanol on cell growth as well as slowness on ROL production during early induction phase was observed at concentration of 10gl−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphenotype 3acell growth 3amethanol 3aKomagataella pastoris 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aRhizopus oryzae 0aRhizopus oryzae lipase 0aFed-batch culture 0aPichia pastoris 0aRecombinant protein production 0aFermentation 0aPAOX11 aMontesinos, José Luis1 aValero, Francisco0 tBiochemical engineering journal.g2013 June 15, v. 75 p.47-54dElsevier B.V.x1369-703X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bej.2013.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014300159300001600302520146100318592002801779650002001807650001301827650004101840650001601881650001101897650002901908650001801937650001701955650001601972700002201988700002002010700002202030700002102052773010202073856007502175852000902250655001202259IND60533955420221120064009.0160802e20120119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053395542DNAL7 a10.1021/ef201346g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Luke S.10aCoextrusion of Zirconia–Iron Oxide Honeycomb Substrates for Solar-Based Thermochemical Generation of Carbon Monoxide for Renewable Fuels  ap. 712-721.  aCeramic honeycombs based on homogeneous composites of zirconia and iron oxide are formed using polymer-based coextrusion for testing in thermochemical reactors to generate CO for renewable fuels. The honeycomb substrates possess controlled surface areas and are processed using zirconia with 3 and 8 mol % yttria additions to investigate the influence of surface area and oxygen conductivity of the substrate on the CO generation properties. CO generation was tested using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer and a laboratory scale thermochemical reactor capable of precisely controlling temperature and gas conditions. Results showed that reaction temperature and reactant gas flow rate effect CO generation. The yttria content of the zirconia support phase was also found to have a significant impact on the long-term CO generation, improving iron oxide conversion from 41 to 58%. Yttria content did not markedly impact the short-term reaction properties. Increasing the surface area of the substrates, from 2.6 up to 8.5 cm², did not result in improvements in CO generation within the resolution of the test equipment. The substrates reacted by two distinct mechanisms, an initial, spontaneous surface reaction that changed over time to a diffusion-based mechanism utilizing reaction material from the bulk. These substrate systems exhibit the high reactivity necessary for large-scale thermochemical reactors, while being based on common materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3aceramics 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3airon oxides 3aoxygen 3arenewable energy sources 3aspectrometers 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aMiller, James E.,1 aHilmas, Greg E.1 aEvans, Lindsey R.1 aCorral, Erica L.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2012 Jan. 19, v. 26, no. 1 p.712-721dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef201346g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245007300175300001600248520111000264592002801374650001101402650001201413650001701425650001301442650001801455650001201473650001601485650003101501653003101532653001801563653003601581653002601617700002601643700003201669700002301701700002301724773011401747856008501861852000901946655001201955IND60610696920221119222417.0180829e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061069692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.09.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalar-García, M.J.10aIonic liquid technology to recover volatile organic compounds (VOCs)  ap. 484-499.  aVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) comprise a wide variety of carbon-based materials which are volatile at relatively low temperatures. Most of VOCs pose a hazard to both human health and the environment. For this reason, in the last years, big efforts have been made to develop efficient techniques for the recovery of VOCs produced from industry. The use of ionic liquids (ILs) is among the most promising separation technologies in this field. This article offers a critical overview on the use of ionic liquids for the separation of VOCs both in bulk and in immobilized form. It covers the most relevant works within this field and provides a global outlook on the limitations and future prospects of this technology. The extraction processes of VOCs by using different IL-based assemblies are described in detail and compared with conventional methods This review also underlines the advantages and limitations posed by ionic liquids according to the nature of the cation and the anions present in their structure and the stability of the membrane configurations in which ILs are used as liquid phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds 0aVolatile organic compounds 0aIonic liquids 0aSupported ionic liquid membrane 0aSeparation technology1 aOrtiz-Martínez, V.M.1 aHernández-Fernández, F.J.1 ade los Ríos, A.P.1 aQuesada-Medina, J.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2017 Jan. 05, v. 321 p.484-499dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.09.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016100158300002000319520163400339592002801973650001102001650001402012650001902026650002302045650001102068650001302079650001702092650001602109650002202125700001702147700001902164700001602183773012302199856007502322852000902397655001202406IND60558275020221119172524.0161113e20121025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055827502DNAL7 a10.1021/jp307365y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Chi Hoon10aThermal Treatment Effect on the Structure and Property Change between Hydroxy-Containing Polyimides (HPIs) and Thermally Rearranged Polybenzoxazole (TR-PBO)  ap. 12864-12877.  aIn this study, we report on the effect of thermal treatment on polyimide precursors (HPIs) and on the resulting thermally rearranged polybenzoxazole (TR-PBO) polymer membranes as investigated through the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For this purpose, we have first analyzed the structures of hydroxy-containing polyimides before thermal treatment and those of the thermally rearranged polybenzoxazoles after the thermal treatment, according to their temperature conditions. As expected, HPIs and TR-PBOs always show very limited motion of their polymer chains, indicated by the radius of gyration, due to their well-known thermal stability. In particular, the very rigid and stiff PBO linkages did not undergo significant change in their torsional angle distribution. On the other hand, in regards to intrachain movement, HPI chains were significantly affected by temperature. Their conformational changes were notably observed, which affected the distances between possible reaction sites, oxygen atoms in hydroxyl groups, and carbon atoms in the imido-ring. The free volume analysis, performed on both polymers and during thermal treatment, indicates that HPIs have a unimodal distribution of free volume areas, which partially coalesce in larger areas having, however, a relatively narrow size. Further, TR-PBO shows a bimodal cavity distribution, and after thermal treatment and TR reaction, the free volume structures in TR-PBO are maintained. The cavity size distributions determined by simulation were also consistent with free volume distributions determined by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aelectrons 3aheat treatment 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aTocci, Elena1 aLee, Young Moo1 aDrioli, E.,0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 25, v. 116, no. 42 p.12864-12877dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp307365y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008000176506011700256506007600373520093200449592002801381506003701409653002401446653002101470653002201491653002101513653002201534700002601556700002801582700002101610700001901631700002001650700002501670773010401695856008401799852000901883655001201892IND60761692720221207130816.0220606e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076169272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prmcm.2021.1000302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, Ogbodo Onyebuchi10aPhytotherapy: A promising approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease and the most common form of dementia, affecting more than 10 million people all over the world. Clinically, AD is characterized by progressive deficits in memory, cognitive impairment, and altered behavior. Although researches have largely continued, there is still no appropriate treatment option for disease-modifying AD. However, symptomatic treatment options exist. Medicinal plants have been used in different systems of medicine from ancient times for the treatment of diseases. Numerous herbs have been shown to improve brain function and may have a role to play in AD treatment. In this review, we provide a systematic review on the role of medicinal plants and herbs useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the effect of these herbs on hormones, herb-drug interactions as well as stability-related testing for the herbal pharmaceutical medicines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aMedicinal plants 0aPhytoconstituents 0aDrug interaction 0aStability studies1 aAmarachi, Ihim Stella1 aChinazom, Agbo Precious1 aAdaeze, Echezona1 aKale, Mayur B.1 aUmare, Mohit D.1 aUpaganlawar, Aman B.0 tPharmacological research.g2022 Mar., v. 2 p.100030-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28563x2667-14257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prmcm.2021.1000303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02142naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245014000171300001600311520093200327592002801259650001501287650001101302650001101313650003301324650001501357650001101372653001001383653001301393653002201406653001101428700003101439700001801470700001901488700003101507773013001538856007901668852000901747655001201756IND60754773020221121231224.0211023e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075477302DNAL7 a10.1515/ijfe-2020-02422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaghipour Zade, Maryam10aOptimization of slicing sugar beet for improving the purity of diffusion juice using response surface methodology and genetic algorithm  ap. 827-836.  aThe purity is accounted for one of the main characteristics of sugar beet juice in the sugar production process. In this regard, in the paper, the impact of slicing parameters including blade type, slicing angle from 0 to 90°, slicing thickness from 3 to 6 mm, and preheating duration from 3 to 15 min was studied on juice purity using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique was also employed to find the optimum values of variables to reach the highest juice purity. The results indicated that the quadratic model was the best model to predict juice purity. The Findings presented that as cossette thickness and slicing angle increased, the juice purity was improved. Optimization of the quadratic model by GA showed the best cossette thickness was 6 mm for both blades. The results of optimization indicated that 92.25 and 94.45% juice purities could be obtained from optimum conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ajuices 3amodels 3aresponse surface methodology 3asugar beet 3asugars 0ablade 0acossette 0agenetic algorithm 0apurity1 aAghkhani, Mohammad Hossein1 aRohani, Abbas1 aBehzad, Khalil1 aKosari-Moghaddam, Armaghan0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 17, no. 10 p.827-836dDe GruyterwJournal:2183x1556-37587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ijfe-2020-02423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011100167300001400278520130500292592002801597650001401625650002201639650001901661650001201680650001801692650001001710650001201720650001201732650002901744650001301773650001601786650001101802650001201813651001701825653002001842653002501862653001901887653002001906653001701926700001901943700001801962700002101980773012202001856008202123852000902205655001202214IND60083243120221120055625.0190318e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008324312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2013.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaschenko, M.A.10aReproduction-related effects of green alga Coccomyxa sp. infestation in the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus  ap. 86-95.  aThe effects of Coccomyxa sp. infestation on the reproductive characteristics of the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus from the north-western Pacific (Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan) are demonstrated in this study. The mussels were collected monthly from May to September of 2009, and the prevalence of females and males with green tissues was 39% and 47%, respectively. Overall, the green alga infection caused a mild effect on gametogenesis in the horse mussel. The dynamics of gonad development in the healthy and infected mussels during the study period was generally similar, with the spawning being partial and occurring from the beginning of June to the first half of September; total spawning was recorded at the end of this period. However, several negative reproduction-related effects of the green alga infestation were observed, i.e., general gonadal underdevelopment, which was apparent from significant decrease in the acinus areas of the ovaries and testes and an increase in the connective tissue layer between the acini, a delay in some stages of the reproductive cycle and production of decreased number of spermatozoa and large vitellogenic oocytes, especially in the early spawning period (June). All of these results suggest a reduced reproductive output for the infected mussels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccomyxa 3aModiolus modiolus 3aanimal ovaries 3afemales 3agametogenesis 3amales 3amussels 3aoocytes 3areproductive performance 3aspawning 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 3atissues 3aSea of Japan 0aSymbiotic algae 0aCoccomyxa parasitica 0aMytilus edulis 0aBivalve mollusc 0aReproduction1 aKovaleva, A.L.1 aSyasina, I.G.1 aKukhlevsky, A.D.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2013 May, v. 113, no. 1 p.86-95dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2013.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245013300184300001600317520198400333592002802317650001402345650001702359650000902376650001902385650001802404650001902422650001102441650001902452650001102471650002102482650002202503650001202525653003202537653002402569700001802593700002302611773013602634856008102770852000902851655001202860IND60654875420221120125715.0190726e20160114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065487542DNAL7 a265226662pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145150042372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJessri, Mahsa10aEvaluation of different methods to handle misreporting in obesity research: evidence from the Canadian national nutrition survey  ap. 147-159.  aThe association of dietary exposures with health outcomes may be attenuated or reversed as a result of energy intake (EI) misreporting. This study evaluated several methods for dealing with implausible recalls when analysing the association between dietary factors and obesity. We examined data from 16 187 Canadians aged ≥12 years in the nationally representative Canadian Community Health Survey 2.2. Under- and over-reporting were defined as the ratio of EI:estimated energy requirement <0·7 and >1·42, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression-generalised logit model was conducted to test the utility of different methods for handling misreporting, including (a) adjusting for variables related to misreporting, (b) excluding misreported recalls, (c) adjusting for reporting groups (under-, plausible and over-reporters), (d) adjusting for propensity score and (e) stratifying the analyses by reporting groups. In the basic model, EI showed a negative association with overweight (OR 0·988; 95 % CI 0·979, 0·998) and obesity (OR 0·989; 95 % CI 0·977, 0·999). Similarly, the association between total energy density and overweight (OR 0·670; 95 % CI 0·487, 0·923) and obesity (OR 0·709; 95 % CI 0·495, 1·016) was inverse. Among all methods of handling misreporting, adjusting for the reporting status revealed the most satisfactory results, where a positive association between EI and overweight (OR 1·037; 95 % CI 1·019, 1·055) and obesity (OR 1·109; 95 % CI 1·082, 1·137) was observed (P<0·0001), as well as direct positive associations between energy density and percentage energy from solid fats and added sugars with obesity (P<0·05). The results of this study can help advance knowledge about the relationship between dietary variables and obesity and demonstrate to researchers and nutrition policy makers the importance of adjusting for recall plausibility in obesity research, which is highly relevant in light of global obesity epidemic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanadians 3aadded sugars 3adiet 3aenergy density 3aenergy intake 3ahealth surveys 3alipids 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3anutrition policy 3anutrition surveys 3aobesity 0aImplausible dietary recalls 0aEnergy misreporting1 aLou, Wendy Y.1 aL’Abbé, Mary R.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2016 Jan. 14, v. 115, no. 1 p.147-159dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145150042373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245010600161300001800267520048600285592002800771650002300799650002600822650001100848650001100859650001900870650001600889700003000905700002500935773012800960856007201088852000901160655001201169IND60657370620221116233138.0190816e20030417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065737062DNAL7 a10.1039/b300635b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizoguchi, Hiroshi10aOptical and electrical properties of the wide gap, n-type semiconductors: ZnBi₂O₆ and MgBi₂O₆  ap. 1084-1085.  aCharacterization of polycrystalline samples of the trirutile oxides ZnBi₂O₆ and MgBi₂O₆ reveals temperature independent conductivity (0.4 and 0.01 S cm⁻¹), a negative Seebeck coefficient (−0.035 and −0.025 mV K⁻¹), and an optical band gap that falls at the low energy end of visible region (1.7 and 1.8 eV), this combination of attributes, indicating that these compounds are degenerate n-type semiconductors, has not previously been observed in a Bi⁵⁺ oxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aelectrical properties 3aenergy 3aoxides 3asemiconductors 3atemperature1 aBhuvanesh, Nattamai S.

Drilling of CFRP, though a challenging task, is being performed successfully at low spindle speeds. However high speed drilling in CFRP thin laminates has not been explored much. This paper reports an experimental investigation of a full factorial design performed on thin CFRP laminates using K20 carbide drill by varying the drilling parameters such as spindle speed and feed rate to determine optimum cutting conditions. The hole quality parameters analyzed include hole diameter, circularity, peel-up delamination and push-out delamination. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out for hole quality parameters and their contribution rates were determined. Genetic Algorithm (GA) methodology was used in the multiple objective optimization (using MATLAB R2010a software) to find the optimum cutting conditions for defect free drilling. Tool life of the K20 carbide drill was predicted at optimized cutting speed and feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalysis of variance 3acarbon 3acomputer software 3acutting 3adelamination 3adrilling 3amanufacturing1 aPrabukarthi, A.1 aRamanathan, Arun1 aElanghovan, N.1 aSenthil Kumar, M.1 aZitoune, R.q(Redouane),1 aDavim, J.P.0 tComposites.g2012 June, v. 43, no. 4 p.1791-1799dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.01.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03599naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100001700182245006800199506007600267520188900343592002802232506003702260650002302297650001902320650002802339650001902367650001402386650001002400650001202410650002102422650002202443650001102465650001502476650001602491650001802507650001302525650001402538650002202552650001902574650002002593650001202613650000902625650002302634650002202657653002702679653001402706653000902720700001602729700002202745700002002767700001902787773010702806856007502913852000902988655001202997IND60652527520221207104325.0190713s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065252752DNAL7 a10.1017/jns.2018.162doi7 aPMC61610132pmcid7 a302759482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoran, L. J.10aNutrition and listeriosis during pregnancy: a systematic review  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aListeriosis is a rare but severe foodborne illness which is more common in populations such as pregnant women, and can result in serious complications including miscarriage, prematurity, maternal and neonatal sepsis, and death in the newborn. Population recommendations exist for specific foods and food preparation practices to reduce listeriosis risk during pregnancy. The aim of the present systematic review was to assess the association between listeriosis and these practices during pregnancy to confirm appropriateness of these recommendations. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science Core Collection, included articles’ references, and contacted clinical experts. All databases were searched until July 2017. Case–control and cohort studies were included which assessed pregnant women or their newborn offspring with known listeriosis status and a nutritional exposure consistent with international population recommendations for minimising listeriosis. Outcomes included listeriosis with or without pregnancy outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed through the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Results were described narratively due to clinical heterogeneity in differences in nutritional exposures. Eleven articles comprising case–control or cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria. Cases of maternal, fetal or neonate listeriosis were more likely to have consumed high-risk dairy products, meat products or some fruits during pregnancy in comparison with women without listeriosis. Cases of listeriosis were more likely to have consumed foods that are highlighted in population guidelines to avoid to minimise listeriosis in comparison with those without listeriosis during pregnancy. Further research is warranted assessing means of improving the reach, uptake and generalisability of population guidelines for reducing listeriosis during pregnancy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabortion (animals) 3acohort studies 3across-sectional studies 3adairy products 3adatabases 3adeath 3aexperts 3afood preparation 3afoodborne illness 3afruits 3aguidelines 3alisteriosis 3ameat products 3aneonates 3anutrition 3apregnancy outcome 3apregnant women 3apremature birth 3aprogeny 3arisk 3asepsis (infection) 3asystematic review 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aPregnancy 0aFood1 aVerwiel, Y.1 aBahri Khomami, M.1 aRoseboom, T.

Twelve suites of four paddocks (farmlets) were seeded with a mixture of resistant and susceptible isolates of both Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) circumcincta calculated to yield a 95% reduction in faecal nematode egg count (FEC) after treatment with ivermectin. Each year for three years the farmlets were stocked in the spring with mobs of lambs which were treated five times at 28-day intervals with either ivermectin or an ivermectin+levamisole combination. In addition, in half the mobs the heaviest 10% of lambs remained untreated at each treatment occasion, resulting in a 2×2 factorial treatment structure (i.e. two drench types×two percentage treated) with three complete replicates. The development of resistance to ivermectin, and at the end to levamisole, was measured by larval development assays (LDA) and worm counts from treated and untreated tracer lambs. For T. colubriformis the development of resistance to ivermectin, as measured by tracer lamb worm burdens, was delayed by treatment with the combination and by leaving 10% of lambs untreated. In addition, the interaction between these factors approached significance (p=0.052). Similarly, results of the LDAs indicated a slower development of resistance when lambs were treated with the combination and when 10% of lambs were left untreated. For T. circumcincta, results were compromised by the rapid development of resistance, which appears to be the result of low viability in the field of the susceptible isolate used to contaminate the pastures. Although a small delay in the development of resistance to ivermectin was indicated, this was off-set by an increase in the level of resistance to levamisole. A post-study modelling experiment simulating the conditions of the field study and the starting efficacies for the two nematode species produced equivalent outputs to those measured in the field. Overall, results support the conclusions that use of combination anthelmintics and deliberately increasing ‘refugia’ of unselected genotypes will slow the development of anthelmintic resistance. However, as indicated in modelling studies, once resistance to all the constituent actives is well developed (efficacy<70%) the value of combinations for slowing the development of resistance is largely lost.  aPublisher supplied data 3arefuge habitats 3alevamisole 3alabeling techniques 3asimulation models 3aivermectin 3aOstertagia 3aviability 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3apastures 3alarval development 3aspring 3afecal egg count 3agenotype 3aTeladorsagia 3alambs 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aComputer Simulation 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aIvermectinxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aModels, Biological 2aNematode Infectionsxdrug therapyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitology. 2aTime Factors 0aoutputs1 aWaghorn, T.S.1 aMiller, C.M.1 aCandy, P.M.1 aOliver, A.-M.B.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2012 June 8, v. 187, no. 1-2 p.285-294dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008500168300001600253520132500269592002801594650002301622650001301645650002101658650001601679700003701695700001901732700006001751700006401811773012001875856008301995852000902078655001202087IND60762605920221120071139.0220110e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076260592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c011982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Md. D.10aNonionic Polymer with Flat Upper Critical Solution Temperature Behavior in Water  ap. 174-181.  aWe rationally designed a monomer that when polymerized formed a well-defined nonionic polymer [poly(2-(methacryloyloxy) ethylureido glycinamide), PMEGA] by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer with a flat and tunable upper critical solution temperature (UCST) in water. The monomer was made in one pot from commercially available compounds and with ease of purification. Strong hydrogen-bonding side groups on the polymer produced sharp coil-to-globule transitions upon cooling below its UCST. Ideal random copolymers produced with butyl methacrylate also showed flat UCST profiles, in which the UCST increased with a greater butyl methacrylate copolymer composition from 7 to 65 °C. In the presence of NaCl, the UCST decreased linearly with NaCl concentration due to the “salting-in” effect, and it was found that the slopes from the linear decrease of UCST were nearly identical for all copolymer compositions. This new polymer and its copolymers support the hypothesis that strong hydrogen bonding between the side groups allowed the flat UCST to be readily tuned with a high level of predictability. We postulate that this polymer system may provide wide biological applicability similar to that found for the well-used flat lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide).  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3atemperature1 aGrandes Reyes, Carlos Fitzgerald1 aZhang, Changhe1 aChen, Sung-Po R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4257-38891 aMonteiro, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5624-71150 tBiomacromolecules.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 23, no. 1 p.174-181dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c011983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013400156300001600290520130800306592002801614650001601642650001201658650001501670650002101685650001501706650002201721650001101743650001201754650001301766650000901779700001301788773010001801856007401901852000901975655001201984IND60440425220221118063942.0151024e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044042522DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028265692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽižka, Z.10aQuantitative assessment of cell damagein situ: Electron microprobe X-ray analysis of model organisms treated with noxious species  ap. 530-532.  aThe existing set of methods for assessing toxicity of noxas, based on experiments with whole animals (subclinical toxicity, toxicokinetics, carcinogenity, teratogenity, neurotoxicologyetc.) does not provide much information about cellular and subcellular effects such compounds may exert. We suggest to complement the current methodology by combining a traditional morphological observation in an electron microscope with a spectroscopic method of electron microprobe X-ray analysis (or X-ray microanalysis). The latter makes it possible to measure concentrations of chemical elements in invidividual cells and organelles and effects of noxas can thus be assessed (i) at subcellular level, (ii) directlyin situ and (iii) quantitatively. Concentrations of biologically important elements such as phosphorus, sulfur or zinc were measured in individual organelles in both intact and noxa-treated tissues, thus offering a possibility of comparing the effects of various noxious species at subcellular level (with the noxa previously applied to whole tissue or animal). The suggested correlation of analytical and morphological information may also provide new insights into cellular targeting of noxas (and potentially also drugs) as some organelles appear to be much more susceptible to damage than others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanimals 3aorganelles 3apharmacokinetics 3aphosphorus 3aspectral analysis 3asulfur 3atissues 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aPelc, R.0 tFolia microbiologica.g1997 Oct., v. 42, no. 5 p.530-532dSpringer Netherlandsx0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF028265693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245015300195300001800348500002000366506007600386520154900462592002802011506003702039650002402076650001702100650001802117650001702135650001102152650001202163700002202175700002602197700005202223773013402275856007302409852000902482655001202491IND60649993720221207111114.0190709e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064999372DNAL7 a10.3390/nu70953702doi7 aPMC45865652pmcid7 a263899492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBos, Colin10aConsumer Acceptance of Population-Level Intervention Strategies for Healthy Food Choices: The Role of Perceived Effectiveness and Perceived Fairness  ap. 7842-7862.  aJournal Article  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study investigates acceptance of intervention strategies for low-calorie snack choices that vary regarding the effect they have on consumers’ freedom of choice (providing information, guiding choice through (dis)incentives, and restricting choice). We examine the mediating effects of perceived effectiveness and perceived fairness, and the moderating effects of barriers to choose low-calorie snacks and perceived responsibility for food choice. Data was collected through an online survey, involving three waves that were completed over a seven week timespan. Information was collected on barriers and perceived responsibility, and evaluations of a total of 128 intervention strategies with varying levels of intrusiveness that were further systematically varied in terms of source, location, approach/avoidance, type, and severity. A total of 1173 respondents completed all three waves. We found that the effect of intervention intrusiveness on acceptance was mediated by the perceived personal- and societal effectiveness, and the perceived fairness of interventions. For barriers and perceived responsibility, only main effects on intervention-specific beliefs were found. Government interventions were accepted less than interventions by food manufacturers. In conclusion, the present study shows that acceptance of interventions depends on perceptions of personal- and societal effectiveness and fairness, thereby providing novel starting points for increasing acceptance of both existing and new food choice interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood choices 3afood industry 3ahealthy diet 3asnacks 3asurveys1 aLans, Ivo Van Der1 aVan Rijnsoever, Frank1 aTrijp, Hans vanq(Johannes Cornelia Maria van),0 tNutrients.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 7, no. 9 p.7842-7862dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70953703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005900169300001600228520199000244592002802234650002302262650001302285650001902298650001902317650002002336650001302356650001402369650001802383650002102401650000902422650001402431650001102445650002402456650001402480650001302494650001202507650001802519650002002537650001302557700002202570700002702592700002102619700001802640700001902658700001702677773009802694856008102792990002302873852000902896655001202905IND60099299320150406000000.0141105e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009929932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÅström, Mats E.10aAttenuation of rare earth elements in a boreal estuary  ap. 105-119.  aThis study focuses on attenuation of rare earth elements (REE) when a boreal creek, acidified and loaded with REE and other metals as a result of wetland drainage, empties into a brackish-water estuary (salinity<6‰). Surface water was collected in a transect from the creek mouth to the outer estuary, and settling (particulate) material in sediment traps moored at selected locations in the estuary. Ultrafiltration, high-resolution ICP-MS and modeling were applied on the waters, and a variety of chemical reagents were used to extract metals from the settling material. Aluminium, Fe and REE transported by the acidic creek were extensively removed in the inner/central estuary where the acidic water was neutralised, whereas Mn was relatively persistent in solution and thus redistributed to particles and deposited further down the estuary. The REE removal was caused by several contemporary mechanisms: co-precipitation with oxyhydroxides (mainly Al but also Fe), complexation with flocculating humic substances and sorption to suspended particles. Down estuary the dissolved REE pool, remaining after removal, was fractionated: the <1kDa pool became depleted in the middle REE and the colloidal (0.45μm–1kDa) pool depleted in the middle and heavy REE. This fractionation was controlled by the removal process, such that those REE with highest affinity for the settling particles became most depleted in the remaining dissolved pool. Modeling, based on Visual MINTEQ version 3.0 and the Stockholm Humic Model after revision and updating, predicted that the dissolved (<0.45μm) REE pool in the estuary is bound almost entirely to humic substances. Acid sulphate soils, the source of the REE and other metals in the creek water, are widespread on coastal plains worldwide and therefore the REE attenuation patterns and mechanisms identified in the studied estuary are relevant for recognition of similar geochemical processes and conditions in a variety of coastal locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid sulfate soils 3aaluminum 3abrackish water 3acoastal plains 3acoprecipitation 3adrainage 3aestuaries 3afractionation 3ahumic substances 3airon 3amanganese 3amodels 3arare earth elements 3asediments 3asorption 3astreams 3asurface water 3aultrafiltration 3awetlands1 aÖsterholm, Peter1 aGustafsson, Jon Petter1 aNystrand, Miriam1 aPeltola, Pasi1 aNordmyr, Linda1 aBoman, Anton0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 96 p.105-119dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017300166300001600339520113900355592002801494650002101522650001401543650002001557650002501577650001501602650001101617650001501628650001801643650002101661700001601682700001701698700001801715700001801733700001801751700001301769700005501782700005801837700005801895773012001953856008302073852000902156655001202165IND60762606020221120102716.0220110e20211210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076260602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.1c012032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Dongning10aHighly Sensitive Multifunctional Electronic Skin Based on Nanocellulose/MXene Composite Films with Good Electromagnetic Shielding Biocompatible Antibacterial Properties  ap. 182-195.  aElectronic skin has aroused extensive research interest due to high similarity with human skin. Realizing a multifunctional electronic skin that is highly consistent with skin functions and endowed with more other functions is now a more urgent need and important challenge. Here, we use 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibril (TOCN) dispersion and highly conductive Ti₃C₂TX dispersion to prepare TOCN/Ti₃C₂TX composite film through vacuum-assisted filtration. The obtained composite film imitating the nacre-like lamellar structure of natural shells has good mechanical properties (124.6 MPa of tensile strength). Meanwhile, the composite film also showed excellent electromagnetic shielding performance (36 dB), biocompatibility, and antibacterial properties. In addition, the piezoresistive sensor assembled from the composite film exhibited a high sensitivity (11.6 kPa–¹), fast response and recovery time (≤10 ms), ultralow monitoring limit (0.2 Pa), and long-term stability (>10 000 cycles). It also could detect human daily activities such as finger bent, chewing, and so on.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acellulose 3acomposite films 3aelectronic equipment 3afiltration 3ahumans 3ananofibers 3askin (animal) 3atensile strength1 aGao, Yujiao1 aSong, Yiheng1 aZhu, Hengfeng1 aZhang, Linjun1 aXie, Yuanyuan1 aShi, Hui1 aShi, Zhuqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2279-00101 aYang, Quanling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7013-419X1 aXiong, Chuanxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0878-08840 tBiomacromolecules.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 23, no. 1 p.182-195dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.1c012033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002500154245016600179300001600345500002400361520152300385650002501908650002201933650001701955650001701972650001001989650001401999650001102013650001102024650001502035650001402050650001402064650000902078650002302087650001402110650001002124650001202134650004702146650003702193650003802230650001002268650001402278650006302292650001702355651001802372651003302390700003102423700002102454700002102475700001902496700002602515773012102541852000902662856007502671655001202746IND4457895020221120120951.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445789502DNAL7 a214853842pmid7 a10.1603/ME100602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrinkerhoff, R.

Lyme disease risk in the United States is highest in the Northeast and in the upper Midwest where I. scapularis ticks are most abundant. Because birds might be important to the range expansion of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi, we explored spatial variation in patterns of I. scapularis parasitism on songbirds, as well as B. burgdorferi infection in bird-derived I. scapularis larvae. We sampled birds at 23 sites in the eastern United States to describe seasonal patterns of I. scapularis occurrence on birds, and we screened a subset of I. scapularis larvae for presence of B. burgdorferi. Timing of immature I. scapularis occurrence on birds is consistent with regional variation in host-seeking activity with a generally earlier peak in larval parasitism on birds in the Midwest. Significantly more I. scapularis larvae occurred on birds that were contemporaneously parasitized by nymphs in the Midwest than the Northeast, and the proportion of birds that yielded B. burgdorferi-infected larvae was also higher in the Midwest. We conclude that regional variation in immature I. scapularis phenology results in different temporal patterns of parasitism on birds, potentially resulting in differential importance of birds to B. burgdorferi transmission dynamics among regions. 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes scapularis 3aLyme disease 3ahost seeking 3ahosts 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3anymphs 3aparasitism 3apathogens 3aphenology 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3asongbirds 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aBorrelia burgdorferixphysiology 2aIxodesxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aNymph 2aSongbirds 2aTick Infestationsxmicrobiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aTime Factors 3aUnited States 0aNorth Americaxepidemiology.1 aFolsom-O'Keefe, Corrine M.1 aStreby, Henry M.1 aBent, Stephen J.1 aTsao, Kimberly1 aDiuk-Wasser, Maria A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2011 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.422-428dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME100603Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03589naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015800167300001400325520211700339592002802456650001602484650001502500650001202515650001102527650002002538650002002558650001102578650001702589650001002606650000902616650001202625650001902637650001502656650001402671650001702685650001202702650003702714700001902751700001902770700002202789700002202811700002502833700001602858773009602874856008102970990002303051852000903074655001203083IND60099299520221121053742.0141105e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009929952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFliegel, Daniel10aCharacterization of alteration textures in Cretaceous oceanic crust (pillow lava) from the N-Atlantic (DSDP Hole 418A) by spatially-resolved spectroscopy  ap. 80-93.  aThe habit, mineralogy, crystallography, and Fe speciation of tubular and granular alteration textures in basaltic glass recovered from DSDP Hole 418A, which have previously been associated with biologically mediated alteration, were investigated using an integrated suite of microscopic and spectroscopic approaches in order to shine light on their formation and mineralization history. Two different analytical approaches were used: (1) micro scale investigations with conventional petrographic optical microcopy and microscale X-ray fluorescence mapping and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and (2) nano scale analyses with FIB (focused ion beam milling) to prepare cross-sections for TEM (transmission electron microscopy), EELS (electron energy loss spectroscopy), and STXM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) analyses. The integrated data show that tubular and granular textures are similar in chemical, mineralogical and structural habit. Both granular and tubular alteration textures show a marked transition from ferrous iron in the glass matrix to ferric iron in the textures. Granular and tubular textures are filled with sheet silicates of similar chemistry, and both exhibit thin amorphous alteration rims ∼10–20nm wide. The alteration rims are typically depleted in Ca and Fe. Ca is enriched at the contact between the secondary mineralization and the alteration rims, whereas Fe is enriched throughout the alteration features and is mainly present as Feᴵᴵᴵ in contrast to Feᴵᴵ in the host glass. Carbon is enriched only in a few areas, and could possibly be of organic origin but is not bound in carbonate. The mineralization of the features follows the sequence: dissolution of the glass; formation of a leached amorphous rim; mineralizing the cavities by smectide type clays and subsequently congruent growing of the texture diameter by diffusing of the elements through the alteration layer. None of the features could be linked solely to a biogenic origin and hence the biogenicity of the textures can neither be refuted nor supported by this micro- and nano-scale data set.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acrystallography 3adata collection 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aglass 3airon 3amilling 3amineralization 3amineralogy 3asilicates 3aspectroscopy 3atexture 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKnowles, Emily1 aWirth, Richard1 aTempleton, Alexis1 aStaudigel, Hubert1 aMuehlenbachs, Karlis1 aFurnes, H.,0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 96 p.80-93dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245011700173300001800290520101700308592002801325650001601353650002401369650002601393650001501419650001301434650003301447650001301480700002801493700001801521700002701539773008401566856008901650990002301739852000901762655001201771IND60095961420221121103857.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009596142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoustgani, A.10aOptimizing the mechanical properties of electrospun polycaprolactone and nanohydroxyapatite composite nanofibers  ap. 1830-1836.  aInterest in fabrication of nanofibers using electrospinning has recently increased due to the ability to produce fibers with controlled structures, orientations, and dimensions. Tensile properties of electrospun fibers have not been widely investigated due to the difficulties in handling nanofibers and measuring low load for deformation. In this study, the effects of process parameters on the mechanical properties of electrospun composite nanofibers of polycaprolactone and nanohydroxyapatite were experimentally investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to design the experiments at the settings of solution concentration, voltage, spinning distance and flow rate. Mechanical properties of the electrospun fibers were correlated with these variables using a third order polynomial function. It was found that polymer concentration, voltage and spinning distance were the most effective parameters. The predicted mechanical properties were in good agreement with the experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aexperimental design 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3aresponse surface methodology 3aspinning1 aVasheghani-Farahani, E.1 aSoleimani, M.1 aHashemi-Najafabadi, S.0 tComposites.g2012 June, v. 43, no. 4 p.1830-1836dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.01.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014900171300001200320520154300332592002801875650002701903650001901930650002901949650001601978650002701994650001202021650002202033650001102055650001902066650002102085650001402106650001302120650001302133700002102146700002702167700002402194700002202218700001802240700002102258773012502279856008102404852000902485655001202494IND60523759020221119111701.0160807e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052375902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-016-2096-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchillaci, Domenico12aA peptide from human β thymosin as a platform for the development of new anti-biofilm agents for Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ap. 124.  aConventional antibiotics might fail in the treatment of biofilm-associated infections causing infection recurrence and chronicity. The search for antimicrobial peptides has been performed with the aim to discover novel anti-infective agents active on pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm associated forms. The fragment 9–19 of human thymosin β4 was studied through 1 μs MD simulation. Two main conformations of the peptide were detected, both constituted by a central hydrophobic core and by the presence of peripheral charged residues suggesting a possible mechanism of interaction with two models of biological membranes, related to eukaryotic or bacterial membrane respectively. In addition, the peptide was chemically synthesized and its antimicrobial activity was tested in vitro against planktonic and biofilm form of a group of reference strains of Staphylococcus spp. and one P. aeruginosa strain. The human thymosin β4 fragment EIEKFDKSKLK showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcal strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 at concentrations from 12.5 to 6.2 mg/ml and inhibited biofilm formation at sub-inhibitory concentrations (3.1–0.75 mg/ml). The activity of the fragment in inhibiting biofilm formation, could be due to the conformations highlighted by the MD simulations, suggesting its interaction with the bacterial membrane. Human thymosin β4 fragment can be considered a promising lead compound to develop novel synthetic or recombinant derivatives with improved pharmaceutical potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abiofilm 3abiological models 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3apathogens 3aplankton 3athymosin1 aSpinello, Angelo1 aCusimano, Maria Grazia1 aCascioferro, Stella1 aBarone, Giampaolo1 aVitale, Maria1 aArizza, Vincenzo0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.124-124dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-016-2096-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010300163300001600266520114300282592002801425650001201453650001201465650002101477650001801498650001701516650002401533650002101557650001601578650001901594700001201613773012001625856008201745852000901827655001201836IND60616903620221121032755.0181021e200011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061690362DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517500070011042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Weilin10aCotton Fabric Strength Loss from Treatment with Polycarboxylic Acids for Durable Press Performance  ap. 957-961.  aIn this study, cotton fabrics are treated at different curing temperatures with different concentrations of 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) catalyzed with sodium hy pophosphite (SHP). Strength retention and wrinkle recovery angle (WRA) are tested, and the results show that high curing temperature and high BTCA concentration will reduce fabric strength and increase WRA. Regression models show that WRA has a close negative linear relation with the strength of the treated fabric. Both WRA and fabric strength are closely related with curing temperature and BTCA concentration. When the treated samples are further treated with 3% sodium hydroxide solution, fabric strength recovers in differing degrees and WRA decreases to the level of the control sample. Recoverable strength is assumed to be mostly induced by intramacromolecular crosslinking in the fibers, and unrecoverable strength is assumed to be due to the acidity of the treatment solution. The ratio of recoverable to unrecoverable strength shows that when curing temperature is around 160°C, strength loss due to the acidity of the treating solution is minimized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abutanes 3acarboxylic acids 3acotton fabric 3acrosslinking 3aregression analysis 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3atextile fibers1 aYi, Li,0 tTextile research journal.g2000 Nov., v. 70, no. 11 p.957-961dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517500070011043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04163naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245013900176300001500315520258600330592002802916650001202944650002002956650001202976650001202988650003903000650001603039650003103055650001903086650001803105650001403123650000703137650001803144650002203162650001803184650001903202650003703221650001203258651001203270700002403282700002203306700001803328700001503346700002103361700001903382700002203401773009703423856008103520990002303601852000903624655001203633IND60099299620221121053852.0141105e20121101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009929962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrawczyk-Bärsch, Evelyn10aImmobilization of uranium in biofilm microorganisms exposed to groundwater seeps over granitic rock tunnel walls in Olkiluoto, Finland  ap. 94-104.  aIn an underground rock characterization facility, the ONKALO tunnel in Finland, massive 5–10-mm thick biofilms were observed attached to tunnel walls where groundwater was seeping from bedrock fractures at a depth of 70m. In laboratory experiments performed in a flow cell with detached biofilms to study the effect of uranium on the biofilm, uranium was added to the circulating groundwater (CGW) obtained from the fracture feeding the biofilm. The final uranium concentration in the CGW was adjusted to 4.25×10⁻⁵M, in the range expected from a leaking spent nuclear fuel (SNF) canister in a future underground repository. The effects were investigated using microelectrodes to measure pH and Eₕ, time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM), and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) studies and thermodynamic calculations were utilized as well. The results indicated that the studied biofilms constituted their own microenvironments, which differed significantly from that of the CGW. A pH of 5.37 was recorded inside the biofilm, approximately 3.5units lower than the pH observed in the CGW, due to sulfide oxidation to sulfuric acid in the biofilm. Similarly, the Eₕ of +73mV inside the biofilm was approximately 420mV lower than the Eₕ measured in the CGW. Adding uranium increased the pH in the biofilm to 7.27 and reduced the Eₕ to −164mV. The changes of Eₕ and pH influenced the bioavailability of uranium, since microbial metabolic processes are sensitive to metals and their speciation. EF-TEM investigations indicated that uranium in the biofilm was immobilized intracellularly in microorganisms by the formation of metabolically mediated uranyl phosphate, similar to needle-shaped autunite (Ca[UO₂]₂[PO₄]₂·2–6H₂O) or meta-autunite (Ca[UO₂]₂[PO₄]₂·10–12H₂O). In contrast, TRLFS studies of the contaminated CGW identified aqueous uranium carbonate species, likely (Ca₂UO₂[CO₃]₃), formed due to the high concentration of carbonate in the CGW. The results agreed with thermodynamic calculations of the theoretically predominant field of uranium species, formed in the uranium-contaminated CGW at the measured geochemical parameters. This investigation clearly demonstrated that biological systems must be considered as a part of natural systems that can significantly influence radionuclide behavior. The results improve our understanding of the mechanisms of biofilm response to radionuclides in relation to safety assessments of SNF repositories.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3abioavailability 3abiofilm 3acalcium 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agroundwater 3alaboratory experimentation 3amicroorganisms 3anuclear fuels 3aoxidation 3apH 3aradionuclides 3asafety assessment 3asulfuric acid 3athermodynamics 3atransmission electron microscopy 3auranium 3aFinland1 aLünsdorf, Heinrich1 aPedersen, Karsten1 aArnold, Thuro1 aBok, Frank1 aSteudtner, Robin1 aLehtinen, Anne1 aBrendler, Vinzenz0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 96 p.94-104dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013500168300001500303500001500318520184400333592002802177650002002205650002502225650001002250650001102260650002302271650001502294650002002309650001202329650001802341650002102359650001502380650001102395650001402406650001102420650001502431650001502446650001102461650001102472650001202483651001302495651001102508653001002519700002302529700003002552773009302582856008102675852000902756655001202765IND4399211920221121060922.0151024e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439921192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-007-9060-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Bruce G.10aAutotrophic energy sources for Paracheirodon axelrodi (Osteichthyes, Characidae) in the middle Negro River, Central Amazon, Brazil  ap. 95-103.  a2019-12-05  aThe cardinal tetra (Paracheirodon axelrodi) is the most abundant species of the Brazilian ornamental fish trade, constituting more than 80% of the ornamental fish collected in the middle Negro River basin. Stable isotope analyses were used to identify the autotrophic carbon sources and trophic position for the cardinal in relation to the plant groups at the base of its foodchain. Filamentous algae, tree and plant leaves and cardinals were collected in stream habitats, flooded forest and interfluvial swamps (campos) during peak flood, falling water and low water periods. δ¹⁵N values of the cardinal in relation to the plants at the base of the food chain indicated a trophic position of omnivore. Values of δ¹³C for the plants ranged from −43.1 to −26.4‰, with averages of −37.6, −30.4, and −29.4‰ for filamentous algae, flooded forest leaves, and campo leaves, respectively. The δ¹³C values for the cardinal ranged from −35.0 to −27.9‰, with an average of −31.4‰. Relative contributions of plants to fish carbon were estimated in a two end-member mixing model which determined that the leaves (flooded forest and campo leaves combined) and filamentous algae had average relative contributions to cardinal carbon of 71% and 29%, respectively. However, seasonal variation in the relative contributions was encountered throughout the hydrological cycle. The cardinals least enriched in ¹³C were encountered in November during the falling water period, indicating that they had perhaps recently migrated down from interfluvial campos where filamentous algae production is significant. Considering that algal production has been reported to be less than 1% of total primary production in the Negro River, these results could suggest some evidence of selective herbivory in the cardinal’s food chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aornamental fish 3aprimary productivity 3atrees 3acarbon 3aseasonal variation 3awatersheds 3astable isotopes 3aforests 3afish industry 3ahydrologic cycle 3afood chain 3aleaves 3aomnivores 3aenergy 3aherbivores 3aCharacidae 3aswamps 3afloods 3astreams 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aAlgae1 aForsberg, Bruce R.1 aThomé-Souza, Mario J.

The objective of this research was to tentatively identify proteins that are differentially expressed in grapevines and involved in disease development or defense responses to Xf-inoculation. We comparatively analyzed proteins differentially expressed in Xf-inoculated grape stems using a pair of siblings of 9621-67 (highly susceptible) and 9621-94 (highly resistant) from a cross of Vitis rupestrisÂ ÃÂ Vitis arizonica. Total proteins were extracted from the stems of uninoculated controls and Xf-inoculated plants at 1, 6, and 12 weeks after inoculation, separated by a 2D-PAGE system, and spots representing differentially expressed proteins were analyzed and tentatively identified using LC/MS/MS. Protein identification was performed using BLASTp and tBLASTn against NCBI non-redundant protein databases and EST databases, respectively. Ten tentatively identified proteins were differentially expressed at different time points after inoculation. A thaumatin-like protein and the pathogenesis-related protein 10 from both genotypes, and the 40S ribosomal protein S25 from the susceptible genotype were up-regulated in response to Xf-inoculation. Furthermore, the expression of the thaumatin-like protein increased sharply 12 weeks post-inoculation in the PD-resistant genotype only. Three heat shock proteins, 17.9Â kDa class II, protein 18 and 21 were highly expressed in healthy tissues compared with those in tissues infected with Xf, and heat shock protein 21 was not detectable in the Xf-inoculated PD-susceptible genotype. In addition, a down-regulated putative ripening related protein was found in the Xf-inoculated PD-susceptible genotype. Glycoprotein and formate dehydrogenase were identified in the PD-resistant genotype and their expression was constant during plant development. A putative GTP-binding protein was down-regulated in the PD-susceptible genotype. Our results revealed that differential expression of proteins in response to Xf-inoculation was genotype and tissue development stage dependent. The specific roles of these candidate proteins in alleviation or aggravation of this disease are under investigation. The information obtained in this study will aid in the understanding of the mechanisms related to the hostâpathogen interactions involved in PD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis rupestris 3aXylella fastidiosa 3adatabases 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene expression regulation 3agenotype 3aglycoproteins 3agrapes 3aheat shock proteins 3aornamental horticulture 3aornamental plants 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3aripening 3asiblings 3astems1 aLin, Hong1 aTakahashi, Yuri1 aChen, Feng1 aWalker, M.

In this study, the suitability of Echium extract as a raw material for production of fermented juice by four strains of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii) was examined. Echium extract was inoculated with these bacteria and incubated at 30Â Â°C for 24Â h. Changes in microbial population, pH, acidity, sugars, and organic acids metabolism were measured during the fermentation process. Results showed that all of the selected bacteria were capable to grow well in Echium extract without any supplementation. They all metabolized sugars including glucose, fructose and sucrose simultaneously. L. paracasei showed more affinity to sugar consumption at almost 45.2%, 38%, and 21.6% of initial glucose, fructose, and sucrose concentration, respectively. Lactic acid was produced immediately after the fermentation started. L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii, and L. acidophilus produced 6.8, 6.6, and 6.4Â g/l lactic acid, respectively, which were significantly higher than that produced by L. paracasei (5Â g/l). On the other hand in the case of acetic acid, L. paracasei produced significantly greater quantities in comparison with other strains (4.48Â g/l). It was proved that E. amoenum was a desirable media for the production of some organic acids by all these bacterial strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchium 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aacetic acid 3aacidity 3afermentation 3afructose 3aglucose 3ajuices 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3araw materials 3asucrose 3aIran1 aMousavi, Seyed Mohammad1 aRazavi, Seyed Hadi0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2012 Aug., v. 5, no. 6 p.2275-2279dSpringer-Verlagx1935-51307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-011-0564-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013600166520166100302592002801963650002001991650002302011650001202034650002402046650001002070650001302080650001802093650001402111650001602125650001002141653002202151653002402173653003102197653002602228653001602254700001402270700001902284700001502303700001702318700002002335700001402355700001702369700001702386773010502403856008502508852000902593655001202602IND60770144220221122173244.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077014422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1044562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Zi-Yang10aFertilization has a greater effect than rhizosphere on community structures of comammox Nitrospira in an alkaline agricultural soil  aThe discovery of comammox Nitrospira has expanded our knowledge of classical labor division in nitrification and opened up new avenues to unravel the nitrification process in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of fertilization and rhizosphere on comammox Nitrospira remains largely limited, especially in alkaline agricultural soils. To address this knowledge gap, the community structure of comammox Nitrospira and canonical ammonia oxidizers in the bulk and rhizosphere of an alkaline agricultural soil following 8 years of fertilizer applications was investigated. The fertilization treatments included no fertilization (CON), mineral NPK fertilizer (NPK), manure + straw (MS), NPK + manure (NPKM), NPK + manure and straw (NPKMS), and NPK + manure and straw by deep ploughing (NPKMSD). Five phylogenetic clusters of comammox Nitrospira were detected in the soil including clades A.1, A.2.1, A.2.2, A.3 and B, with A.2.1 and B as the dominant clades. Fertilization had a greater effect than rhizosphere on the community structure of comammox Nitrospira, while both fertilization and rhizosphere had no significant effect on the community structure of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Compared with CON and NPK, the relative abundance of comammox Nitrospira clade A, especially clade A.2.1, increased while clade B decreased following manure applications. Soil nitrate played a critical role in driving the variation of comammox Nitrospira community structure. These findings showed novel evidence of niche specialization of comammox Nitrospira and canonical ammonia oxidizers in agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNPK fertilizers 3aagricultural soils 3aammonia 3acommunity structure 3alabor 3anitrates 3anitrification 3aphylogeny 3arhizosphere 3astraw 0aAmmonia oxidation 0aComammox Nitrospira 0aCanonical ammonia oxidizer 0aOrganic fertilization 0aRhizosphere1 aSun, Anqi1 aJiao, Xiao-Yan1 aGe, An-Hui1 aHu, Hang-Wei1 aJin, Shengsheng1 aLiu, Xing1 aLin, Yongxin1 aHe, Ji-Zheng0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 July, v. 175 p.104456-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1044563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011300162300001400275520153300289592002801822650002201850650001101872650002401883650002001907650001301927650000901940653002401949653002101973653002401994700002102018700001702039700002102056773011202077856007802189852000902267655001202276IND60780297420221120223718.0220618e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078029742DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2022-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeloev, Hristo10aSizes of Soil Chip Cut By a Continuously Operating Planting Hole Digging Machine with an Active Tillage Unit  ap. 79-84.  aPlanting hole digging is a minimal tillage method, which is beneficial in terms of reducing energy consumption and preventing erosion. Current popular planting hole diggers work intermittently, which results in low productivity. A continuous-operating hole digging machine with an active tillage unit can solve this issue. However, the theoretical basis for this type of digger has not yet been developed; this is also true for the issue of determining the chip thickness – one of the main technical characteristics which significantly influences energy and agrotechnical indicators of active soil tillage. This paper presents research results of determining the soil chip cut thicknesses and observing of new cutting surface under a continuous operation of hole digging machine with an active tillage unit. At the same time, impacts of factors such as the number of knives and the kinematic factor on soil chip sizes are studied. The soil chip size determination and investigation of influence of kinematic and structural parameters on it is conducted via numerical simulation using MATLAB software. The key factors include kinematic factor λf and the number of knives on one cross-section of the tiller’s rotor Z. When λf and Z increase, the maximum average thicknesses decrease gradually; and vice versa, the new specific cutting surface decreases almost linearly. The results are considered a basis for the selection of final parameters for the construction and operation of one machine to meet agronomic requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3aminimum tillage 3aplanting 3asoil 0aactive tillage unit 0akinematic factor 0acontinues operation1 aLong, Nguyen Duc1 aNhu, Dau The1 aThat, Nguyen Duc0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2022 June 01, v. 25, no. 2 p.79-84dSciendowJournal:6159x1338-52677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2022-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245011800202300001100320506007600331520141700407592002801824596005901852596005901911596005801970596008102028596010702109506003702216650002102253650001102274650001102285650001102296650001102307650001502318650000902333650001702342650001602359651001002375700001602385700001702401700001602418700006002434773011102494856008202605852000902687655001202696IND60627630820221207105429.0211015e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062763082DNAL7 a306654692pmid7 aPMC63416212pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-019-3295-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xia12aA combination of climatic conditions determines major within-season dengue outbreaks in Guangdong Province, China  ap. 45.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: China’s Guangdong Province experienced a major dengue outbreak in 2014. Here we investigate if the weather conditions contributing to the outbreak can be elucidated by multi-scale models. METHODS: A multi-scale modelling framework, parameterized by available weather, vector and human case data, was used to examine the integrative effect of temperature and precipitation variation on the effective reproduction number (ERN) of dengue fever. RESULTS: With temperature in the range of 25–30 °C, increasing precipitation leads to an increase in the ERN with an average lag of 10 days. With monthly precipitation fixed, the more regular the pattern of rainfall (i.e. higher numbers of rainy days), the larger is the total number of adult mosquitoes. A rainfall distribution peaking in June and July produces a large ERN, beneficial to transmission. Climate conditions conducive to major outbreaks within a season are a combination of relatively high temperature, high precipitation peaking in June and July, and uninterrupted drizzle or regular rainfall. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating a set of weather conditions favourable to a future major dengue outbreak requires near-future prediction of temperature variation, total rainfall and its peaking times. Such information permits seasonal rapid response management decisions due to the lags between the precipitation events and the realisation of the ERN.  aPublisher supplied data  a11601301cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a11631012cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a11471201cNational Natural Science Foundation (China)  aGK201803006cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (China)  a20160212cYoung Talent fund of the University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimatic factors 3adengue 3ahumans 3aimagos 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3areproduction 3atemperature 3aChina1 aTang, Sanyi1 aWu, Jianhong1 aXiao, Yanni1 aCheke, Robert A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7437-19340 tParasites & vectors.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3295-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010400161300001500265520126800280592002801548650000901576650001701585650002201602650002501624650001201649650002301661650002701684650001101711700001701722700001701739700001301756773011701769856007401886852000901960655001201969IND60440426020221118064027.0151024e200004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044042602DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028174062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠoltésová, A.10aMitochondria—Tool for taxonomic identification of yeasts from Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex  ap. 99-106.  aMitochondrial genomes of Saccharomyces and close relatives previously used for transplacement of mitochondria to S. cerevisiae were examined. The origins of replication in mitochondrial DNA, the presence of nuclear and mitochondrial polymorphic loci and the ability to produce mitochondrial respiration-deficient mutants were used to reclassify some collection yeasts and to assign others into four separate subgroups. The first included isolates identical to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. italicus, S. oviformis, S. chevalieri and S. capensis) which possess 5 or more replication origins. The second group consists of S. paradoxus (var. douglasii) mitochondrial genome with the equal number ofori sequences but incompatible mitochondria. The third group represents Saccharomyces sensu stricto petite-positive species (S. carlsbergensis, S. heterogenicus. S. uvarum.

Short term kinetic batch experiments (contact time of 90d) for four different pH values have been conducted. Moreover, classical batch pH sorption edges have been prepared for two different uranium concentrations for a contact time of 550d. Spectroscopic techniques (XPS, XAS) were applied to probe for the presence and amount of reduced U on the magnetite surface. Batch kinetic studies revealed a fast initial U removal from aqueous solution with >90% magnetite associated U after 24h within the pH range 5–11. Long-term contact time batch experiments (550d) showed neither a U removal below pH<3 nor a decrease in the magnetite associated U at pH⩾9. Redox speciation by XPS verifies the presence of reduced U (both U(IV) and U(V) were resolved if the satellite structures were used in the fitting procedure) at the near surface of magnetite up to a contact time of 550d and a clear correlation of the amount of available Fe(II) on the magnetite surface and the amount of reduced U is observed. XANES investigation supports presence of U(V)/U(VI) uranate and U(IV). Interpretation of the EXAFS for one sample is consistent with incorporation of U into an Fe oxide phase, after long reaction times. Thermodynamic calculations based on the experimentally determined redox potentials corroborate the spectroscopic findings of U oxidation states. Overall, the results reflect the importance of structurally bound Fe(II) as redox partner for uranyl reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon dioxide 3airon 3amaghemite 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apH 3aredox potential 3asorption 3athermodynamics 3auranium1 aSchild, D.1 aVitova, T.1 aRothe, J.1 aKirsch, R.1 aSchäfer, T.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Nov. 1, v. 96 p.154-173dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.07.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245015800205300001100363506007600374520145600450592002801906596007501934596005902009596005902068506003702127650002802164650000802192650001302200650002002213650002402233650002602257650001302283650001202296650002502308650002502333650004302358650001802401650002302419700001802442700001802460700002002478700001702498700001602515773011102531856008202642852000902724655001202733IND60627630920221207104802.0211015e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062763092DNAL7 a306653452pmid7 aPMC63417622pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-019-3294-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yaqiong10aMitochondrial genome sequence variation as a useful marker for assessing genetic heterogeneity among Cyclospora cayetanensis isolates and source-tracking  ap. 47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cyclospora cayetanensis is an important enteric pathogen, causing diarrhea and food-borne cyclosporiasis outbreaks. For effective outbreak identification and investigation, it is essential to rapidly assess the genetic heterogeneity of C. cayetanensis specimens from cluster cases and identify the likely occurrence of outbreaks. METHODS: In this study, we developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the polymorphic link region between copies of the mitochondrial genome of C. cayetanensis, and evaluated the genetic heterogeneity among 36 specimens from six countries using melt curve, gel electrophoresis, and sequence analyses of the qPCR products. RESULTS: All specimens were amplified successfully in the qPCR and produced melt peaks with different Tm values in the melt curve analysis. In gel electrophoresis of the qPCR products, the specimens yielded bands of variable sizes. Nine genotypes were identified by DNA sequencing of the qPCR products. Geographical segregation of genotypes was observed among specimens analyzed, which could be useful in geographical source-tracking. CONCLUSIONS: The length and nucleotide sequence variations in the mitochondrial genome marker allow rapid assessment of the genetic heterogeneity among C. cayetanensis specimens by melt curve, gel electrophoresis, or DNA sequence analysis of qPCR products. The sequence data generated could be helpful in the initial source-tracking of the pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFD0500400cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31630078cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31425025cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyclospora cayetanensis 3aDNA 3adiarrhea 3aenteropathogens 3agel electrophoresis 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenotype 3amelting 3amitochondrial genome 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3asequence diversity1 aWang, Yuanfei1 aWang, Xiaolan1 aZhang, Longxian1 aOrtega, Ynes1 aFeng, Yaoyu0 tParasites & vectors.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.47-47dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3294-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002100154245014000175300001600315500002400331520135700355650002001712650002101732650001401753650002001767650002201787650002201809650002301831650002601854650001101880650001601891650001101907650001101918650002101929650001801950650000901968650002401977650001202001650001902013650001502032650006302047650001202110650003702122650002202159650001402181650001102195650002302206650003002229650000902259650002102268651002302289651003802312700002102350700001802371773012102389852000902510856007502519655001202594IND4457895920221120073701.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445789592DNAL7 a214853892pmid7 a10.1603/ME101932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacups, Susan P.10aArbovirus Models to Provide Practical Management Tools for Mosquito Control and Disease Prevention in the Northern Territory, Australia  ap. 453-460.  aIncludes references  aRoss River virus (RRV) causes the most common human arbovirus disease in Australia. Although the disease is nonfatal, the associated arthritis and postinfection fatigue can be debilitating for many months, impacting on workforce participation. We sought to create an early-warning system to notify of approaching RRV disease outbreak conditions for major townships in the Northern Territory. By applying a logistic regression model to meteorologic factors, including rainfall, a postestimation analysis of sensitivity and specificity can create rainfall cut-points. These rainfall cut-points indicate the rainfall level above which previous epidemic conditions have occurred. Furthermore, rainfall cut-points indirectly adjust for vertebrate host data from the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis) as the life cycle of the agile wallaby is intricately meshed with the wet season. Once generated, cut-points can thus be used prospectively to allow timely implementation of larval survey and control measures and public health warnings to preemptively reduce RRV disease incidence. Cut-points are location specific and have the capacity to replace previously used models, which require data management and input, and rarely provide timely notification for vector control requirements and public health warnings. These methods can be adapted for use elsewhere. 3aMacropus agilis 3aRoss River virus 3aarthritis 3acontrol methods 3adisease incidence 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease prevention 3aearly warning systems 3ahumans 3alabor force 3alarvae 3amodels 3amosquito control 3apublic health 3arain 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3avector control 3awet season 2aAlphavirus Infectionsxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aAnimals 2aCulicidaexphysiologyxvirology. 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aEcosystem 2aHumans 2aModels, Biological 2aMosquito Controlxmethods 2aRain 2aRoss River virus 3aNorthern Territory 0aNorthern Territoryxepidemiology.1 aWhelan, Peter I.1 aHarley, David0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2011 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.453-460dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME101933Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02280naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245009000162300001400252520114700266592002801413650001601441650001501457650001101472651001301483653003101496653001701527653003001544653002001574700002601594700001801620700001501638700002301653700003101676773011201707856007801819852000901897655001201906IND60780297620221121011444.0220618e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078029762DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2022-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoďo, Štefan10aAnalysis of Selected Data from Robotic Milking Regarding to Heat Stress of Dairy Cows  ap. 92-96.  aThe paper presented is dedicated to investigation of the temperature-humidity index (THI) and its impacts on the performance parameters of dairy cattle. These parameters were recorded at four farms in the central Slovakia; the experiments took place three years. These parameters comprised milking time, time spent in the milking box, and connection time. The THI was calculated according to the standard formula and individual periods were established on the basis of achieved THI values. The results showed that the milking time and the time spent in the milking box were not reduced when the THI ranged from 68 to 71, with a daily milk yield of 28.96 kg. If the THI exceeded 72, the milking time and the time spent in the milking box were shortened, which was statistically confirmed. However, even with a daily milk yield of 31.27 kg, a reduction in the milking time and time spent in the milking box was reduced. This was caused by the THI higher than 68, which was also statistically confirmed. Based on the results obtained, the dairy cows respond to heat stress by reducing the milking time and reducing time spent in the milking box.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat stress 3amilk yield 3arobots 3aSlovakia 0atemperature-humidity index 0amilking time 0atime spent in milking box 0aconnection time1 aLüttmerding, Gabriel1 aGálik, Roman1 aKunc, Petr1 aKnížková, Ivana1 aGürdil, Gürkan Alp Kagan0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2022 June 01, v. 25, no. 2 p.92-96dSciendowJournal:6159x1338-52677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2022-00153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245015600174300001800330500001500348520175300363592002802116650001402144650002502158650001802183650002602201650002602227650001302253650001902266650001402285650001702299650001202316650003302328650001202361653002002373700002102393700002402414700002302438773011602461856005502577852000902632655001202641IND4510133620221120131256.0150730e200004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451013362DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01232.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, Ayman S.10aDeterminants of substrate specificity of a second non‐neuronal secreted acetylcholinesterase from the parasitic nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis  ap. 2276-2282.  a2019-12-06  aWe recently reported on a non‐neuronal secreted acetylcholinesterase (AChE B) from the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Here we describe the primary structure and enzymatic properties of a second secreted variant, termed AChE C after the designation of native AChE isoforms from this parasite. As for the former enzyme, AChE C is truncated at the carboxyl terminus in comparison with the Torpedo AChE, and three of the 14 aromatic residues that line the active site gorge are substituted by nonaromatic residues, corresponding to Tyr70 (Ser), Trp279 (Asn) and Phe288 (Met). A recombinant form of AChE C was highly expressed by Pichia pastoris. The enzyme was monomeric and hydrophilic, and displayed a marked preference for acetylthiocholine as substrate. A double mutation (W302F/W345F, corresponding to positions 290 and 331 in Torpedo) rendered the enzyme 10‐fold less sensitive to excess substrate inhibition and two times less susceptible to the bis quaternary inhibitor BW284C51, but did not radically affect substrate specificity or sensitivity to the ‘peripheral site’ inhibitor propidium iodide. In contrast, a triple mutant (M300G/W302F/W345F) efficiently hydrolysed propionylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine in addition to acetylthiocholine, while remaining insensitive to the butyrylcholinesterase‐specific inhibitor iso‐OMPA and displaying a similar profile of excess substrate inhibition as the double mutant. These data highlight a conserved pattern of active site architecture for nematode secreted AChEs characterized to date, and provide an explanation for the substrate specificity that might otherwise appear inconsistent with the primary structure in comparison to other invertebrate AChEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aparasites 3aacetylcholinesterase 3ainvertebrates 3asubstrate specificity 3aKomagataella pastoris 3amutation 3ahydrophilicity 3apropidium 3aactive sites 3amutants 3aNippostrongylus brasiliensis 3aTorpedo 0aPichia pastoris1 aSmith, Angela M.1 aChacón, Matilde R.1 aSelkirk, Murray E.0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Apr., v. 267, no. 8 p.2276-2282dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01232.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04373naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001800188245009100206300001800297506007600315520198200391592002802373506003702401650002002438650002202458650002102480650001402501650001702515650001702532650001602549650001402565650001402579650002102593650001302614650001602627650001002643650007902653650005202732650006402784650003302848650002402881650002402905650005602929650001102985650002002996650001103016650000903027650001603036650002103052650002103073650002803094650005003122650005103172650003003223651001403253700001803267700001903285700001503304700001503319700001503334700001803349700001903367700001803386700001503404773010603419856008103525852000903606655001203615IND50064410720221207085902.0160807e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006441072DNAL7 aPMC39154092pmcid7 a228723232pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-012-0433-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWidmer, R.

The possible augmentation of endothelial function with the combined efforts of OO and EGCG is intriguing, yet unknown. METHODS: Eighty-two patients with early atherosclerosis (presence of endothelial dysfunction) were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized trial with 52 completing the study. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of a daily intake of 30 ml simple OO, with 30 ml of EGCG-supplemented OO, on endothelial function as well as on inflammation and oxidative stress after a period of 4 months. Endothelial function was assessed noninvasively via peripheral arterial tonometry (Endo-PAT®). RESULTS: After 4 months, when OO and EGCG-supplemented OO groups were combined, OO significantly improved endothelial function (RHI, 1.59 ± 0.25–1.75 ± 0.45; p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in results between the two olive oil groups. Interestingly, with OO supplementation there was a significant reduction in inflammatory parameters: sICAM (196 to 183 ng/mL, p = < 0.001); white blood cells (WBCs) (6.0 × 10⁹/L–5.8 × 10⁹/L, p < 0.05); monocytes (0.48 × 10⁹/L to 0.44 × 10⁹/L, p = 0.05); lymphocytes (1.85 × 10⁹/L to 1.6 × 10⁹/L, p = 0.01); and platelets (242–229 × 10⁹/L, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in endothelial dysfunction in patients with early atherosclerosis in association with significant reduction in leukocytes may suggest an important role of early cellular inflammatory mediators on endothelial function. The current study supports one potential mechanism for the role of olive oil, independent of EGCG, modestly supplemented to a healthy cardiovascular diet.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aatherosclerosis 3adisease incidence 3aepigallocatechin 3aflavanols 3ahealthy diet 3ainflammation 3alymphocytes 3amonocytes 3aolive oil 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apolyphenols 2aAdult 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidalxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aAntioxidantsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aAtherosclerosisxdiet therapyximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aCamellia sinensisxchemistry 2aDiet, Mediterranean 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEndothelium, Vascularximmunologyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aFood, Fortified 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidative Stress 2aPatient Dropouts 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aPolyphenolsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aSeverity of Illness Index 0aMinnesota1 aFreund, M.

DNM2 is the most ubiquitously expressed member of the DNM family. We developed a novel tool based on elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) technology to quickly, precisely, and reversibly modulate the structure of DNM2. ELPs are temperature-sensitive biopolymers that self-assemble into microdomains above sharp transition temperatures. When linked together, DNM2 and a temperature-sensitive ELP fusion organize into a range of distinct temperature-dependent structures above a sharp transition temperature, which were not observed with wild-type DNM2 or a temperature-insensitive ELP fusion control. The structures comprised three different morphologies, which were prevalent at different temperature ranges. The size of these structures was influenced by an inhibitor of the DNM2 GTPase activity, dynasore; furthermore, they appear to entrap co-expressed cytosolic ELPs. Having demonstrated an unexpected diversity of morphologically distinct structures, DNM2–ELP fusions may have applications in the exploration of dynamin-dependent biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3adynamins 3apolypeptides 3atemperature1 aTrương, Anh,1 aTyrpak, David1 aPark, Shin-Jae1 aLei, Siqi1 aLi, Yaocun1 aOkamoto, Curtis1 aHamm-Alvarez, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8195-57031 aMacKay, J.

An Internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 530 respondents. The mean age of the participants was 49.2 ± 16.6 years, and 27% were tertiary educated. Two-stage cluster analysis revealed three distinct segments; “impulsive, involved” (33.4%), “rational, health conscious” (39.2%), and “uninvolved” (27.4%). The “impulsive, involved” segment was characterised by higher levels of impulsivity and food involvement (importance of food) compared to the other two segments. This segment also reported significantly more frequent consumption of fast foods, takeaways, convenience meals, salted snacks and use of ready-made sauces and mixes in cooking compared to the “rational, health conscious” consumers. They also reported higher frequency of preparing meals at home, cooking from scratch, using ready-made sauces and mixes in cooking and higher vegetable consumption compared to the “uninvolved” consumers. The findings show the need for customised approaches to the communication and promotion of healthy eating habits.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acluster analysis 3aconsumers (people) 3acooking 3across-sectional studies 3afast foods 3ahealthy eating habits 3asauces 3asnacks 3avegetable consumption1 aWorsley, Anthony0 tNutrients.g2015 Sept. 18, v. 7, no. 9 p.8036-8057dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu70953793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008500156300001600241500001900257520046300276592002800739650002400767650001700791650001800808650002100826650001100847650001400858650002200872650002300894651001000917653000800927653001300935653001700948653002700965700001500992700002001007700001401027700001401041700002401055700001801079700001701097700002201114773018301136856007401319852000901393655001201402IND60692920020221120074357.0200503e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069292002DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1208152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWU, Yi-Bing10aXylomexicanins C and D, New Mexicanolide-Type Limonoids from Xylocarpus granatum  ap. 736-740.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwo new limonoids, named xylomexicanins C and D, were isolated from a dichloromethane extract of the seeds of Xylocarpus granatum cultivated in Hainan, China, and their structures were elucidated on the basis of one- and two-dimensional NMR (including ¹H, ¹³C-NMR, DEPT, ¹H-¹H COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY) and confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry.

Quite often the results of these schemes are sensitive to the timing of monitoring due to the phenology of species, which in turn may affect the detectability of species during censuses. As global warming has been shown to cause changes in phenology, there is an increasing risk that species detectability will be altered if the timing of monitoring is not adapted to this change. I tested how sensitive species detectability is to the timing of censuses and whether there are potential climate-driven temporal changes in the detectability of 73 Finnish land bird species monitored using single-visit line-transects in 1987–2010. This was done by investigating seasonal and annual patterns in the proportion of birds in the main belt and those detected by displaying activity. Over 20 of the study species showed significant changes in detectability within the census season. However, only three species showed a significant trend in annual detectability. According to multi-species analyses there was a slight but significant increasing trend in the proportion of displaying birds and a slight decreasing trend in the proportion of birds in the main belt. However, the observed species-specific annual changes in displaying activity or in proportion of birds in main belt were not associated with the observed population trends of species during the same period. Nevertheless, the findings highlight a strong potential risk that species detectability can change if climate change escalates in the future. I recommend researchers to investigate how sensitive their monitoring systems are for phenological changes and prepare tools for taking potential changes in detectability into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3aglobal warming 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3aresearchers 3arisk 3atemporal variation0 tPopulation ecology.g2013 Apr., v. 55, no. 2 p.315-323dSpringer-Verlagx1438-38967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-012-0359-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245013100177300001800308520178000326592002802106650001102134650002102145650001402166650001102180650001902191700002702210700001702237773008402254856008902338990002302427852000902450655001202459IND60095962620221121233033.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009596262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobhani Aragh, B.10aEshelby–Mori–Tanaka approach for vibrational behavior of continuously graded carbon nanotube-reinforced cylindrical panels  ap. 1943-1954.  aIn this paper, natural frequencies characteristics of a continuously graded carbon nanotube-reinforced (CGCNTR) cylindrical panels based on the Eshelby–Mori–Tanaka approach is considered. The volume fractions of oriented, straight single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction. In this research work, an equivalent continuum model based on the Eshelby–Mori–Tanaka approach is employed to estimate the effective constitutive law of the elastic isotropic medium (matrix) with oriented, straight carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The CGCNTR shell is assumed to be simply supported at one pair of opposite edges and arbitrary boundary conditions at the other edges such that trigonometric functions expansion can be used to satisfy the boundary conditions precisely at simply supported edges. The 2-D generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) as an efficient and accurate numerical tool is used to discretize the governing equations and to implement the boundary conditions. The novelty of the present work is to exploit Eshelby–Mori–Tanaka approach in order to reveal the impacts of the volume fractions of oriented CNTs, different CNTs distributions, various mid radius-to-thickness ratio, shell angle, length-to-mean radius ratio and different combinations of free, simply supported and clamped boundary conditions on the vibrational characteristics of CGCNTR cylindrical panels. The interesting and new results show that continuously graded oriented CNTs volume fractions can be utilized for the management of vibrational behavior of structures so that the frequency parameters of structures made of such material can be considerably improved than that of the nanocomposites reinforced with uniformly distributed CNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aequations 3amodels 3ananocomposites1 aNasrollah Barati, A.H.1 aHedayati, H.0 tComposites.g2012 June, v. 43, no. 4 p.1943-1954dElsevier Ltdx1359-83687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245005400183300001800237500001100255520072300266592002800989650001201017650002401029650002201053650001301075650001201088650003301100650002201133650001101155650003201166700001801198773014401216852000901360856008201369655001201451IND4392852620221121200223.0200207e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439285262DNAL7 a174047262pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-007-0964-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeisola, Matti10aProtein engineering: opportunities and challenges  ap. 1225-1232.  aReview  aThe extraordinary properties of natural proteins demonstrate that life-like protein engineering is both achievable and valuable.

This research attempts to reduce yarn hairiness by designing an air-suction nozzles as alternatives to the commonly used air-jet nozzle, and attaching them to a conventional spinning machine. To examine the effect of various nozzle parameters on yam hairiness and quality, air-suction nozzles with different hole angles and arrangements are designed and employed. The number of hairs longer than or equal to 3 mm is reduced by more than 50% when yams are spun through these specifically designed air-suction nozzles. Other yarn quality measures such as strength, elongation, and appearance also improve with these nozzles, without sacrificing yarn evenness.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3afiber quality 3anozzles 3aspinning 3atextile fibers 3ayams 3ayarns0 tTextile research journal.g2000 Nov., v. 70, no. 11 p.1019-1024dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517500070011133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002400135245016200159300001600321500002400337520121900361650002501580650001901605650001101624650001401635650001001649650001301659650002501672650000901697650001001706650003701716650001301753650001201766650002101778650002201799650001201821651001401833651002101847651001001868651002001878700002301898700002201921700001801943700002201961700002201983700002202005773013902027852000902166856007502175655001202250IND4457897020221120073733.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445789702DNAL7 a10.1603/AN101062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakano, Shun-Ichiro10aTwo Cryptic Species in Brontispa longissima (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae): Evidence from Mitochondrial DNA Analysis and Crosses between the Two Nominal Species  ap. 121-131.  aIncludes references  aThe beetle Brontispa longissima (Gestro) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a serious invasive pest of the coconut palm, Cocos nucifera I., in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. Genetic analysis is essential to ecological and evolutionary study of such invasive species. We therefore conducted molecular analyses by using partial sequences (1044 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of B. longissima collected from several locations. We found two monophyletic groups: one distributed over a limited area (Australia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Sumba Island; referred to as the Pacific group) and the other collected from a wide area of Asia and the Pacific region (referred to as the Asian group). We compared the biological and morphological traits of the two groups. We found that insects in the Pacific group had a shorter developmental time from hatching to adult emergence, produced fewer eggs, and had a larger adult body size than insects in the Asian group. Elytral color patterns did not differ between the two groups. Our interpopulation crosses produced significantly fewer progeny than intrapopulation crosses, suggesting that B. longissima represents two cryptic species. 3aBrontispa longissima 3aCocos nucifera 3aadults 3abody size 3acolor 3acrossing 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aeggs 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahatching 3ainsects 3ainvasive species 3amitochondrial DNA 3aprogeny 3aAustralia 3aPapua New Guinea 3aSamoa 3aSouth East Asia1 aMochizuki, Atsushi1 aKonishi, Kazuhiko1 aTakasu, Keiji1 aAlouw, Jelfina C.1 aPandin, Donata S.1 aNakamura, Satoshi0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2011 Mar., v. 104, no. 2 p.121-131dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN101063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01584naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245010000187300001800287520062000305592002800925650001300953650001300966650001300979650000900992650001501001700002401016700002501040773008401065856008901149990002301238852000901261655001201270IND60095962820221121233053.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009596282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesb.2012.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Costa Mattos, Heraldo S.12aA simple methodology for the design of metallic lap joints bonded with epoxy/ceramic composites  ap. 1964-1969.  aIn the present study it is proposed a shape factor that allows correlating the static strength of two single lap joints with different geometries.

The target compounds were extracted by acetonitrile, purified by an automated on-line SPE cartridge, and analyzed by LC–MS/MS under the negative-ion mode. Mean recoveries fortified at three concentration levels ranged from 81.6 to 115.7%, and the coefficient of variation ranged from 4.6 to 19.9% (n = 6). The limits of quantification (LOQs) of the method were 0.5, 0.5, and 0.25 μg/kg for BPA, NP, and OP, respectively, in both rice and maize, while the LOQs in wheat were 0.5, 1.25, and 0.5 μg/kg for BPA, NP, and OP, respectively. This method was applied in the analysis of rice, maize, and wheat from a local market. As a result, NP occurred in all cereal samples at the concentration range of 9.4–1683.6 μg/kg and BPA was detected in a few samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3acorn 3aliquid chromatography 3amarkets 3amass spectrometry 3asolid phase extraction 2aBenzhydryl Compounds 2aEdible Grainxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aQuality Control 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSolid Phase Extractionxmethods 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aTriticumxchemistry 2aZea maysxchemistry 0aBisphenol A 0anonylphenol 0aoctylphenol 0aon-line solid-phase extraction 0acereals 0aLC−ESI−MS/MS1 aZhang, Jing1 aWu, Yongning1 aShao, Bing0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 June 20, v. 60, no. 24 p.6116-6122dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf301401k3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02613naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016000165300001400325520161500339592002801954650001501982650002501997650000902022650001102031650001602042650001002058650002102068773009702089856008102186990002302267852000902290655001202299IND60099300720221119184843.0141105e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009930072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaozhi13aAn experimental study of H solubility in feldspars: Effect of composition, oxygen fugacity, temperature and pressure and implications for crustal processes  ap. 46-57.  aA series of experiments, with run durations of ∼100–240h, have been carried out on H solubility in natural labradorite, albite and anorthoclase at 2–10kbar and 700–850°C, in equilibrium with different oxygen buffer materials: Fe–FeO, Ni–NiO, Re–ReO₂ and Fe₂O₃–Fe₃O₄. Attainment of equilibrium water contents were examined by conducting experiments with different run-durations and by performing profile analysis along crystal core-to-rim paths. The annealed products generally show typical OH-related infrared absorption bands in the range 3700–2600cm⁻¹: the spectra of the labradorite and anorthoclase are dominated by broad bands at ∼3300–3100cm⁻¹, while the spectra of the albite consist of broad bands at ∼3100–3000cm⁻¹ and sharp bands at ∼3600–3400cm⁻¹. The measured H solubility, ranging from ∼80 to 285ppm H₂O, differs greatly between the feldspars with different chemical compositions, depends strongly on oxygen fugacity, and increases with increasing temperature and pressure. The H solubility is significantly higher, e.g., by a factor of ∼3 or even more, at very reducing conditions than at oxidizing conditions. The high H solubility of feldspar at reduced conditions indicates that, at least locally, the Earth’s ancient deep continental crust was probably more hydrous than the modern one. Crustal dehydration can be caused by a change of oxygen fugacity and a corresponding change of water solubility in the constituent feldspar under isothermal conditions, without the requirement of high temperature and/or additional heat sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achemical composition 3aheat 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3awater 3awater solubility0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 97 p.46-57dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2012.08.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013300169500002200302520144200324592002801766650001801794650001401812650001801826650001001844650001001854650002501864650001301889650001801902650001801920650002901938650001401967650001301981650001901994650002102013650001002034650001402044651001502058653002402073653002002097653002702117653002402144700001902168700001802187773010102205856008302306852000902389655001202398IND60670409820221122020856.0191002e20190923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067040982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e007982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoohan, Brendan10aDiversity favours the old: Metrics of avian diversity increase in aging regrowth Acacia woodlands of semi-arid eastern Australia  aPre-press version  aUnderstanding how native fauna use regrowth vegetation is critical because of increased land clearing rates and biodiversity loss, yet it remains poorly studied in Australia's semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to use acoustic sensors to monitor avian diversity in three different age classes (new regrowth <15 years, intermediate regrowth 15–30 years, and old growth >30 years) of Acacia dominated, predominately mulga (Acacia aneura) woodlands in the Mulga Lands bioregion of south-west Queensland. We found that species richness (SR), functional diversity (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) increased with time since last clearance, with statistically significant differences between new regrowth and old growth. Generalised linear models showed that tree cover was a significant predicator of SR, FD and PD. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that species composition was more similar within than between age classes. Each age class had unique species, yet intermediate regrowth and old growth shared a large number of species suggesting a convergence in species composition. The results of this study show that while old growth vegetation sustains the highest level of biodiversity, intermediate and new regrowth still support a range of bird species. Therefore, regrowth mulga vegetation represents important habitat for avian biodiversity in semi-arid western Queensland and should be protected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia aneura 3aacoustics 3aage structure 3abirds 3afauna 3afunctional diversity 3ahabitats 3aland clearing 3alinear models 3amultidimensional scaling 3aphylogeny 3aregrowth 3asemiarid zones 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aQueensland 0aRegrowth vegetation 0aAcacia woodland 0aPhylogenetic diversity 0aAcoustic monitoring1 aKemp, Jeanette1 aFuller, Susan0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2019 Sept. 23, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e007983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012500159300001600284500001900300520096200319592002801281650001701309650001801326650001501344650001601359650002301375650001501398650001201413650000901425650001801434653001401452653001701466653001601483700002301499773018201522856007401704852000901778655001201787IND60692920420221120074347.0200503e20130523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069292042DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1208642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aARII, Yasuhiro10aMagnesium Chloride Concentration-Dependent Formation of Tofu-Like Precipitates with Different Physicochemical Properties  ap. 928-933.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA wet precipitate is generated in the process of making tofu by adding a coagulant to the basic soymilk ingredient. We investigated the magnesium chloride concentration-dependent change in the precipitate weight. The wet precipitate weight dramatically increased following a short plateau phase at a low concentration of magnesium chloride. It is interesting that this weight slightly decreased following a long plateau phase at a high concentration. These low and high concentrations respectively induced precipitates with a smooth surface and rough surface. The precipitate with a smooth surface had a higher water content than that with a rough surface. These precipitates also had obviously different solubility in various chemical reagents. The different properties indicate that these precipitates were formed by different intermolecular interactions. These results can be utilized to more clearly understand the mechanisms involved in tofu formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3acoagulants 3aingredients 3amagnesium chloride 3asolubility 3asoymilk 3atofu 3awater content 0acoagulant 0aregular tofu 0asilken tofu1 aTAKENAKA, Yasuyuki0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2013 May 23, v. 77, no. 5 p.928-933dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1208643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007500170300001600245520143600261592002801697650001101725650002301736650002101759650001301780650002101793650001501814653001701829653002501846653003001871653002401901773013501925856008502060852000902145655001202154IND60595488320221117224545.0180605e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059548832DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2017.13659302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVirkkula, Outi10aCustomer-driven questioning in Finnish forestry advisory conversations  ap. 271-277.  aThis paper deepens our understanding of the customer’s role in institutional face-to-face encounters. It includes an in-depth analysis of authentic Finnish forestry advisory conversations to illuminate the specifics of the pursued customer perspective and collaboration. From a total 9:02:09 hours of video recordings the data yielded 89 qualified customer-initiated questions for comprehensive analysis. Results indicated that family forest owners (FFOs) can initiate if they so wish. Most of the posed questions (92.1%) were requests for information or for confirmation, which re-established the institutional positioning of the encounter. The forestry advisory professional presented topics that complied with the meeting’s standard procedure. The actual impact the customer had on the agenda appeared quite limited and genuine collaboration was not quite balanced. Cautious tactics of asking emerged specifically when related to more personal questions. In the shift to a new forestry advisory service era, where publicly funded services are now open to various market-based agents and new tailored advisory traditions are being developed, FFOs are even more important customers. Good advisory services and relationships will be key assets to service providers. Understanding the interactional mechanisms of an institutional encounter is crucial to promote the customer perspective, the initiative and learning of the FFOs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3aconsumers (people) 3aforest ownership 3alearning 3aprivate forestry 3atraditions 0aConversation 0acustomer perspective 0aforestry advisory service 0atalk-in-interaction0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 33, no. 3 p.271-277dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39219x1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2017.13659303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245012700161300002000288500001500308520183700323592002802160650002202188650002202210650001902232650001402251653001802265653002602283653002202309653002202331653002902353653002202382700002002404700001802424700001402442700001802456700002002474700001602494700001202510700005502522700005602577773014202633856007802775852000902853655001202862IND60711078320221118172418.0200916e20200818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071107832DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c112162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yunhao10aDomino Effect of Thickness Fluctuation on Subband Structure and Electron Transport within Semiconductor Cascade Structures  ap. 41950-41959.  agolden set  aEffectively restraining random fluctuation of layer thickness (RFT) during the thin-film epitaxy plays an essential part in improving the quality of low-dimensional materials for device application. While it is already challenging to obtain an ideal growth condition for thickness control, the tangle of RFT with interfacial problems makes it even more difficult to guarantee the properties of heterostructures and the performance of devices. In our research, the RFT of potential barriers and wells within a semiconductor multilayer is demonstrated to correlate with the interfacial grading effect (IFG) and to affect the band offset strongly. Then, the synergetic effect of RFT and IFG that serves as the first domino is shown to impact the subband structure and the electron transport successively. On the basis of an investigation of a quantum cascade structure, statistical results indicate a normal distribution of RFT with a standard deviation of about 1 Å and an extreme value of 3 Å (about one monolayer) for all the layers within 38 cascade periods. The “seemingly negligible” RFT could actually reduce the conduction band offset for tens to hundreds of meV and alter the subband gaps at a rate of 40 meV/monolayer at most. Furthermore, the dependence of different subband gaps on the barrier/well thickness differs from one another. In addition, the distribution of wave function could also be regulated dramatically by RFT to change the type of electron transition and thus the carrier lifetime. Further impacts of RFT and the RFT-modulated subband alignment on electron transport result in two different mechanisms (injection-dominant and extraction-dominant) of electron population inversion (PI), which is manifested by comparatively discussing the results of in situ electron holography and macro performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3afilms (materials) 3asemiconductors 3athickness 0adomino effect 0athickness fluctuation 0asubband structure 0acarrier transport 0asemiconductor multilayer 0acascade structure1 aZhang, Jinchuan1 aCai, Chenyuan1 aChen, Jie1 aZhao, Xuebing1 aLiang, Chongyun1 aLiu, Fengqi1 aShi, Yi1 aLiu, Xianhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4975-35861 aChe, Renchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4192-72780 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Aug. 18, v. 12, no. 37 p.41950-41959dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c112163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009100168300001600259520121300275536015401488592002801642596001901670650002801689650001501717650001101732650002201743650001201765650001501777650001101792650001301803650001501816650001901831650003201850650001001882653002601892653002301918653002801941653001401969653001601983700001501999773013502014856008502149852000902234655001202243IND60595488420221117224435.0180605e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059548842DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2017.13678392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Guangyi10aUsing landscape preference models and tree-scale measurements to predict stand quality  ap. 255-260.  aScenic beauty estimation (SBE) models that quantify landscape aesthetics through picture-based questionnaires are complicated to develop. Therefore, precise, simple, and widely applicable models of SBE prediction based on tree and stand measurements must be developed. To investigate the application of tree- and stand-based SBE models to Chinese fir forest management, the relationships between diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H) measurements and tree- (TSBE) and stand (SSBE)-based SBE predictions were assessed. TSBE and SSBE were strongly influenced by DBH and H measurements according to either a power function or linear function, depending on the variables. When the mean stand DBH was less than 8.4 cm or H was less than 9.8 m, dense canopies resulted in negative SSBE residuals. In stands with large trees and non-dense canopies, the residuals of SSBE were positive. We conclude that average H and DBH measurements within a stand can be used to predict SSBE by extrapolating the tree-based SBE model to form a stand-based SBE model. Therefore, SBE models based on individual tree measurements can provide quantitative guidance for forest landscape quality planning and evaluation.  aThis work was supported by ForPlan system introduction of projects on forest multifunction management science and technology grant  [No. 2015-4-31].  aPublisher supplied data  cForPlan system 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aaesthetics 3acanopy 3aforest management 3aforests 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprediction 3aquestionnaires 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 0aMultipurpose forestry 0aoutdoor recreation 0astand landscape quality 0aSBE model 0asample tree1 aSun, Yujun0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2018 Apr. 3, v. 33, no. 3 p.255-260dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39219x1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2017.13678393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01377naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245005700171520052300228592002800751650003100779650002000810650001300830700006100843773012600904856008401030852000901114655001201123IND60761689220221117233127.0220118s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076168922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crgsc.2021.1002422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudzinski, Kristi10aGrassroots and blue skies lead to greener landscapes  aThe biopharmaceutical industry has a noble mission: to treat and cure disease.

However, the fingerprints of Dendrobium officinale from Jiangxi province, Hu’nan province and Wenzhou, Yandangshan and Fuyang in Zhejiang province were very similar. As far as the fingerprints of different Dendrobium species were concerned, the differences between Dendrobium officinale, Dendrobium huoshanense, Dendrobium moniliforme, Dendrobium devonianum, Dendrobium aphyllum, Dendrobium wilsonii and Dendrobium crystallinum were obvious. Moreover, the genetic relationships between different samples were analyzed by using principal component analysis and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analysis.

Clarifying their distribution ranges and climatic preferences would contribute to the prediction of disease occurrences and consideration of controls. In this study, we predicted the present geographical distributions of F. torreyae and F. punctata in Japan using a Maxent species distribution model to analyze our data and previously published collection records. In addition, we examined the importance of temperature on these predictions via jackknife analysis and evaluated the effects of temperature on mycelial growth and survival to elucidate determinants of their distribution. The predicted potential distributions showed that F. torreyae is mainly distributed in warmer areas compared to F. punctata. Jackknife analysis indicated the high importance of temperature variables for each fungal prediction. The two fungi were usually found at locations within upper or lower temperature limits for the growth and survival of each species. These results suggest that temperature is a key determinant of their distributions in Japan. This is the first report to predict fungal distribution based on species distribution modeling and evaluation of fungal physiological characteristics. This study indicates that the projected global warming will influence the future ranges of the two fungal species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFomitiporia 3aJapan 3afungi 3afungus physiology 3ageographical distribution 3amodels 3amycelium 3aprediction 3atemperature 3atrees1 aMasuya, Hayato 1 aHattori, Tsutomu 0 tForests.g2021 Nov. 17, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121115803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00974naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245003200164300001400196520028300210592002800493650001400521773011800535856008200653852000900735655001200744IND60620119620221121055244.0181105e196209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062011962DNAL7 a10.1177/0002764262006001042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouch, W.T.10aEncyclopedias and Education  ap. 19-22.  aThe Editor of the American Oxford Encyclopedia shows how encyclopedias can be used as instruments of education.

After the clearcutting of hybrid aspen plantation, the next generation arises from root and stump sprouts. The economic feasibility of different management strategies of hybrid aspen coppice stands has not yet been comprehensively evaluated in Northern Europe. We compared the land expectation values (LEVs) of hybrid aspen coppice stands managed according to four scenarios: three early thinning methods (corridor, cross-corridor and single-tree) followed by conventional management and intensive bioenergy production (repeated harvests in 5-year rotations) over a 25-year period in hemiboreal Estonia. We considered the historic price volatility of aspen wood assortments under various discount rates (1–20%). We found that the 25-year rotation with different early thinning methods was more profitable than short bioenergy cycles in the case of low discount rates (<5%). The LEV of short coppice cycles for only bioenergy production became more profitable in comparison with those by thinning methods, when higher discount rates (>10%) were applied. Hybrid aspen coppice stands can be managed profitably, but more risks are taken when the management strategy focuses only on bioenergy production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3acase studies 3aclearcutting 3acoppicing 3adiscount rate 3aeconomic feasibility 3ahybrids 3aprices 3atrees 3awood 3aEstonia 3aNorthern European region1 aLukason, Oliver 1 aLutter, Reimo 1 aPadari, Allar 1 aTullus, Arvo 1 aTullus, Hardi 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 29, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04047naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245016300205300001200368506007600380520222000456592002802676596005002704506003702754650001902791650001602810650002102826650002502847650001802872650001302890650003002903650001802933650001902951650002202970650001302992650001903005650001903024650001503043650001903058650001403077650002003091650001203111650001003123700001203133700001503145700001603160700001403176700001703190700001303207700001603220700001303236773010503249856008203354852000903436655001203445IND60647020520221207105213.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064702052DNAL7 a311959632pmid7 aPMC65676682pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-1788-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yunpu10aElevated CO2 concentration induces photosynthetic down-regulation with changes in leaf structure, non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen content of soybean  ap. 255.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Understanding the mechanisms of crops in response to elevated CO₂ concentrations is pivotal to estimating the impacts of climate change on the global agricultural production. Based on earlier results of the “doubling-CO₂ concentration” experiments, many current climate models may overestimate the CO₂ fertilization effect on crops, and meanwhile, underestimate the potential impacts of future climate change on global agriculture ecosystem when the atmospheric CO₂ concentration goes beyond the optimal levels for crop growth. RESULTS: This study examined the photosynthetic response of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) to elevated CO₂ concentration associated with changes in leaf structure, non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen content with environmental growth chambers where the CO₂ concentration was controlled at 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600 ppm. We found CO₂-induced down-regulation of leaf photosynthesis as evidenced by the consistently declined leaf net photosynthetic rate (Aₙ) with elevated CO₂ concentrations. This down-regulation of leaf photosynthesis was evident in biochemical and photochemical processes since the maximum carboxylation rate (Vcₘₐₓ) and the maximum electron transport rate (Jₘₐₓ) were dramatically decreased at higher CO₂ concentrations exceeding their optimal values of about 600 ppm and 400 ppm, respectively. Moreover, the down-regulation of leaf photosynthesis at high CO₂ concentration was partially attributed to the reduced stomatal conductance (Gₛ) as demonstrated by the declines in stomatal density and stomatal area as well as the changes in the spatial distribution pattern of stomata. In addition, the smaller total mesophyll size (palisade and spongy tissues) and the lower nitrogen availability may also contribute to the down-regulation of leaf photosynthesis when soybean subjected to high CO₂ concentration environment. CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of leaf photosynthesis associated with the changes in stomatal traits, mesophyll tissue size, non-structural carbohydrates, and nitrogen availability of soybean in response to future high atmospheric CO₂ concentration and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a31400418cNatural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3aGlycine max 3anitrogen content 3astomatal conductance 3acarboxylation 3anitrogen 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarbohydrates 3aphotochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3asoybeans 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aecosystems 3aphotosynthesis 3amesophyll 3agrowth chambers 3astomata 3acrops1 aLi, Fei1 aHao, Lihua1 aYu, Jingjin1 aGuo, Lili1 aZhou, Haoran1 aMa, Chao1 aZhang, Xixi1 aXu, Ming0 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.255-255dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-1788-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008300165300001300248500002900261520094600290592002801236650002501264650003201289650001301321653001801334653001201352773010601364856008101470852000901551655001201560IND60688667220221121131550.0200416e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068866722DNAL7 a10.1080/096145207017783062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMowles, Chris10aValues in international development organisations: negotiating non-negotiables  ap. 5-16.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aValues are an important theme in discussions in international NGOs, helping to create the conditions for solidarity among staff. But at the same time they are also frequently a source of demoralisation and destructive conflict. This is because the prevailing perceptions of values as instruments of management or as elements in some inchoate mystical whole render the power relationship between staff and managers undiscussable. Values need not be thought of as an instrument of management, and they are above all idealisations. An alternative theory of values is that they are emergent and intensely social phenomena that arise daily between people engaged in a collective enterprise. They are idealisations, but they must be discussed in the everyday context. Conflict is inevitable, but the exploration of the nature of this conflict in daily practice is the only way of ensuring that the discussion about values is an enlivening process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3ainternational organizations 3amanagers 0aCivil Society 0aMethods0 tDevelopment in practice.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 18, no. 1 p.5-16dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145207017783063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011400168300001600282520155000298592002801848650002501876650001901901650002601920650002301946650000901969650001101978650002201989650001302011650001702024650001302041650001602054650001502070650001302085650001102098653002102109653002602130653002202156653004202178653002902220653001502249700002002264773009202284856008102376852000902457655001202466IND60544793720221122015032.0160901e20150730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054479372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Ming-Yueh10aStage-frit: A straightforward sub-2 μm nano-liquid chromatography column fabrication for proteomic analysis  ap. 200-206.  aIn this work we demonstrated a facile method for the fabrication of C18 coordination polymer gel in a capillary, called stage-frit, which was efficiently applied to pack sub-2 μm C18 beads into the capillary by a high pressure bomb for the online separation of proteolytic peptides. The back pressure of the column with 10 cm × 75 μm i.d. is regularly lower than 170 bar at a flow rate of 300 nl/min, which could be operated on a common nanoLC system instead of nanoUPLC system due to the good permeability, low back pressure and high mechanical stress of the frit that will totally reduce the cost for the purchase of instrument. The stage-frit allows long-term continuous flow of the solvent and no significant beads loss or pressure instability was observed during the period. The repeatability of retention time for fifteen BSA tryptic peaks was found to be less than 1.08% (RSD) in six time nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS experiments. The average full width at half maximum (FWHM) of peptide peaks is 5.87 s. The sub-2 μm stage-frit nanoLC column showed better sensitivity than the commercial available for large scale proteomic analysis of total tissue proteins from human spleen. The number of identified peptides is approximately 0.4-fold and 0.2-fold higher than that obtained by utilizing commercial columns packed with 3 μm and 1.8 μm C18 materials, respectively. In the field of analytical chemistry, particularly the use of nanoLC systems, stage-frit nanoLC column offers a great potential for the separation of complex mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3achromatography 3acoordination polymers 3acost effectiveness 3agels 3ahumans 3amechanical stress 3apeptides 3apermeability 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3aproteomics 3asolvents 3aspleen 0aCapillary column 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aNano-liquid chromatography separation 0aTandem mass spectrometry 0aStage-frit1 aHsiao, He-Hsuan0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 July 30, v. 886 p.200-206dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01931naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245007700200500002200277500002200299520091700321592002801238650001301266650001501279650001101294653002001305653002301325653002901348653001701377700001901394773010001413856008301513852000901596655001201605IND60610151120221119102958.0180914s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061015112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2018.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0696-257210aModel-based curve registration via stochastic approximation EM algorithm  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aFunctional data often exhibit both amplitude and phase variation around a common base shape, with phase variation represented by a so called warping function. The process of removing phase variation by curve alignment and inference of the warping functions is referred to as curve registration. When functional data are observed with substantial noise, model-based methods can be employed for simultaneous smoothing and curve registration. However, the nonlinearity of the model often renders the inference computationally challenging. An alternative method for model-based curve registration is proposed which is computationally more stable and efficient than existing approaches in the literature. The proposed method is applied to the analysis of elephant seal dive profiles. The result shows that more intuitive groupings can be obtained by clustering on phase variations via the predicted warping functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMirounga 3aalgorithms 3amodels 0aFunctional data 0aCurve registration 0aStochastic approximation 0aEM algorithm1 aHeckman, Nancy0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2018, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2018.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010300165300001500268520106300283592002801346650001201374650001501386650001901401650001301420650003801433650001601471650001201487650003201499650001501531653002801546653001301574653002901587653001801616653001601634700001701650700001601667700001901683700001301702700001601715700001501731773009901746856008701845852000901932655001201941IND60542376920221119031937.0190402e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054237692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yang10aCitrinin detection using phage-displayed anti-idiotypic single-domain antibody for antigen mimicry  ap. 97-101.  aAnti-idiotypic antibodies (AIds) can mimic antigen molecules and can thus offer an alternative to conventional antigens in immunoassays. In this study, citrinin (CIT) was chosen as a target analyte, and an anti-idiotypic single-domain antibody (VHH) was selected from a naïve alpaca VHHs library to serve as a surrogate for CIT hapten. The phage-displayed VHH was used as a signal-amplification carrier to develop an indirect competitive phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (P-ELISA) for the sensitive detection of CIT. The half-inhibition concentration (IC50) of P-ELISA was 10.9μg/kg, which was 9-fold better than that of conventional ELISA (IC50=102.1μg/kg). Results on P-ELISA analysis of naturally contaminated samples were also consistent with those obtained by conventional ELISA. In conclusion, the proposed P-ELISA demonstrates the potential use of phage-displayed anti-idiotypic VHH as surrogate for small molecules and signal-amplification carrier to improve assay performance for more sensitive analyte detection in food safety monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpacas 3aantibodies 3abacteriophages 3acitrinin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood safety 3ahaptens 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amonitoring 0aAnti-idiotypic antibody 0aCitrinin 0aSingle-domain antibodies 0aPhage display 0aPhage ELISA1 aXiong, Liang1 aLi, Yanping1 aXiong, Yonghua1 aTu, Zhui1 aFu, Jinheng1 aTang, Xiao0 tFood chemistry.g2015 June 15, v. 177 p.97-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01217naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245005200207300001300259506007600272520016700348592002800515506003700543650001800580650002200598650001500620650001000635700001800645700001900663773010700682856008100789852000900870655001200879IND60119421620221207105356.0141214e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011942162DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-12-1382doi7 aPMC33346082pmcid7 a222065862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFredman, David10aMaking enhancers from spare parts of the genome  ap. 2711.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNew studies show that novel long-range enhancers of developmental genes can emerge by exaptation of protein-coding sequences with no previous regulatory function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata analysis 3aenhancer elements 3aexaptation 3agenes1 aDong, Xianjun1 aLenhard, Boris0 tGenome biology.g2011 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.2711-2711dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-12-1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013300157520106800290592002801358650002101386650001501407650001901422650002601441650001201467650002201479650004401501650001201545650001101557650001801568650000901586700002801595700002001623700001901643700002401662700002001686773012201706856007401828852000901902655001201911IND60754214620221120105332.0211023e20210929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421462DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Injeong 10aCharacterisation of Moisture in Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) Sapwood Modified with Maleic Anhydride and Sodium Hypophosphite  aIn this study, the wood–water interactions in Scots pine sapwood modified with maleic anhydride (MA) and sodium hypophosphite (SHP) was studied in the water-saturated state. The water in wood was studied with low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LFNMR) and the hydrophilicity of cell walls was studied by infrared spectroscopy after deuteration using liquid D₂O. The results of LFNMR showed that the spin–spin relaxation (T₂) time of cell wall water decreased by modification, while T₂ of capillary water increased. Furthermore, the moisture content and the amount of water in cell walls of modified wood were lower than for unmodified samples at the water-saturated state. Although the amount of accessible hydroxyl groups in modified wood did not show any significant difference compared with unmodified wood, the increase in T₂ of capillary water indicates a decreased affinity of the wood cell wall to water. However, for the cell wall water, the physical confinement within the cell walls seemed to overrule the weaker wood–water interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3acell walls 3ahydrophilicity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aliquids 3amaleic anhydrides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asapwood 3asodium 3awater content 3awood1 aThybring, Emil Engelund1 aKarlsson, Olov 1 aJones, Dennis 1 aMantanis, George I.1 aSandberg, Dick 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 29, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245019700176300001600373500001400389520153200403592002801935596003201963596002401995650002102019650001402040650001602054650002302070650001102093650003302104650003502137650001702172650001502189650002402204650001402228650000902242650001302251700002502264700002202289700002502311700002902336700002702365700003102392700002202423700002502445700003002470700002402500773013002524856008202654852000902736655001202745IND60707258620221120183450.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070725862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-020-03258-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlvera-Juárez, Esteban14aThe content of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), kisspeptin, and estrogen receptors (ERα/ERβ) in the anteromedial hypothalamus displays daily variations throughout the rat estrous cycle  ap. 451-460.  aNAL-light  aThe content of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), its mRNA, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ) in the hypothalamus varies throughout the estrous cycle. Furthermore, the abundance of these molecules displays asymmetry between the right and left side. In the present study, we investigated the changes in the content of ERα, ERβ, kisspeptin, and GnRH by western blot in the left and right anteromedial hypothalamus, at four different times during each stage of the rat estrous cycle. The serum levels of the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also measured. ERα and ERβ levels changed depending on the stage of the estrous cycle, meanwhile that of kisspeptin was modified according to both the hour of the day and the stage of the cycle. Except in estrus day, ERβ was higher in the right hypothalamus, while ERα was similar in both sides. During both proestrus and estrus, the content of kisspeptin and GnRH was higher in the right hypothalamus. The highest levels of FSH and LH occurred at 17:00 h of proestrus. But at estrus, the highest FSH levels were observed at 08:00 h and the lowest at 17:00 h. Thus, the current results show that the content of ERα, ERβ, kisspeptin, and GnRH in the anteromedial hypothalamus are regulated as a function of the stage of the estrous cycle and the hour of the day. Furthermore, the content of these proteins is regularly higher in the right anteromedial hypothalamus, regardless of the stage of the cycle or time of the day.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN215619cUNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT  aCVU-370898cCONACYT 3aWestern blotting 3aasymmetry 3ablood serum 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrus 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahypothalamus 3akisspeptin 3aluteinizing hormone 3aproestrus 3arats 3aresearch1 aSilva, Carlos-Camilo1 aFlores, Angélica1 aArrieta-Cruz, Isabel1 aMendoza-Garcés, Luciano1 aMartínez-Coria, Hilda1 aLópez-Valdés, Héctor E.1 aCárdenas, Mario,1 aDomínguez, Roberto,1 aGutiérrez-Juárez, Roger1 aCruz, María-Esther0 tCell and tissue research.g2020 Sept., v. 381, no. 3 p.451-460dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-020-03258-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245012000203300001600323520125400339592002801593650002301621650002501644650004601669650002101715650001501736653002901751653003901780653002201819653001801841653002101859700001701880700002001897773009201917856008102009852000902090655001202099IND60544793920221122015349.0170709e20150805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054479392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yunyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9552-141X10aField-induced wooden-tip electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for high-throughput analysis of herbal medicines  ap. 127-137.  aThis study demonstrates the first application of field-induced wooden-tip electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) for high-throughput analysis of herbal medicines. By application of an opposite and sample-contactless high voltage on the MS inlet rather than wooden tips, a high-throughput analysis device is easily set up, and a relatively fast analysis speed of 6 s per sample was successfully achieved. In addition, fast polarity switching between positive and negative ion detection mode is readily accomplished, which provides more complete chemical information for quality assessment and control of herbal medicines. By using the proposed method, various active ingredients present in different herbal medicines were rapidly detected, and the obtained mass spectra were served as the samples' fingerprints for tracing the origins, establishing the authenticity, and assessing the quality consistency and stability of herbal medicines. Our experimental results demonstrated that field-induced wooden-tip ESI-MS is a desirable method for high-throughput analysis of herbal medicines, with promising prospects for rapidly differentiating the origin, determining the authenticity, and assessing the overall quality of pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aanalytical chemistry 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aherbal medicines 3aionization 0aHigh-throughput analysis 0aWooden-tip electrospray ionization 0aMass spectrometry 0aField-induced 0aHerbal medicines1 aDeng, Jiewei1 aYao, Zhong-Ping0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Aug. 05, v. 887 p.127-137dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245004400169300001600213520126800229592002801497650001501525650002001540650001101560653001801571653002701589653001701616653001501633653002401648700002401672773012101696856008301817852000901900655001201909IND60610151420221119102940.0190214e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061015142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2018.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarbac, Matthieu12aA tractable multi-partitions clustering  ap. 167-179.  aIn the framework of model-based clustering, a model allowing several latent class variables is proposed. This model assumes that the distribution of the observed data can be factorized into several independent blocks of variables. Each block is assumed to follow a latent class model (i.e., mixture with conditional independence assumption). The proposed model includes variable selection, as a special case, and is able to cope with the mixed-data setting. The simplicity of the model allows to estimate the repartition of the variables into blocks and the mixture parameters simultaneously, thus avoiding to run EM algorithms for each possible repartition of variables into blocks. For the proposed method, a model is defined by the number of blocks, the number of clusters inside each block and the repartition of variables into block. Model selection can be done with two information criteria, the BIC and the MICL, for which an efficient optimization is proposed. The performances of the model are investigated on simulated and real data. It is shown that the proposed method gives a rich interpretation of the data set at hand (i.e., analysis of the repartition of the variables into blocks and analysis of the clusters produced by each block of variables).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3amodels 0aMixture model 0aModel-based clustering 0aModel choice 0aMixed-data 0aVariables selection1 aVandewalle, Vincent0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2019 Apr., v. 132 p.167-179dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2018.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03896naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245011000212300001200322506007600334520179300410592002802203506003702231650004402268650002002312650002502332650000902357650002002366650001902386650001302405650001302418650003802431650001602469650002902485650002002514650002102534650001002555650001402565650001502579650002902594650001802623650004302641650002502684650001502709650001102724650002802735650002602763650002302789650001602812650000902828650001402837650003002851650002102881650003302902700002202935700002102957700002202978773013103000856008203131852000903213655001203222IND60647020820221207105223.0201028e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064702082DNAL7 a311960402pmid7 aPMC65674812pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-019-2545-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandit, Ashlesha P.10aCurcumin as a permeability enhancer enhanced the antihyperlipidemic activity of dietary green tea extract  ap. 129.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Green tea has polyphenols like flavonoids and catechins; mainly epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC) and epicatechin (EC), out of which EGCG is of higher abundance. EGCG has shown preventive role in hypercholesterolemia. However, due to low oral bioavailability, a need arises to improve its membrane permeability and transporter-mediated intestinal efflux. Therefore, an attempt was made to enhance permeability and bioavailability of EGCG using curcumin to treat hyperlipidemia. Further, it was formulated in herbal tea bags to achieve patient compliance. METHODS: EGCG extracted from green tea leaves was confirmed by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography. Green tea extract (GTE), curcumin and their mixtures were subjected to Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry for compatibility studies. Powder formulation was prepared comprising GTE, curcumin, sucralose and cardamom. RESULTS: Ex-vivo study was performed on everted goat intestine, analyzed by HPLC and demonstrated highest permeation of GTE:curcumin (220:50) (53.15%) than GTE (20.57%). Antihyperlipidemic activity was performed in rats for 15 days. Blood sample analysis of rats of test groups (formulation and GTE solution) fed on high fat diet showed (mg/dl):cholesterol 80 and 90, triglycerides 73.25 and 85.5, HDL 50.75 and 46, LDL 43.9 and 46, VLDL 14.65 and 17.1 respectively with significant lipid regulating effect. CONCLUSION: Curcumin enhanced permeability of EGCG. Therefore, P-glycoprotein pump inside intestine can be potential mechanism to enhance permeability of EGCG. Thus, EGCG-curcumin herbal tea bag is promising nutraceutical to treat hyperlipidemia in day-to-day life achieving patient compliance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aP-glycoproteins 3aalternative medicine 3abags 3abioavailability 3ablood sampling 3acardamom 3acurcumin 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aepicatechin 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aex vivo studies 3afunctional foods 3agoats 3agreen tea 3aherbal tea 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahypercholesterolemia 3aintestines 3aleaves 3alow density lipoprotein 3amembrane permeability 3apatient compliance 3apolyphenols 3arats 3asucralose 3athin layer chromatography 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein1 aJoshi, Shreyas R.1 aDalal, Preeti S.1 aPatole, Vinita C.0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.129-129dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2545-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245013800188300001600326520121700342592002801559650003801587650002201625650001601647650002801663650000901691650001601700650001001716650000901726650001001735650001101745650001301756650002001769650001601789650001201805650003001817650002401847650002501871650000901896650002401905650003801929650002501967650003401992650001602026700002202042700002302064700002802087700002402115700002402139773013002163856008202293852000902375655001202384IND4486588620221121061637.0201220e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448658862DNAL7 a216814672pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-011-9112-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChantiratikul, Anut10aResponses of Growing Japanese Quails that Received Selenium from Selenium Enriched Kale Sprout (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra L.)  ap. 760-768.  aThe objectives of this study were to determine the effect of selenium (Se) from Se-enriched kale sprout (Brassica oleracea var. alboglabra L.) on the performance and Se concentrations in tissues of growing Japanese quails. Two hundred quails were divided into five treatments. Each treatment consisted of four replicates and each replicate contained ten quails in a completely randomize design. The experiment was conducted for 5 weeks. The treatments were T1, control diet; T2, control diet plus 0.2 mg Se/kg from sodium selenite; T3, T4, and T5, control diet plus 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg Se/kg from Se-enriched kale sprout. The results revealed that Se supplementation had no impact on feed intake, performance, and carcass characteristics of quails (p > 0.05). However, Se supplementation from both sodium selenite and Se-enriched kale sprout increased (p < 0.05) Se concentrations in the heart and breast meat of quails. Se concentrations in the liver and breast meat of quails increased (p < 0.05) with increasing Se concentration from Se-enriched kale sprout. The results indicate that Se from Se-enriched kale sprout offers no advantage over Se from sodium selenite on tissue Se concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea var. alboglabra 3aCoturnix japonica 3abreast meat 3acarcass characteristics 3adiet 3afeed intake 3aheart 3akale 3aliver 3aquails 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBrassicaxchemistry 2aCoturnixxphysiology 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aEatingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSeleniumxmetabolism 2aSodium Selenitexpharmacology 2aWeight Gain1 aChinrasri, Orawan1 aPakmaruek, Pornpan1 aChantiratikul, Piyanete1 aThosaikham, Withpol1 aAengwanich, Worapol0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 Dec., v. 144, no. 1-3 p.760-768dHumana Press IncwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-011-9112-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01255naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002200187245008500209300001300294506007600307520015700383592002800540506003700568650001500605650001000620650001600630650002000646650001100666650001100677700002100688773010700709856008000816852000900896655001200905IND60119421920221207095419.0141214e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011942192DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-2-1032doi7 aPMC31887872pmcid7 a213202972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStilling, Roman M12aA Drosophila model for the role of epigenetics in brain function and development  ap. 2461.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA genetic study in Drosophila gives important insights into the epigenetic control of gene expression implicated in a human mental retardation syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3abrain 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amodels1 aFischer, André,0 tGenome biology.g2011 Sept., v. 12, no. 2 p.2461-2461dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-2-1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245006800213300001600281520091300297592002801210650001901238650001701257650001401274650001601288650001401304650005801318650001201376653001201388653001301400653001701413653001601430653001501446700001801461700001501479700002201494773010001516856008701616852000901703655001201712IND60542377120221119032138.0190402e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054237712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiddicoat, Callum1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1648-002410aThiamin analysis in red wine by fluorescence reverse phase-HPLC  ap. 325-329.  aThe derivatization of thiamin vitamers to their respective thiochrome by ferricyanide to facilitate fluorescence detection following separation by HPLC provides a powerful analytical tool. However the polyphenolic compounds in red wine readily interact with ferricyanide, reducing the effectiveness of ferricyanide oxidation in the derivatization of thiamin. We describe a method to facilitate the removal of polyphenolic compounds that interfere with the ferricyanide derivatization of thiamin. Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone afforded the total removal of phenolic compounds from red wines and allowed a spike recovery of thiamin vitamers (101% for thiamin; 104% for TMP; and 100% for TDP) in a wide range of red wines. This research found that Merlot styles of red wine contained the highest concentration of total thiamin (29.01ng/mL) while Pinot Noir wines contained the lowest total concentration (8.27ng/mL).  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3afluorescence 3aoxidation 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3athiamin 0aThiamin 0aVitamers 0aFerricyanide 0aPolyphenols 0aThiochrome1 aHucker, Barry1 aLiang, Hao1 aVriesekoop, Frank0 tFood chemistry.g2015 June 15, v. 177 p.325-329dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015700172300001600329520167100345592002802016650002502044650001502069650001902084650001602103650001702119650001502136650002002151650002502171650001202196650002302208650001602231650001302247650001302260650001402273650001102287650000702298650001302305650002102318650000902339650002902348650004402377653001702421653002602438653002202464653001002486653001202496653002102508700001702529700006302546700001902609700002202628700001602650700001602666700002202682700001802704700001402722700001602736773009202752856008102844852000902925655001202934IND60544794220221122014803.0160901e20150730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054479422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCháfer-Pericás, C.10aUltra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry determination of lipid peroxidation biomarkers in newborn serum samples  ap. 214-220.  aByproducts of arachidonic (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) oxidation are highly relevant for the study of free radical associated conditions in the perinatal period. Plasma metabolites can provide the clinician with a snapshot of the oxidant status of patients before and after specific clinical interventions (e.g.: supplementation with oxygen). We describe a new andreliable ultra-performance liquid mass spectrometry method to determine F2-isoprostanes and other byproducts (isoprostanes, isofurans, neuroprostanes, neurofurans) in newborn serum samples. Cord blood samples were obtained from severely depressed newborn infants (Apgar score 1 min < 3; arterial cord pH < 7.00), and aliquoted for serum determination and stored at −80 °C. A UHPLC-MS/MS method was employed. It has a series of technical advantages: simple sample treatment; reduced sample volume (100 μL) which is essential for preterm neonates with low circulating blood volume, high throughput of sample analysis (96 samples in less than 24 h) and high selectivity for different isoprostanes isomers. Excellent sensitivity was achieved within limits of detection between 0.06 and 4.2 nmol L−1, which renders this method suitable to monitoranalyte concentration in newborn samples. The method's precision was satisfactory; with coefficients of variation around 5–12% (intra-day) and 7–17% (inter-day). The reliability of the described method was assessed by analysis of spiked serum samples obtaining recoveries between 70% and 120%. The proposed method has rendered suitable for serum determination for newborn babies at risk of oxygen free radical associated conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3ablood volume 3abyproducts 3adetection limit 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aisomers 3alipid peroxidation 3ametabolites 3aneonates 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3apatients 3aperinatal period 3arisk 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aIsoprostanes 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMass spectrometry 0aSerum 0aNewborn 0aOxidative stress1 aRahkonen, L.1 aSánchez-Illana, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7630-06141 aKuligowski, J.1 aTorres-Cuevas, I.1 aCernada, M.1 aCubells, E.1 aNuñez-Ramiro, A.1 aAndersson, S.1 aVento, M.1 aEscobar, J.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 July 30, v. 886 p.214-220dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008900169300001600258520109000274592002801364650001301392650000901405650001101414653001601425653001401441653001801455653002201473653002501495653002201520653002801542653003401570773012101604856008401725852000901809655001201818IND60122843520221117160959.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012284352DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2013.8531202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaffi, Mohamed10aAnalytic solution to a one-dimensional, leaky, heterogeneous transient aquifer model  ap. 138-153.  aA closed form solution of a 1D heterogeneous transient aquifer model is developed. The aquifer model is considered over a finite domain (0, L) with only one transmissivity jump located at some position x ₀. The solution is studied in the light of two parameters, namely the magnitude of the transmissivity jump and the eccentricity of the jump locus x ₀ with respect to the middle of the domain. At least two schemes can be envisaged: the first scheme, not considered in this work, combines the effect of the two aforementioned parameters while developing the solution. The second scheme separates them by confining the locus x ₀ within a symmetrical sub-domain. In this way the solution restricted to this sub-domain involves only the transmissivity jump but is free from the effect of eccentricity. Then the problem is solved over the remaining part of the flow domain (0, L) as a homogeneous aquifer model. Afterwards, the derived solutions are concatenated using the flux continuity principle. These two schemes differ basically in the structure of the solution they produce.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aloci 3amodels 0agroundwater 0atransient 0aheterogeneous 0aLaplace transform 0aChebyshev polynomial 0aanalytic solution 0atranscendental equation 0aintegro-differential equation0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 59, no. 1 p.138-153dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2013.8531203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015300165300001600318520174500334592002802079650002502107650001102132650001902143650001602162650001102178650000902189650002102198650001802219650001702237650002002254650001202274653002802286653001602314653002802330653003702358700001502395700001602410700001802426700001702444700001702461700001702478700001702495700001702512773009202529856008102621852000902702655001202711IND60544794320221122001949.0170709e20150805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054479432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeng, Jiapeng10aDirect infusion electrospray ionization–ion mobility–mass spectrometry for comparative profiling of fatty acids based on stable isotope labeling  ap. 148-154.  aA rapid method for fatty acids (FAs) comparative profiling based on carboxyl-specific stable isotope labeling (SIL) and direct infusion electrospray ionization–ion mobility–mass spectrometry (ESI–IM–MS) is established. The design of the method takes advantage of the three-dimensional characteristics of IM–MS including drift time, m/z and ion intensity, for comparison of d0-/d6-2,4-dimethoxy-6-piperazin-1-yl pyrimidine (DMPP)-labeled FAs. In particular, without chromatographic separation, the method allowed direct FAs profiling in complex samples due to the advantageous priority of DMPP in signal enhancement as well as the extra resolution that IM–MS offered. Additionally, the d0-/d6-DMPP-labeled FAs showed expected features, including very similar drift times, 6 Da mass deviations, specific reporter ions, similar MS responses, and adherence to the drift time rule regarding the influence of carbon chain length and unsaturation on relative drift times. Therefore, the introduction of isotope analogs minimized the matrix effect and variations in quantification and ensured accurate identification of non-targeted FAs by those typical features. Peak intensity ratios between d0-/d6-DMPP-labeled ions were subsequently used in relative quantification for the detected FAs. The established strategy has been applied successfully in the rapid profiling of trace free FAs between normal and cancerous human thyroid tissues. Sixteen free FAs were found with the increased level with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) compared to the normal tissue samples. The integrated SIL technique and ESI–IM–MS are expected to serve as an alternative tool for high-throughput analysis of FAs in complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acarbon 3achromatography 3afatty acids 3ahumans 3aions 3aisotope labeling 3arapid methods 3aspectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3atissues 0aStable isotope labeling 0aFatty acids 0aElectrospray ionization 0aIon mobility–mass spectrometry1 aGuan, Qing1 aSun, Tuanqi1 aWang, Haoyang1 aCui, Jianlan1 aLiu, Qinghao1 aZhang, Zhixu1 aZhang, Manyu1 aGuo, Yinlong0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Aug. 05, v. 887 p.148-154dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245011200192300001600304520129000320592002801610653002601638653001601664653002501680653002401705700002101729773013701750856011701887852000902004655001202013IND60126923120221119224917.0151108e200105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012692312DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2001)094[0420:CCRAWL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShelton, Thomas G.10aCyclic CO2 Release and Water Loss in Alates of the Eastern Subterranean Termite (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae)  ap. 420-426.  aCO₂ release and water loss of unmated alates of Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar), collected immediately before flight, were examined using flow-through respirometry. Whole body lipid and water content and cuticular permeability were also determined. Two models were used to estimate cuticular surface area for permeability calculation. CO₂ release and water loss cycled concurrently in 90.9 and 66.7% of the recordings for males and females, respectively. Level of cycling of the recordings was determined by use of the coefficient of variability of the V˙˙CO₂. Cyclic traces (40.4 ±± 3.4 for females and 53.7 ±± 2.1% for males) had greater coefficient of variability than acyclic traces (31.7 ±± 6.1 and 40.5 ±± 3.2%, for females and males, respectively) from both genders. Mean overall V˙˙CO₂ did not vary significantly with alate gender. Lipid content (≈≈12%) was not significantly different between genders of R. flavipes alates. However, cuticular permeability values varied depending on the model for determining surface area used. Cuticular permeability values calculated using Meeh’’s formula were comparable to those reported in the literature (28.3 and 36.1 μμg H₂O lost cm⁻⁻² h⁻⁻¹ mmHg⁻⁻¹, for females and males, respectively).  aPublisher supplied data 0asubterranean termites 0arespiration 0aCO2 release patterns 0awater loss patterns1 aAppel, Arthur G.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2001 May, v. 94, no. 3 p.420-426dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282001%29094%5B0420%3ACCRAWL%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245006700157300001800224520125700242592002801499650001501527650002801542650002701570650002301597650002401620650001101644650001101655650001901666650001901685650002101704650001901725650001101744700002401755700002201779773010801801856007501909852000901984655001201993IND60532752920221118002843.0160728e20131209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053275292DNAL7 a10.1021/bm40079792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanxia10aBioactive Cellulose Nanofibrils for Specific Human IgG Binding  ap. 4161-4168.  aBioactive films were produced by conjugation of a short peptide onto modified cellulose nanofibrils (CNF). Specifically, a hydrophilic copolymer, poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride-co-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (poly(AMA-co-HEMA)), was grafted via surface initiated polymerization from an initiator coupled to CNF. The poly(AMA-co-HEMA) was used as a spacer and support layer for immobilization of the peptide, acetylated-HWRGWVA, which has specific affinity with human immunoglobulin G (hIgG). Two methods for peptide grafting were compared: modification of CNF in aqueous suspension followed by assembly into a bioactive film and peptide grafting on a preformed CNF film. The CNF-based networks were examined on solid supports via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and extreme resolution imaging with ultralow electron landing energies (scanning low energy electron microscopy). The specific binding capability of hIgG and nonspecific protein resistance of the resultant peptide-modified CNF were evaluated by using quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM). The effects of initiator concentration and thickness of poly(AMA-co-HEMA) layer on hIgG adsorption were investigated in the developed systems, which exhibited high signal-to-noise response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3acellulose microfibrils 3acomposite polymers 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3aimage analysis 3aimmunoglobulin G 3apolymerization 3aquartz1 aCarbonell, Ruben G.1 aRojas, Orlando J.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Dec. 09, v. 14, no. 12 p.4161-4168dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm40079793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01130naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245003600211300001300247506007600260520009900336592002800435506003700463650002000500650001000520650001900530650001100549650002300560700001300583773010700596856008000703852000900783655001200792IND60119422020221207105601.0141214e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011942202DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-2-1042doi7 aPMC31887882pmcid7 a213492072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrayling, Timothy M10aPiecing together the FTO jigsaw  ap. 2462.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo recent studies of the FTO gene provide more information on how it affects body mass index.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3agenes 3ahuman genetics 3ahumans 3amolecular genetics1 aOng, Ken0 tGenome biology.g2011 Sept., v. 12, no. 2 p.2462-2462dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-2-1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013900154520163700293592002801930650002801958650001101986650002501997650001502022650001602037650001502053650002202068650001602090650002502106650001302131650003202144650001002176651001002186700001702196700001802213700001602231773012102247856007402368852000902442655001202451IND60757725220221120051442.0211125e20211118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075772522DNAL7 a10.3390/f121115902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hao 10aExploring the Effects of Thinning on Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb. Carbon Allocation in Southwestern China Using a Process-Based Model  aWe investigated the effects of thinning intensity on the carbon allocation of Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb. Hook by analyzing the stand growth and carbon content of a plantation under three thinning intensities (I: 70%; II: 50%; III: 30%) and with no thinning treatment. Using the carbon balance framework of the CROwn BASe (CROBAS) model and multi-source inventory data, we calibrated the parameters of the CROBAS-C. lanceolata (CROBAS-CL) model to simulate the carbon content in the plantation. We validated the CROBAS-CL model by comparing the predicted stand diameter at breast height (DBH) and stand height (H) with the measured values. Finally, the predicted stand carbon was compared with the soil carbon to assess the dynamics and allocation of ecosystem carbon content. Overall, our findings suggest that the predicted stand carbon of CROBAS-CL satisfies the statistical test requirements: the deviation of height and DBH predicted by the CROBAS-CL model from the measured height and DBH are less than 0.087 m and 0.165 cm, respectively. These results confirm that the model is useful for a dynamic prediction of stand carbon in C. lanceolata plantations. Based on the results of the proposed model, we determine that Thinning III (30% thinning intensity) is beneficial for the growth of C. lanceolata plantations and improving soil carbon sequestration. Additionally, the simulated carbon storage of an individual tree in the C. lanceolata plantation gradually increased with the tree age. Our study provides a strong reference for the efficient operation and management of C. lanceolata plantations in southwestern China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystems 3ainventories 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3asoil carbon 3astatistical analysis 3atree age 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aChina1 aLiao, Ziyan 1 aMing, Angang 1 aMiao, Ning 0 tForests.g2021 Nov. 18, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121115903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01790naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245011800175300001600293500001900309520079400328592002801122650001201150650001901162651001501181653001801196653002501214653001801239653002001257773010901277856008101386852000901467655001201476IND60688668220221121105738.0200416e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068866822DNAL7 a10.1080/096145207017789752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahan Chowdhury, Nusrat12aA journey towards development: the impact of local NGO programmes on women living in the char lands of Bangladesh  ap. 117-124.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBoth national and international policy-making institutions have acknowledged the contribution of NGOs in alleviating poverty, through empowering the poor and continuing to support their endeavours. In Bangladesh NGOs are working at national and local levels, but very few are working with the poorest and most vulnerable groups who live in the riverine and coastal areas, known as the char lands. These areas are unlike other parts of the country in terms of their physical, economic, and social structures, and they require a different approach in order to address the unique set of problems facing those who live there. Using experimental and innovative programmes, a small number of local NGOs have begun to make an impact in an area where government interventions and success are rare.  aPublisher supplied data 3apoverty 3ariparian areas 3aBangladesh 0aCivil society 0aGender and diversity 0aSocial sector 0aSouth-East Asia0 tDevelopment in practice.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 18, no. 1 p.117-124dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145207017789753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01265naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002300187245007000210300001300280506007600293520026200369592002800631506003700659650000800696650000800704650002200712700002100734773010700755856008000862852000900942655001200951IND60119422220221207095410.0141214e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011942222DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-2-2172doi7 aPMC31887912pmcid7 a213492082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, John F.,14aThe properties and applications of single-molecule DNA sequencing  ap. 2464.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSingle-molecule sequencing enables DNA or RNA to be sequenced directly from biological samples, making it well-suited for diagnostic and clinical applications.

In this study, we investigated the possible causes that affect the development of the male heads and genitalia by comparing variability of weight among body parts and allometry in each part to body size. Genitalia varied least in weight among males, and the frequency distribution of their weight was approximately normal. In contrast, the frequency distribution of head weight exhibited a conspicuous skew. Significant positive allometry was found for heads, whereas genitalia showed significant negative allometry. Heads that are used for fighting are allometrically highly variable, whereas genitalia are highly stable, suggesting variable strategies for obtaining mates while maintaining equally sexually functional genitalia. The low variability and low allometric coefficient with body size for genitalia may indicate that the development mechanism for genitalia is separated from that for other body parts, as a result of sexual selection.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLucanidae 0aallometry 0ahead 0agenitalia 0alock-and-key hypothesis 0asexual selection hypothesis1 aMizota, Koji1 aAkimoto, Shin-Ichi0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2001 May, v. 94, no. 3 p.462-466dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282001%29094%5B0462%3AAPOHAG%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011200209300001800321520163700339592002801976650001702004650001702021650002602038650001202064650001502076650002402091650001202115650000702127650001702134650001902151651001302170700001702183773013302200856008202333852000902415655001202424IND60643679620221119193800.0190512e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064367962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-019-01959-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCay, Timothy S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9169-109410aInvasive lumbricid earthworms in northeastern North American forests and consequences for leaf-litter fauna  ap. 2081-2093.  aColonization of North America by exotic earthworms has been implicated in undesirable changes in soil structure, nutrient cycling, and biodiversity. Invasion by putative European earthworms has a long history in northeastern North America. Partly for this reason, factors that may be continuing to facilitate expansion of earthworm distributions and the consequences of earthworm spread in the Northeast get relatively little attention. We sampled earthworms and environmental attributes at 85 sites in central New York. We additionally sampled leaf-litter fauna at 25 of these sites. We detected no earthworms at 27 of 71 forested sites (38%). Forested sites without detectable earthworm populations were farther from the nearest road and had soils of lower pH than forested sites with earthworms. Proximity of the nearest road was strongly associated with earthworm diversity and abundance, and earthworm biomass was highest in low, moist areas. We found a strong, negative relationship between the biomass of earthworms and abundance of invertebrates in the litter layer. This association was likely mediated by the abundance of organic litter, which was lower at sites with high biomass of earthworms. Sites with only the putative native Bimastos (Dendrodrilus) rubidus had a high mass of leaf litter and large numbers of leaf litter animals despite high densities of this species. We believe that there is potential for further expansion of European earthworm taxa in the Northeast and strong evidence for negative consequences of this expansion. Additional regulations on activities that promote introduction may be necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendrodrilus 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3aearthworms 3aecological invasion 3aforests 3apH 3aplant litter 3asoil structure 3aNew York1 aScull, Peter0 tBiological invasions.g2019 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.2081-2093dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-01959-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015800158520214800316592002802464650002202492650001902514650002402533650001402557650002102571650001402592650001402606650001802620650002102638650001602659650001702675651001002692700001802702700002002720700001302740700001402753773012102767856007402888852000902962655001202971IND60757725520221120061620.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075772552DNAL7 a10.3390/f121115932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Shiming 10aEffects of Temperature, Scarification, Stratification, Phytohormones, and After-Ripening on the Dormancy and Germination of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. Seeds  aEucommia ulmoides Oliv., the only member of the family Eucommiaceae, is endemic to China and has great development and utilization prospects. The seeds of E. ulmoides show dormancy but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the cause of the seed dormancy and provide fundamental knowledge for the breeding, genetic improvement, and conservation of the germplasm resources of this species. According to the seed dormancy classification system developed by Jerry M. Baskin and Carol C. Baskin, we compared the germination percentage between intact seeds and isolated embryos, constructed water absorption curves, and evaluated the germination of seeds treated with scarification, cold/warm-moist stratification, after-ripening during dry storage, and gibberellic acid (GA₃). The results showed that the intact seeds germinated only at 10 °C with a low germination percentage of 13.3% whereas the isolated embryos had a high normal germination percentage among a wider range of temperatures. According to the results from the scarified seeds, half seeds, and intact seeds, the seed coat significantly restricted the embryo water absorption. The scarification, after-ripening, cold/warm-moist stratification, and GA₃ treatments promoted seed germination. Among them, cold-moist stratification was the most effective method and the temperature range of seed germination increased in both directions from 10 °C with prolonged stratification. The germination percentage increased significantly at constant temperatures with the highest germination percentage of 93.7 ± 0.3% at 10 °C and a light/dark cycle after 90 days of cold-moist stratification. Therefore, the freshly harvested E. ulmoides seeds exhibited a combinational dormancy comprising physical and Type 3 non-deep physiological dormancy, causing limited embryo water absorption by the seed coat and a low embryo growth potential. Given the unique phylogenetic characteristics and utility of E. ulmoides, our findings should promote studies of seed dormancy evolution and the development and application of E. ulmoides germplasm resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucommia ulmoides 3aafter-ripening 3agenetic improvement 3agermplasm 3agibberellic acid 3aphylogeny 3aseed coat 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3atemperature 3awater uptake 3aChina1 aDeng, Zhijun 1 aWang, Xiaofeng 1 aLu, Hai 1 aXue, Hua 0 tForests.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121115933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011200155300001800267500002000285520122700305592002801532650001201560650002801572650001001600650001401610650001601624650002301640650001001663650001601673650001401689650001801703650001101721650001001732650002601742650002001768650001301788700001601801700001601817700002301833700002601856773012301882856007302005852000902078655001202087IND60587790520221119215046.0180102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058779052DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.123412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegade, Á.10aEffect of the diet on lipid composition and liver histology of short snout seahorse Hippocampus hippocampus  ap. 1312-1319.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLittle is known about the nutritional requirements of ornamental fish and the effects which they may have on fish histology. Because of this, 45 young, captive‐bred seahorses (1.37 g ± 0.51) were randomly divided and put into fifteen, 35‐L, glass aquariums. Three experimental diets were tested in triplicate: live enriched Artemia (LEA); frozen enriched Artemia (FEA); and commercial Mysis (M). seahorses were fed twice daily, 6 days a week for 102 days throughout the experiment. The body weight and length of the seahorses were measured every 20 days, and at the end of the experiment, fish liver samples were taken for histological studies. Biochemical analyses of the diets and the seahorses fed on the experimental diets were recorded, and the differences in the total lipid content in each of the three diets were also observed, each reflecting their respective liver lipid content. seahorses fed with LEA treatment showed lipid vacuoles in the hepatocytes with nuclei displaced to the periphery. Similar results were also observed in FEA fed seahorses, but to a lesser extent. In contrast, the M fed seahorses were characterized by having livers with lower size hepatocytes and centrally located nuclei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aHippocampus hippocampus 3aMysis 3aaquariums 3abody weight 3aexperimental diets 3aglass 3ahepatocytes 3ahistology 3alipid content 3alipids 3aliver 3anutrient requirements 3aornamental fish 3avacuoles1 aRobaina, L.1 aNovelli, B.1 aOtero‐Ferrer, F.1 aMolina Domínguez, L.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2016 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.1312-1319dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.123413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002700172245012800199300001800327520119900345592002801544650002101572650001501593650001201608650001901620650001201639650001601651650001401667650001801681650001401699650001501713650002501728650001301753650001601766650004201782650003101824650005101855650002201906650003501928650002701963650005301990700001502043700001702058773008602075856008902161852000902250655001202259IND4466588720221120151545.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446658872DNAL7 a228779362pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotvin, Christopher M.10aRemoval of tetrabromobisphenol A by conventional activated sludge, submerged membrane and membrane aerated biofilm reactors  ap. 1183-1188.  aThe goal of this study was to compare removal efficiencies of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) using typical wastewater treatment technologies, and to identify the most significant mechanisms of removal. Two types of municipal wastewater reactors were studied: a full-scale conventional activated sludge (CAS) reactor with tertiary treatment; and three pilot-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs) having different sludge retention times (SRTs). All four reactors were fed the same influent. A third reactor type, a membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) was fed tap water, ammonia, and TBBPA. TBBPA in municipal influent ranged from 1 to 41ngL⁻¹ (n=10). The CAS effluent had an average TBBPA concentration of 0.7±1.3ngL⁻¹ (n=3). Effluent concentrations from the MBRs were an average of 6±6ngL⁻¹ TBBPA (n=26). Significant TBBPA removal was observed in the MABR throughout the 5week of study (p⩾0.05). Removal of TBBPA from wastewater treatment was found to be due to a combination of adsorption and biological degradation. Based on experimental results, nitrification is likely a key process therein. No significant relationship between removal of TBBPA and SRT was identified (p⩾0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abioreactors 3aeffluents 3anitrification 3atap water 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aBiofilms 2aBioreactors 2aFiltrationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFlame Retardantsxanalysis 2aPolybrominated Biphenylsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSewagexchemistry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWastewaterxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry.1 aLong, Zebo1 aZhou, Hongde0 tChemosphere.g2012 Nov., v. 89, no. 10 p.1183-1188dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007100157300001600228520169700244592002801941650002701969650002001996650001902016650001702035650001602052650002002068650001002088650002302098650002402121650002702145650001702172650001202189650002002201650002402221650001002245650001302255650002002268650001802288650001302306650001302319700002102332700002402353700001702377773010102394856007302495852000902568655001202577IND60137808220221117191200.0150524e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013780822DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.123632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatarino, Rui14aThe impact of secondary pests on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops  ap. 601-612.  aThe intensification of agriculture and the development of synthetic insecticides enabled worldwide grain production to more than double in the last third of the 20th century. However, the heavy dependence and, in some cases, overuse of insecticides has been responsible for negative environmental and ecological impacts across the globe, such as a reduction in biodiversity, insect resistance to insecticides, negative effects on nontarget species (e.g. natural enemies) and the development of secondary pests. The use of recombinant DNA technology to develop genetically engineered insect‐resistant crops could mitigate many of the negative side effects of insecticides. One such genetic alteration enables crops to express toxic crystalline (Cry) proteins from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Despite the widespread adoption of Bt crops, there are still a range of unanswered questions concerning longer term agro‐ecosystem interactions. For instance, insect species that are not susceptible to the expressed toxin can develop into secondary pests and cause significant damage to the crop. Here, we review the main causes surrounding secondary pest dynamics in Bt crops and the impact of such outbreaks. Regardless of the causes, if nonsusceptible secondary pest populations exceed economic thresholds, insecticide spraying could become the immediate solution at farmers’ disposal, and the sustainable use of this genetic modification technology may be in jeopardy. Based on the literature, recommendations for future research are outlined that will help to improve the knowledge of the possible long‐term ecological trophic interactions of employing this technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aadverse effects 3aagroecosystems 3abiodiversity 3acrop damage 3acrop production 3acrops 3aeconomic threshold 3agenetic engineering 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3anatural enemies 3anontarget organisms 3apests 3aproteins 3arecombinant DNA 3asoil bacteria 3aspraying 3atoxicity1 aCeddia, Graziano1 aAreal, Francisco J.1 aPark, Julian0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2015 June, v. 13, no. 5 p.601-612dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.123633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245007100172300001600243520145000259592002801709653002301737653004101760653002601801653001801827653001501845700003701860700002401897700002601921700001901947700002201966773012201988856008802110852000902198655001202207IND60520383220221119131308.0160520e20140129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052038322DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinov, Jordan10aChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Never-Smoking Bricklayers  ap. 397-403.  aBackground: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to occupational exposures remains an important public health problem taking significant toll on the global burden of the disease. Aim: In order to assess chronic prevalence and characteristics of COPD in bricklaying we performed a cross-sectional study including 47 never-smoking male bricklayers (aged 34 to 57 years) and an equal number of never-smoking male office workers studied as a control. Methods: Evaluation of examined subjects consisted of completion of a questionnaire, baseline spirometry, and bronchodilator reversibility testing. Results: We found higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms in bricklayers with significant difference for cough and phlegm. Majority of the chronic respiratory symptoms in bricklayers were work-related. The mean values of all measured spirometric parameters in bricklayers were significantly lower than in office workers. The prevalence of COPD was significantly higher in bricklayers than in office workers (14.9% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.034). COPD in both examined groups was close related to age over 45 years, while in bricklayers significant association was registered for duration of occupational exposure longer than 20 years and work-related respiratory symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings support data about relationship between occupational exposure to inorganic dust and fumes in construction workers and persistent airflow limitation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aairflow limitation 0abronchodilator reversibility testing 0aoccupational exposure 0aquestionnaire 0aspirometry1 aKaradzinska-Bislimovska, Jovanka1 aVasilevska, Kristin1 aRisteska-Kuc, Snezana1 aStoleski, Saso1 aMijakoski, Dragan0 tMacedonian journal of medical sciences.g2014 Jan. 29, v. 6, no. 4 p.397-403dVersitawJournal:23186x1857-57497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02946naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013300160300001800293500001500311520148900326592002801815650001101843650004301854650001301897650002201910650001901932650001401951650002301965650005201988650001602040650002202056650001202078650002502090650001602115653001002131700001302141700001802154700001802172700001502190700001502205700001502220700001902235773012002254856008102374852000902455655001202464IND60556228220221120134442.0161031e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055622822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1252-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Wei10aGenome-wide identification and expression analysis of stress-associated proteins (SAPs) containing A20/AN1 zinc finger in cotton  ap. 2199-2213.  a2019-12-06  aStress-associated proteins (SAPs) containing the A20/AN1 zinc-finger domain play important roles in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the SAP gene family in cotton. To explore the distributions and expression patterns of these genes, we performed genome-wide identification and characterization of SAPs in tetraploid Gossypium hirsutum L. TM-1 (AD1). A total of 37 genes encoding SAPs were identified, 36 of which were duplicated in the A and D sub-genomes. The analysis of gene architectures and conserved protein motifs revealed that nearly all A20–AN1-type SAPs were intron-free, whereas AN1–AN1-type SAPs contained one intron. The cis-elements of the SAP promoters were studied, as were the expression levels of cotton SAP genes under different stresses based on RNA-seq data and validated by qRT-PCR. Most cotton SAP genes were induced by multiple stresses and phytohormones, particularly salt stress, indicating that SAP genes may play important roles in cotton’s response to unfavorable environmental changes. Among these identified SAPs, the expression of GhSAP17A/D is suppressed in cotton response to Vertillium dahliae, and the GhSAP17A/D-silenced cotton exhibits more resistance to V. dahliae. This study provides insight into the evolution of SAP genes in upland cotton and may aid in efforts at further functional identification of A20/AN1-type proteins and cotton’s response to different stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3aplant hormones 3aevolution 3aGossypium hirsutum 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atetraploidy 3azinc finger motif 3aintrons 3aVerticillium dahliae 3asalt stress 0agenes1 aLong, Lu1 aTian, Xinquan1 aJin, Crystal,1 aLiu, Huili1 aZhang, Hui1 aXu, Fuchun1 aSong, Chunpeng0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 Dec., v. 291, no. 6 p.2199-2213dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1252-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170520124700284592002801531650001501559650001601574650002301590650001501613650002901628650001201657650001601669650001001685650001701695650002201712653003201734653002301766653001101789653001801800653001701818700001701835700005601852773009201908856008602000852000902086655001202095IND60761048220221120062528.0220124e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076104822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1231452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Changbao10aRecent advances and perspectives of enzyme-based optical biosensing for organophosphorus pesticides detection  aThe overuse or abuse of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) can bring about severe contamination problems in foodstuff and the environment, which will seriously threaten human health and the ecosystem's cycle. Hence, it is in high demand to establish sensitive, portable, specific, and cost-effective methods for monitoring OPs to control food safety, protect the ecosystem, and prevent disease. The optical biosensor with enzyme as bio-recognition elements has been an effective alternative for OPs detection. Herein, we firstly introduce various enzymes, sensing mechanisms, advantages and disadvantages used as bio-recognition elements in optical sensing for OPs detection. Then, we review various optical biosensing strategies based on enzymes as recognition elements that were ingeniously designed and successfully utilized for OPs detection, with a particular emphasis on photoluminescence (PL), chemiluminescence (CL), electrochemiluminescence (ECL), and colorimetric (CM) biosensing strategies. We not only highlight the state-of-art developments and the construction strategies of the enzyme-based optical biosensing method but also summarize the existing deficiencies, current challenges, and the future perspectives of OPs detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acolorimetry 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystems 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aenzymes 3afood safety 3afoods 3ahuman health 3aphotoluminescence 0aOrganophosphorus pesticides 0aOptical biosensing 0aEnzyme 0aNanomaterials 0aQuantum dots1 aFan, Yaofang1 aZhao, Huimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8952-801X0 tTalanta.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 240 p.123145-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1231453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009500169300001600264520153900280592002801819650001801847650002801865650001101893650002201904650001101926650001901937650001201956653001901968653002401987653002502011653002302036653001802059700001902077700005702096700002202153700001502175773009502190856008402285852000902369655001202378IND60622810720221121082529.0201230e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062281072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2018.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinkens, L.H.H.10aMindful eating and change in depressive symptoms: Mediation by psychological eating styles  ap. 204-211.  aEarlier cross-sectional research showed that a higher level of mindful eating is associated with less depression.

Higher baseline scores on Focused Eating, Eating with Awareness and Eating without Distraction were associated with a 3-year decrease in depressive symptoms. Eating in response to Hunger and Satiety Cues was not associated with a change in depressive symptoms. Multiple mediation models showed mediation by external eating for the domains Eating with Awareness, Eating without Distraction, and Eating in response to Hunger and Satiety Cues, but no mediation by emotional and restrained eating. No mediation by the eating styles was found for Focused Eating. In this study, higher scores on three mindful eating domains were associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms. Mediation analyses suggest that three domains are associated with depression through external eating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeating habits 3aepidemiological studies 3ahunger 3amental depression 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3asatiety 0amindful eating 0aDepressive symptoms 0aProspective analysis 0aMediation analysis 0aEating styles1 avan Strien, T.1 aBrouwer, I.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8762-382X1 aPenninx, B.W.J.H.1 aVisser, M.0 tAppetite.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 133 p.204-211dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009200167300001600259520081100275592002801086650001601114650000901130650001401139650001001153650002301163650000901186650002401195650001201219650002101231650001701252650001901269650002501288653002301313653001601336653001801352653001701370653001401387653001101401700002101412773011101433856008701544852000901631655001201640IND50070343120221119045656.0190318e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007034312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Qian10aMicroencapsulation of astaxanthin with blends of milk protein and fiber by spray drying  ap. 165-171.  aThis study investigated the encapsulation of astaxanthin using spray drying method to enhance its stability and application in food systems. Blends of milk protein (either whey protein isolate, WPI or sodium caseinate, SC) and carbohydrate (soluble corn fiber, SCF 70) were applied as the wall materials. The results demonstrated that spray drying could be applied to transform the stable astaxanthin emulsions into powders with reasonably good properties, including water activity, surface morphology and oxidative stability. The reconstituted emulsions also showed good stability similar to the parent emulsions. The microencapsulation efficiency was high (∼95%) for both wall systems under investigation, indicating the suitability of these wall matrices for encapsulating the hydrophobic astaxanthin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastaxanthin 3acorn 3aemulsions 3afoods 3amicroencapsulation 3amilk 3aoxidative stability 3apowders 3asodium caseinate 3aspray drying 3awater activity 3awhey protein isolate 0aMicroencapsulation 0aAstaxanthin 0aMilk proteins 0aSpray drying 0aStability 0aPowder1 aQuek, Siew Young0 tJournal of food engineering.g2014 Feb., v. 123 p.165-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245013100173300001600304520134800320592002801668653001201696653001301708653002201721653001701743653001701760700001801777700001601795700001601811773012201827856008801949852000902037655001202046IND60520383420221119131150.0160520e20140129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052038342DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmeti, Albana10aDiarrhea Associated Costs among Children Less Than 5 Years of Age from Health Care Provider and Social Perspectives in Albania  ap. 450-454.  aBackground: Diarrheal diseases count for a considerable proportion of morbidity, mortality and elevated use of health services and costs, especially in developing countries. In limited resource countries like Albania, it is essential to assess the costs associated with diarrhea, from health provider and social perspective, as a first step toward prioritization of interventions. Materials and Methods: We used the 2011 information by gathering data from primary care, emergency rooms (ER) and hospitals. Average non-medical and medical costs were used. To assess the social costs of diarrhea we interviewed parents of children with diarrhea. Based on this information the total cost of diarrhea in Albania was calculated. Results: The total mean cost per hospitalized, emergency room and outpatient diarrhea case was $228.97, $17.68 and $9.24, respectively. The total social costs per each hospitalized, ER and outpatient diarrhea case were $45.66, $15.22 and $15.22, respectively. The final burden of diarrhea, in terms of costs, in Albania was approximately $3 million in 2011. Conclusion: The high burden of diarrhea associated costs for the Albanian health care system finances dictates the necessity to assess the costs of a potential rotavirus immunization program in order to prioritize the interventions based on scientific evidence.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAlbania 0aDiarrhea 0aHealth Care Costs 0aPrimary Care 0aSocial Costs1 aSimaku, Artan1 aPreza, Iria1 aBino, Silva0 tMacedonian journal of medical sciences.g2014 Jan. 29, v. 6, no. 4 p.450-454dVersitawJournal:23186x1857-57497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2013.03323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05091naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245007100213300001800284500001100302520314300313592002803456596005103484596005003535596004003585596005003625596006203675650002603737650002303763650001403786650002403800650002403824650001503848650001603863650001503879650001303894650001003907650002303917650002203940650002103962650002203983650002504005650001504030650001304045650001104058650002204069650001004091650001404101700005704115700006404172700002004236700002204256773013204278856008204410852000904492655001204501IND60572590820221120035441.0220117e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057259082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-016-1367-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoxcroft, Llewellyn C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7071-673910aPlant invasion science in protected areas: progress and priorities  ap. 1353-1378.  aReview  aInvasive alien species are a major problem for managers of protected areas (PAs) worldwide. Until the 1980s biological invasions were widely considered to be largely confined to anthropogenically disturbed sites and the widespread disruption of ecosystems in PAs by invasive species was not globally perceived as a major threat. A working group of the SCOPE program on biological invasions in the 1980s showed that PAs are not spared from major disruptive effects of invasions. Early research focused on descriptive studies of the extent to which PAs were invaded. More recent research explored drivers of invasion, and in the last decade much work has focused on understanding the impacts of invasions. We review the current understanding of alien plant invasions in PAs, focusing on four themes: (1) the status and macroecological patterns of alien plant invasions; (2) the threats that invasive alien plants (IAPs) pose and the impacts detected to date; (3) the current focus of invasion science in PAs; and (4) research priorities for advancing science-based management and policy. Of a sample of 59 widespread IAP species from a representative sample of 135 PAs globally, trees make up the largest proportion (32%), followed by perennial herbs (17%) and shrubs (15%). About 1857 papers have been published on alien species in PAs; 45% have focused on alien plants. Some textbook examples of impacts by IAPs originate from PAs, illustrating the severe threat to the core function of PAs. Impacts have been quantified at the species and community levels through the displacement and alteration of habitats. In some cases, native species abundance, diversity and estimated species richness have been altered, but reversed following control. At an ecosystem level, invasive plants have radically altered fire regimes in several PAs, in some cases causing regime shifts and transforming woodlands or savannas to grasslands. Invasions have also had a major impact on nutrient cycles. Protected areas are performing an increasingly important part of the global response to stem the rate of environmental change. Despite this, integrated efforts involving science, management and policy that are sufficiently resourced to generate insights on the status and dynamics of IAPs in PAs are insufficient or even lacking. Such efforts are needed to pave the way for monitoring trends, revising legislation and policies, and improving management interventions to reduce the extent and magnitude of impacts of invasive plants in PAs. While policy instruments to support management of non-native species date back to the 1930s, there has been a substantial increase in legislative support and general awareness since the early 2000s. Still, opportunities to improve research for PAs need to be created. Towards this goal, the establishment of a global PA research network could provide a unique vehicle to explore questions across species or functional groups and systems, at a scale currently beyond existing abilities. Developing an integrated global database with standardized, quantitative information could form part of such a networks function.  aPublisher supplied data  aIFR2010041400019cNational Research Foundation  aIFR160215158271cNational Research Foundation  a85417cNational Research Foundation  aRVO 67985939cAkademie Věd České Republiky  aPraemium Academiae awardcAkademie Věd České Republiky 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aconservation areas 3adatabases 3adescriptive studies 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3afire regime 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aherbs 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3amonitoring 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3awoodlands1 aPyšek, Petr,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8500-442X1 aRichardson, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9574-82971 aGenovesi, Piero1 aMacFadyen, Sandra0 tBiological invasions.g2017 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.1353-1378dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1367-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04960naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245009400205300001800299506010400317506007600421520262100497592002803118506003703146650001303183650002203196650001403218650002303232650002603255650002303281650001603304650001903320650001603339650001903355650001803374650001103392650002003403650002103423650001203444650002303456650001003479650002003489650001203509650001803521650001803539650001403557650001403571650000903585650001403594650002303608650002303631650001303654653002903667653001103696653001103707653002903718700006903747700005903816700005903875700002003934700006503954773015504019856007904174852000904253655001204262IND60787303320221207064311.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078730332DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2021-215672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlopp, Rebecca N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8485-683110aEffect of medium-chain fatty acids on growth, health, and immune response of dairy calves  ap. 7738-7749.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is necessary for the dairy industry to reduce calf morbidity and mortality, and the reliance on antibiotics to treat sick calves, to address the growing concern regarding antibiotic resistant bacteria. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect that feeding dairy calves medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) has on growth performance and health, and the secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of MCFA on energy status around weaning and the adaptive immune response following a vaccine challenge. Thirty-three Holstein bull calves (5 ± 1.6 d of age) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments. Control (CON) calves were fed milk replacer with no C8:0 or C10:0 oil added and MCFA calves were fed milk replacer with 0.5% of a combination of C8:0 or C10:0 oil added. Body weight and average daily gain were measured weekly. Feed efficiency (gain/feed) and the change in body condition score, hip width, hip height, heart girth, and paunch girth were calculated for the duration of the study. Fecal scores were recorded daily and all medical treatments were documented for the duration of the trial. On d 42, 49, and 56 of the study, a serum sample was collected from each calf and used to measure nonesterified fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyric acid, insulin, and glucose concentrations to evaluate energy status around weaning. A subset of 11 calves per treatment were enrolled in a vaccine challenge. At 21 ± 1.9 d of age (mean ± standard deviation) calves were vaccinated intramuscularly with 1 mL of endotoxin-free ovalbumin (OVA) mixed with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. At 42 d of age (±1.9 d), blood samples were collected and used to analyze OVA-specific IgG₁ and IgG₂, and calves were vaccinated a second time. At 56 d of age (±1.9 d), blood samples were collected to analyze IgG₁ and IgG₂ as well as IFN-γ and IL-4 secreted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) treated with OVA or phytohemagglutinin. Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with repeated measures when applicable. A tendency for greater daily fecal score was observed for MCFA calves compared with CON. At d 42 of the study, nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were greater in CON calves compared with MCFA. At 42 and 56 d of age, anti-OVA IgG₁ concentrations for CON and MCFA calves were greater than prevaccination samples. This study suggests that feeding MCFA to calves affects the energy status of calves around weaning and vaccinating dairy calves with ovalbumin combined with an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant is an effective way to evaluate the adaptive immune responses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aadaptive immunity 3aadjuvants 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aantibiotic resistance 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3abody weight 3adairy industry 3adairy science 3aenergy 3afeed conversion 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3aheart 3aimmune response 3ainsulin 3ainterleukin-4 3amilk replacer 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoils 3aovalbumin 3aphytohemagglutinin 3astandard deviation 3avaccines 0amedium-chain fatty acids 0agrowth 0ahealth 0aadaptive immune response1 aHernandez Franco, Juan F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0798-41321 aHogenesch, Harm1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2738-91891 aDennis, Tana S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3424-54981 aCowles, Kate E.1 aBoerman, Jacquelyn P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0336-82950 tJournal of dairy science.g2022 Sept., v. 105, no. 9 p.7738-7749dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-215673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245008700167300001600254520101600270592002801286653001101314653001601325653002001341653001201361653001401373653001701387700001601404700002201420700002701442700001701469700002801486700002601514700002501540700002201565700002201587773009901609856008001708852000901788655001201797IND60520632020221121051838.0160522e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052063202DNAL7 a10.1515/popore-2015-00192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZagórski, Piotr10aMultidecadal (1960–2011) shoreline changes in Isbjørnhamna (Hornsund, Svalbard)  ap. 369-390.  aA section of a gravel-dominated coast in Isbjørnhamna (Hornsund, Svalbard) was analysed to calculate the rate of shoreline changes and explain processes controlling coastal zone development over last 50 years. Between 1960 and 2011, coastal landscape of Isbjørnhamna experienced a significant shift from dominated by influence of tide-water glacier and protected by prolonged sea-ice conditions towards storm-affected and rapidly changing coast. Information derived from analyses of aerial images and geomorphological mapping shows that the Isbjørnhamna coastal zone is dominated by coastal erosion resulting in a shore area reduction of more than 31,600 m². With ~3,500 m² of local aggradation, the general balance of changes in the study area of the shore is negative, and amounts to a loss of more than 28,000 m². Mean shoreline change is −13.1 m (−0.26 m a⁻¹). Erosional processes threaten the Polish Polar Station infrastructure and may damage of one of the storage buildings in nearby future.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArctic 0aSpitsbergen 0acoastal erosion 0asea-ice 0ashore ice 0afjord system1 aRodzik, Jan1 aMoskalik, Mateusz1 aStrzelecki, Mateusz C.1 aLim, Michael1 aBłaszczyk, Małgorzata1 aPromińska, Agnieszka1 aKruszewski, Grzegorz1 aStyszyńska, Anna1 aMalczewski, Artur0 tPolish Polar Research.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 36, no. 4 p.369-390dDe Gruyter Openx2081-82627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/popore-2015-00193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009900157300001600256520105600272592002801328650001901356650001601375650002201391650002401413650001001437650002001447650001901467650002501486650001301511650001901524650001101543650002201554650001101576650001401587650001801601650001701619700002601636700001801662700002101680700002501701700002001726700002101746700002101767700002001788700001501808700002201823773010101845856007301946852000902019655001202028IND60137808620221117191018.0150524e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013780862DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.122912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Minesh10aOverexpression of ubiquitin‐like LpHUB1 gene confers drought tolerance in perennial ryegrass  ap. 689-699.  aHUB1, also known as Ubl5, is a member of the subfamily of ubiquitin‐like post‐translational modifiers. HUB1 exerts its role by conjugating with protein targets. The function of this protein has not been studied in plants. A HUB1 gene, LpHUB1, was identified from serial analysis of gene expression data and cloned from perennial ryegrass. The expression of this gene was reported previously to be elevated in pastures during the summer and by drought stress in climate‐controlled growth chambers. Here, pasture‐type and turf‐type transgenic perennial ryegrass plants overexpressing LpHUB1 showed improved drought tolerance, as evidenced by improved turf quality, maintenance of turgor and increased growth. Additional analyses revealed that the transgenic plants generally displayed higher relative water content, leaf water potential, and chlorophyll content and increased photosynthetic rate when subjected to drought stress. These results suggest HUB1 may play an important role in the tolerance of perennial ryegrass to abiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3achlorophyll 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agrowth chambers 3alawns and turf 3aleaf water potential 3apastures 3aphotosynthesis 3asummer 3atransgenic plants 3aturgor 3aubiquitin 3awater content 3awater stress1 aMilla‐Lewis, Susana1 aZhang, Wanjun1 aTempleton, Kerry1 aReynolds, William C.1 aRichardson, Kim1 aBiswas, Margaret1 aZuleta, Maria C.1 aDewey, Ralph E.1 aQu, Rongda1 aSathish, Puthigae0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2015 June, v. 13, no. 5 p.689-699dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.122913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245021300169300001800382520162700400592002802027650002402055650001102079650001802090650001602108650002702124650001902151650002702170650001502197650001202212650002402224650002302248650002502271650001502296650001902311650001702330650001502347651001102362700002702373700002102400700001902421700001702440700002202457700002102479700001802500773011102518856008102629852000902710655001202719IND60574488520221120060322.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057448852DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9974-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalopoulos, I.10aValorization of the Liquid Fraction of a Mixture of Livestock Waste and Cheese Whey for Biogas Production Through High-rate Anaerobic Co-digestion and for Electricity Production in a Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC)  ap. 1759-1769.  aThe objective of this work is the evaluation of two alternative ways of valorizing the liquid fraction of a mixture of different kinds of livestock waste and cheese whey, namely (a) biogas production through the anaerobic co-digestion of in a Periodic Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (PABR) and (b) electrical energy generation in a Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). The different kinds of livestock manure (pig manure, cow manure, poultry manure, sheep manure and cheese whey) were collected from the region of Metsovo, Greece. The mixture was passed through a pretreatment process producing a liquid fraction that was treated (a) in a pilot-scale Periodic Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (PABR) for methane production and (b) in a lab-scale two-chamber Microbial Fuel Cell for electricity production. In the present study, the experimental data obtained from a previous study [1] were used for the evaluation of a simple mathematical model, based on Monod kinetics, for the PABR using Aquasim 2.1 [2]. The simple model was able to satisfactorily describe the behavior of the PABR in terms of soluble COD consumption. In addition, the same liquid waste, filtered (0.70 μm) and diluted at different initial concentrations, was used as feedstock for electricity production, using a two-chamber microbial fuel cell (MFC). The experiments showed that the MFC performance was not limited by the wastewater strength, since the substrate removal efficiency and the maximum power density were not affected by an increase of the initial concentration. The required time showed a linear relationship with the initial concentration of the substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acattle manure 3acheese whey 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectric power 3aelectricity generation 3afeedstocks 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3amethane production 3amicrobial fuel cells 3apig manure 3apoultry manure 3asheep manure 3awastewater 3aGreece1 aChatzikonstantinou, D.1 aMathioudakis, D.1 aVaiopoulos, I.1 aTremouli, A.1 aGeorgiopoulou, M.1 aPapadopoulou, K.1 aLyberatos, G.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2017 July, v. 8, no. 5 p.1759-1769dSpringer Netherlandsx1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9974-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245009300167300001600260520129800276592002801574650001901602650002201621650000901643650002901652650002601681650001101707650001201718700002201730700002401752700002201776773009801798856008201896852000901978655001201987IND4481904520221121131829.0141112e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448190452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorey, Nicole R.10aDecreasing dog problem behavior with functional analysis: Linking diagnoses to treatment  ap. 276-282.  aBehavioral problems in dogs account for nearly half of the reasons given for relinquishing them to shelters, and thus constitute a significant animal welfare issue. Any successful attempt to manage these problems will require an understanding of the mechanisms that control these behaviors. However, for some of the behavioral problems cited, such as jumping up on people, available treatments are not prescribed after a systematic assessment of the environmental contingencies contributing to the behavior. The current study assesses the use of functional analysis, an established technique for identifying the variables controlling problem behavior in humans, to determine the environmental factors supporting the behavior of jumping up on people in dogs. Statistically significant differences were found in the rate of jumping up behavior across conditions for each dog in the assessment phase. Treatment conditions used the maintaining variable found in the assessment phase. By comparing the rates of jumping up behavior in these conditions, we found the rates to be of lower statistical significance in the treatment condition. Therefore, results show that this methodology is effective in determining the maintaining variables for these individuals, leading to a more precise treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3abehavior problems 3adogs 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental factors 3ahumans 3ajumping1 aTobias, Jarvon S.1 aUdell, Monique A.R.1 aWynne, Clive D.L.0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2012 , v. 7, no. 5 p.276-282dElsevier Inc.x1558-78787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100001800157245016400175300001800339520158000357592002801937650001801965650001401983650001201997650001702009650002702026650001802053650000902071650001702080650003902097650000902136650000902145650001702154650001402171650003902185650001202224650003402236650002302270650000902293650004102302650003502343650002102378650000902399650001702408650003202425650003102457650004402488650003502532700001802567700002202585773010602607856003902713852000902752655001202761IND50059943420221120115809.0121102e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005994342DNAL7 a224225172pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.46352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Vinod10aNeuroprotective Effect of Vitamin E Isoforms Against Chronic Alcohol‐induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity: Possible Involvement of Oxidative‐Nitrodative Stress  ap. 1738-1745.  aSmall‐fiber painful peripheral neuropathy is one of the long‐term complications of alcohol for which there is no reliable successful therapy available. The precise mechanisms by which chronic alcohol consumption produces peripheral nerve fiber damage and loss remain unclear. Emerging data from clinical and preclinical studies suggest that increased oxidative‐nitrodative stress mediated release of proinflammatory cytokines from damaged neural tissues may play a central role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic neuropathy. The present study investigated the effect of both the isoforms of vitamin E (α‐tocopherol and tocotrienol) against chronic alcohol‐induced peripheral neuropathy in rats. Ethanol treated rats showed a significant decrease in paw‐withdrawal threshold in both Randall‐Selitto and von‐Frey hair tests along with a significant reduction in tail flick latency in the tail‐immersion test. A decreased pain threshold was associated with significant alterations in oxidative‐nitrodative stress markers and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α and IL‐1β). The 4‐week treatment with tocotrienol significantly ameliorated behavioral, biochemical and molecular alterations in alcohol treated rats. However, α‐tocopherol failed to produce any protective effect. The results of the present study suggest that oxidative‐nitrodative stress mediated cytokine signaling may be responsible for alcohol‐induced peripheral neurotoxicity and tocotrienol treatment might be beneficial in chronic alcoholics exhibiting neuropathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol abuse 3acytokines 3aethanol 3anerve tissue 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3apain 3apathogenesis 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3arats 3atail 3atherapeutics 3avitamin E 2aAlcoholic Neuropathyxdrug therapy 2aAnimals 2aInterleukin-1betaxmetabolism 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMale 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxpharmacology 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPain Measurement 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSciatic Nervexdrug effects 2aTocotrienolsxpharmacology 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2aalpha-Tocopherolxpharmacology1 aKuhad, Anurag1 aChopra, Kanwaljit0 tPhytotherapy research.g2012 Nov., v. 26, no. 11 p.1738-1745dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.4635  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002000160245009300180300001800273520175600291592002802047650001902075650002802094650001802122650001002140650001602150650001002166650001002176650000902186650001602195650001902211650001902230650001202249650001402261650001502275650002002290650002302310650002302333650001402356650002002370650001102390650003002401650004702431650001202478650002802490650002202518650001102540650002002551650002602571650003302597650002102630650002502651650002602676650003802702700001802740773013902758856004402897852000902941655001202950IND4477409420221119113005.0120531e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447740942DNAL7 a222056652pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2011-46752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumgard, L. H.10aRUMINANT NUTRITION SYMPOSIUM: Ruminant Production and Metabolic Responses to Heat Stress  ap. 1855-1865.  aHeat stress compromises efficient animal production by marginalizing nutrition, management, and genetic selection efforts to maximize performance endpoints. Modifying farm infrastructure has yielded modest success in mitigating heat stress-related losses, yet poor production during the summer remains arguably the costliest issue facing livestock producers. Reduced output (e.g., milk yield and muscle growth) during heat stress was traditionally thought to result from decreased nutrient intake (i.e., a classic biological response shared by all animals during environmental-induced hyperthermia). Our recent observations have begun to challenge this belief and indicate heat-stressed animals employ novel homeorhetic strategies to direct metabolic and fuel selection priorities independently of nutrient intake or energy balance. Alterations in systemic physiology support a shift in carbohydrate metabolism, evident by increased basal and stimulated circulating insulin concentrations. Perhaps most intriguing given the energetic shortfall of the heat-stressed animal is the apparent lack of basal adipose tissue mobilization coupled with a reduced responsiveness to lipolytic stimuli. Thus, the heat stress response markedly alters postabsorptive carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism independently of reduced feed intake through coordinated changes in fuel supply and utilization by multiple tissues. Interestingly, the systemic, cellular, and molecular changes appear conserved amongst different species and physiological states. Ultimately, these changes result in the reprioritization of fuel selection during heat stress, which appears to be primarily responsible for reduced ruminant animal productivity during the warm summer months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aenergy intake 3afarms 3afeed intake 3afever 3afuels 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3ainfrastructure 3ainsulin 3alivestock 3amilk yield 3anutrient intake 3aprotein metabolism 3aruminant nutrition 3aruminants 3astress response 3asummer 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHot Temperature 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLipid Metabolismxphysiology 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aRuminantsxphysiology 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiology1 aRhoads, R.

In this study, we integrated single‐molecule sequencing and high‐throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques to produce a high‐quality and long‐range contiguity chromosome‐scale genome assembly of the soft‐seeded pomegranate cultivar ‘Tunisia’. The genome covers 320.31 Mb (scaffold N50 = 39.96 Mb; contig N50 = 4.49 Mb) and includes 33 594 protein‐coding genes. We also resequenced 26 pomegranate varieties that varied regarding seed hardness. Comparative genomic analyses revealed many genetic differences between soft‐ and hard‐seeded pomegranate varieties. A set of selective loci containing SUC8‐like, SUC6, FoxO and MAPK were identified by the selective sweep analysis between hard‐ and soft‐seeded populations. An exceptionally large selective region (26.2 Mb) was identified on chromosome 1. Our assembled pomegranate genome is more complete than other currently available genome assemblies. Our results indicate that genomic variations and selective genes may have contributed to the genetic divergence between soft‐ and hard‐seeded pomegranate varieties.  aPublisher supplied data  aCAAS‐ASTIP‐2015‐ZFRIcAgricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences  a2012FY110100cKey Project of the National Science and Technology Basic Work of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPunica granatum 3abiotechnology 3acultivars 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenome assembly 3agenomics 3ahardness 3apomegranates 3atrees1 aLi, Haoxian1 aWu, Zhikun1 aYao, Wen1 aZhao, Peng1 aCao, Da1 aYu, Haiyan1 aLi, Kaidi1 aPoudel, Krishna1 aZhao, Diguang1 aZhang, Fuhong1 aXia, Xiaocong1 aChen, Lina1 aWang, Qi1 aJing, Dan1 aCao, Shangyin0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2020 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.955-968dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.132603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04171naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006300160300001200223520298000235592002803215650001203243650002503255650001803280650002303298650001303321650001403334650001103348650001203359650001403371650002103385650001103406650002003417650002003437650002803457700001403485700001903499700001703518773012903535856007603664852000903740655001203749IND60677618620221121082603.0191202s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067761862DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv32n2Ab1992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCittadini, C.10a199 Strategies to improve canine oocyte invitro maturation  ap. 228.  aCanine oocyte invitro maturation (IVM) is one of the challenges of animal reproduction because of low maturation and high degeneration rates. In the bitch, after ovulation, oocytes remain in an immature stage and acquire their competence in the intra- and extrafollicular (oviductal) environments. Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species affect canine oocytes, which can be related to the high amount of lipids they contain. Therefore, the use of antioxidants such as insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) and lower oxygen tension during IVM could be beneficial for oocyte maturation and survival. The purpose of this study was to determine an optimum IVM culture medium and to evaluate the effect of ITS and lower oxygen tension in canine IVM. In experiment 1, TCM-199 and synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF) media were evaluated for their ability to promote nuclear maturation at 72 and 48h of culture. Also, two protein sources were used: 8% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and media were supplemented with hormones. The results revealed that SOF with FBS and BSA had similar results to TCM-199 supplemented with FBS after 72 and 48h of IVM (MII rates of 7% and 4% for the 72-h group, and 4% and 10% for the 48-h group). Synthetic oviductal fluid supplemented with BSA but without FBS produced significantly higher degeneration rates compared with SOF with FBS and BSA (44% and 23%, respectively). Forty-eight hours of IVM decreased degeneration rates, with higher MII rates compared with 72h of IVM. In experiment 2, SOF medium supplemented with FBS and BSA was chosen. Oocytes were cultured in SOF with FBS and BSA supplemented at two concentrations of ITS (1 and 10μLmL−1 ITS). Supplementation with 1μLmL−1 ITS demonstrated a beneficial effect by improving maturation rates up to 20%, compared to control and 10μLmL−1 supplemented group (4% and 6% MII, respectively) after 72h of IVM. For experiment 3, oocytes were cultured in SOF medium with or without ITS (0 and 1μLmL−1 ITS) under two oxygen tensions (5% and 20% O2) for 48h. Results from this experiment demonstrated that the combination of low oxygen tension and ITS (5% O2 and 1μLmL−1 ITS) improved maturation rates up to 26.2%, although there were no statistically significant differences compared with high oxygen and ITS (20% O2 and 1μLmL−1 ITS) and low oxygen without ITS (5% O2 and 0μLmL−1 ITS) groups. These treatments were able to increase MII rates compared with the control group (20% O2 and 0μLmL−1 ITS). Parthenogenetic activation was performed on the low oxygen with or without ITS supplemented groups. The untreated group generated higher degeneration rates after 7 days of culture, and cleavage rates were low for both groups. Nevertheless, an oocyte at the 8-cell stage was obtained in the ITS-supplemented group. Taken together, these results indicate that ITS supplementation and low oxygen tension during IVM improve canine oocyte maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitches 3abovine serum albumin 3aculture media 3afetal bovine serum 3ahormones 3aimmatures 3alipids 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aparthenogenesis 3aprotein sources 3areactive oxygen species1 aDuque, M.1 aDe Stefano, A.1 aSalamone, D.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2020, v. 32, no. 2 p.228-228dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RDv32n2Ab1993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245018100196300001600377506007600393520144500469592002801914506003701942650001101979650002001990650001602010650001902026650002602045650001502071650001402086650001202100650001902112650003102131650001102162650002202173650001602195650001602211700001402227700002102241700001802262773009002280856007302370852000902443655001202452IND60137808920221207102124.0150524e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013780892DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.122232doi7 aPMC43218182pmcid7 a252665762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlow, M.

The interaction between mobility impairments and environmental factors often compromises motivation and ability to engage in healthy behaviours. Such difficulties to engage in healthy behaviours can result in energy imbalance, weight gain and a cycle of functional declines; i.e. obesity can exacerbate mobility impairments and symptoms and increase the likelihood of other comorbid conditions, all of which make it more difficult to engage in healthy behaviours. To help disrupt this cycle, there is a need to identify strategies to optimize energy balance. Thus, this review summarizes clinical trials of nutrition and weight loss interventions in adults with mobility‐impairing conditions. Although adults with osteoarthritis were represented in large rigorous clinical trials, adults with neurological conditions were typically represented in studies characterized by a small number of participants, a short‐term follow‐up and high attrition rates. Studies varied greatly in outcome measures, description and implementation of the interventions, and the strategies used to promote behaviour change. Nutrition and weight loss research in adults with mobility‐impairing conditions is still in its formative stages, and there is a substantial need to conduct randomized controlled trials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abehavior change 3acomorbidity 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental factors 3amotivation 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aosteoarthritis 3arandomized clinical trials 3astroke 3asystematic review 3aweight gain 3aweight loss1 aMoore, S.1 aHusni, M.

The rock succession at Red Hill has been determined to represent the Baranowski Glacier Group that was previously assigned a Late Cretaceous age. Two formations were distinguished within this succession: the lower Llano Point Formation and the upper Zamek Formation. These formations have stratotypes defined further to the north on the western coast of Admiralty Bay. On Red Hill the Llano Point Formation consists of terrestrial lavas and pyroclastic breccia; the Zamek Formation consist predominantly of fine to coarse tuff, pyroclastic breccia, lavas, tuffaceous mud-, silt-, and sandstone, locally conglomeratic. The lower part of the Zamek Formation contains plant detritus (Nothofagus, dicotyledonous, thermophilous ferns) and numerous coal seams (vitrinitic composition) that confirm the abundance of vegetation on stratovolcanic slopes and surrounding lowlands at that time. Selected basic to intermediate igneous rocks from the succession have been analysed for the whole-rock K-Ar age determination. The obtained results indicate that the Red Hill succession was formed in two stages: (1) from about 51–50 Ma; and (2) 46–42 Ma, i.e. during the Early to Middle Eocene. This, in combination with other data obtained from other Baranowski Glacier Group exposures on western coast of Admiralty Bay, confirms the recently defined position of the volcano-clastic succession in the stratigraphic scheme of King George Island. The new stratigraphic position and lithofacies development of the Red Hill succession strongly suggest its correlation with other Eocene formations containing fossil plants and coal seams that commonly occur on King George Island.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAntarctica 0aKing George Island 0aRed Hill 0aEocene 0avolcanogenic succession 0aK-Ar dating 0aflora1 aPécskay, Zoltán1 aKrajewski, Krzysztof P.0 tPolish Polar Research.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 36, no. 4 p.307-324dDe Gruyter Openx2081-82627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/popore-2015-00223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014100163300001800304520151500322592002801837650001901865650001701884650002201901650001701923650001001940650001201950650001101962650002001973650001101993651001102004700001902015700001602034700001502050700001302065773011102078856008102189852000902270655001202279IND60574488820221120043252.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057448882DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9969-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancini, G.13aAn Approach to an Insular Self-contained Waste Management System with the Aim of Maximizing Recovery While Limiting Transportation Costs  ap. 1617-1627.  aThis study is focused on definition of the typology, capacity and location of waste treatment and disposal facilities for use in both present and future management scenarios on the larger Mediterranean islands, using Sicily as a case study. Following estimation of the amount of waste produced in Sicily and the proposal of a pathway aimed at rapidly achieving the 50% recovery target established by the European Union, a series of progressive and alternative scenarios for the management of residual waste have been proposed and analyzed by means of the software platform TransCad in terms of “facility location” and “minimum-cost flow” problems. The cost of transportation was calculated as the sum of different cost components related to distance traveled, staff involved, and vehicle used to collect waste, including fuel costs, tire costs, road tax and truck maintenance costs. The different scenarios were critically compared in terms of transportation costsAnalysis of traffic flows allowed us to ascertain the general framework of increased traffic elicited by the proposed scenarios and assess the impact caused by an increase in “trucks per day” along three critical sections of the road network in Sicily. Overall transportation costs corresponded to approximately 10% of treatment/disposal costs for all scenarios, highlighting therefore how transportation costs should not be over-inflated or used to condition public acceptance as to the location, size and typology of the facilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aenergy costs 3atires 3atraffic 3atrucks 3awaste treatment 3awastes 3aSicily1 aNicosia, F.

Transgenic lines were obtained in which FaMADS9 was silenced. The fruits of these lines did not show differences in basic parameters, such as fruit firmness or colour, but exhibited lower Brix values in three of the four independent lines. The gene ontology MapMan category that was most enriched among the differentially expressed genes in the receptacles at the white stage corresponded to the regulation of transcription, including a high percentage of transcription factors and regulatory proteins associated with auxin action. In contrast, the most enriched categories at the red stage were transport, lipid metabolism and cell wall. Metabolomic analysis of the receptacles of the transformed fruits identified significant changes in the content of maltose, galactonic acid‐1,4‐lactone, proanthocyanidins and flavonols at the green/white stage, while isomaltose, anthocyanins and cuticular wax metabolism were the most affected at the red stage. Among the regulatory genes that were differentially expressed in the transgenic receptacles were several genes previously linked to flavonoid metabolism, such as MYB10, DIV, ZFN1, ZFN2, GT2, and GT5, or associated with the action of hormones, such as abscisic acid, SHP, ASR, GTE7 and SnRK2.7. The inference of a gene regulatory network, based on a dynamic Bayesian approach, among the genes differentially expressed in the transgenic receptacles at the white and red stages, identified the genes KAN1, DIV, ZFN2 and GTE7 as putative targets of FaMADS9. A MADS9‐specific CArG box was identified in the promoters of these genes.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGR12‐40066‐CO2‐02cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aBIO2013‐44199‐RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aRTI2018‐099797‐B‐100cMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aRYC2011‐09170cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  aRYC2013‐12699cMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  a679303cEuropean Union’s H2020 Programme  aERC‐2014‐StG638134cEuropean Union’s H2020 Programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBayesian theory 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabscisic acid 3aanthocyanins 3aauxins 3abiotechnology 3abrix 3acell walls 3acolor 3aepicuticular wax 3aflavonols 3afruit quality 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agene regulatory networks 3agenetically modified organisms 3aisomaltose 3alipid metabolism 3amaltose 3ametabolomics 3aproanthocyanidins 3astrawberries 3atomatoes1 aMerchante, Catharina1 aSánchez‐Sevilla, José F.1 ade Luis Balaguer, María Angels1 aPott, Delphine M.1 aAriza, María T.1 aCasañal, Ana1 aPosé, David1 aVioque, Amalia1 aAmaya, Iraida1 aWillmitzer, Lothar1 aSolano, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5459-24171 aSozzani, Rosangela1 aFernie, Alisdair R.1 aBotella, Miguel A.1 aGiovannoni, James J.1 aValpuesta, Victoriano1 aOsorio, Sonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0159-60910 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2020 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.929-943dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.132573Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002900113040001800142100002100160245011300181300001800294520182500312592002802137650001002165650001102175650002602186650001402212650001202226650001102238650001702249650001902266650002302285650001402308650001502322650001202337653001702349653001502366653001902381653002702400653001802427653003302445653003102478700001902509700002202528773011702550856007502667852000902742655001202751IND60114932620221122224309.0141124e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011493262DNAL7 a251434682pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.13004432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUria-Diez, Jaime10aDrivers of a riparian forest specialist (Carex remota, Cyperaceae): It is not only a matter of soil moisture  ap. 1286-1292.  a• Premise of the study: Plants respond to the prevailing conditions in the surrounding environment, but since they are dynamic systems this response may vary during their life. Thus, the identification of key aspects for the maintenance of plant populations requires the consideration of plant performance across environmental gradients and along life stages. This study examines how abiotic conditions and biotic interactions and processes determine the spatial distribution of two life-story stages that play a key role in the functioning of a representative population of Carex remota.• Methods: We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test for direct and indirect influences of abiotic and biotic factors on seedlings and adults of Carex remota. The variables used in the analysis were number of seedlings, cover of adults, soil moisture, leaf litter cover, relative light, and topographic position.• Key results: Population patterns partially depend on direct and indirect effects of abiotic conditions. Whereas adult individuals were only affected by topsoil moisture, seedling emergence was largely affected by multiple environmental conditions. The number of seedlings increased with high topsoil moisture, low leaf-litter values, high light values as well as in low parts of the study area. The importance of adult individuals in determining seedling success is also highlighted: higher abundance provides seed rain in the surroundings and modifies the microenvironmental conditions favoring high seedling establishment.• Conclusions: As hypothesized, adults and seedlings responded to the environmental conditions differently. Seedling emergence was a critical aspect in C. remota performance, and abrupt changes in the environment during this stage may strongly influence population performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex 3aadults 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3aforests 3amodels 3aplant litter 3aseed dispersal 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3asoil water 3atopsoil 0aCarex remota 0aCyperaceae 0aforest streams 0aseedling establishment 0asoil moisture 0astructural equation modeling 0atemperate deciduous forest1 aGazol, Antonio1 aIbáñez, Ricardo0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2014 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.1286-1292dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.13004433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245017600154300001400330500002000344520116900364592002801533650002601561650001301587650002501600650002001625650003201645650001801677650001801695650002001713650002301733650002001756650003601776650001801812650001401830650001901844650002901863650001601892650001101908650002501919700001301944700001501957700001401972700001301986700001401999773011902013856007302132852000902205655001202214IND60587791220221119214804.0180102e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058779122DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.123552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, J.M.10aEffects of replacing plant proteins with rubber seed meal on growth, nutrient utilization and blood biochemical parameters of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus × O. aureus)  ap. 30-39.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn 8‐week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of replacing plant proteins with rubber seed meal (RSM) on growth, nutrient utilization and blood biochemical parameters of juvenile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus × O. aureus). Five experimental diets were formulated with 0, 65, 130, 195 and 260 g kg⁻¹ RSM replacing graded levels of a mixture of plant proteins, respectively. Dietary RSM inclusion level up to 260 g kg⁻¹ did not affect growth and feed utilization. Fish fed diets with 65–130 g kg⁻¹ RSM showed the highest feed efficiency ratio and protein efficiency ratio. However, high inclusion of RSM (260 g kg⁻¹) markedly reduced the hepatic protease, lipase and amylase activities, and thereby decreased the dry matter and crude protein digestibilities. Similarly, plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activities were depressed by high inclusion of RSM. These results indicate that dietary RSM inclusion level up to 195 g kg⁻¹ did not affect the growth and health status of tilapia, whereas a further inclusion of RSM might result in reduced feed digestibility and antioxidant capacity of tilapia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aamylases 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood chemistry 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahealth status 3ajuveniles 3aplant proteins 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aproteinases 3arubber 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aWang, Y.1 aChen, L.Q.1 aMai, K.S.1 aWang, Z.1 aZhang, X.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2017 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.30-39dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.123553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245010400176300001800280520167200298592002801970650001401998650001402012650001902026650002602045650001402071650001402085650001502099650002002114650004102134650002402175650001502199650002202214650001102236650002402247650001602271650001102287700001902298773011102317856008102428852000902509655001202518IND60574488920221120043132.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057448892DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-017-9960-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Mohammed Noorul10aNumerical Simulation and Experimental Testing of Novel Sonochemical Reactor for Transesterification  ap. 1733-1747.  aBiodiesel is a powerful alternate fuel that has one of the best feedstock in the form of waste cooking oil (WCO). Producing biodiesel from WCO solves two major environmental and waste related issues. Firstly, biodiesel substantially reduces CO₂ and Sulphur emissions and is capable of directly replacing petro-diesel in vehicles. Secondly, using WCO for biodiesel reduces the wastage of a potential fuel source and reduces problems such as sewer clogging which are caused by WCO draining. The biodiesel industry currently needs a continuous, compact, inexpensive and efficient reactor to make biodiesel lucrative and sonochemical reactors seems to be the best option. Hence, in this work a much needed task of a sonochemical reactor design development for biodiesel production is carried out through multiphysics simulations which account for ultrasound waves, cavitation attenuation, reactive flow and chemical kinetics. Numerical simulation is a coupled system of equations like Helmholtz equation, Navier–Stokes and species transport. Additionally, a full scale, closely resembling prototype of the reactor design is experimentally tested. In the prototype testing, piezo-electric hydrophone was carried for three cases to evaluate the acoustic pressure in the reactor. Experiments were performed with the reactor and the final biodiesel product was tested in a GC/MS analyzer. The numerical simulation showed several advantages of the design. The average conversion of biodiesel achievable at as low as 100 W ultrasonic power and was found to be 84%. The experimental testing also showed very high conversion of 91.23% for 100 W power and 12 l/h flow rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acooking fats and oils 3aemissions 3aequations 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amathematical models 3aprototypes 3areaction kinetics 3asulfur 3atransesterification 3aultrasonics 3awastes1 aJanajreh, Isam0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2017 July, v. 8, no. 5 p.1733-1747dSpringer Netherlandsx1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-017-9960-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245015800165300001100323500001500334520181100349592002802160650001702188650002302205650006702228650001502295650003402310650001702344650002802361650002402389650001102413650001602424650000902440650002302449650002202472650001302494650001102507650002002518651001002538651001302548653001802561700002602579700001702605700002402622700002402646700002102670700001502691700001702706773009402723856007802817852000902895655001202904IND50069730220221118163825.0160319e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006973022DNAL7 a10.1186/2041-7136-3-202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenay, Gabriel B10aEstablishing an operational waterhole monitoring system using satellite data and hydrologic modelling: Application in the pastoral regions of East Africa  ap. 20.  a2019-12-06  aTimely information on the availability of water and forage is important for the sustainable development of pastoral regions. The lack of such information increases the dependence of pastoral communities on perennial sources, which often leads to competition and conflicts. The provision of timely information is a challenging task, especially due to the scarcity or non-existence of conventional station-based hydrometeorological networks in the remote pastoral regions. A multi-source water balance modelling approach driven by satellite data was used to operationally monitor daily water level fluctuations across the pastoral regions of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data were used for mapping and estimating the surface area of the waterholes. Satellite-based rainfall, modelled run-off and evapotranspiration data were used to model daily water level fluctuations. Mapping of waterholes was achieved with 97% accuracy. Validation of modelled water levels with field-installed gauge data demonstrated the ability of the model to capture the seasonal patterns and variations. Validation results indicate that the model explained 60% of the observed variability in water levels, with an average root-mean-squared error of 22%. Up-to-date information on rainfall, evaporation, scaled water depth and condition of the waterholes is made available daily in near-real time via the Internet (http://watermon.tamu.edu). Such information can be used by non-governmental organizations, governmental organizations and other stakeholders for early warning and decision making. This study demonstrated an integrated approach for establishing an operational waterhole monitoring system using multi-source satellite data and hydrologic modelling.  aPublisher supplied data 3astakeholders 3aevapotranspiration 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3amonitoring 3anongovernmental organizations 3asurface area 3asustainable development 3asurface water level 3aforage 3aevaporation 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3ahydrologic models 3aInternet 3arunoff 3adecision making 3aKenya 3aEthiopia 0awater balance1 aVelpuri, Naga Manohar1 aAlemu, Henok1 aMd Pervez, Shahriar1 aAsante, Kwabena O.,1 aKariuki, Gatarwa1 aTaa, Asefa1 aAngerer, Jay0 tPastoralism.g2013 Dec., v. 3, no. 1 p.20-20dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2041-71367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2041-7136-3-203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245005300169300001600222520081800238592002801056653001501084653001101099653001301110653002001123653001701143653001901160773009901179856008001278852000901358655001201367IND60520632520221121051813.0160522e20151216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052063252DNAL7 a10.1515/popore-2015-00242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadwiszczak, Piotr10aAnother look at tarsometatarsi of early penguins  ap. 343-354.  aThe tarsometatarsus, a compound bone from the lower leg in birds, is the most important skeletal element in fossil penguin taxonomy, especially in the case of early members of this group. However, any attempt to go beyond the problem of mere classification obviously requires the better understanding of osteological traits under consideration. This in turn touches on the issue of interplay between bone and concomitant soft-tissue structures, such as muscles, tendons and vessels. This paper focuses on the more holistic comprehension of the tarsometatarsal section of the Eocene penguin foot, based on the analysis of the myology and the vascular system of its modern counterparts. A number of graphical reconstructions are provided with a discussion of the role of the hypotarsus and intermetatarsal foramina.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAntarctica 0aEocene 0aHolocene 0aSphenisciformes 0afoot anatomy 0areconstruction0 tPolish Polar Research.g2015 Dec. 16, v. 36, no. 4 p.343-354dDe Gruyter Openx2081-82627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/popore-2015-00243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02108naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010800170300001400278520108900292592002801381650001801409650001501427650001701442650001201459650001101471650001101482650001001493650002501503651001801528700002201546700002001568773010601588856005501694852000901749655001201758IND4480335720221119112434.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448033572DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2011.00553.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Guanming12aAnanalysis of bundle pricing in horizontal and vertical markets: The case of the U.S. cottonseed market  ap. 77-88.  aThe U.S. cottonseed market has seen the rapid development and adoption of seeds with differing bundles of genetically modified (GM) traits. It has also seen an increase in vertical integration by biotechnology firms. In this article, we investigate the price impacts associated with structural changes in the U.S. cottonseed market from 2002 to 2007. We develop a structural model to examine the substitution/complementarity relationships among cottonseeds sold with different genetic trait bundles and under different vertical arrangements. We examine the price impacts emanating from product differentiation, market concentration, and market size. The econometric investigation finds evidence of subadditive bundle pricing in patented biotech traits. While higher ownâmarket concentrations are found to be associated with higher prices, we also uncover evidence of crossâproduct complementarity effects that lead to lower prices. Simulations are used to evaluate net price effects, illustrating the usefulness of the approach in the analysis of changing market structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acottonseed 3aeconometrics 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3aseeds 3avertical integration 3aUnited States1 aStiegert, Kyle W.1 aChavas, Jean P.0 tAgricultural economics.g2011 Nov., v. 42 Suppl s1 p.77-88dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2011.00553.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001600180245009300196300001800289500002000307506007600327520165500403592002802058596007002086596007102156596010102227596004702328506003702375650002502412650002202437650001802459650001502477650001402492650002002506650002902526650001002555650002402565650001302589650001902602650002402621700001302645700001502658700001702673700001902690700001502709700001802724700005802742773013102800856007302931852000903004655001203013IND60685963420221207134034.0200311e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068596342DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.132702doi7 aPMC70618832pmcid7 a315842362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Liang10aGenetic dissection of the gene coexpression network underlying photosynthesis in Populus  ap. 1015-1026.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhotosynthesis is a key reaction that ultimately generates the carbohydrates needed to form woody tissues in trees. However, the genetic regulatory network of protein‐encoding genes (PEGs) and regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), underlying the photosynthetic pathway is unknown. Here, we integrated data from coexpression analysis, association studies (additive, dominance and epistasis), and expression quantitative trait nucleotide (eQTN) mapping to dissect the causal variants and genetic interaction network underlying photosynthesis in Populus. We initially used 30 PEGs, 6 miRNAs and 12 lncRNAs to construct a coexpression network based on the tissue‐specific gene expression profiles of 15 Populus samples. Then, we performed association studies using a natural population of 435 unrelated Populus tomentosa individuals, and identified 72 significant associations (P ≤ 0.001, q ≤ 0.05) with diverse additive and dominance patterns underlying photosynthesis‐related traits. Analysis of epistasis and eQTNs revealed that the complex genetic interactions in the coexpression network contribute to phenotypes at various levels. Finally, we demonstrated that heterologously expressing the most highly linked gene (PtoPsbX1) in this network significantly improved photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, pointing to the functional role of PtoPsbX1 in the photosynthetic pathway. This study provides an integrated strategy for dissecting a complex genetic interaction network, which should accelerate marker‐assisted breeding efforts to genetically improve woody plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a6172027cthe Project of the Natural Science Foundation of Beijing  a2016YFD0600102cthe State ‘13.5’ Key Research Program of China  a31670333, 31872671 and 31872707cthe Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China  aZ181100006218024cthe Beijing Nova Program0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPopulus tomentosa 3abiotechnology 3adissection 3aepistasis 3agene expression 3agene regulatory networks 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3amicroRNA 3aphotosynthesis 3aquantitative traits1 aLiu, Xin1 aLu, Wenjie1 aChen, Panfei1 aQuan, Mingyang1 aSi, Jingna1 aDu, Qingzhang1 aZhang, Deqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8849-23660 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2020 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.1015-1026dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774064x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.132703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092024002100129040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002400195245010300219300001600322500002400338500001500362520139200377650001601769650001101785650001601796650001701812650001601829650001001845650002301855650001601878650001401894650001001908651001001918653002501928653001601953700002201969700002101991773012902012852000902141856011202150856008702262930003302349945002502382946001302407961001302420655001202433IND4438944320221122030901.0100622e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443894432DNAL7 a10.18474/0749-8004-45.2.1702doi7 a10113/458382hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aS200 0aF1201 aArmstrong, J.

The most accurate simulation occurred in 2008 by injecting 1 [mu]L of 10% pectinase into all 4 locules of a cotton boll. This improved the relationships of injury score to seed cotton, seed, and lint weights. The youngest boll age class of >=2 cm diam. (2 d of age) was not significantly more damaged than the medium age >= 2.5 cm (8 d of age) bolls, and both sustained significantly more injury than the large boll classification of >= 3 cm (12 d of age). However, small bolls were at least 3 times more likely to abscise than medium-sized bolls, and large bolls did not abscise regardless of treatment. Some damage was observed for large bolls from the injected and actual feeding compared with the controls, but the lint and seed weights were not significantly different for any of the treatments including the controls. Our study characterizes the feeding injury caused by C. signatus and describes a simulated technique that may be used to further economic injury studies. 3aCreontiades 3aweight 3aseed cotton 3ainsect pests 3alint cotton 3aseeds 3aeconomic threshold 3acrop damage 3aGossypium 3abolls 3aTexas 0aCreontiades signatus 0amethodology1 aColeman, Randy J.1 aDuggan, Brian L.0 tJournal of entomological science.g2010 Apr., v.  45, no.  2 p.170-177dGeorgia Entomological Society, Inc.x0749-80047nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/458383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18474/0749-8004-45.2.1703Available from publisher's Web site  a20101124b20101204c00000000  aINDd1CTe2010/07/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03393naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245014800160300001800308520176500326592002802091650001002119650002502129650002402154650001002178650001502188650002002203650001002223650001502233650001602248650001302264650001602277650001402293650002102307650002302328650001702351650002302368650000902391650002202400650002002422650000902442650002002451650002902471650002002500700001702520700001602537700001602553700001402569700001702583700001702600773012002617856008102737852000902818655001202827IND60556228920221120134617.0161031e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055622892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-016-1242-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Yue10aTranscriptome analysis reveals that constant heat stress modifies the metabolism and structure of the porcine longissimus dorsi skeletal muscle  ap. 2101-2115.  aExposure to high ambient temperatures is detrimental to pig rearing and porcine meat quality. Deep molecular sequencing allows for genomic characterization of porcine skeletal muscles and helps understand how the genomic landscape may impact meat quality. To this end, we performed mRNA-seq to molecularly dissect the impact of heat stress on porcine skeletal muscles, longissimus dorsi. Sixteen castrated, male DLY pigs [which are crossbreeds between Duroc (D) boars and Landrace (L) × Yorkshire (Y) sows, 79.0 ± 1.5 kg BW] were evenly split into two groups that were subjected to either control (CON) (22 °C; 55 % humidity) or constant heat stress (H30; 30 °C; 55 % humidity) conditions for 21 days. Seventy-eight genes were found to be differentially expressed, of which 37 were up-regulated and 41 were down-regulated owing to constant heat stress. We predicted 5247 unknown genes and 6108 novel transcribed units attributed to alternative splicing (AS) events in the skeletal muscle. Furthermore, 30,761 and 31,360 AS events were observed in the CON and H30 RNA-seq libraries, respectively. The differentially expressed genes in the porcine skeletal muscles were involved in glycolysis, lactate metabolism, lipid metabolism, cellular defense, and stress responses. Additionally, the expression levels of these genes were associated with variations in meat quality between the CON and H30 groups, indicating that heat stress modulated genes crucial to skeletal muscle development and metabolism. Our transcriptomic analysis provides valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing porcine skeletal muscle development. Such insights may lead to innovative strategies to improve meat quality of pigs under heat stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aalternative splicing 3aambient temperature 3aboars 3acrossbreds 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglycolysis 3aheat stress 3ahumidity 3alactic acid 3alandraces 3alipid metabolism 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3amuscle development 3apork 3asequence analysis 3askeletal muscle 3asows 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aFeng, Yuejin1 aYang, Peige1 aCui, Yanjun1 aLiu, Jiru1 aYang, Chunhe1 aGu, Xianhong0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2016 Dec., v. 291, no. 6 p.2101-2115dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-016-1242-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010500154300002000259500001900279520091500298592002801213650003401241650001501275650001101290700001301301700001801314700001501332700001201347773012401359856007401483852000901557655001201566IND60739089320221117230432.0210526e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073908932DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra02350k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui12aA dual-functional Ta/TaOₓ/Ru device with both nonlinear selector and resistive switching behaviors  ap. 18241-18245.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, we demonstrate that a Ta/TaOₓ/Ru device can act as both a highly uniform and nonlinear selection device and a stable resistive switching device, respectively, by controlling the voltage applied to the Ta electrode. As a selection device, it shows high selectivity (10³), high current density (25 kA cm⁻²), very low variation, and good endurance. The non-linear performance of the device may be attributed to a trapezoidal band structure modulated by the concentration gradient of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, with a large voltage bias on the Ta electrode, a repeatable and stable resistive switching behavior was observed, which could be attributed to the formation of conductive filaments probably composed of Ta metal and oxygen vacancies. This research deepens the understanding of the mechanism of Ta/TaOₓ devices, and provides a potential solution for large-scale memristor arrays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3aoxygen1 aShi, Tuo1 aZhang, Xumeng1 aWu, Zuheng1 aLiu, Qi0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 20, v. 11, no. 30 p.18241-18245dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra02350k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011000173300001600283520188200299592002802181650001602209650001602225650002002241650001902261650001702280650001602297650001902313650002202332650002102354650001002375650001202385650001702397650001602414653002102430653002002451653001902471653001602490653001102506653001202517653001202529653001802541700001602559700002302575700002002598773009502618856008402713852000902797655001202806IND60622811320221122073423.0201230e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062281132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2018.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadler, Jennifer R.10aIndividual differences in appeal of energy dense foods predicts lower body mass change during adolescence  ap. 184-190.  aHighly energy dense foods are often synonymous with high palatability, excess intake and weight gain. However, food preferences show individual differences. Food preferences are closely related to food intake, which can impact weight change over time. We examined whether the energy density of food images rated as appetizing and unappetizing foods related to baseline BMI and change in BMI over 3-year follow-up (n = 117; 45% Male, Baseline BMI: 21.1 ± 1.9. Participants completed hedonic visual analog scales (−100 to 100) ratings of 103 food images, and reported dietary intake at baseline, and had their height and weight directly measured over 3-year follow-up. Energy density (ED) of the food depicted in each image was calculated. For each participant, food images (kcal/g) were categorized into appetizing (32 images) and unappetizing foods (32 images) based on each individual's hedonic ratings. We observed significant interaction between energy density and hedonic value driven by an inverse relation between unappetizing food energy density and BMI change (p = 0.008). Specifically, participants who rated higher energy dense foods as unappetizing showed less weight gain (β= −0.83; p = 0.00052). There was no significant relation between the energy density of appetizing foods and weight change (p = 0.67), suggesting that dislike of highly energy dense foods more strongly associates with lower weight gain than preference for low energy dense foods. Post-hoc analyses revealed that individuals with a higher preference for low energy density foods showed less weight gain over 3-years (β = - 0.007, p = 0.02). Results support the idea that individual hedonic ratings for foods varying in energy density is a determinant of weight change in adolescents and may represent an important intervention target for obesity prevention programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3aenergy density 3afood choices 3afood intake 3ahedonic scales 3ahigh energy foods 3alow energy foods 3amales 3aobesity 3apalatability 3aweight gain 0aFood preferences 0aHedonic ratings 0aEnergy density 0aWeight gain 0aLiking 0aWanting 0aObesity 0aHedonic value1 aStice, Eric1 aShearrer, Grace E.1 aBurger, Kyle S.0 tAppetite.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 133 p.184-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05874naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005800149245010300207500001900310520386400329592002804193650002004221650002704241650000804268650001404276650001604290650001004306650000904316650001804325650001004343650002204353650001104375650001504386650002004401650001304421650003304434650001204467650001304479650001804492650001404510650001704524650002204541650002604563650000904589650001404598650002404612650002304636650001704659650001304676650001104689651001004700653001204710653001404722653000804736653000804744653001504752653002304767700001904790700001904809700001904828700002204847700002004869700001404889700001704903773012804920856008305048852000905131655001205140IND60734731920221122023404.0210422e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073473192DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-20-0709-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahesha, H.

It is considered the “king of fodder” for its high-quality green fodder, which is a rich source of protein and low in fiber. Symptoms similar to collar rot were observed in experimental sites at the ICAR-Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi (N25° 52′ 749.20″, E78° 55′ 452.70″), Uttar Pradesh, India, in March 2019. The incidence of disease ranged from 18 to 22% during 2019. Symptoms included dark-colored water-soaked lesions at the base of stems, stem thinning (resembles wire stem), and eventually wilting of the whole plant. A white mycelial mat was observed on the stem and collar region, and light brown to tan colored sclerotial bodies formed as the disease progressed. To determine the etiology of the infection, 30 diseased plants with typical symptoms were collected from the three different fields and used for the isolation of causal agent. Infected stem portions were cut into small pieces (5 mm), surface sterilized with 2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 2 min, washed three times with sterile distilled water, and air dried. The sterilized infected tissues were cultured on potato dextrose agar amended with streptomycin sulfate at 50 µg/ml and incubated at 28 ± 1°C for 3 days. After 4 days, hyaline septate mycelia ranging 2 to 3 µm in diameter grew radially over the whole plate (90 mm). Sclerotia formation started 6 days after incubation. Sclerotia were initially white and later turned brownish to tan as they matured. The number of sclerotia per plate ranged from 55 to 120 (n = 5) at 12 days after inoculation. The diameter of matured sclerotial bodies ranged from 0.1 to 1.35 mm (n = 25). Genomic DNA was extracted from mycelium using the CTAB method (Murray and Thompson 1980). Three regions of rDNA, namely, internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit (LSU), and small subunit (SSU), were used to identify the etiology of the disease. The isolate was amplified with ITS1 (5′-CGGATCTCTTGGTTCTGGGA-3′)/ITS4 (5′-GACGCTCGAACATGCC-3′) described by White et al. (1990) and sequenced. The ITS sequence (NCBI GenBank accession no. MT026581) showed 98.21% similarity to Athelia rolfsii (MH514001.1). The isolate also amplified with primers LSU (LROR, ACCCGCTGAACTTAAGC/LR5, TCCTGAGGGAAACTTCG) and SSU (NS1, GTAGTCATATGCTTGTCTC/NS4, CTTCCGTCAATTCCTTTAAG). The LSU (MT225781) and SSU (MT225782) sequences showed 99.90 and 100% similarity to A. rolfsii (AY635773.1) and A. rolfsii (AY635773.1), respectively. Based on the morphological and molecular characteristics, the pathogen responsible for collar rot in berseem was identified as A. rolfsii (anamorph: Sclerotium rolfsii) (Mordue 1974). To confirm pathogenicity, inoculum was prepared by inoculating mycelial plugs of pathogen into autoclaved corn/sand meal (5:95) and incubating at 28 ± 1°C for 12 days. The inoculum (30 g) was placed on the stem portion of 15-day-old seedlings (n = 30) of berseem (cv. Wardan) raised in pots filled with sterilized soil. Seedlings (n = 25) inoculated with sterilized corn/sand meal (30 g) served as the control. The pots were placed inside of a plant growth chamber (26 ± 2°C, 65% relative humidity) for 15 days. Water-soaked spots with white mycelium were observed on the collar region after 3 days. After 7 days, stems were completely covered by mycelia, and death of seedlings was observed 14 days after inoculation. The pathogen was recovered from the artificially inoculated berseem seedlings (n = 15). No symptoms were observed in control plants. Based on morphological and molecular characterization, the present isolate was confirmed as S. rolfsii. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of S. rolfsii causing collar rot of berseem in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aTrifolium alexandrinum 3aair 3aanamorphs 3aautoclaving 3acolor 3acorn 3aculture media 3adeath 3adisease incidence 3aforage 3agrasslands 3agrowth chambers 3ainoculum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alegumes 3amycelium 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3arelative humidity 3aresearch institutions 3asand 3asclerotia 3asodium hypochlorite 3asoil sterilization 3astreptomycin 3asulfates 3awinter 3aIndia 0aberseem 0awire stem 0aLSU 0aSSU 0acollar rot 0aSclerotium rolfsii1 aKeerthi, M.

However, the direct targets responsible for its antiadipogenic action are unclear. Our hypothesis is that resveratrol inhibits adipogenesis through modulation of mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and cell signaling pathways in the early phase of differentiation. To test this, we examined the effects of resveratrol on MCE and insulin signaling pathway in the early phase of adipogenesis in murine preadipocytes. We observed that the antiadipogenic action of resveratrol is largely limited to the early phase of adipogenesis. Specifically, the presence of resveratrol in the first 24 hours of adipogenesis was required for its antiadipogenic effect. During the first 24 hours of adipogenesis, resveratrol impaired the progression of MCE by suppressing the cell cycle entry of preadipocytes to G2/M phase, and expression of cell cycle regulators cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Concomitantly, resveratrol inhibited insulin signaling pathway in the early phase of adipogenesis. Furthermore, we revealed an inhibitory effect of resveratrol on insulin receptor (IR) activity, and this is likely through a direct physical interaction between resveratrol and IR. The antiadipogenic effect of resveratrol is through inhibition of the MCE and IR-dependent insulin signaling pathway in the early phase of adipogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3ainsulin 3alipogenesis 3aresveratrol 2a3T3-L1 Cells 2aAdipocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAdipogenesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Obesity Agentsxpharmacology 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCyclin Axmetabolism 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase 2xmetabolism 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMitosisxdrug effects 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aReceptor, Insulinxantagonists & inhibitors 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aStilbenesxpharmacology1 aSeo, Sang Gwon1 aYue, Shuhua1 aCheng, Ji-Xin1 aLee, Ki Won1 aKim, Kee-Hong0 tNutrition research.g2012 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.607-616dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2012.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01537naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009900167300001600266520063900282592002800921653001100949653001900960653001400979653001600993653002401009700002601033773009901059856008001158852000901238655001201247IND60520632820221121062529.0160522e20160314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052063282DNAL7 a10.1515/popore-2016-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkoracki, Maciej10aChenophila nanseni sp. n.

PCC6803  ap. 18637-18650.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCyanobacteria are promising adsorbents that are widely used for heavy metal removal in aqueous solutions. However, the underlying adsorption mechanism of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is currently unclear. In this study, the adsorption behavior and mechanism of cadmium (Cd²⁺) were investigated. Batch biosorption experiments showed that the optimal adsorption conditions were pH 7.0, 30 °C, 15 min, and an initial ion concentration of 4.0 mg L⁻¹. The adsorption process fitted well with the pseudo-second order kinetic model, mainly based on chemisorption. Complexation of Cd²⁺ with carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and amido groups was demonstrated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analyses confirmed the presence of Cd²⁺ on the cyanobacterial cell surface and intracellularly. Cd²⁺ could lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and photosynthesis inhibition in cyanobacterial cells, and glutathione (GSH) played an important role in alleviating Cd²⁺ toxicity. Analyses of three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) and high performance anion exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) revealed the changes of the composition and content of EPS after Cd²⁺ adsorption, respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) revealed the potential molecular regulatory mechanisms involved in Cd²⁺ biosorption. These results revealed the adsorption mechanism of Cd²⁺ by Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and provided theoretical guidance for insight into the biosorption mechanisms of heavy metals by other strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aglutathione 3aheavy metals 3akinetics 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChen, Ran1 aWang, Junjun1 aFan, Ling1 aCui, Linlin1 aZhang, Yejuan1 aCheng, Jinju1 aWu, Xueling1 aLi, Jiaokun1 aZeng, Weimin0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 25, v. 11, no. 30 p.18637-18650dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra02366g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245013300176300001600309520134400325592002801669653002301697653001101720653002001731700002501751700002001776700002501796700002201821700002301843700002001866773012901886856008802015852000902103655001202112IND60520384520221119131306.0160520e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052038452DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2014.03712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoaty, Maha I.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty eight obese female volunteers suffering from MetS, followed a specially designed dietary therapy consists of a low caloric balanced diet, accompanied by either 30% doum biscuits (group A), or whole wheat biscuits (group B) for four weeks (phase 1). During the next four weeks, they were continued on the hypocaloric diet alone (phase 2). RESULTS The health effects of two dietary therapies were more prominent in improving the biochemical markers of the MetS than in the body weight reduction. The lower levels of serum vaspin were significantly increased at the end of the 1ˢᵗ phase in both groups especially group (A). Sustained negative correlations were detected between vaspin level and both of C-peptide and insulin resistance expressed as modified homeostatic model assessment (M.HOMA). CONCLUSION The effect of the dietary supplements may play a role in alleviating the impact of the components of the MetS and may also sustain the level of the vaspin in the sensitization of the C-peptide in order to attain glucose homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMetabolic syndrome 0avaspin 0adietary therapy1 aEl Shebini, Salwa M.1 aAhmed, Nihad H.1 aHussein, Ahmed M.

Geodiversity—the diversity of Earth surface materials, forms, and processes—may be a useful biodiversity surrogate for conservation and have conservation value itself. Geodiversity and species richness relationships have been demonstrated; establishing whether geodiversity relates to threatened species’ diversity and distribution pattern is a logical next step for conservation. We used 4 geodiversity variables (rock‐type and soil‐type richness, geomorphological diversity, and hydrological feature diversity) and 4 climatic and topographic variables to model threatened species diversity across 31 of Finland's national parks. We also analyzed rarity‐weighted richness (a measure of site complementarity) of threatened vascular plants, fungi, bryophytes, and all species combined. Our 1‐km² resolution data set included 271 threatened species from 16 major taxa. We modeled threatened species richness (raw and rarity weighted) with boosted regression trees. Climatic variables, especially the annual temperature sum above 5 °C, dominated our models, which is consistent with the critical role of temperature in this boreal environment. Geodiversity added significant explanatory power. High geodiversity values were consistently associated with high threatened species richness across taxa. The combined effect of geodiversity variables was even more pronounced in the rarity‐weighted richness analyses (except for fungi) than in those for species richness. Geodiversity measures correlated most strongly with species richness (raw and rarity weighted) of threatened vascular plants and bryophytes and were weakest for molluscs, lichens, and mammals. Although simple measures of topography improve biodiversity modeling, our results suggest that geodiversity data relating to geology, landforms, and hydrology are also worth including. This reinforces recent arguments that conserving nature's stage is an important principle in conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3aclimatic factors 3adata collection 3afungi 3aheat sums 3ahydrology 3alandforms 3alichens 3amammals 3amodels 3amolluscs 3anational parks 3aplanning 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3athreatened species 3atopography 3avascular plants 3aFinland1 aBailey, Joseph J.1 aField, Richard1 aKangas, Katja1 aHjort, Jan0 tConservation biology.g2017 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.364-375dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.127993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245007000211506010400281506007600385520077200461592002801233506003701261650001401298650002501312650001601337651001101353653002301364653002601387653001601413653001701429653003101446653002101477653002301498700001901521700005901540700002801599700003001627700005801657700002301715700002001738773010501758856008601863852000901949655001201958IND60787304220221207045000.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078730422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1282652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Mojtaba1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4841-722X10aDay-ahead inflow forecasting using causal empirical decomposition  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is essential to have accurate and reliable daily-inflow forecasting to improve short-term hydropower scheduling. This paper proposes a Causal multivariate Empirical mode Decomposition (CED) framework as a complementary pre-processing step for a day-ahead inflow forecasting problem. The idea behind CED is combining physics-based causal inference with signal processing-based decomposition to get the most relevant features among multiple time-series to the inflow values. The CED framework is validated for two areas in Norway with different meteorological and hydrological conditions. The validation results show that using CED as a pre-processing step significantly enhances (up to 70%) the forecasting accuracy for various state-of-the-art forecasting methods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahydrology 3atime series analysis 3awater power 3aNorway 0aInflow forecasting 0aHydropower scheduling 0aTime-series 0aCausal model 0aMultivariate decomposition 0aMachine learning 0aInformation theory1 aCheng, Xiaomei1 aGazzea, Michele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0759-48871 aWierling, August Hubert1 aRajasekharan, Jayaprakash1 aHelseth, Arild1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4877-442X1 aFarahmand, Hossein1 aArghandeh, Reza0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Oct., v. 613 p.128265-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.1282653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245014600164300002000310500001900330520130800349592002801657650002301685650002201708650001501730650002401745650002201769650001601791650001901807650001901826650002201845700002301867700002501890700002001915700002301935700002101958700002801979773012402007856007402131852000902205655001202214IND60739089720221117230305.0210526e20210524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073908972DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra02475b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Brahim, Khaoula10aOrganic–inorganic interactions revealed by Raman spectroscopy during reversible phase transitions in semiconducting [(C₂H₅)₄N]FeCl₄  ap. 18651-18660.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe alkylammonium halogenoferrate families are subjected to diverse studies according to their wide field application. However, these compounds show various transitions depending on the preparation process. In this paper, the [(C₂H₅)₄N]FeCl₄ compound was successfully synthesized using a slow evaporation solution growth method at room temperature. An optical absorption measurement confirms the semiconductor nature with a band gap around 2.95 eV. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data confirmed the formation of a single-phase with hexagonal-type structure. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that the [(C₂H₅)₄N]FeCl₄ compound undergoes eight reversible phase transitions between 193 and 443 K. At high temperature (T > 423 K) the plastic nature of the crystals was confirmed. Temperature-controlled X-ray diffraction reveals that the thermal expansion of the crystal structure is non homothetic in the (a,b) plane and along the c axis. The temperature dependence of the Raman spectra up to 443 K revealed specific reorientations and molecular displacements of the organic and inorganic components associated with the phase transitions. We aim to thermally stabilize the [(C₂H₅)₄N]FeCl₄ compound which has a band gap suitable for photocatalytic processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aambient temperature 3acrystal structure 3aevaporation 3aphotocatalysis 3asemiconductors 3athermal expansion1 aBen gzaiel, Malika1 aOueslati, Abderrazek1 aKhirouni, Kamel1 aGargouri, Mohamed.1 aCorbel, Gwenaël1 aBardeau, Jean-François0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 24, v. 11, no. 30 p.18651-18660dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra02475b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01047naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245006700181300001600248520028500264592002800549650001400577650001600591651001400607773010800621856005500729852000900784655001200793IND50064452920221119112445.0130330e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006445292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1756-1051.2012.01630.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl‐Shehbaz, Ihsan A.10aCardamine guatemalensis sp. nov.

In the present study a computational model of plant tissue that incorporates micro-scale geometrical features was developed to provide qualitative and quantitative predictions of the mechanical properties of onion (Allium cepa) epidermis. The simulations of cellular structure behaviour under various mechanical load conditions were carried out using the finite element method (FEM). The models were validated against experimental data from a tensile test of the real tissue strips. The models showed capabilities of simulating large strains (up to 25%) with nonlinear behaviour and produced force-strain curves that closely matched the experimental data. Also, a new insight into the relationship between microstructure and mechanical behaviour was provided for this type of material. The incorporation of the real microstructure resulted in a qualitative improvement of the mechanical characteristics obtained from FEM models of plant tissues. The ability to directly simulate the impact of changes in turgor pressure was limited due to the semi-three dimensional representation of tissue. The general behaviour of tissue resulting from the changes in turgor was approximated using the semi-solid protoplast that replaced the cells liquid. On the basis of a sensitivity analysis it was concluded that the validity of the results provided by the model is largely dependent on accurate measurements of cell wall thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3acell walls 3amathematical models 3amechanical loads 3amechanical properties 3aonions 3aplant tissues 0aFinite element method 0aModelling 0aOnion (Allium cepa) epidermis 0aTissue deformation1 aZdunek, Artur0 tJournal of food engineering.g2014 Feb., v. 123 p.50-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014000183300001600323520105600339592002801395650001401423650002301437650001501460650001901475650000901494650001401503650001201517650002701529650001901556650001601575650002601591650001401617650002401631650001201655650002801667650003701695650003501732650001101767650002801778650003201806650000901838650002201847650003001869650003601899650003701935650006001972650002702032650001902059700001302078700001402091700001602105773012902121856008102250852000902331655001202340IND4411327020221119112324.0151023e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441132702DNAL7 a183227232pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-008-9149-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Lingling10aEcotoxicological Effects of Buprofezin on Fecundity, Growth, Development, and Predation of the Wolf Spider Pirata piratoides (Schenkel)  ap. 652-658.  aThe toxicological effects of buprofezin, an insect growth regulator, on the fecundity, development, and pest control potential of the wolf spider Pirata piratoides (Schenkel) (Araneae: Lycosidae) were investigated in the laboratory. It was shown that buprofezin had low toxicity to P. piratoides and that the median lethal dosage (LD₅₀) 48 h and 10% lethal dosage (LD₁₀) after topical application for female spiders were 653 and 316 mg buprofezin/mg fresh weight of spider, respectively. Buprofezin significantly reduced the percent hatching of spiders’ eggs but had only a slight effect on egg production. No negative effects on the development and growth were observed. However, spider predation rates were strongly affected: Insecticide-treated females predated on fewer prey than the controls, and their predation rate did not recover even 5 days after insecticide application. This indicated that their pest control potential might be influenced by buprofezin, and the use of buprofezin in biological control of insects is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycosidae 3abiological control 3abuprofezin 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3agrowth and development 3ainsect control 3alethal dose 3apesticide application 3apredation 3atopical application 2aAnimals 2aBody Sizexdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFeeding Behaviorxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aFertilityxdrug effects 2aJuvenile Hormonesxtoxicity 2aMale 2aMaternal Exposure 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aOvumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPredatory Behaviorxdrug effects 2aSpidersxanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aThiadiazinesxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests1 aXu, Muqi1 aCao, Hong1 aDai, Jiayin0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 Nov., v. 55, no. 4 p.652-658dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-008-9149-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245017900154300001400333500002000347520145900367592002801826650002501854650001201879650002301891650002701914650002101941650001001962650001401972650001101986650001601997650001602013650001102029650001302040650001202053650001002065650001002075650001202085650001202097650001102109650001602120650000902136650001002145650001202155700001702167700001602184773011902200856007302319852000902392655001202401IND60587791820221119214751.0180102e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058779182DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.123602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoller, F.10aReplacement of fish oil with alternative lipid sources in plant‐based practical feed formulations for marine shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) reared in outdoor ponds and tanks  ap. 63-75.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of partial substitution of menhaden fish oil by alternative lipid sources (soybean oil, poultry grease and flaxseed oil) in non‐marine protein‐based shrimp production diet, its influence on fatty acid profile and its final product flavour. Results for the pond study (17 weeks) showed no differences (P ≥ 0.05) in shrimp production among different test diets. Production ranged from 5070 to 5363 kg ha⁻¹; mean final weight, 18.0 to 21.6 g; weekly growth, 1.04 to 1.25 g; survival, 65.6 to 75.4%; and FCR, 1.37 to 1.45. Results from the tank trial (12 weeks) confirmed these findings, final weight, 13.8–14.8 g; weekly growth, 1.1–1.2 g; survival, 92.5–98.3%; FCR, 1.05–1.11; and final standing crop, 4738–5024 kg ha⁻¹. The fatty acids profiles of edible tail muscle reared on the various diets displayed a similar fatty acid profile to that of the diets. The sensory test showed no statistical differences in texture, appearance, aroma and flavour between the shrimp fed diets containing menhaden fish oil and soybean oil. These studies demonstrated that practical shrimp feeds containing non‐marine protein ingredients and a percentage of fish oil replaced by alternative lipid sources had no negative impact on mean final weight, weekly growth, survival, FCR, final standing crop, fatty acids profile and organoleptic properties of Litopenaeus vannamei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3abiomass 3aexperimental diets 3afatty acid composition 3afeed formulation 3afeeds 3afish oils 3aflavor 3aingredients 3alinseed oil 3alipids 3amenhaden 3amuscles 3aodors 3aponds 3apoultry 3arearing 3ashrimp 3asoybean oil 3atail 3atanks 3atexture1 aRhodes, M.A.1 aDavis, D.A.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2017 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.63-75dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.123603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009400164300001600258520213300274592002802407650001202435650003002447650001202477650001102489650002002500650002602520650001402546650003102560650001002591650002402601650002102625650001402646650001502660650001102675650001502686650001602701650001502717650002002732700001702752700002602769773011202795856004802907852000902955655001202964IND4513859320221118155315.0150901e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451385932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-011-0671-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng Zhiqiang,10aModeling nitrate-nitrogen removal process in first-flush reactor for stormwater treatment  ap. 865-874.  aStormwater runoff is one of the most common non-point sources of water pollution to rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal beaches. While most pollutants and nutrients, including nitrate-nitrogen, in stormwater are discharged into receiving waters during the first-flush period, no existing best management practices (BMPs) are specifically designed to capture and treat the first-flush portion of urban stormwater runoff. This paper presents a novel BMP device for highway and urban stormwater treatment with emphasis on numerical modeling of the new BMP, called first-flush reactor (FFR). A new model, called VART-DN model, for simulation of denitrification process in the designed first-flush reactor was developed using the variable residence time (VART) model. The VART-DN model is capable of simulating various processes and mechanisms responsible for denitrification in the FFR. Based on sensitivity analysis results of model parameters, the denitrification process is sensitive to the temperature correction factor (b), maximum nitrate-nitrogen decay rate (K max), actual varying residence time (T v), the constant decay rate of denitrifiying bacteria (v dec), temperature (T), biomass inhibition constant (K b), maximum growth rate of denitrifiying bacteria (v max), denitrifying bacteria concentration (X), longitudinal dispersion coefficient (K s), and half-saturation constant of dissolved carbon for biomass (K Car-X); a 10% increase in the model parameter values causes a change in model root mean square error (RMSE) of â28.02, â16.16, â12.35, 11.44, â9.68, 10.61, â16.30, â9.27, 6.58 and 3.89%, respectively. The VART-DN model was tested using the data from laboratory experiments conducted using highway stormwater and secondary wastewater. Model results for the denitrification process of highway stormwater showed a good agreement with observed data and the simulation error was less than 9.0%. The RMSE and the coefficient of determination for simulating denitrification process of wastewater were 0.5167 and 0.6912, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the VART-DN model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3abest management practices 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aestuaries 3alaboratory experimentation 3alakes 3amathematical models 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrients 3apollutants 3arivers 3astormwater 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater pollution1 aSun, Shaowei1 aGang, Daniel Dianchen0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2012 Aug., v. 35, no. 6 p.865-874dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-011-0671-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010200167300001400269520203800283592002802321650002502349650004502374650001602419650002502435650001302460650001802473650001502491650001602506650002402522650001102546650001302557651001102570773011402581856005502695852000902750655001202759IND4465367520221120120015.0120727e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446536752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01872.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaxton, T.10aDepth selectivity and spatial distribution of juvenile lake sturgeon in a large, fragmented river  ap. 45-52.  aLake sturgeon are considered imperilled across much of their range where rehabilitation efforts have been employed to enhance recovery. Habitat requirements are not known for all life stages of lake sturgeon, especially the juvenile stage. Juvenile lake sturgeon can be important in assessing effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts and therefore life history requirements for this stage is important. The objectives of this study were to determine if juvenile lake sturgeon within the Ottawa River, Canada has a depth preference; if so, to determine if depth selectivity was a function of body length; and finally, to determine if spatial structuring exists for juvenile lake sturgeon within reach type (i.e. impounded vs unimpounded reaches). A depth stratified, index netting program selective to juvenile lake sturgeon was conducted in the Ottawa River, Canada from 2008â2010. Overall, a total of 192 juvenile lake sturgeon were sampled. A Bayesian approach was used to analyze the data including logistic regression, Poisson regression and generalized linear model. The probability of capturing a juvenile lake sturgeon in a net and their relative abundance was greatest as the 12â20âm depth stratum and lowest at 35â50âm depth stratum in both impounded and unimpounded river reaches. Lake sturgeon mean total length was smallest at shallowest depth stratum (1â3âm) and greatest in the deepest depth stratum (50â75âm). For spatial segregation, mean total length of lake sturgeon was significantly smaller in the lower reach of the three contiguous, unimpounded reaches whereas the trend was opposite in impounded reaches where the smallest lake sturgeon were sampled in the upper third of the river reach. This study therefore identified areas where the probability of capturing a juvenile lake sturgeon is the greatest and where to best expend efforts through a stratified random sample study design when conducting effectiveness monitoring of any restoration or management actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aNutrition Education and Training program 3abody length 3adevelopmental stages 3ahabitats 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3asampling 3aCanada0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2011 Nov., v. 27 Suppl s2 p.45-52dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01872.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04555naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011600185300001600301520235500317592002802672650002002700650001502720650001502735650003002750650000902780650001202789650002002801650001202821650002202833650003002855650002502885650002602910650001602936650000902952650001702961650001202978650001902990650002003009650001603029650001703045650001203062650004603074650004403120650004303164650000903207650003003216650003503246650002203281650003503303650003903338650002603377650003403403650004303437650003003480650004603510700001903556700001803575700002103593700002303614700001903637700002003656773010003676856004803776852000903824655001203833IND4484461420221117212437.0120602e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448446142DNAL7 a225385192pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-012-1405-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurness, John B.10aIdentification of neurons that express ghrelin receptors in autonomic pathways originating from the spinal cord  ap. 397-405.  aFunctional studies have shown that subsets of autonomic preganglionic neurons respond to ghrelin and ghrelin mimetics and in situ hybridisation has revealed receptor gene expression in the cell bodies of some preganglionic neurons. Our present goal has been to determine which preganglionic neurons express ghrelin receptors by using mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the promoter for the ghrelin receptor (also called growth hormone secretagogue receptor). The retrograde tracer Fast Blue was injected into target organs of reporter mice under anaesthesia to identify specific functional subsets of postganglionic sympathetic neurons. Cryo-sections were immunohistochemically stained by using anti-EGFP and antibodies to neuronal markers. EGFP was detected in nerve terminal varicosities in all sympathetic chain, prevertebral and pelvic ganglia and in the adrenal medulla. Non-varicose fibres associated with the ganglia were also immunoreactive. No postganglionic cell bodies contained EGFP. In sympathetic chain ganglia, most neurons were surrounded by EGFP-positive terminals. In the stellate ganglion, neurons with choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity, some being sudomotor neurons, lacked surrounding ghrelin-receptor-expressing terminals, although these terminals were found around other neurons. In the superior cervical ganglion, the ghrelin receptor terminals innervated subgroups of neurons including neuropeptide Y (NPY)-immunoreactive neurons that projected to the anterior chamber of the eye. However, large NPY-negative neurons projecting to the acini of the submaxillary gland were not innervated by EGFP-positive varicosities. In the celiaco-superior mesenteric ganglion, almost all neurons were surrounded by positive terminals but the VIP-immunoreactive terminals of intestinofugal neurons were EGFP-negative. The pelvic ganglia contained groups of neurons without ghrelin receptor terminal innervation and other groups with positive terminals around them. Ghrelin receptors are therefore expressed by subgroups of preganglionic neurons, including those of vasoconstrictor pathways and of pathways controlling gut function, but are absent from some other neurons, including those innervating sweat glands and the secretomotor neurons that supply the submaxillary salivary glands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal medulla 3aanesthesia 3aantibodies 3acholine acetyltransferase 3aeyes 3aganglia 3agene expression 3aghrelin 3aghrelin receptors 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain situ hybridization 3ainnervation 3amice 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3aneuropeptide Y 3asalivary glands 3aspinal cord 3asweat glands 2aAnimals 2aAutonomic Pathwaysxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aCholine O-Acetyltransferasexmetabolism 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMice 2aNerve Endingsxmetabolism 2aNeuronsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aProtein Transport 2aReceptors, Ghrelinxmetabolism 2aSpinal Cordxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aStaining and Labeling 2aStellate Ganglionxmetabolism 2aSuperior Cervical Ganglionxmetabolism 2aSynaptophysinxmetabolism 2aVasoactive Intestinal Peptidexmetabolism1 aCho, Hyun-Jung1 aHunne, Billie1 aHirayama, Haruko1 aCallaghan, Brid P.1 aLomax, Alan E.1 aBrock, James A.0 tCell and tissue research.g2012 June, v. 348, no. 3 p.397-405dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1405-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006900156520117300225592002801398650001901426650002001445650003401465650001901499650002201518650002401540650002201564650001201586650001901598650001401617650002101631650001101652650002301663650001501686650001101701651001001712700001701722700001701739700001701756700002001773700002201793700001701815773012201832856007401954852000902028655001202037IND60754212420221120131056.0211023e20210926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421242DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Qiuchi 10aMajor Forest Changes in Subtropical China since the Last Ice Age  aIn the subtropical zone of southern China, there was a considerable conversion of forests from deciduous to evergreen broadleaf in the early Holocene. However, the exact timing of this vegetation change and its relationship to climate are still unclear. We examined a high-resolution pollen record collected in the mid-subtropical zone and then performed a correlation with regional data to reconstruct the history of forest ecosystems since the last deglaciation. Our data show that the expansion of the evergreen plant component already occurred at low elevations during the last deglaciation. The subtropical mountain landscape was not recolonized by evergreen forests until the mid-Holocene at about 8.1 ka BP. Based on fossil pollen reconstruction and climate model simulation, we conclude that the primary increase in evergreen components of subtropical ecosystems was triggered by postglacial temperature increase, and that a complete conversion from deciduous to evergreen forest ecosystems did not occur until Holocene winter temperatures and seasonal temperature contrast reached a threshold suitable for the growth and persistence of evergreen tree species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aair temperature 3abroadleaved evergreen forests 3aclimate models 3adeciduous forests 3aforensic palynology 3aforest ecosystems 3afossils 3aglobal warming 3amountains 3apaleoclimatology 3apollen 3aseasonal variation 3asubtropics 3awinter 3aChina1 aZhang, Xiao 1 aZhang, Yaze 1 aYue, Yuanfu 1 aHuang, Kangyou 1 aCheddadi, Rachid 1 aZheng, Zhuo 0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100005300181245006000234300001800294506007600312520087200388592002801260506003701288650001201325650002101337650001001358700002301368700002601391773013501417856007401552852000901626655001201635IND60619238920221207113042.0181031e20181029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061923892DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cs00391b2doi7 aPMC69053802pmcid7 a303351062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckerBoth authors contributed equally., Marc R.10aBeyond olefins: new metathesis directions for synthesis  ap. 7867-7881.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe olefin–olefin metathesis reaction has emerged as one of the most important carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions, as illustrated by its wide use in the synthesis of complex molecules, natural products and pharmaceuticals. The corresponding metathesis reaction between carbonyls and olefins or alkynes similarly allows for the formation of carbon–carbon bonds. Although these variants are far less developed and utilized in organic synthesis, they possess attractive qualities that have prompted chemists to incorporate and explore these modes of reactivity in complex molecule synthesis. This review highlights selected examples of carbonyl–olefin and carbonyl–alkyne metathesis reactions in organic synthesis, in particular in the total synthesis of natural products and complex molecules, and provides an overview of current advantages and limitations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalkynes 3achemical bonding 3adrugs1 aWatson, Rebecca B.1 aSchindler, Corinna S.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 47, no. 21 p.7867-7881dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cs00391b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245001800168300001600186500001900202520105700221592002801278650001201306650001301318650001201331653000801343653001801351653003901369653001201408773011101420856008101531852000901612655001201621IND60688664820221122175108.0200416e20070801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068866482DNAL7 a10.1080/096145207014696582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandhoke, Neera10aCivil society  ap. 607-614.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe idea of civil society has proved very elusive, escaping conceptual grasps and evading sure-footed negotiation of the concept itself. Resurrected in a very definite historical setting, that of authoritarian states, the concept of civil society came to signify a set of social and political practices that sought to engage with state power. The close connection with the re-emergence of the concept and the collapse of dictatorial states made civil society attractive to a variety of political agents pursuing different agendas: expanding the market at the expense of the state, transiting from mass politics to single-issue and localised campaigns, undermining confidence in accepted modes of representation such as political parties, and in general shrinking the domain of the state and that of accepted modes of politics. That the concept of civil society could suit such a variety of different political projects is cause for some alarm, for it might well mean that civil society has come to mean everything to everyone remotely interested in it.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarkets 3apolitics 3asociety 0aAid 0aCivil Society 0aCentral and Eastern Europe and CIS 0aSE Asia0 tDevelopment in practice.g2007 Aug. 1, v. 17, no. 4-5 p.607-614dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145207014696583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01083naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245004600183300001400229520033400243592002800577650001400605650001400619773011700633856008200750852000900832655001200841IND60620112720221118005751.0181105e196201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062011272DNAL7 a10.1177/0002764262005005062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKemp, Clarence Gratton,d1905-10aCritical Thinking:bOpen and Closed Minds  ap. 10-15.  aA significant turning in the path of research into the popular "authoritarian character" theme is reported.

This research focuses on the surface water content retrieval using active microwave data. Two semi-empirical models were chosen as these showed the best performances in simulating cross and co-polarized backscatter. Thus, these models were coupled to obtain reliable assessments of both soil water content and soil roughness. The use of the coupled model enables one to avoid using roughness measured in situ . Remote sensing images and in situ data were collected between April and July 2006 within the European Space Agency-funded project AgriSAR 2006. The images data set includes L-band in HH, VV and VH polarizations acquired from the airborne E-SAR sensor, operated by the German Aerospace Centre. Results were validated using in situ soil water content and roughness measurements. The results show that reliable assessment of both soil roughness (r ² up to ˜0.8) and soil water content (r ² ˜ 0.9) can be retrieved in fields characterized by low fractional coverage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3afarms 3airrigation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aroughness 3asoil water content 3asurface roughness 3asurface water 3awater content 0abackscattering 0asoil water content 0asurface roughness 0avegetation indices1 aMaltese, A.1 aCiraolo, G.1 aLa Loggia, G.1 aD’Urso, G.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 58, no. 8 p.1677-1689dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2013.7975783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001800169245013800187300001400325520159200339592002801931653002401959653001801983653000902001653001802010653001402028653002502042700001902067773013602086856011702222852000902339655001202348IND60126919620221120190353.0151108e200101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012691962DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2001)094[0033:EOAMAH]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBishop, D. B.10aEffect of Allegheny Mound Ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Presence on Homopteran and Predator Populations in Michigan Jack Pine Forests  ap. 33-40.  aThe impact of different densities of Allegheny mound ant, Formica exsectoides Forel, populations on myrmecophilous (tended) and nonmyrmecophilous (untended) aphid and scale species and their potential predators was examined in jack pine forests of north-central Michigan. A summer-long survey indicated that areas with large populations of F. exsectoides had larger populations of the aphid Cinara banksiana Pepper & Tissot and the soft scale Toumeyella parvicornis (Cockerell), two obligate myrmecophiles, than areas with low or no F. exsectoides populations. Cinara ontarioensis Bradley was also obligately tended by ants but did not show a significant response to F. exsectoides densities, having a patchy distribution. In contrast, in areas without F. exsectoides, these homopterans were replaced by the woolly aphid Schizolachnus piniradiatae (Davidson), a species that never forms ant associations. Mound ant exclusion experiments and observations indicated that F. exsectoides preyed upon S. piniradiatae, potentially reducing their numbers in areas with this ant. Aphid and scale predators showed a mixed response to F. exsectoides presence: densities of lacewing larvae and salticid spiders were inversely related to F. exsectoides populations, whereas mirid populations did not show a response to different F. exsectoides densities. This study suggests that the presence of large populations of aggressive, honeydew seeking F. exsectoides can shift the homopteran community from one composed predominantly of nonmyrmecophilous species to one composed of myrmecophilous species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aFormica exsectoides 0aCinara aphids 0aants 0ascale insects 0amutualism 0ahomopteran community1 aBristow, C.

Synthetic efficiency is best represented by the number of steps it takes to finish the target molecule from readily available starting materials, as by reducing the number of steps, all other factors of synthetic efficiency are influenced positively. By comparing several total syntheses from the recent years, the most successful strategies for step efficient syntheses will be highlighted. Each synthesis will be presented using a color-coded synthetic flowchart, in which each step is categorized by a colored box. Five categories of transformations are defined and rated according to their synthetic value. Each class will be signified by different colors so that the reader can quickly see which parts of the synthesis are productive and those that are not.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3asynthesis1 aChristmann, Mathias0 tChemical Society reviews.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 47, no. 21 p.7985-7995dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cs00399h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01364naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245006400210300001300274506007600287520030100363592002800664506003700692650001300729650001100742650002200753700001700775700001400792700002300806773010700829856008100936852000901017655001201026IND60119419620221207072043.0141214e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011941962DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-11-2342doi7 aPMC33345922pmcid7 a221047252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColonna, Vincenza12aA world in a grain of sand: human history from genetic data  ap. 2684.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome-wide genotypes and sequences are enriching our understanding of the past 50,000 years of human history and providing insights into earlier periods largely inaccessible to mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosomal studies.

But it was found that 10–15% patients are reluctant towards Snehapana hence may deprive the benefits of Shodhana. These inconveniences made us think about effective alternative to counter drawbacks of Snehapana. On the basis of literature review and pilot study, it was confirmed that, Anuvasana Basti can be administered as an alternative for Snehapana.To evaluate samyak snigdha lakshana achieved by administration of Anuvasana Basti and to evaluate outcomes of Vamana and Virechana.Specially designed basti pouches were used according to doses. In group A, constant dose of processed sesame oil (120 ml) and rock salt (500 mg) was used. In group B, the dose was escalating started with 120 ml and 500 mg with 25 ml and 100 mg increase in sesame oil and rock salt respectively for maximum seven days.Patients from group B showed better results than group A i.e. 29 patients showed symptoms of proper oleation. Mridu koshtha required minimum dose and duration for getting proper symptoms of oleation. Outcome of Vamana and Virechana were also very promising.Hence it can be concluded that Anuvasana Basti in escalating dose can be used as an alternative for Snehapana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3acomparative study 3asesame oil 3atherapeutics 0aAnuvasana Basti 0aSnehapana 0aVamana 0aVirechana1 aVedpathak, Surendra M.0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2017 July,  Sept., v. 8, no. 3 p.194-199dElsevier B.V.aTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda FoundationwJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2016.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03982naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100006500187245009200252300001600344506002800360506003600388506007600424506003100500520178100531592002802312596007102340596006502411596004502476596006502521506003702586650002202623650002802645650001602673650001202689650001302701650001302714650001302727650001302740650001102753650001802764650001002782650001102792651002102803651001902824651002902843653001802872653001602890653001302906653001702919653002002936700002202956700002702978700002003005700002203025700001903047773012503066856008303191903002403274961001303298852000903311655001203320IND60610149720221207064745.0190705e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061014972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.0042chorus7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanrahan, Brittany R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5599-433810aWinter cover crops reduce nitrate loss in an agricultural watershed in the central U.S.  ap. 513-523.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAgricultural land use in the Midwestern U.S. is the major source of nitrogen (N) causing recurring hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Despite efforts to reduce losses, N export from tile-drained, agricultural watersheds throughout the Corn Belt persists. The use of effective agricultural conservation practices can reduce N loss from fields, yet little is known about how field-scale implementation will translate into watershed-scale reductions in N export. In this study, we used a sampling approach with high spatial and temporal resolution to quantify changes in tile drain load and watershed export of nitrate (NO3−-N) after planting cover crops on >60% of croppable acres in a small, agricultural watershed. We found that median NO3−-N losses from tiles draining fields with cover crops were 69–90% lower than tiles draining fields without cover crops during winter/spring. Measured instantaneous flow was the major driver of NO3−-N losses from tile drains, though results suggest that this relationship differed between tiles with and without cover crops in spring. The signature of cover crops at the field-scale was evident in watershed NO3−-N export, particularly during times of elevated flows; median daily NO3−-N exported in elevated flows was 18–22% lower during years with watershed-scale planting of cover crops compared to years without. Nevertheless, changes in watershed NO3−-N export were smaller than the observed reductions in tile drain loads. Results indicate that tile drain reductions directly reflected the influence of cover crops at the field-scale while watershed export integrated both past and present management, ultimately complicating attempts to distinguish the effect of conservation efforts at larger spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data  cIndiana Corn Marketing Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015628  cIndiana Soybean Alliancedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100016702  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cWalton Family Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000105360 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural watersheds 3acover crops 3ahypoxia 3aland use 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aplanting 3aspring 3atile drainage 3atiles 3awinter 3aCorn Belt region 3aGulf of Mexico 3aMidwestern United States 0aWater quality 0aAgriculture 0aLand use 0aConservation 0aWatershed-scale1 aTank, Jennifer L.1 aChristopher, Sheila F.1 aMahl, Ursula H.1 aTrentman, Matt T.1 aRoyer, Todd V.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 265 p.513-523dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01531naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005000165300001600215520073100231592002800962653001800990653000801008653001201016653003601028773011101064856008101175852000901256655001201265IND60688665120221122175041.0200416e20070801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068866512DNAL7 a10.1080/096145207014698072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEade, Deborah10aCapacity building: who builds whose capacity?  ap. 630-639.  aThis article focuses on the role that development NGOs play in capacity building, arguing that many conventional NGO practices are ultimately about retaining power, rather than empowering their partners. This leads to tunnel vision and to upward rather than downward or horizontal accountability, based on the assumption that the transfer of resources is a one-way process. At worst, this undermines rather than strengthens the capacities of the organisations that NGOs are attempting to assist. Sharing responsibilities and risks, mutual accountability, and committing to the long term rather than to short-term projects are more likely to create partnerships that can withstand vicissitudes and contribute to lasting change.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCivil Society 0aAid 0aMethods 0aLatin America and the Caribbean0 tDevelopment in practice.g2007 Aug. 1, v. 17, no. 4-5 p.630-639dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145207014698073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007000163300002000233520153200253592002801785650001201813650001301825650001701838650002101855650001601876650001301892650000901905650001101914650001101925650002101936650001601957650001301973650001101986650002201997650001602019650001202035700002402047773013702071856007502208852000902283655001202292IND60536924020221118135935.0160807e20120919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053692402DNAL7 a10.1021/ie300921d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYong, Tau Len-Kelly10aReaction Kinetics of the Lignin Conversion in Supercritical Water  ap. 11975-11988.  aThe effect of temperature (390–450 °C) and residence time (0.5–10 s) at a pressure of 25 MPa was investigated for lignin conversion in supercritical water (SCW) using a continuous flow apparatus designed to rapidly heat the system to the desired reaction temperature. Conversion of lignin in SCW occurs rapidly, and complete depolymerization can be achieved within a 5 s residence time. A high degree of depolymerization is achieved from rapid heating to supercritical temperatures. In addition, supercritical conditions result in a high yield of solid that does not significantly change with an increase in temperature or residence time. To test the suggested hypothesis that the formation of low molecular weight fragments and cross-linking of these fragments forms higher molecular weight fragments, the yield of char, gaseous products, phenolic compounds (phenol, guaiacol, catechol, o-cresol, m-cresol, and catechol) and aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, and naphthalene) were determined. The formation of phenolic compounds at short residence time indicates that ether bonds in lignin are easily degraded under supercritical conditions. A reaction network model was proposed, and the subsequent kinetic parameters for the conversion pathways were determined by assuming a first-order reaction. It is observed that the rate constant of overall lignin conversion obeys Arrhenius behavior. The individual rate constants of each reaction in the network are evaluated to determine conformity to Arrhenius behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3acatechol 3acrosslinking 3adepolymerization 3aengineering 3aguaiacol 3aheat 3alignin 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3anaphthalene 3ao-cresol 3aphenol 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 3atoluene1 aMatsumura, Yukihiko0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Sept. 19, v. 51, no. 37 p.11975-11988dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie300921d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01286naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245005900207300001300266506007600279520020500355592002800560506003700588650001400625650001600639650001000655650001300665650001200678650002900690700002000719773010700739856008100846852000900927655001200936IND60119419820221207071641.0141214e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011941982DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-11-1332doi7 aPMC33345892pmcid7 a221264642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoigt, Philipp10aBRD4 jump-starts transcription after mitotic silencing  ap. 2690.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe chromatin adapter BRD4 may be crucial for transmitting epigenetic information by acting as a histone acetylation-dependent gene bookmark and accelerating post-mitotic transcriptional reactivation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3ahistones 3amitosis 3atranscription (genetics)1 aReinberg, Danny0 tGenome biology.g2011 Nov., v. 12, no. 11 p.2690-2690dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-11-1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011100167300001600278520075800294592002801052650001901080650002101099650001301120650001701133650001001150650001601160650001401176650001601190651001201206700001801218700001701236700001901253773012401272856008101396852000901477655001201486IND60647018620221118123707.0190614e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064701862DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136190300682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalinina, E.

Core samples were taken from April to September in 2012. The results have shown that the onset and duration of different phases of tree ring formation in larch and pine are determined by the geographic location of the sites and the related temperature gradient. It should be noted that species-specific features of tree growth have an effect on the formation of xylem cells during the growing period and, as a consequence, on the dimensional anatomical parameters of tracheids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix sibirica 3aPinus sylvestris 3aaltitude 3agrowth rings 3ataiga 3atemperature 3atracheids 3atree growth 3aSiberia1 aKnorre, A.

Here, we employed the spatial variations in the WUE and the quantitative contributions of the influencing factors, including the precipitation (P), temperature (Temp), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), sunshine duration (SD), and leaf area index (LAI), with the drought index varying over the last two decades. Results showed that the multiyear average WUE decreased significantly as the drought index increased for all of the vegetation types. Per-pixel interannual variability of WUE trend was 0.024 gC·m⁻²·mm⁻¹·year⁻¹. As the drought index increased, the WUE initially increased and then decreased for the forests, grassland, and shrubland, and their peaks occurred at drought index values of 2.60–3.10. Among the influencing factors, the WUE was predominantly controlled by the LAI, with an impact and relative contribution of 0.014 gC·m⁻²·mm⁻¹·year⁻¹ and 58.3%, respectively. The P and SD contributed the least to the trend in WUE, and impact and relative contribution of both were 0.001 gC·m⁻²·mm⁻¹·year⁻¹ and 4.17%. Our study also demonstrated that the LAI was the dominant factor affecting the WUE trends for grassland and the Yan River due to the structural parameters and geographical location. In addition, the impact and relative contribution of the residual factors on the WUE trend were 0.004 gC·m⁻²·mm⁻¹·year⁻¹ and 16.7%. Our findings suggested that comprehensive effects such as micro-geomorphic changes and nitrogen deposition could not be ignored except for vegetation and climate change. This study will clarify the spatial and temporal evolution of WUE and its influence mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3aleaf area index 3anitrogen 3arivers 3ashrublands 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3avapor pressure deficit 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aWang, Zhihui 1 aWei, Fengyuan 1 aXiao, Peiqing 1 aShen, Zhenzhou 1 aLv, Xizhi 1 aShi, Yonglei 0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121114423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245013500164520239200299592002802691650001102719650001802730650002602748650001702774650001402791650000902805650002702814650002202841650002402863650001002887650001202897650001002909650001302919650000902932650001902941650002802960773012202988856007403110852000903184655001203193IND60754212820221120131311.0211023e20210926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421282DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorneeva, Evgenia A.10aEconomic Evaluation of Ecological Restoration of Degraded Lands through Protective Afforestation in the South of the Russian Plain  aThe latest international climate documents emphasize the great importance of protective forest stands in ensuring the sustainable development of agriculture, and the main requirement is the use of the forest-forming factor by landowners in the interests of improving the environment. In Russia, until recently, the ecological significance of forest plantations was underestimated, which created the ground for discussions about their effectiveness. In this regard, a new approach is proposed that emphasizes the positive impact of forests, including sustainable development, environmental security of the agricultural sector and reducing the degradation of agricultural land. The purpose of the work was an economic assessment and regularities of the dynamics of humus-regulating and nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK)-regulating efficiency of protective forest plantations on lands with deflation-hazardous soils. By means of a system analysis, the change in the soil cover of land use due to the influence of forest plantations on the balance of soil fertility elements in forested cells is comprehensively analyzed. The different spatial placement of trees from each other under different degrees of deflation in semiarid conditions is modeled. These models are used to determine the nature of the dynamics of soil nutrients in forested areas: in protection zones and outside protection. It is established that the anti-deflationary effect of agroforestry depends on the indicator of the protective forest cover of the land, the level of deflationary danger, and the operational life of the plantings. In semiarid conditions, it increases in proportion to the increase in the protection of land and amounts to EUR 376–EUR 4222 ha⁻¹. With an increase in the intensity of deflation to the level of dust storms, the prevented damage from the loss of soil nutrients increases almost four times. In systems of plantings from early-maturing fast-growing rocks, the anti-deflationary effect is 6–7% higher on an average annual basis than in systems of plantings from long-lasting, slow-growing rocks. The greatest efficiency of forest reclamation in ensuring a positive balance of humus and NPK substances in the soil (EUR 1002–EUR 4222 ha⁻¹) is achieved when placing plantings after 15 H. The study will confirm the need to subsidize the integration of trees into farm systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRussia 3aafforestation 3aagricultural industry 3aagroforestry 3adeflation 3adust 3aecological restoration 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic evaluation 3afarms 3aforests 3ahumus 3aland use 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asustainable development0 tForests.g2021 Sept. 26, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012200169300001800291500001900309520165500328592002801983596005302011596007902064650001602143650002502159650001502184650001402199650001502213650001702228650001402245650001602259650001402275650001702289650001302306650001102319651001202330700006302342700005902405773013102464856008202595852000902677655001202686IND60707256720221120051609.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070725672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-020-06830-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchand, Justin10aSize and survival of two freshwater snail species in relation to shedding of cercariae of castrating Echinostoma spp.  ap. 2917-2925.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTrematode-induced castration of snails is widespread and can lead to other life history changes of snails such as changes in trajectories of size and growth or survival. The changes produced likely depend on whether the parasite or host controls allocation of host resources remaining after partial or complete cessation of host current reproduction by castrating trematodes. Documenting host life history changes, like changes in host size in response to castration, is a first step in assessing whether these changes are beneficial to the parasite (increasing transmission success) or to the host (outliving the infection) or to neither. Herein, we test for differences in size and survival among individuals of two snail species in relation to infection by Echinostoma spp. trematodes. Active shedding of Echinostoma spp. was associated with castration of all Stagnicola elodes snails from a site in Eastern Ontario. Snails actively shedding cercariae were not different in size from non-shedding, egg-laying snails but had a higher mortality than egg-laying snails. Active shedding of Echinostoma spp. cercariae was also associated with castration of nearly all Helisoma trivolvis monitored, from a site in Southwestern Ontario. Actively shedding, non-laying H. trivolvis hosts were smaller on average than non-shedding egg-laying hosts, but both non-laying and egg-laying snails survived equally well. We discuss these results in light of what is known about effects of castration on snail hosts in terms of growth and survival for these and other trematode species and speculate on whether changes in size or survival benefits parasite or host.  aPublisher supplied data  aSR01-2018cEnvironment and Climate Change Canada  a100118cNatural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) 3aEchinostoma 3aPlanorbella trivolis 3acastration 3acercariae 3afreshwater 3alife history 3amortality 3aoviposition 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aresearch 3asnails 3aOntario1 aRobinson, Stacey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4522-03761 aForbes, Mark R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2288-32090 tParasitology research.g2020 Sept., v. 119, no. 9 p.2917-2925dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-06830-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245016200163300001800325520094900343592002801292650003401320650001901354650001501373650001701388650000901405650001201414650002201426650001401448650001501462700016201477700001901639700002301658700001801681700002501699773013301724856007401857852000901931655001201940IND60617488620221119021327.0181025e20180510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061748862DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01350k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Sebastian10aPhosphorus anionic redox activity revealed by operando P K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy on diphosphonate-based conversion materials in Li-ion batteries  ap. 4939-4942.  aWhen cycling diphosphonate-based organic–inorganic hybrid materials as negative battery electrodes, specific charges exceeding the maximum for a metal redox reaction are recorded. Classical explanations are electrolyte reduction and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) oxidation. Using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the P K-edge experiment, we demonstrate an additional contribution of reversible ligand co-cycling based on the P-atoms of the diphosphonate ligands, upon delithiation occurring during the first potential plateau, which matches perfectly to previous investigations using Fe K-edge XAS. We thus investigate experimentally an anionic redox process in situ. Thereby we could demonstrate a possible methodology to measure P K-edge XANES on Li-ion battery active materials under operando conditions, which could be applied to verify the predicted P co-cycling of other conversion-type negative electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3adiphosphonates 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3airon 3aligands 3alithium batteries 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus1 aSallardPresent address: Flemish Institute of Technological Research (VITO), Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium.

In most plants studied, ICDH is encoded by either one gene or a small gene family, and the protein sequence has been highly conserved during evolution, suggesting it plays different and essential roles in metabolism and differentiation. To elucidate the role of ICDH in hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x P. alba), transgenic plants overexpressing the Pinus pinaster gene were generated. Overexpression of ICDH resulted in hybrid poplar (Populus tremula × P. alba) trees with higher expression levels of the endogenous ICDH gene and higher enzyme content than control untransformed plants. Transgenic poplars also showed an increased expression of glutamine synthetase (GS1.3), glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and other genes associated with vascular differentiation. Furthermore, these plants exhibited increased growth in height, longer internodes and enhanced vascular development in young leaves and the apical region of stem. Modifications in amino acid and organic acid content were observed in young leaves of the transgenic lines, suggesting an increased biosynthesis of amino acids for building new structures and also for transport to other sink organs, as expanding leaves or young stems. Taken together, these results support an important role of ICDH in plant growth and vascular development.  aPublisher supplied data  aBIO2003-04590aAGL2009-011404aBIO2015-69285-RcSpanish  aBIO-474cJunta de Andalucía 3aPicea glauca 3aPinus pinaster 3aPopulus alba 3aPopulus tremula 3aamino acid sequences 3abiosynthesis 3aevolution 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3ahybrids 3ainternodes 3aleaves 3aplant growth 3atransgenic plants 3atree physiology 3atrees 0a2-oxoglutarate 0acytosolic NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase 0aγ-aminobutyric acid 0anitrogen metabolism 0aPopulus tremula × P. alba 0avascular development1 aMolina-Rueda, Juan Jesús1 aCánovas, Francisco M.,1 aGallardo, Fernando1 aCooke, Janice0 tTree physiology.g2018 June 15, v. 38, no. 7 p.992-1005dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl41003x1758-44697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002900156245007100185500001900256520137800275592002801653650001301681650002801694650001801722650002301740650002101763650002801784650001201812650001101824650001401835650001801849650001001867653001701877653001201894653001401906653001801920653001601938653002601954700002001980700003202000700002702032700002402059700001602083700002902099700001902128700002202147700001702169700001902186773009302205856009102298852000902389655001202398IND60707452120221117060741.0210108e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070745212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1203132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez del Río, Eduardo10aCCL21-loaded 3D hydrogels for T cell expansion and differentiation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRecent achievements in the field of immunotherapy, such as the development of engineered T cells used in adoptive cell therapy, are introducing more efficient strategies to combat cancer. Nevertheless, there are still many limitations. For example, these T cells are challenging to manufacture, manipulate, and control. Specifically, there are limitations in producing the large amounts of therapeutic T cells needed for these therapies in a short period of time and in an economically viable manner. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) hydrogels covalently combined with low molecular weight heparin are engineered to resemble the lymph nodes, where T cells reproduce. In these hydrogels, PEG provides the needed structural and mechanical properties, whereas heparin is used as an anchor for the cytokine CCL21, which is present in the lymph nodes, and can affect cell migration and proliferation. The 3D structure of the hydrogel in combination with its loading capacity result in an increased primary human CD4⁺ T cell proliferation compared to the state-of-the-art expansion systems consisting of artificial antigen presenting cells. Thus, we present a new tool for adoptive cell therapy to help achieving the large numbers of cells required for therapy of selected phenotypes targeted against cancer cells, by mimicking the lymph nodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3abiocompatible materials 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3achemical bonding 3aeconomic sustainability 3aheparin 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3aimmunotherapy 3alymph 0a3D hydrogels 0aT cells 0aCytokines 0aProliferation 0aLymph nodes 0aAdoptive cell therapy1 aSantos, Fabião1 aRodriguez Rodriguez, Xavier1 aMartínez-Miguel, Marc1 aRoca-Pinilla, Ramon1 aArís, Anna1 aGarcía-Fruitós, Elena,1 aVeciana, Jaume1 aSpatz, Joachim P.1 aRatera, Imma1 aGuasch, Judith0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Nov., v. 259 p.120313-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1203133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245006800181300001400249520101300263592002801276650002301304650000901327650001601336650001101352650000901363650001001372650001001382650001001392650001901402650001501421650001301436650001401449650002001463650002001483651000901503653001601512653002301528653002201551700001701573700001901590700001901609700001901628700002001647773011801667856008501785852000901870655001201879IND60535346720221120160754.0190401e20151130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053534672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChelladurai, Jeba Jesudoss10aToxocara vitulorum infection in a cohort of beef calves in Iowa  ap. 96-99.  aToxocara vitulorum, an ascarid that infects bovines, is largely considered a parasite of tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Infections in more temperate climates have been reported but little is known about T. vitulorum transmission in North America. Herein, we detail an investigation of an Iowa beef farm where necropsy of a 20 day old beef calf revealed a mass of large ascarid nematodes occluding the small intestine. Gross histopathological, and molecular features of nematodes recovered from the calf were consistent with T. vitulorum. Fecal samples obtained from calves in the herd revealed 14 of 34 (40%) were shedding T. vitulorum eggs. Calves continued to shed eggs following a single dose of a topical moxidectin product. These results suggest that T. vitulorum may be more widespread in the United States than previously recognized. Due to the pathogenic nature of this parasite, further investigation into the prevalence and transmission of T. vitulorum in North America is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxocara vitulorum 3abeef 3abeef cattle 3acalves 3aeggs 3afarms 3afeces 3aherds 3ahistopathology 3amoxidectin 3anecropsy 3aparasites 3asmall intestine 3atemperate zones 3aIowa 0aToxocarosis 0aBovine toxocarosis 0aBovine parasitism1 aBader, Chris1 aSnobl, Tymbrie1 aMagstadt, Drew1 aCooper, Vickie1 aBrewer, Matt T.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2015 Nov. 30, v. 214, no. 1-2 p.96-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01751naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245004600202300001600248520054800264592002800812650001100840650001200851650001200863650001200875650002000887650001000907650002000917653002100937653001200958653002600970653003100996653002801027653002201055653002001077653001801097700001801115773011901133856008001252852000901332655001201341IND60619194620221122054507.0191025e20180612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061919462DNAL7 a10.1093/treephys/tpy0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteppe, Kathy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6252-070414aThe potential of the tree water potential  ap. 937-940.  aNon-invasive quantification of tree water potential is one of the grand challenges for assessing the fate of trees and forests in the coming decades.

In this paper, AP@HNS (hexanitrostilbene) composites with core–shell structure were designed and prepared by an ultrasound-assisted method using polyurethane for the interfacial modification of ammonium perchlorate (AP). The results show that the AP@HNS composites have a complete and dense shell structure when the nano-HNS content of the shell layer is 15% or more, the synergistic decomposition effect between HNS and AP can advance the high-temperature decomposition peak of AP by 102.4 °C and increase the apparent heat release 2.55 times to 1388 J g⁻¹, and HNS improves the energy of AP while reducing environmental pollution. The safety performance test shows that the nano-HNS with 15% mass content can increase the composite characteristic drop height H₅₀ to 32 cm and reduce the frictional susceptibility explosion probability to 77% (the H₅₀ of AP is 27 cm and the frictional susceptibility explosion probability is 95%). The insensitive shell layer HNS significantly improves the safety performance of AP through barrier and buffering effects. This technology is expected to provide new ideas for designing and preparing solid propellants with high energy, low susceptibility, and excellent thermal decomposition performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium perchlorate 3aenergy 3aheat 3apollution 3apolyurethanes 3aprobability 3athermal degradation 3aultrasonic treatment1 aYe, Ping1 aGuo, Changping1 aZhu, Wenkun1 aJin, Dayong0 tRSC advances.g2022 May 19, v. 12, no. 24 p.15329-15336dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra01871c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245009900198300001800297506007600315520043800391592002800829506003700857650002700894650001600921650002300937650002300960650004900983650001301032700001701045700002101062700001201083700001201095700001201107700001701119700001801136773013301154856007401287852000901361655001201370IND60617488820221207065526.0181025e20180517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061748882DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01356j2doi7 aPMC60892382pmcid7 a297265572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaminker, R.10aTuning conformation and properties of peptidomimetic backbones through dual N/Cα-substitution  ap. 5237-5240.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe demonstrate that changing the backbone between peptides, peptoids and the underexplored dual N/Cα-substituted peptoids analogues allows for control over the preferred conformation of the intrinsically disordered biomimetic oligomers.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross‐sectional online survey. ANIMALS OR SAMPLE POPULATION: A total of 441 veterinarians with a caseload of companion animal orthopedic patients. METHODS: Respondents answered questions regarding their familiarity with and application of OROMs. Respondents provided opinions on statements related to reasons for using or not using OROMs in routine clinical practice, prerequisites to implement OROMs in routine clinical practice, and whether they would implement OROMs in routine clinical practice if adequate tools/technologies were available. RESULTS: Most (293/441, 66.4%) respondents felt familiarity with at least one OROM. Only 17.5% (77 out of the 440 answering the question about the application of OROMs) applied OROMs in routine clinical practice. The two main reasons for not using OROMs in routine clinical practice were the lack of opportunity/feasibility and the lack sufficient information/knowledge/experiences. User‐friendliness, time efficiency, and interpretability were considered the most important prerequisites for implementing OROMs in routine clinical practice. If adequate tools/technologies were available, 266/439 (60.6%) respondents indicated that they would definitely implement OROMs in routine clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Although most respondents were familiar with at least one OROM, fewer than one‐fifth applied them in routine clinical practice. Most respondents were willing to implement OROMs in routine clinical practice if adequate tools/technologies were available. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our results justify further investigations to improve the application of OROMs in routine clinical practice in veterinary care of companion animal orthopedic patients.  aPublisher supplied data  cAO Foundation 3aorthopedics 3apets 3asurgery 3asurveys1 aZhu, Tracy Y.1 aKnoll, Christian1 aAllen, Matthew J.1 aJoeris, Alexander0 tVeterinary surgery.g2022 Aug., v. 51, no. 6 p.903-913dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.138423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04285naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245015600165300001600321520171800337592002802055650002002083650002502103650001702128650001202145650001502157650002102172650001802193650001502211650001802226650002102244650001102265650001602276650001902292650001602311650002402327650001902351653003802370653003902408653004202447653004302489653005302532653005302585653005202638653003702690653003402727653004902761653001802810653000802828653000802836653000802844653001102852653000902863653000902872653000902881653000702890653000802897653000702905653000902912653000802921653000902929653000902938653000802947653001002955653001102965653000802976653002002984653001603004653002503020653001803045653002203063700001703085700001403102700001703116700001803133700001903151700002003170773011003190856008603300852000903386655001203395IND60543268720221118100933.0190410e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054326872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lu10aComparison of different methods for extracting polyphenols from Ipomoea batatas leaves, and identification of antioxidant constituents by HPLC-QTOF-MS2  ap. 101-109.  aThis study aimed to compare the extraction efficiency of dynamic high pressure microfluidization-assisted extraction (DHPMAE) and other commonly used extraction methods on the antioxidant activities (AAs) of sweet potato leaves (Ipomoea batatas L., SPL), and to identify the antioxidant compounds by HPLC-QTOF-MS2. Two highly consumed commercial varieties, orange-fleshed and cream-fleshed sweet potato leaves (OFL and CFL), were taken as materials. OFL was evidenced to be a better antioxidants resource than CFL due to higher polyphenols and AAs. DHPMAE had the best extraction efficiency on total phenolics and total flavonoids, with the values in OFL extract at 16.35mgGAE/g DM and 16.51mgRE/g DM, respectively. DHPMAE extract also exhibited the strongest DPPH· and ABTS·+ scavenging ability, chelating ability and reducing power. Multiple regression analysis revealed that polyphenols played an important contribution to the AAs of SPL extracts. After successive fractionation of DHPMAE extract by chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol, the ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest total phenolic (569.38mgGAE/g Extract) and total flavonoid (43.15mgRE/g Extract) content, as well as the highest AAs. HPLC-QTOF-MS2 analysis of the ethyl acetate fraction resulted in identifying 37 compounds including 20 phenolic acids, 12 flavonoids, 3 organic acids, 1 nucleoside and 1 ester, and 20 of them were firstly detected in SPL. Caffeoylquinic acid derivatives and flavonoids were the most abundant antioxidant compounds. The presented results suggested that DHPM might be a promising assisted technology in extracting polyphenols from plants, and SPL could be utilized for the development of functional food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIpomoea batatas 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abutanol 3achloroform 3achlorogenic acid 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3afractionation 3afunctional foods 3aleaves 3anucleosides 3aphenolic acids 3apolyphenols 3aregression analysis 3asweet potatoes 0aSuccinic acid (PubChem CID: 1110) 0aCaffeic acid (PubChem CID: 689043) 0aProtocatechuic acid (PubChem CID: 72) 0aRosmarinic acid (PubChem CID: 5281792) 0a4,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 6474309) 0a3,4-Dicaffeoylquinic acid (PubChem CID: 5459216) 0aQuercetin-3-O-glucoside (PubChem CID: 54758678) 0aRhamnetin (PubChem CID: 5281691) 0aOmbuin (PubChem CID: 5320287) 0a3,7-Dimethylquercetin (PubChem CID: 5320945) 0aHPLC-QTOF-MS2 0aSPL 0aOFL 0aCFL 0aDHPMAE 0aHMAE 0aUSAE 0aMWAE 0aLC 0aAAs 0aDM 0aMLRA 0aBPC 0aHBAs 0aHCAs 0aCQA 0adiCQA 0atriCQA 0aBHT 0aIpomoea batatas 0aPolyphenols 0aAntioxidant activity 0aHPLC-QTOF-MS2 0aMicrofluidization1 aTu, Zong-cai1 aWang, Hui1 aFu, Zhi-feng1 aWen, Qing-hui1 aChang, Hai-xia1 aHuang, Xiao-qin0 tFood research international.g2015 Apr., v. 70 p.101-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245004700197300001600244500002000260520147000280592002801750596001901778596001501797596001701812596001601829650001201845650001401857650001201871650001001883650002401893650001301917650001501930650001601945650000901961700002401970773012601994856007302120852000902193655001202202IND60624044420221120211842.0181130e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062404442DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.125632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApps, Peter J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0129-946810aHow camera traps work and how to work them  ap. 702-709.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCamera traps are very widely used to monitor the presence of animals and record their behaviour. Setting them up properly enhances their performance and data yield. The paper describes how camera traps work and gives basic advice on camera selection, setting up camera traps for various purposes, protecting them from animals, keeping them working and troubleshooting. A camera trap's capture of a still image or video is triggered by a passive infrared detector that responds when something hotter or colder than the background moves in its detection zone. Target detection is camera traps’ weak point, and they need to be set up so that animals move across their detection zone rather than towards or away from the camera. Short trigger and recovery times are preferred. After dark, camera traps illuminate the subject with infrared light that is difficult for animals to see, or white light if colour images are required. During the day, stills and video are captured in colour, and at night in monochrome under infrared, or in colour with white illumination. Where cameras need to be sited depends on study design. Camera performance is sensitive to the height and angle that they are mounted at; maximum detections come from cameras just below the target's shoulder height, aimed horizontally. To avoid large numbers of false triggers, trim vegetation in the detection zone that might be moved by the wind. Keep cameras clean and change batteries frequently.  aPublisher supplied data  cPrivate donors  cTusk Trust  cWild Entrust  cSelf funded 3aanimals 3abatteries 3acameras 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3alighting 3avegetation 3awhite light 3awind1 aMcNutt, John Weldon0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 56, no. 4 p.702-709dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.125633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245021800200300001600418500002000434520169400454592002802148650001202176650003002188650002002218650001402238650002002252650001102272650001402283650001102297650001002308700002302318700002002341773011902361856007402480852000902554655001202563IND60785876520221120064855.0220729e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078587652DNAL7 a10.1111/vsu.138012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazdarani, Parisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6022-855510aEffect of center of rotation of angulation‐based leveling osteotomy on ex vivo stifle joint stability following cranial cruciate ligament transection and medial meniscal release with and without a hamstring load  ap. 940-951.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of center of rotation of angulation (CORA)‐based leveling osteotomy (CBLO) and hamstring load on stifle stability following cranial cruciate ligament transection (CCLx) and medial meniscal release (MMR). STUDY DESIGN: Ex vivo experimental study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Cadaver hind limb preparations (n = 7). METHODS: After instrumentation, constant quadriceps and gastrocnemius loads with an optional hamstring load in a 3:1:0.6 ratio were applied, and stifles were extended from fully flexed using an electrical motor during fluoroscopic recording. The recording process was repeated after each of CCLx, MMR and CBLO and the extracted landmark coordinates were used for calculation of cranial tibial translation (CTT) and patellar ligament angle (PTA). RESULTS: Mean initial tibial plateau angle was 28.1°: post‐CBLO the mean was 9.7°. Cranial tibial translation developed from 50° and 75° with CCLx and MMR respectively (p < .04, < .02) without hamstring loading. Hamstring loading mitigated CTT due to CCLx and delayed CTT until 120° for MMR (P < .02) in this model. CBLO prevented CTT, except at 140° without hamstring loading (P = .01). Similar results were seen for PTA, but CBLO curves were parallel to and lower than intact values at all tested angles (P < .04), consistent with induced effective joint flexion. CONCLUSION: CBLO to a target tibial plateau angle of 10° largely eliminated CTT induced by CCLx and MMR. Hamstring loads of 20% quadriceps load improved stifle stability in this model. IMPACT: Stifle stability following CBLO appears to be multifactorial and depends on meniscal integrity, joint angle, and hamstring strength.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadaver 3acranial cruciate ligament 3aelectric motors 3ahindlimbs 3ainstrumentation 3amodels 3aosteotomy 3astifle 3atibia1 aPedram, Mir Sepehr1 aMiles, James E.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2022 Aug., v. 51, no. 6 p.940-951dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10192x0161-34997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vsu.138013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01404naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169500002200273520040800295592002800703653001400731653002400745653002700769653001600796700002600812700002400838700002000862700001600882700002200898773009800920856005101018852000901069655001201078IND60795341220221121055409.0221004e20220925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079534122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1541742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavi Kumar, G.10aCooperative catalytic Prins cyclization for the construction of azaspiro[5.5]undec-2-ene frameworks  aPre-press version  aHomoallylic alcohols appended with N-propargyl moiety undergo a smooth condensation with aldehydes in the presence of 5 mol% of Ph₃PAuCl/AgSbF₆/In(OTf)₃catalytic system in dichloromethane at 25 °C to afford the corresponding 1,9-dioxa-4-azaspiro[5.5]undec-2-ene scaffolds in good yields.

In the past, this has not caused concerns because the metabolic networks studied were invariably associated with living cells. Nowadays, there are needs to reconstruct metabolic networks, and so metabolic homeostasis cannot be taken for granted. For metabolic steady state, enzyme feedback control has been known to explain why metabolites in metabolic pathways can avoid accumulation. However, we reasoned that there are further contributing mechanisms. As a new methodology developed, we separated cofactor intermediates (CIs) from non-cofactor intermediates, and identified an appropriate type of open systems for operating putative reaction topologies. Furthermore, we elaborated the criteria to tell if a multi-enzyme over-all reaction path is of in vivo nature or not at the metabolic level. As new findings, we discovered that there are interactions between the enzyme feedback inhibition and the CI turnover, and such interactions may well lead to metabolic homeostasis, an emergent property of the system. To conclude, this work offers a new perspective for understanding the role of CIs and the presence of metabolic homeostasis in the living cell. In perspective, this work might provide clues for constructing non-natural metabolic networks using multi-enzyme reactions or by degenerating metabolic reaction networks from the living cell.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3ahomeostasis 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolites 3amethodology 0aMetabolic stability 0aMetabolic steady state 0aCofactor balance 0aCofactor turnover 0aEnzyme feedback control 0aEmergent property of metabolic network1 aGuan, Y.H.1 aVilladsen, J.0 tMetabolic Engineering Communications.g2016 Dec., v. 3 p.196-204dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23270x2214-03017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meteno.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245005400169520163200223592002801855650001501883650002201898650000901920650001401929650001401943650001001957653001401967653003401981653002402015653002002039653003102059653002002090700002002110700001502130773009802145856008702243852000902330655001202339IND60695414920221119022558.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Zhiqin10aReview of oil shale in-situ conversion technology  aOil shale is an important strategic resource with tremendous reserve. In-situ retorting is the only technology available to achieve large-scale industrial exploitation. This paper systematically introduces the intensive researches conducted by Zhao’s team on oil shale retorting, as well as the progress of oil shale in-situ conversion technology in the world. The oil shale deposit in sedimentary strata with hidden layering, and the kerogen in oil shale is dispersed in flat strips that ranges from a few to tens of microns in size. A large amount of micro-scale pores and fractures are formed along the bedding in oil shale during the in-situ pyrolysis process, which creates connected channels and enhances the effectiveness of thermal fluid injection and the yield of pyrolysis products. Back to 2005, Zhao’s team invented the oil shale in-situ retorting technology by injecting superheated steam, and related technical advantages are analyzed in detail.

This work examines the relationships between normalized difference indices (NDI) calculated from under‐ice radiance measurements and sea ice algal biomass and snow thickness for Antarctic fast ice. While this technique has been calibrated to assess biomass in Arctic fast ice and pack ice, as well as Antarctic pack ice, relationships are currently lacking for Antarctic fast ice characterized by bottom ice algae communities with high algal biomass. We analyze measurements along transects at two contrasting Antarctic fast ice sites in terms of platelet ice presence: near and distant from an ice shelf, i.e., in McMurdo Sound and off Davis Station, respectively. Snow and ice thickness, and ice salinity and temperature measurements support our paired in situ optical and biological measurements. Analyses show that NDI wavelength pairs near the first chlorophyll a (chl a) absorption peak (≈440 nm) explain up to 70% of the total variability in algal biomass. Eighty‐eight percent of snow thickness variability is explained using an NDI with a wavelength pair of 648 and 567 nm. Accounting for pigment packaging effects by including the ratio of chl a‐specific absorption coefficients improved the NDI‐based algal biomass estimation only slightly. Our new observation‐based algorithms can be used to estimate Antarctic fast ice algal biomass and snow thickness noninvasively, for example, by using moored sensors (time series) or mapping their spatial distributions using underwater vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data  aEP/K032208/1cAustralian Antarctic Division, Antarctica New Zealand  cAustralian Government  cAntarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre  a110282cUniversity of Otago  a112061cUniversity of Otago  aEP/K032208/1cEPSRC  cHanse‐Wissenschaftskolleg  cIsaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences 3aabsorption 3aalgae 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3ageophysics 3ahabitats 3aice shelf 3aresearch 3asalinity 3asea ice 3asnow 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3awavelengths 3aAntarctic region 3aArctic region 3aMcMurdo Sound1 aMeiners, K.

In addition, this experiment could further comprehend how the preparation and characteristics of FAC affect the formation and properties of AGS. The conclusions showed that compared with the control, FAC enhanced the sedimentation performance and significant removal efficiency. Meanwhile, the values of protein (PN) and polysaccharide (PS) also increased significantly in the addition of FAC, indicating the production of substances were induced by FAC. Molecular biology methods indicated that the rapid production of granulation and removal of nutrients were considered as the abundance of various microbes and denitrifying bacteria at the addition of FAC. This research showed that the presence of FAC is a useful strategy for the initiation of sludge particle formation to promote the treatment of wastewater, containing COD and NH₄⁺ at about 150–100 and 30 mg L⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abioreactors 3adenitrification 3amolecular biology 3apolysaccharides 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aFe-loaded activated carbon (FAC) 0aAerobic granulation 0aBioreactor 0aLow-strength wastewater 0aNutrient biodegradation1 aLi, Xinzhi1 aHou, Mingxiu1 aChen, Yuliang1 aZeng, Jie1 aYi, Xuesong0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135532-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013500172520141700307592002801724650001801752650001301770650001801783650001201801650001501813650002501828650001701853650001601870653003301886653002201919653002301941653002901964700001701993700001702010700001402027700001702041700005302058773010502111856008702216852000902303655001202312IND60684212620221121233411.0200330e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068421262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1245812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xianpeng10aMechanism of the temperature-responsive material regulating porous morphology on epoxy phenolic novolac resin microcapsule surface  aPorous microcapsules (MCs) with tailorable surface morphology are indispensable in practical applications because of their large surface area and controlled release. In this study, epoxy phenolic novolac resin MCs were prepared with temperature-responsive 2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol (DMP) as crosslinker. Reaction temperature was proved to generate distinct effects on MC porous morphology, shell thickness, mechanical strength and release behavior. The MC surface varied from nonporous to dense small pores (ca. 237 nm in diameter) with increasing temperature from 40 °C to 70 °C, but they showed decreasing tendency at higher temperature (＞70 °C). The encapsulation process illuminated that DMP aggregates formed and deposited on the loose shells at 60 °C and 70 °C (close to the so-called cloud point (Tₛcₚ) of DMP), leading to porous morphology. Nevertheless, at temperature far below or above the Tₛcₚ of DMP (＜50 °C or ＞70 °C), DMP kept its solubility in water or insufficiently deposited on the shells, which resulted in no pores existed. Higher temperature promoted the reactivity to generate thicker shells and larger mechanical strength, further leading to prolong payload release. The present work provided an insight about the reaction temperature to prepare tunable MCs, which can be employed to encapsulate lipophilic components in agriculture field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aencapsulation 3aepoxides 3alipophilicity 3aphenols 3asolubility 3astrength (mechanics) 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aSurface porous microcapsules 0aTunable pore size 0aTemperature effect 0aPore formation mechanism1 aZhang, Luxia1 aZhang, Daxia1 aLiu, Sisi1 aWei, Dengguo1 aLiu, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0271-36320 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 May 20, v. 593 p.124581-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1245813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245010200198300001800300500002000318520148500338592002801823596006601851596006301917596004101980596003002021650001502051650001102066650001302077650002402090650001402114650001602128651001802144700006602162700006102228700005702289700005902346700005902405773013102464856007702595852000902672655001202681IND60789668620221116173920.0220822e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078966862DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0136552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyston, Sam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7685-504310aSea‐Level Trend Uncertainty With Pacific Climatic Variability and Temporally‐Correlated Noise  ap. 1978-1993.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecent studies have identified climatic drivers of the east‐west see‐saw of Pacific Ocean satellite altimetry era sea level trends and a number of sea‐level trend and acceleration assessments attempt to account for this. We investigate the effect of Pacific climate variability, together with temporally‐correlated noise, on linear trend error estimates and determine new time‐of‐emergence (ToE) estimates across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Sea‐level trend studies often advocate the use of auto‐regressive (AR) noise models to adequately assess formal uncertainties, yet sea level often exhibits colored but non‐AR(1) noise. Standard error estimates are over‐ or under‐estimated by an AR(1) model for much of the Indo‐Pacific sea level. Allowing for PDO and ENSO variability in the trend estimate only reduces standard errors across the tropics and we find noise characteristics are largely unaffected. Of importance for trend and acceleration detection studies, formal error estimates remain on average up to 1.6 times those from an AR(1) model for long‐duration tide gauge data. There is an even chance that the observed trend from the satellite altimetry era exceeds the noise in patches of the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans and the south‐west and north‐east Pacific gyres. By including climate indices in the trend analysis, the time it takes for the observed linear sea‐level trend to emerge from the noise reduces by up to 2 decades.  aPublisher supplied data  aID DP150100615cAustralian Research Council Discovery Project  aFT110100207cAustralian Research Council Future Fellowship  aIDL‐FCT‐UID/GEO/50019/2013cPSTF  aSFRH/BPD/89923/2012cPSTF 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3asatellite altimetry 3asea level 3auncertainty 3aPacific Ocean1 aWatson, Christopher S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7464-45921 aLegrésy, Benoît1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1909-16301 aKing, Matt A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5611-94981 aChurch, John A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7037-81941 aBos, Machiel S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1946-86370 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.1978-1993dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0136553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03915naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245011400172520230900286592002802595650002302623650001402646650002302660650001502683650002302698650002202721650002902743650002302772650001802795650001502813650001502828650001802843650001902861650001402880650001102894650001502905650002502920650001602945650001602961653002202977653002302999653001203022653002503034653002103059700001703080700001303097700001803110700001903128700002403147773009103171856009003262852000903352655001203361IND60782062920221121234024.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Hongyan10aEnhanced photoautotrophic growth of Chlorella vulgaris in starch wastewater through photo-regulation strategy  aMicroalgae biomass production with starch wastewater (SW) is a promising approach to realize waste recovery and cost reduction due to the inherent copious nutrients and nontoxic compounds in SW. However, the application of this technique is significantly hindered by low biomass production on account of the poor photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae. In this regard, we proposed a photo-regulation strategy characterized by the adjusting of numbers of light/dark (L/D) cycles, and compositions of light wavelength, which was proved to be an effective method for stimulating intracellular photo electron transfer and enhancing photosynthetic efficiency, to boost microalgae biomass accumulation. Additionally, responses of the microalgae photo-biochemical conversion, and the wastewater treatment performance at various number of L/D cycles and light wavelengths were discussed. The experimental results indicated that the biomass production increased when the L/D period was increased from 2 h:2 h–12 h:12 h. When the L/D period was 2 h:2 h, the biomass production reached a maximum value of 1.28 g L⁻¹, which was 19.6% higher than that of the control group when the L/D period was 12 h:12 h. Furthermore, with respect to microalgae growth under monochromatic light, the maximum biomass concentration (1.25 g L⁻¹) and lipid content (32.2%) of Chlorella were achieved under blue light; whereas, the minimum values were attained under red light (1.05 g L⁻¹ and 19.3%, respectively). When the red light and blue light were mixed and supplied, the microalgae biomass productivity was higher than that under white light, and the highest lipid productivity was 109.0 mg⁻¹ L⁻¹ d under a blue: red ratio of 2:1. Moreover, gas chromatography analysis demonstrated that the methyl in the range of C16–C18 in the system was higher than 70%. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) containing palmitic acid (C16:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) are beneficial for production of biodiesel, and the quality of fatty acid methyl ester used in biodiesel production can be improved using microalgae cultured under the mixed wavelengths of blue and red. Finally, Chlorella was cultured in PBR and reached the peak concentration of 2.45 g L⁻¹ by semi-continuous process with the HRT regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3ablue light 3acost effectiveness 3aelectron transfer 3afatty acid methyl esters 3agas chromatography 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aphotosynthesis 3ared light 3astarch 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awavelengths 3awhite light 0aStarch wastewater 0aChlorella vulgaris 0aBiomass 0aNumber of L/D cycles 0aLight wavelength1 aZhu, Guoqing1 aNi, Jing1 aShen, Mingwei1 aShow, Pau Loke1 aSun, Fubao Fuelbiol0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 307 p.135533-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164300001400295520197900309592002802288650001802316650002402334650001602358650002502374650001502399650001402414650002402428650001102452650001302463650001902476650001902495650001802514650001202532653002602544653001302570653001002583653001102593653001202604653002102616700001902637700002702656700002502683700002202708700002702730700003202757773009102789856008102880852000902961655001202970IND60611159820221122083558.0180830e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061115982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2016.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolst, Mette10aOptimizing protein and energy intake in hospitals by improving individualized meal serving, hosting and the eating environment  ap. 14-20.  aOptimizing protein and energy intake by food in nutritional risk patients is difficult. The aim of this study was to improve the ≥75% of energy and protein requirements. We would like to see nurses take on the role of hosting the nutritional-risk patients, including focusing on bringing nutrition to the forefront in the collaboration between nurses and patients.This was an interventional study that included patients admitted to the Departments of Infectious Diseases, Hematology, and Heart–Lung Surgery in a baseline and follow-up investigation. It included 24-h food intake registrations (FRs) for 3 d consecutively, a questionnaire, and a semistructured patient interview. The interventions included in this study helped to improve the eating environment and serving, integrated nutrition into the nurse–patient welcome interview, and targeted individual preferences and challenges for eating.The study comprised 76 24-h FRs at baseline and 108 FRs at follow-up. The total group had improved food intake; 75% of individual energy requirements were met by (67.6% vs. 40%; P = 0.036) and the Heart–Lung Surgery group (85.7 vs. 38.5; P = 0.036). This was not reflected for protein (NS). Energy intake improved for the entire group, albeit not significantly (P = 0.862). Patients reported being happy with the interventions regarding individualized food serving, nurse communication, and improved meal environments.Only insignificant improvements to overall energy intake were seen in two of the three departments and in the overall group, and no statistical or clinically significant improvements to protein intake were observed. The relative risk of meeting 75% of energy requirements was improved in the overall group and in patients in the Department of Heart-Lung Surgery. This did not include the meeting of protein requirements. Improvements were welcomed by patients and staff. Focus on individualized nutrition from the nursing staff also improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy intake 3aenergy requirements 3afood intake 3afood serving methods 3ahematology 3ahospitals 3ainfectious diseases 3anurses 3apatients 3aprotein intake 3aquestionnaires 3arelative risk 3asurgery 0aHospitalized patients 0aNRS-2002 0aMeals 0aNurses 0aServing 0aNutrition intake1 aBeermann, Tina1 aMortensen, Marie Nerup1 aSkadhauge, Lotte Boa1 aKohler, Marianne,1 aLindorff-Larsen, Karen1 aRasmussen, Henrik Højgaard0 tNutrition.g2017 Feb., v. 34 p.14-20dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245009600173300001400269520182900283592002802112650001602140650002102156650001402177650001102191650001302202650001502215650000902230650004302239650001602282650001502298650001102313650001502324650001902339650001802358650000902376650001402385650002102399653000902420653000702429653000702436653000802443653000702451653000802458653000802466653000702474653000702481653000702488653000802495653000802503653000702511653000702518653000702525653000702532653000702539653000802546653000802554653000802562653002102570653001802591653001302609653001402622653002102636653001502657700002202672700001702694700002002711700002302731773010302754856008702857852000902944655001202953IND60525911320221118041914.0190401e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052591132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakagawa, Hikaru10aChanges of brain monoamine levels and physiological indexes during heat acclimation in rats  ap. 15-22.  aBrain monoamines, such as noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT), regulate many important physiological functions including thermoregulation. The purpose of this study was to clarify changes in NA, DA, and 5-HT levels in several brain regions in response to heat acclimation while also recording body temperature (Tb), heart rate (HR), and locomotor activity (Act). Rats were exposed to a heated environment (32°C) for 3h (3H), 1 day (1D), 7 days, 14 days (14D), 21 days, or 28 days (28D). After heat exposure, each of the following brain regions were immediately extracted and homogenized: the caudate putamen (CPu), preoptic area (PO), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), frontal cortex (FC), and hippocampus (Hip). NA, DA, and 5-HT levels in the extract were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Although Tb increased immediately after heat exposure, it decreased about 14D later. HR was maintained at a low level throughout heat exposure, and Act tended to increase near the end of heat exposure. After 3H, we observed a marked increase in NA level in the CPu. Although this response vanished after 1D, the level increased again after 28D. DA level in the CPu decreased significantly from 1D to 28D. 5-HT level in the PO and DMH decreased from 1D to 14D. It returned to control levels after 28D with increment of DA level. 5-HT level in the FC decreased at the start of heat exposure, but recovered after 28D; a time point at which DA level also increased. Monoamine levels in the Hip were unchanged after early heat exposure, but both 5-HT and DA levels increased after 28D. These results provide definitive evidence of changes in monoamines in individual brain regions involved in thermoregulation and behavioral, cognitive, and memory function during both acute and chronic heat exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3abody temperature 3acognition 3acortex 3adopamine 3aheart rate 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahippocampus 3alocomotion 3amemory 3amonoamines 3anorepinephrine 3apreoptic area 3arats 3aserotonin 3athermoregulation 0a5-HT 0aNA 0aDA 0aCPu 0aPO 0aDMH 0aHip 0aFC 0aHR 0aTb 0aAct 0aBAT 0aTa 0aRH 0a3H 0a1D 0a7D 0a14D 0a21D 0a28D 0aHeat acclimation 0aNoradrenaline 0aDopamine 0aSerotonin 0aBody temperature 0aHeart rate1 aMatsumura, Takeru1 aSuzuki, Kota1 aNinomiya, Chisa1 aIshiwata, Takayuki0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2016 May, v. 58 p.15-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245018800160300001600348500002000364520140600384592002801790650001901818650001501837650001301852650001201865650001101877650001201888650002601900650001501926650001601941650002701957650001001984650001801994650001402012650002702026650001602053650002102069650001702090650000702107650002502114650002002139650002102159650002002180650001302200650002202213650001002235650001502245700002102260700002302281700002002304773012802324856007302452852000902525655001202534IND60571382520221121032252.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057138252DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.77022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, Ângela A10aPreparation and characterization of baru (Dipteryx alata Vog) nut protein isolate and comparison of its physico‐chemical properties with commercial animal and plant protein isolates  ap. 151-157.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The Brazilian leguminous tree locally known in the Cerrado Biome as baru (Dipteryx alata Vog), provides a healthy edible oil source. The proteinaceous cake remaining after oil extraction could be transformed into new products to foodstuff development, such as protein concentrates and isolates, adding value to the production chain. In this study, it is described the preparation and characterization of baru nut protein isolate (BPI) from deffated baru flour, and measurements of its functional, nutritional, and thermal properties, in comparison to the more common vegetable (soybeans) and animal (casein and albumin) protein sources of the food industry. RESULTS: BPI presented higher protein content than soybean, casein and albumin commercial protein isolates, despite losses of albumins and low molecular weight globulins during the isolation procedure. Thermodynamics studies suggested that BPI has a well‐conserved protein arrangement and lower thermostability than the other protein sources. BPI showed high in vitro digestibility and suitable and desirable functional properties such as water and oil absorption capacity, emulsifying activity, and foam formation and stability at mild and neutral pH. CONCLUSION: BPI could be used either as a substitute ingredient in oily food formulations or in the development of new products of its own. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipteryx alata 3aabsorption 3aalbumins 3aanimals 3acasein 3acerrado 3acooking fats and oils 3aecosystems 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aflour 3afood industry 3aglobulins 3ain vitro digestibility 3aingredients 3amolecular weight 3anew products 3apH 3aprotein concentrates 3aprotein content 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein sources 3asoybeans 3athermal stability 3atrees 3avegetables1 aFavaro, Simone P1 aMiranda, Cesar H B1 aNeves, Valdir A0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2017 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.151-157dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.77023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01664naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014500166300001800311500001900329520049800348592002800846650002600874650001100900650001300911650002900924650001300953700001700966700005800983700001501041700005701056773012101113856008301234852000901317655001201326IND60719714920221121213204.0201204e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071971492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c035512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinmou10aConstruction of 2-(2-Arylphenyl)azoles via Cobalt-Catalyzed C–H/C–H Cross-Coupling Reactions and Evaluation of Their Antifungal Activity  ap. 9331-9336.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough compounds with a 2-(2-arylphenyl) benzoxazole motif are biologically important, there are only a few methods for synthesizing them.

Nine non-pregnant Anglo Nubian nanny goats were used in the study. An indirect calorimeter was designed and developed to measure oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, methane production and water vapour pressure of the air exhaled from goats. Physiological parameters: rectal temperature, skin temperature, hair-coat temperature, expired air temperature and respiratory rate and volume as well as environmental parameters: air temperature, relative humidity and mean radiant temperature were measured. The results show that respiratory and volume rates and latent heat loss did not change significantly for air temperature between 22 and 26°C. In this temperature range, metabolic heat was lost mainly by convection and long-wave radiation. For temperature greater than 30°C, the goats maintained thermal equilibrium mainly by evaporative heat loss. At the higher air temperature, the respiratory and ventilation rates as well as body temperatures were significantly elevated. It can be concluded that for Anglo Nubian goats, the upper limit of air temperature for comfort is around 26°C when the goats are protected from direct solar radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3abody temperature 3acalorimeters 3acarbon dioxide production 3aenvironmental factors 3aheat 3amethane production 3anannygoats 3aoxygen consumption 3arelative humidity 3arespiratory rate 3askin temperature 3asolar radiation 3atropics 3avapor pressure 3awater vapor 0aGoats 0aSensible heat loss 0aLatent heat loss 0aThermoregulation 0aThermogenesis1 aNascimento, Sheila T.1 aNascimento, Carolina C.N.1 aGebremedhin, Kifle G.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2016 May, v. 58 p.43-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245015300157300001600310520106000326592002801386650002101414650002101435650001501456650002101471650002601492650001001518700001401528700001301542700001501555700001401570773012701584856007701711852000901788655001201797IND60765404720221122181116.0220419e20130708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076540472DNAL7 a10.17221/6868-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYilmaz, S.10aInvestigations on the postnatal development of the foliate papillae using light and scanning electron microscopy in the porcupine (Hystrix cristata)  ap. 318-321.  aIn this study SEM and light microscopy were used to investigate the structure of the foliate papillae in the porcupine. The foliate papillae consisted of about 10 or 11 clefts. The length of the foliate papillae averaged 2.79 mm and its width averaged 863 &micro;m. Taste buds were located intraepithelial in the basal half of the papilla grooves (sulcus papillae). Every wall on each fold harboured from five to nine taste buds. There were two different cell types of taste buds: one stained light (epitheliocytus sensorius gustatorius), and the other dark (epitheliocytus sustentans).

When artificial selection is applied to a single component of a stress response, this selection may result in correlated responses in other stress responses, a phenomenon called cross-tolerance, which is ultimately controlled by the genetic correlations among traits. We selected for extreme responses to cold tolerance by selecting for chill-coma recovery time from a single temperate population of Drosophila melanogaster. Chill-coma recovery time is a common metric of low, but non-lethal, cold temperature tolerance. Replicated divergent artificial selection was applied to a genetically variable base population for 31 generations, resulting in two cold resistant, two cold susceptible, and two unselected control lines. To quantify the relationship between selection on chill-coma recovery and other metrics of thermal performance, we also measured survivorship after acute cold exposure, survivorship after chronic cold exposure, survivorship after cold exposure following a pre-treatment period (rapid cold hardening), starvation tolerance, and heat tolerance. We find that chill-coma recovery time is heritable within this population and that there is an asymmetric response to increased and decreased chill-coma recovery time. Surprisingly, we found no cross-tolerances between selection on chill-coma recovery time and the other environmental stress response traits. These results suggest that although artificial selection has dramatically altered chill-coma recovery time, the correlated response to selection on other stress response phenotypes has been negligible. The lack of a correlated response suggests that chill-coma recovery time in these selection lines is likely genetically independent from measures of cold survivorship tested here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aartificial selection 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acorrelated responses 3agenetic correlation 3aheat tolerance 3aphenotype 3aselection response 3astarvation 3astress response 3asurvival rate 0aCross-tolerance 0aChill-coma recovery 0aDrosophila melanogaster 0aArtificial selection1 aMackay, Trudy F.C.1 aMorgan, Theodore J.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2016 July, v. 59 p.77-85dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245007700156520113000233592002801363650001601391650001301407650001601420650001801436650001901454650001501473650001901488650001401507650001301521700001401534700001501548700001601563700001701579700001501596700001801611773012001629856007801749852000901827655001201836IND60794207520221120081043.0220922e20220902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079420752DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130915792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hao 10aSenescent Fibroblasts Generate a CAF Phenotype through the Stat3 Pathway  aAging has been recently reported to promote lung cancer initiation and progression. Senescent fibroblasts gain a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype, and exert a powerful influence on cancer behavior, such as tumor cell growth and metastasis. However, mechanisms linking fibroblast senescence with CAF activation remain poorly understood. Our study shows that senescent fibroblasts displayed CAF properties, including the highly expressed CAF markers, α-SMA and Vimentin, and CAF-specific factors, CXCL12, FGF10, IL6 and COL1A1, which significantly increased collagen contractile activity and promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, H1299 and A549. We were further able to show that CAF characteristics in senescent fibroblasts could be regulated by the Stat3 pathway. Intracellular ROS accumulation activates the Stat3 pathway during senescence. Thus, our findings indicate that senescent fibroblasts mediate a CAF function with the Stat3 pathway. We further propose a novel Stat3 dependent targetable mechanism, which is instrumental in mediating the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3acollagen 3afibroblasts 3ainterleukin-6 3alung neoplasms 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aphenotype 3avimentin1 aQiu, Lei 1 aLiu, Qing 1 aMa, Zelong 1 aXie, Xiaoli 1 aLuo, Ying 1 aWu, Xiaoming 0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 02, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130915793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014000168300001400308520182900322592002802151650002502179650001902204650002002223650002602243650003502269650001202304650001602316650002402332650001702356650001502373650001102388650001602399650001302415650001002428651002402438651001102462653003302473653003102506653002202537653002002559700001902579700002002598700002402618773012302642856008302765852000902848655001202857IND60628352820221122022222.0190318e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062835282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmid, Ryan B.10aLandscape effects on Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), distribution within six Kansas commercial wheat fields  ap. 52-61.  aCrop production of a significant portion of the Great Plains has greatly simplified the landscape, which can affect insect pest outbreaks. The Hessian fly is an important economic pest of wheat, a major crop grown in the region. However, outbreaks are often limited to localized events, which may be difficult to predict. Better understanding of where Hessian fly outbreaks are more likely to occur would help producers make informed management decisions. Therefore, the objective of our study was to describe the spatial distribution of Hessian fly infestation within commercial wheat fields, while examining how a simplified landscape may contribute to the distribution of Hessian fly infestations. Spatial distribution modeling was conducted in select fields (n = 6) infested with Hessian fly puparia. A geographic information system was used to create sampling grids for each field (n = 34–50 sample points/field), with one meter row of plants sampled at each sample point. The number of puparia and plants infested at each sample point were used to construct Hessian fly distribution maps for each field. Correlations between environmental factors and fly distribution were then examined. Results show that host plants (wheat and grasses) adjacent to the borders of study fields did not affect the distribution of puparia or plants infested within the field. Rather, the proportion of wheat within a 1 km radius of sampled fields affected the level of Hessian fly infestation, with a smaller proportion of wheat within the 1 km radius increasing the probability of Hessian fly infestation in sampled fields. The results of this study show previously unknown distribution of Hessian fly infestation within commercial wheat fields, resulting in new hypotheses about Hessian fly management in agroecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMayetiola destructor 3aagroecosystems 3acrop production 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographic information systems 3agrasses 3ahost plants 3ainsect infestations 3ainsect pests 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprobability 3apuparium 3awheat 3aGreat Plains region 3aKansas 0aAgroecosystem simplification 0aIntegrated pest management 0aInsect monitoring 0aCrop production1 aHefley, Trevor1 aLollato, Romulo1 aMcCornack, Brian P.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 274 p.52-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01371naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009900168300001600267520033200283592002800615650001400643650001900657650003000676650001600706650002500722700001300747700001700760700001800777700001300795700001800808773011400826856008400940852000901024655001201033IND60112768920221117060252.0141111e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011276892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Dongming10aEfficient purification of native recombinant proteins using proteases immobilized on cellulose  ap. 542-544.  aCellulose binding domain (CBD) fusion protease was employed to digest the CBD fusion protein.

This simple model fails to describe experimental isotherms and isosteric heats for many gas/graphite pairs. In this paper, we investigate the adsorption of krypton and methane on graphite, using a recently developed molecular model for graphite, that has been shown to improve the description of experimental isotherms and isosteric heats for nitrogen and argon.(1−3) Although the collision diameters of krypton and methane are almost the same, their isotherms and heats are significantly different. With the aid of detailed microscopic analysis, we establish the mechanism underlying the transitions in adsorbate loading as well as the origin of the spike in the experimental isosteric heat versus loading for methane and krypton. The first adsorbate layer of both adsorbates exhibits the transition from a 2D-fluid to a commensurate (C) state; but only krypton shows a subsequent transition to incommensurate (IC) packing before the onset of the second layer. However, the first adsorbate layer of the methane isotherm does also undergo this transition, but only after the second layer has been formed at higher temperatures (T > 87 K). This is explained by the difference between the intermolecular spacing in the C-packed lattice and in the IC-lattice. The difference is smaller for methane than for krypton, making it more difficult for methane to achieve IC-packing and it is also reflected in the isosteric heat versus loading (heat curve). The heat curves for both adsorbates exhibit an increase in the isosteric heat at submonolayer coverage and reach a maximum at the coverage corresponding to C-packing at temperatures far below the triple point. As the temperature is increased, the isosteric heat also increases to a maximum at a loading less than the C-packing, followed by a cusp due to the onset of the second layer, prior to the spike at the C-packing. The difference between the two adsorbates is shown by the appearance of an additional spike for krypton when the C–IC transition occurs. These heat spikes for Kr due to C-packing and IC-packing shift to higher loading and have smaller magnitudes at higher temperatures because of the contributions from higher layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aargon (noble gases) 3agraphene 3aheat 3akrypton 3amethane 3amolecular models 3anitrogen 3atemperature1 aTan, Shiliang Johnathan1 aLiu, Lumeng1 aDo, D.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the developed strain caused 2nd, 3rd, and recent Indian strain waves of epidemics that have led to unexpected consequences, such as forced reductions in demands for some industries, transportation systems, employment, and businesses due to public confinement. Besides, poultry processing plants' conditions exacerbate the risks due to the proximity on the line, cold, and humidity. Most workers do not have access to paid sick time or adequate health care, and because of the low wages, they have limited reserves to enable them to leave steady employment. In addition, workers in meat and poultry slaughterhouses may be infected through respiratory droplets in the air and/or from touching dirty surfaces or objects such as workstations, break room tables, or tools. Egg prices have increased dramatically during the lockdown as consumers have started to change their behaviors and habits. The COVID pandemic might also substantially impact the international poultry trade over the next several months. This review will focus on the effect of COVID-19 on poultry production, environmental sustainability, and earth systems from different process points of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aair 3acold 3aeggs 3aemployment 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahealth services 3ahumidity 3ameat 3apandemic 3apollution 3apoultry industry 3apoultry production 3aresearch 3atransportation1 aAttia, Youssef A1 aBovera, Fulvia1 aAbd El-Hack, Mohamed E.1 aKhafaga, Asmaa F.1 ade Oliveira, Maria Cristina0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 33 p.44833-44844dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15052-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013200182300001400314520119800328592002801526650001601554650002601570650001001596650002001606650001201626650001401638650001301652650002301665650001301688650001401701650001601715650001301731651002201744651002501766653002101791653001201812653002501824700002001849700002601869700002201895700002101917700001801938700002301956773011101979856008502090852000902175655001202184IND60682604520221121113704.0200130e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068260452DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2019.16764172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelliti Ben Garali, Sondes10aFactors driving the seasonal dynamics of Pseudo-nitzschia species and domoic acid at mussel farming in the SW Mediterranean Sea  ap. 66-82.  aThe seasonal variations in Pseudo-nitzschia species and domoic acid (DA) concentration were investigated, at three shellfish farms in SW coastal Mediterranean. In parallel, the toxicity of mussels was tested. Two distinct groups of species were enumerated according to morphology and size (Pseudo-nizschia delicatissima and P. seriata groups). DA was detected over a nine-week period from July to October 2012 in the Lagoon, with a maximum concentration recorded in July (12.71 ng DA L⁻¹). DA was positively correlated with the presence of P. seriata-group and P. delicatissima-group and was mostly occurred during P limitation period in seawater. No DA was found in mussels that were collected during the period of DA absence in seawater. Our results suggest that temperature, salinity, inorganic and organic nutrients were significant for the seasonal dynamics of P. seriata and P. delicatissima groups, but that the P limitation was the most driving factor for DA production in these areas. The relative influence of environmental factors should be further studied to better understand the recent surfacing of massive blooms of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia in SW Mediterranean coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3adomoic acid 3aenvironmental factors 3afarms 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3anutrients 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3ashellfish 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3aMediterranean Sea 3aMediterranean region 0aPseudo-nitzschia 0adiatoms 0aMediterranean lagoon1 aSahraoui, Inès1 aIglesia, Pablo de la,1 aChalghaf, Mohamed1 aDiogène, Jorge,1 aKsouri, Jamel1 aSakka Hlaili, Asma0 tChemistry in ecology.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 36, no. 1 p.66-82dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12214x1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2019.16764173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015100167300001600318520142500334592002801759650002101787650001801808650001401826650001401840650001401854650001401868650002201882650003801904650002101942650001301963650002901976650001902005650001002024650003002034650001802064650001602082650003402098650002002132650001302152650004302165650005202208650001302260650001702273653002202290653002902312653002702341653001802368653002602386700001702412700001902429700001302448700001702461700001702478700001202495700001402507773013302521856008502654852000902739655001202748IND60644330520221120224432.0190613e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064433052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2019.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wenxia10aMicrovesicles derived from human Wharton’s Jelly mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate acute lung injury partly mediated by hepatocyte growth factor  ap. 114-122.  aSeveral studies have highlighted the underlying role of mesenchymal stem cells microvesicles (MSC-MVs) in acute lung injury (ALI). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) derived from MSC-MVs is partly involved in their therapeutic effects; however, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. MVs were isolated from human Wharton's Jelly MSCs. The rat model of ALI was established by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM). A co-culture model of alveolar epithelial cells or pulmonary endothelial cells and MSC-MVs was utilized. Total protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was determined by bicinchoninic acid method. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil in BALF were counted. ELISA was used for the determination of cytokines and HGF in BALF. Apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining as well as caspase-3 activity detection. HE and Masson staining of lung tissues was used for histopathology analysis. The expression of HGF and proteins involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Treatment with MSC-MVs significantly inhibited BLM-induced apoptosis and fibrosis in lung tissues and PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation, which was reversed by HGF mRNA deficient MVs. Intriguingly, these effects were completely abrogated by PI3K inhibitor. The therapeutic effect of MSC-MVs in ALI was partly mediated through HGF mRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acoculture 3acytokines 3aendothelial cells 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3afibrosis 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3ahistopathology 3alungs 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amessenger RNA 3aneutrophils 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3atherapeutics 0aAcute lung injury 0aHepatocyte growth factor 0aMesenchymal stem cells 0aMicrovesicles 0aPI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway1 aWang, Shumin1 aXiang, Hengjie1 aLiu, Jie1 aZhang, Yudan1 aZhou, Shasha1 aDu, Tao1 aShan, Lei0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2019 July, v. 112 p.114-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2019.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012000171300001600291520168400307592002801991650001502019650001302034650002002047650001302067650002402080650001802104650001902122650001502141650002402156650001002180650002402190650001302214650001202227651001302239653002202252653002002274653002402294653003502318653002602353700001702379700002002396700002202416700001702438700002002455700001802475773009302493856008102586852000902667655001202676IND60611160320221122114810.0180830e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061116032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2016.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebremedhin, Samson10aPredictors of dietary diversity in children ages 6 to 23 mo in largely food-insecure area of South Wollo, Ethiopia  ap. 163-168.  aThe aim of this study was to assess the level and predictors of dietary diversity (DD) in predominantly food-insecure area of South Wollo, Ethiopia among children ages 6 to 23 mo.The study was conducted in October 2014. We selected 2080 children using a multistage sampling technique. DD in the preceding day of the survey was assessed with the standard seven-food group score. Predictors of DD were identified via Poisson regression model and the outputs are presented using adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).Only 7% (95% CI, 5.9%–8.1%) of the children met the recommended minimum DD. Child age and maternal knowledge of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) were significant predictors of DD with IRR of 1.027 (95% CI, 1.022–1.032) and 1.026 (95% CI, 1.010–1.043). Households with moderate and severe food insecurity had 9% (95% CI, 3.8–13.9%) and 24.9% (95% CI, 14.6–44%) reduced chance of providing diversified food. Husbands' direct involvement in IYCF increased DD by 13.7% (95% CI, 7.4–20.4). Caregivers who discussed IYCF with health extension workers, participated in cooking demonstrations, and heard radio spots about IYCF in the preceding 3 mo had 11.7% (95% CI, 3.4–20.7%), 18.9% (95% CI, 0.3–40.9%), and 11.4% (95% CI, 4.8–18.4) higher chance of providing diversified food, respectively. Backyard gardening (IRR, 1.088; 95% CI, 1.031–1.148) and number of chickens owned (IRR, 1.011; 95% CI, 1.001–1.021) also were significant predictors.In predominately food-insecure areas, nutrition education, implementation of nutrition-sensitive agriculture, and husband involvement in IYCF can improve children's DD.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaregivers 3achickens 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3afood security 3ahome gardening 3ahouseholds 3anutrition education 3aradio 3aregression analysis 3asampling 3asurveys 3aEthiopia 0aDietary diversity 0aFood insecurity 0aNutrition education 0aInfant and young child feeding 0aComplementary feeding1 aBaye, Kaleab1 aBekele, Tilahun1 aTharaney, Manisha1 aAsrat, Yonas1 aAbebe, Yewelsew1 aReta, Nigusse0 tNutrition.g2017 Jan., v. 33 p.163-168dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009900169300001600268520172600284592002802010650002202038650002602060650001902086650001602105650001802121650001402139650001302153650002502166650002102191650001002212650001202222650001002234651001302244653001802257653001602275653001802291653002102309653001302330700001702343700001902360773011002379856005102489852000902540655001202549IND50086034320221121030411.0140412e20110203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008603432DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2011.5406882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Amanullah10aWheat response to farm yard manure and nitrogen fertilization under moisture stress conditions  ap. 732-742.  aInformation on the combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity is lacking under moisture stress conditions of Northwest Pakistan. The present experiment was designed to ascertain the combined effect of organic and inorganic fertilizer management on rainfed wheat. Four levels of farm yard manure, FYM, (0, 10, 20, and 30 Mg FYM ha⁻¹) and nitrogen (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 kg N ha⁻¹) were used. The experiment was conducted at the Agriculture Research Farm of NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar, Pakistan during crop season of 2003–04. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with four replications. Plant height, productive tillers m⁻², grains spike⁻¹, grain yield, straw yield, and harvest index were significantly higher in plots which received 30 Mg FYM ha⁻¹. In the case of nitrogen (N) no distinctive differences between the effect of 90 and 120 kg ha⁻¹ was observed for most of the parameters. Nitrogen application at 90 kg ha⁻¹ had significantly higher; plant height, grains spike⁻¹, grain yield, straw yield, and harvest index as compared with the lower levels, i.e., 0, 30, and 60 kg N ha⁻¹ but were at par with 120 N kg ha⁻¹. Significantly higher numbers of productive tillers m⁻², grains spike⁻¹, grain yield, straw yield and harvest index were recorded with application of 30 Mg FYM ha⁻¹ + 90 kg N ha⁻¹. The present study suggested that application of 30 Mg FYM ha⁻¹ + 90 kg N ha⁻¹ are promising levels for higher production of wheat under moisture stress conditions. Further research work is needed to ascertain the effect of N above 90 kg ha⁻¹ under different moisture regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aagricultural colleges 3aanimal manures 3agrain yield 3aharvest index 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aon-farm research 3astraw 3atillers 3awheat 3aPakistan 0arainfed wheat 0agrain yield 0aharvest index 0afarm yard manure 0anitrogen1 aAmānullāh,1 aNoor, Maimoona0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 Feb. 3, v. 34, no. 5 p.732-742dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2011.540688  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013500166300001800301520179900319592002802118650001502146650001202161650001302173650002102186650001702207650002102224650001902245650001202264650001502276650000702291650001802298650001202316650001602328700001502344700001802359700001502377700001702392700001402409773011002423856008602533852000902619655001202628IND60530438520221119110528.0160721e20160202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053043852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.5b041692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Yanfen10aDesign of NIR Chromenylium-Cyanine Fluorophore Library for “Switch-ON” and Ratiometric Detection of Bio-Active Species In Vivo  ap. 1842-1849.  aThe real-time monitoring of key biospecies in the living systems has received thrusting attention during the past decades. Specifically, fluorescent detection based on near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes is highly favorable for live cells, live tissues, and even animal imaging, owing to the substantial merits of the NIR window, such as minimal phototoxicity, deep penetration into tissues, and low autofluorescence background. Nevertheless, developing potent NIR fluorescent probes still poses serious challenges to the chemists because traditional NIR fluorophores are less tunable than visible-wavelength fluorophores. To address this issue, here we report a set of novel NIR hybrid fluorophores, namely, the hybrid chromenylium-cyanine fluorophore (CC-Fluor), in which both the fluorescence intensity and the emission wavelength can be easily adjusted by the conformational changes and substitution groups. Compared to known NIR fluorophores, the new CC-Fluors are substantially advantageous for NIR probe development: (1) CC-Fluors display tunable and moderate Stokes shifts and quantum yields; (2) the fluorophores are stable at physiological conditions after long-term incubation; (3) the absorption maxima of CC-Fluors coincide with the common laser spectral lines in mainstream in vivo imaging systems; (4) most importantly, CC-Fluors can be easily modified to prepare NIR probes targeting various biospecies. To fully demonstrate the practical utility of CC-Fluors, we report two innovative NIR probes, a ratiometric pH probe and a turn-on Hg²⁺ probe, both are successfully employed in live animal imaging. Hence, the detailed studies allow us to confirm that CC-Fluors can work as an excellent platform for developing NIR probes for the detection of species in living systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanimals 3achemists 3aemissions factor 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3amercury 3amonitoring 3apH 3aphototoxicity 3atissues 3awavelengths1 aCheng, Dan1 aRen, Tianbing1 aLi, Yinhui1 aZeng, Zebing1 aYuan, Lin0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Feb. 02, v. 88, no. 3 p.1842-1849dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b041693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03852naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014400159520227800303592002802581650002202609650003402631650003002665650002302695650001402718650002202732650002102754650001702775650001002792650001002802650002002812650001102832650002002843650001702863650001602880650001402896650001802910650001702928650001402945650002902959650001902988650001603007700003803023700001803061700002903079700002103108773012203129856007403251852000903325655001203334IND60757968220221119003915.0211125e20211112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075796822DNAL7 a10.3390/v131122652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGwon, Yong-Dae 10aRift Valley Fever Virus Propagates in Human Villous Trophoblast Cell Lines and Induces Cytokine mRNA Responses Known to Provoke Miscarriage  aThe mosquito-borne Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a prioritised disease that has been listed by the World Health Organization for urgent research and development of counteraction. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) can cause a cytopathogenic effect in the infected cell and induce hyperimmune responses that contribute to pathogenesis. In livestock, the consequences of RVFV infection vary from mild symptoms to abortion. In humans, 1–3% of patients with RVFV infection develop severe disease, manifested as, for example, haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis or blindness. RVFV infection has also been associated with miscarriage in humans. During pregnancy, there should be a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators to create a protective environment for the placenta and foetus. Many viruses are capable of penetrating that protective environment and infecting the foetal–maternal unit, possibly via the trophoblasts in the placenta, with potentially severe consequences. Whether it is the viral infection per se, the immune response, or both that contribute to the pathogenesis of miscarriage remains unknown. To investigate how RVFV could contribute to pathogenesis during pregnancy, we infected two human trophoblast cell lines, A3 and Jar, representing normal and transformed human villous trophoblasts, respectively. They were infected with two RVFV variants (wild-type RVFV and RVFV with a deleted NSs protein), and the infection kinetics and 15 different cytokines were analysed. The trophoblast cell lines were infected by both RVFV variants and infection caused upregulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for interferon (IFN) types I–III and inflammatory cytokines, combined with cell line-specific mRNA expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and interleukin (IL)-10. When comparing the two RVFV variants, we found that infection with RVFV lacking NSs function caused a hyper-IFN response and inflammatory response, while the wild-type RVFV suppressed the IFN I and inflammatory response.

However, MVM use is common in the general population as well. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the safety of long-term use of these supplements. To examine the safety of MVM use, we performed a literature search for randomized controlled studies involving supplementation with a combination of at least nine vitamins and three minerals at a maximum concentration of 100% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance. We found nine studies evaluating the use and efficacy of MVMs in pregnant women and healthy adults and six studies in the elderly where adverse effects were explicitly addressed. Only minor adverse events (e.g., unspecific gastrointestinal symptoms) were reported in all studies. In particular, there were no significant differences between treatment and placebo groups. MVM use within the range of the Dietary Reference Intake will not result in excess intake, even when including the effect of food and fortified food, and does not increase mortality. Taken together, these findings indicate that MVMs can be safe for long-term use (>10 y).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aabortion (animals) 3aadverse effects 3aelderly 3afolic acid 3afortified foods 3agastrointestinal system 3airon 3aminerals 3amortality 3amultivitamin supplements 3aplacebos 3apregnant women 3avitamin-mineral supplements 0aMultivitamins 0aMinerals 0aSupplements 0aSafety 0aLong-term use 0aRandomized controlled trials1 aTinz, Jana0 tNutrition.g2017 Apr., v. 36 p.60-66dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2016.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245010200163520147000265592002801735650002601763650001601789650002101805650001101826650002501837650001201862650001501874650001201889650001101901650002401912650001501936650002501951650000701976700002801983700002202011700001602033773012002049856007802169852000902247655001202256IND60794208220221120223108.0220922e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079420822DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130915852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDekker, Yasmin 10aCrosstalk between Hypoxia and Extracellular Matrix in the Tumor Microenvironment in Breast Cancer  aEven though breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women, treatments are not always successful in preventing its progression. Recent studies suggest that hypoxia and the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important in altering cell metabolism and tumor metastasis. Therefore, the aim of this review is to study the crosstalk between hypoxia and the ECM and to assess their impact on breast cancer progression. The findings indicate that hypoxic signaling engages multiple mechanisms that directly contribute to ECM remodeling, ultimately increasing breast cancer aggressiveness. Second, hypoxia and the ECM cooperate to alter different aspects of cell metabolism. They mutually enhance aerobic glycolysis through upregulation of glucose transport, glycolytic enzymes, and by regulating intracellular pH. Both alter lipid and amino acid metabolism by stimulating lipid and amino acid uptake and synthesis, thereby providing the tumor with additional energy for growth and metastasis. Third, YAP/TAZ signaling is not merely regulated by the tumor microenvironment and cell metabolism, but it also regulates it primarily through its target c-Myc. Taken together, this review provides a better understanding of the crosstalk between hypoxia and the ECM in breast cancer. Additionally, it points to a role for the YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction pathway as an important link between hypoxia and the ECM in the tumor microenvironment, driving breast cancer progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid metabolism 3aamino acids 3abreast neoplasms 3aenergy 3aextracellular matrix 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahypoxia 3alipids 3amechanotransduction 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm progression 3apH1 aLe Dévédec, Sylvia E.1 aDanen, Erik H.

The management consisted of the establishment of 3 m2 patches of sown plant species or spontaneous natural vegetation between trees along tree lines. The sown plant species in the mixtures were Sinapis alba L. (Brassicaceae), Glebionis segetum (L.) Fourr. and Glebionis coronaria (L.) Cass. ex Spach (Asteraceae), Vicia sativa L. and Pisum sativum L. (Fabaceae), Borago officinalis L. (Boraginaceae), Coriandrum sativum L. and Pimpinella anisum L. (Apiaceae). Sowing was performed in autumn or spring and the peak flowering period occurred at the end of March to end of April, and at the end of May to end of June, respectively. Visual estimation of flower cover, counts of pollinator landings on flowers and presence of beneficial arthropods (suction sampling) were performed in three 7–10 day intervals during peak flowering, for each experimental year. Overall, patches with sown plant mixtures attracted higher numbers of pollinating Hymenoptera compared to native vegetation, especially mining bees and honey bees (Apis mellifera) as well as megachilids and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Sinapis alba, present in both sown and native vegetation patches, attracted mainly mining bees and honey bees. The flowering mixture with C. sativum and B. officinalis was more attractive to honey bees than the one with G. coronaria as main flowering species but they were both equally attractive to mining bees, although the species composition may well have been different. Hymenopterous parasitoids, primarily Braconidae and Chalcidoidea, were sampled from the patches and the olive fruit fly parasitoid Opius concolor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was recorded on olive trees adjacent to the flowering patches. Large numbers of predators, namely Orius sp. (Hemiptera: Miridae) and lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), were recorded in the patches, principally in those with the mixture containing mostly S. alba. Our results suggest that ground cover in patches with suitable flowering species could be part of a sustainable olive crop management system, providing food and refuge for pollinating insects and beneficial arthropods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrena 3aApis mellifera 3aBactrocera oleae 3aBombus 3aBorago officinalis 3aChrysopidae 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aGlebionis coronaria 3aMiridae 3aOlea europaea 3aOpius concolor 3aOrius 3aPimpinella anisum 3aPisum sativum 3aSinapis alba 3aVicia sativa 3aautumn 3acrop management 3aflowering 3agroves 3ahabitats 3ahoney bees 3aindigenous species 3alacewings 3anatural enemies 3aolives 3aparasitoids 3apollinating insects 3apollination 3apredators 3asowing 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3atreeline 3atrees 3aGreece 0aBiodiversity 0aGround cover 0aSustainable management 0aPollination 0aBeneficial arthropods1 aKati, Vaya1 aVolakakis, Nikos1 aVarikou, Kyriaki1 aGarantonakis, Nikos1 aEconomou, Leonidas1 aBirouraki, Athanasia1 aMarkellou, Emilia1 aLiberopoulou, Sofia1 aEdwards, Mike0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 274 p.76-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245009400183300001400277520154500291592002801836650001301864650002001877650001301897650002101910650001201931650001001943650001901953650001301972650001701985650001202002650001002014651001702024653003002041653002602071653002102097653002102118653003302139700002102172700004002193700002402233773010302257856008702360852000902447655001202456IND60525912320221118041835.0190401e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052591232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRueda Solano, Luis Alberto10aThermal ecology of montane Atelopus (Anura: Bufonidae): A study of intrageneric diversity  ap. 91-98.  aHarlequin frogs (Bufonidae: Atelopus) are among the most threatened frog genus in the world and reach very high elevations in the tropical Andes and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM). Learning about their thermal ecology is essential to infer sensitivity to environmental changes, particularly climate warming. We report on the activity temperature and thermoregulatory behavior of three high-elevation species of harlequin frogs, Atelopus nahumae, Atelopus laetissimus and Atelopus carrikeri. The first two mentioned live in streams in Andean rain forests, whereas A. carrikeri inhabits paramo streams in the SNSM. We studied the thermal ecology of these species in tree localities differing in altitude, and focused on activity body, operative, substrate and air temperature. A main trend was lower body temperature as elevation increased, so that differences among species were largely explained by differences in substrate temperature. However, this temperature variation was much lower in forest species than paramo species. The Atelopus species included in this work proved to be thermoconformers, a trend that not extended to all congenerics at high elevation. This diversity in thermal ecology poses important questions when discussing the impact of climate warming for high-elevation harlequin frogs. For example, forest species show narrow thermal ranges and, if highly specialized, may be more susceptible to temperature change. Paramo species such as A. carrikeri, in contrast, may be more resilient to temperature change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtelopus 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3abody temperature 3aecology 3afrogs 3aglobal warming 3alearning 3arain forests 3astreams 3atrees 3aAndes region 0aActivity body temperature 0aOperative temperature 0aThermoregulation 0aThermoconformers 0aSierra Nevada De Santa Marta1 aNavas, Carlos A.1 aCarvajalino-Fernández, Juan Manuel1 aAmézquita, Adolfo,0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2016 May, v. 58 p.91-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011100160520134900271592002801620650001901648650002101667650002001688650001101708650001101719700002501730700001901755700002701774700002101801700002101822773012201843856007401965852000902039655001202048IND60757968420221119003822.0211125e20211112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075796842DNAL7 a10.3390/v131122662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGokavi, Jyotsna 10aInhibition of miR-155 Promotes TGF-β Mediated Suppression of HIV Release in the Cervical Epithelial Cells  aTGF-β has been shown to play a differential role in either restricting or aiding HIV infection in different cell types, however its role in the cervical cells is hitherto undefined. Among females, more than 80% of infections occur through heterosexual contact where cervicovaginal mucosa plays a critical role, however the early events during the establishment of infection at female genital mucosa are poorly understood. We earlier showed that increased TGF-β level has been associated with cervical viral shedding in the HIV infected women, however a causal relationship could not be examined. Therefore, here we first established an in vitro cell-associated model of HIV infection in the cervical epithelial cells (ME-180) and demonstrated that TGF-β plays an important role as a negative regulator of HIV release in the infected cervical epithelial cells. Inhibition of miR-155 upregulated TGF-β signaling and mRNA expression of host restriction factors such as APOBEC-3G, IFI-16 and IFITM-3, while decreased the HIV release in ME-180 cells. To conclude, this is the first study to decipher the complex interplay between TGF-β, miR-155 and HIV release in the cervical epithelial cells. Collectively, our data suggest the plausible role of TGF-β in promoting HIV latency in cervical epithelial cells which needs further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3afemale genitalia 3agene expression 3amodels 3amucosa1 aSadawarte, Sharwari 1 aShelke, Anant 1 aKulkarni-Kale, Urmila 1 aThakar, Madhuri 1 aSaxena, Vandana 0 tViruses.g2021 Nov. 12, v. 13, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131122663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01726naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012900170300001800299500001900317520065100336592002800987650001101015650002201026650002801048700002401076700002501100700001701125700005701142773012101199856008301320852000901403655001201412IND60719715920221121213154.0201204e20201118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071971592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c036662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarak, Dinesh S.10aDecarboxylative/Oxidative Amidation of Aryl α-Ketocarboxylic Acids with Nitroarenes and Nitroso Compounds in Aqueous Medium  ap. 9381-9385.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe decarboxylative/oxidative amidation of aryl α-ketocarboxylic acids with 5-aryl-3-nitroisoxazole-4-carboxylates and substituted dinitrobenzenes under oxidative aqueous conditions to afford N-aryl amides is described.

Several studies using GABA supplementation as a mitigatory measure have been published. However, it remains difficult to draw a general conclusion since these studies have been done under different experimental conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the response (growth performances, immune responses, and blood biochemical parameters) of chickens to GABA supplementation under various stressful conditions through a meta-analysis approach. A total of 19 articles published from 2011 to 2020, including 30 treatments, were used. A mixed-model ANOVA was used to assess how the growth parameters varied based on the GABA mode of supplementation. Linear mixed models and general linear models were used to evaluate the effects of the GABA doses and the duration of the supplementation on the growth performances and the immune parameters. Results indicated that supplementation of GABA via drinking water was more effective than dietary supplementation for reducing the feed conversion ratio in heat-stressed birds (P < 0.01). In addition, an increase in the GABA doses resulted in an augmentation (P < 0.01) of the body weight gain while a longer duration of supplementation resulted in increasing (P<0.01) the feed intake. Furthermore, increasing the duration of the supplementation reduced the immunoglobulin (P < 0.0001) and bursa’s relative weight (P < 0.0001), while increasing blood CD8+ count (P < 0.001) and spleen’s relative weight (P < 0.0001). Finally, blood total protein content was increased (P < 0.0001) by a longer duration of supplementation. This study showed that the doses and the duration of the GABA supplementation can affect the growth performances of chickens under stressful conditions. However, the effect of GABA on immune responses and blood parameters is perceived with a relatively longer supplementation duration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3ablood 3abody weight changes 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aimmunoglobulins 3ameta-analysis 3apollution 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3aspleen1 aJeong, Chaemi1 aGupta, Vaishali1 aGoel, Akshat0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 33 p.45019-45028dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13855-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245013000159520132300289592002801612650001601640650001701656650001701673650002501690650001401715650001801729650000901747650001601756650001701772700001401789700001701803700001801820700001701838700001901855773012001874856007801994852000902072655001202081IND60794208420221120223135.0220922e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079420842DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130915872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hanmei 14aThe Complete Mitochondrial Genome of Spirobolus bungii (Diplopoda, Spirobolidae): The First Sequence for the Genus Spirobolus  aMillipedes (Diplopoda) comprise one of the most important groups of large soil arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems; however, their phylogenetic relationships are poorly understood. Herein, the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Spirobolus bungii was sequenced and annotated, which was 14,879 bp in size and included 37 typical mitochondrial genes (13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), and 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs)). Most of the 13 PCGs had ATN (AT/A/T/G) as the start codon except for COX1, which used CGA, and most PCGs ended with the T end codon. By comparing the gene arrangements of the mitogenomes among Diplopoda species, rearrangement occurred between and within orders. In contrast to Narceus annularus, the mitogenome genes of S. bungii had consistent orders but were transcribed in completely opposite directions, which was a novel finding in Spirobolidae. Moreover, the phylogenetic relationships within Diplopoda, which were based on the sequences of 13 PCGs, showed that S. bungii was clustered with N. annularus, followed by Abacion magmun. This indicated that there might be a close relationship between Callipodida and Spirobolida. These results could contribute to further studies on the genetics and evolutionary processes of S. bungii and other Diplopoda species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallipodida 3aSpirobolidae 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3astart codon 3atransfer RNA1 aFang, Yu 1 aCao, Guohua 1 aShen, Caiqin 1 aLiu, Hongyi 1 aRuan, Honghua 0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130915873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01805naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245011200157300001600269520077500285592002801060650001701088650001501105650000901120650001301129650001201142650001901154650001001173650001401183650001401197700001201211700001601223773012701239856008001366852000901446655001201455IND60765405820221120084307.0220419e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076540582DNAL7 a10.17221/69/2010-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLew, M.10aUpper eyelid and medial canthus reconstructive surgery after histiocytoma resection in a dog: a case report  ap. 137-143.  aA six year old crossbred male dog presented with non-pigmented, pale pink, unhaired, ulcerative tumor of the medial canthus and upper eyelid region.

The multiplexed LC-MS/MS assay using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) allows simultaneous quantitation of five molecular species derived from trastuzumab after tryptic digestion: a stable signature peptide (FTISADTSK), a deamidation-sensitive signature peptide (IYPTNGYTR), its deamidated products (IYPTDGYTR and IYPTisoDGYTR), and a succinimide intermediate (IYPTsuccGYTR). Digestion of a 50 μL plasma sample is performed at pH 7 for 3 h at 37 °C, which combines a reasonable (>80%) digestion efficiency with a minimal (<1%) formation of deamidation products during digestion. Rapid in vitro deamidation was observed at higher pH, leading to a (large) overestimation of the concentrations of deamidation products in the original plasma sample. The LC-MS/MS method was validated in accordance with international bioanalytical guidelines over the clinically relevant range of 0.5 to 500 μg/mL with bias and CV values well below 15%. Deamidation of trastuzumab was observed in plasma both in a 56 day in vitro forced degradation study (up to 37% of the total drug concentration) and in samples obtained from breast cancer patients after treatment with the drug for several months (up to 25%). Comparison with a validated ELISA method for trastuzumab showed that deamidation of the drug at the CDR leads to a loss of recognition by the antibodies used in the ELISA assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abiotransformation 3abreast neoplasms 3adeamidation 3adrug therapy 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3apatients 3aquantitative analysis1 aBischoff, Rainer1 aBakker, Hilde1 aGietema, Jourik A.1 avan de Merbel, Nico C.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Feb. 02, v. 88, no. 3 p.1871-1877dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.5b042763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04082naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012500165300001400290520185500304536016202159592002802321596010102349596004402450650002102494650002902515650001502544650002302559650002302582650002002605650002302625650002002648650002602668650002402694650001002718650002802728650001202756650002502768650001402793650002202807650004802829650001802877650001402895650001802909650002602927650002302953653002102976653001102997653001303008653000803021700001803029700001603047700001403063700001303077700001403090700001703104700001903121700001503140700001603155700001903171773011203190856008503302852000903387655001203396IND60682605320221122130411.0200130e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068260532DNAL7 a10.1080/08905436.2019.17111122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Ting10aDirected evolution of the transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis and its enhanced expression in Escherichia coli  ap. 42-61.  aTransglutaminase-catalyzed reactions can be used widely to modify the functional properties of food proteins, biopharmaceuticals and in tissue engineering. Transglutaminase-producing organisms obtained from natural screening have a low ability to produce enzymes, and the obtained enzyme generally has low activity and poor substrate specificity, which limit its industrial applications. Of 100 isolates collected from five air-dried soil samples, 20 exhibited the typical growth characteristics of Actinomycetes. Of these 20 isolates, S-1and S-2 resulted in 0.47 and 0.30 U/mL transglutaminase production, respectively. Based on phenotypic and the 16S rRNA gene-sequence data, the isolate S-1 was confirmed as Streptomyces mobaraensis. We produced Transetta (DE3)/PET-32(a)-YC2 mutants in Escherichia coli exhibiting improved MTGase activity and production from the screened microbial transglutaminase-producing strain by directed evolution of the MTGase gene using epPCR combined with construction and overexpression of the PET-32(a)-YC2. The activity of Transetta (DE3)/pET-32a-YC2 TGase (3.03 U/mL) in E. coli growth supernatant was 1.5 and 1.8-fold above that of the control Transetta (DE3)/pET-32a-MTGase strain (2.02 U/mL) and Transetta (DE3)/pET-32a strain (1.68 U/mL), respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the content of target protein and MTGase activity by the MTGase gene expression in Transetta (DE3)/pET-32a-YC2 (26.2% and 4.99 U/mL) were 2.07 and 1.65-fold greater than control through optimization of different parameters. These results suggest that directed evolution of the MTGase gene from Streptomyces mobaraensis can effectively enhance the MTGase activity and protein expression in E. coli. This method of enhanced expression of active MTGase in E. coli may be valuable for food and other industrial applications.  aThis study was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (Grant No. 2017J01622) and the Sugar Crop Research System (Grant No. CARS-170501).  aPublisher supplied data  a2017J01622cNatural Science Foundation of Fujian Provincedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003392  aCARS-170501cSugar Crop Research System 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces mobaraensis 3aair drying 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acatalytic activity 3adietary protein 3adirected evolution 3aenzyme activity 3afunctional properties 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3amutants 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 3asoil sampling 3asubstrate specificity 3atissue engineering 0aTransglutaminase 0apET32a 0a16S rRNA 0aPCR1 aZheng, Xuehai1 aSu, Xiaomei1 aChen, Duo1 aLiu, Kui1 aYuan, Xue1 aLin, Ronghua1 aHuang, Luqiang1 aHe, Wenjin1 aZhu, Jinmao1 aChen, Youqiang0 tFood biotechnology.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 34, no. 1 p.42-61dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl46326x1532-42497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08905436.2019.17111123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001600192245014500208300001800353506007600371520070100447592002801148506003701176650001701213650001401230650001401244650001301258650001101271650002501282650000901307650002101316650000901337650001401346653000901360653001301369653002101382653001901403653001401422653001301436700001501449700001601464700001501480700001601495700001301511700001401524700002301538700001901561700002001580700001801600700001701618700001701635773015601652856008601808852000901894655001201903IND60539268620221207080821.0190215e20140605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053926862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2014.04.0462doi7 aPMC44862852pmcid7 a248156922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenjuan10aTargeting Nrf2 by dihydro-CDDO-trifluoroethyl amide enhances autophagic clearance and viability of β-cells in a setting of oxidative stress  ap. 2115-2124.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNrf2 appears to be a critical regulator of diabetes in rodents. However, the underlying mechanisms as well as the clinical relevance of the Nrf2 signaling in human diabetes remain to be fully understood. Herein, we report that islet expression of Nrf2 is upregulated at an earlier stage of diabetes in both human and mice. Activation of Nrf2 suppresses oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced β-cell apoptosis while enhancing autophagic clearance in isolated rat islets. Additionally, oxidative stress per se activated autophagy in β-cells. Thus, these results reveal that Nrf2 drives a novel antioxidant independent autophagic clearance for β-cell protection in the setting of diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3adiabetes 3ahumans 3aislets of Langerhans 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aviability 0aNrf2 0aβ-Cells 0aOxidative stress 0aUbiquitination 0aAutophagy 0aDiabetes1 aWu, Weiwei1 aSong, Haibo1 aWang, Fang1 aLi, Huanjie1 aChen, Li1 aLai, Yimu1 aJanicki, Joseph S.1 aWard, Keith W.1 aMeyer, Colin J.1 aWang, Xing Li1 aTang, Dongqi1 aCui, Taixing0 tFEBS letters.g2014 June 05, v. 588, no. 12 p.2115-2124dElsevier B.V.aFederation of European Biochemical SocietieswJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.04.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012900164520160800293592002801901650002301929650001701952650002001969650001001989650001601999650001702015650001502032650001902047650001702066650001102083650001402094650001402108700001702122700002202139700001802161700002002179700002202199700002202221700001702243700001802260700001802278700002202296700002102318700002202339700002502361700002302386773012002409856007802529852000902607655001202616IND60794208620221120212028.0220922e20220904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079420862DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130915892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTozaki, Teruaki 10aDetection of Indiscriminate Genetic Manipulation in Thoroughbred Racehorses by Targeted Resequencing for Gene-Doping Control  aThe creation of genetically modified horses is prohibited in horse racing as it falls under the banner of gene doping. In this study, we developed a test to detect gene editing based on amplicon sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS). We designed 1012 amplicons to target 52 genes (481 exons) and 147 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). NGS analyses showed that 97.7% of the targeted exons were sequenced to sufficient coverage (depth > 50) for calling variants. The targets of artificial editing were defined as homozygous alternative (HomoALT) and compound heterozygous alternative (ALT1/ALT2) insertion/deletion (INDEL) mutations in this study. Four models of gene editing (three homoALT with 1-bp insertions, one REF/ALT with 77-bp deletion) were constructed by editing the myostatin gene in horse fibroblasts using CRISPR/Cas9. The edited cells and 101 samples from thoroughbred horses were screened using the developed test, which was capable of identifying the three homoALT cells containing 1-bp insertions. Furthermore, 147 SNVs were investigated for their utility in confirming biological parentage. Of these, 120 SNVs were amenable to consistent and accurate genotyping. Surrogate (nonbiological) dams were excluded by 9.8 SNVs on average, indicating that the 120 SNV could be used to detect foals that have been produced by somatic cloning or embryo transfer, two practices that are prohibited in thoroughbred racing and breeding. These results indicate that gene-editing tests that include variant calling and SNV genotyping are useful to identify genetically modified racehorses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aThoroughbred 3aembryo transfer 3aexons 3afibroblasts 3agene editing 3agenotyping 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ahorses 3amyostatin 3aparentage1 aOhnuma, Aoi 1 aNakamura, Kotono 1 aHano, Kazuki 1 aTakasu, Masaki 1 aTakahashi, Yūji,1 aTamura, Norihisa 1 aSato, Fumio 1 aShimizu, Kyo 1 aKikuchi, Mio 1 aIshige, Taichiro 1 aKakoi, Hironaga 1 aHirota, Kei-ichi 1 aHamilton, Natasha A.1 aNagata, Shun-ichi 0 tGenes.g2022 Sept. 04, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130915893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245020200174300001600376520075100392592002801143650001301171650002401184650001101208650003201219650001101251650001501262650001201277650001601289653001601305653001301321653001201334653001001346653001501356700001501371700001501386700001701401700001501418773013701433856008201570852000901652655001201661IND60622111820221117170450.0181123e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062211182DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013298004006072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Anaya, M.A.10aEffects of the combination of starters and enzymes in regu lating bread quality and shelf life Effectos de la combinación de iniciadores microbianos y enzimas en la calidad y conservación del pan  ap. 425-435.  aThe influence of commercial enzymes and starters on white wheat bread quality and keeping proper ties (microbial and physical shelf life) has been studied.

The combination of enzymes and starter resulted in beneficial effects greater than those obtained when each technological aid was used in a single way. The effect was mostly stressed when low grade wheat flour was used; in this case, specifically designated combinations facilitated loaves of improved volume and shape, and a crumb texture with initial values and rate of staling close to those found with a high quality flour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylases 3abreadmaking quality 3abreads 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aloaves 3ashelf life 3atexture 3awheat flour 0awheat flour 0astarters 0aenzymes 0abread 0ashelf life1 aDevesa, A.1 aAndreu, P.1 aEscrivá, C.1 aCollar, C.0 tFood science and technology international.g1998 Dec., v. 4, no. 6 p.425-435dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013298004006073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006500155245014400220520107600364592002801440650001601468650002301484650002001507650001801527650002601545650002101571650000901592650001501601653002101616653004001637653002901677653001701706700006201723700001801785700001801803700001501821700002001836700002401856700001701880700006001897773009201957856009002049852000902139655001202148IND60644331520221122232951.0190725e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064433152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Clement Matthew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5464-479010aUnderstanding the effect of copolymer content on the processability and mechanical properties of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)/wood composites  aThe present study investigates the effects of copolymer composition on the mechanical properties of extruded mixed culture poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB4HB) copolymers and their composites with 50 wt% wood flour. The use of copolymers with a higher strain at break (i.e. 24 mol% 3-HV and 15 mol% 4-HB copolymers) for composite production resulted in a slight but promising improvement in strain at break at the cost of lower strength and modulus. The inclusion of 4-HB comonomer was more effective at improving the strain at break of the composites than for the 3-HV comonomer due to the inability of the 4-HB monomer unit to co-crystallise. However, unlike for the tensile properties, the matrix properties did not affect the composite impact strength. It is interpreted that the mechanical properties of the PHA-based WPCs with 50 wt% wood content are dominated by the rigid and brittle wood flour, with the matrix properties having limited influence on the bulk composite properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrittleness 3acomposite polymers 3aimpact strength 3amixed culture 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3atensile strength 3awood 3awood flour 0aA.

This study compared the global warming impact (GWI) and FFD of a shrub willow evapotranspiration (ET), conventional clay, and geosynthetic cover using life cycle assessment (LCA). The willow ET cover is a carbon-negative system with a total GWI of −13,206 kgCO₂ₑq ha⁻¹ over 30 years, while the GWI of clay (194,916 kgCO₂ₑq ha⁻¹) and geosynthetic covers (260,212 kgCO₂ₑq ha⁻¹) were substantial. Willow’s ability to store carbon in coarse roots and stools creates the opportunity for negative carbon emissions. The FFD impact of the willow ET cover (75,303 MJ surplus ha⁻¹) is 4.7 times lower than the clay cover and 7.7 times lower than the geosynthetic cover. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicated that the GWI of the willow ET cover was less than zero for all scenarios, and the GWI and FFD of the geosynthetic cover were the highest. Willow ET covers can protect human health and the environment, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon, and provide a source of wood chips that could be used for renewable energy or other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclay 3aevapotranspiration 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gases 3ahuman health 3alandfills 3alife cycle assessment 3apollution 3aresearch 3ashrubs 3auncertainty 3awood 3aNew York1 aVolk, Timothy A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6969-92811 aTherasme, Obste0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 33 p.45029-45040dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13901-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245007300173300001400246520163500260592002801895650001101923650002001934650001301954650002401967650002101991650001602012650001902028650003002047650002702077650001902104650001302123651001202136653001602148653002802164653001402192653001002206653001002216653000902226700001602235700002302251773010402274856008702378852000902465655001202474IND60525912720221118041812.0190401e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052591272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyen, K.

Thermal tolerance of diverse organisms often varies predictably with latitude, with upper thermal limits changing little and lower thermal limits decreasing with latitude. Despite similarly steep gradients in environmental temperatures across altitude, few studies have investigated altitudinal variation in critical thermal limits. We estimated critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and recovery temperature (Trec) by tracking righting response of three bumble bee species during thermal ramps: Bombus huntii collected from 2180m asl, and Bombus bifarius and Bombus sylvicola collected from 3290m asl in Wyoming, USA. Overall, larger bees could tolerate more extreme temperatures, likely due to a thermal inertia driven lag between core body temperatures and air temperatures. Despite their smaller size, high altitude bumble bees tolerated colder air temperatures: they had ~1°C lower CTmin and recovered from cold exposure at ~3–4°C lower air temperatures. Conversely, low altitude bees tolerated ~5°C hotter air temperatures. These altitudinal differences in thermal tolerance parallel differences in average daily minimum (1.2°C) and maximum (7.5°C) temperatures between these sites. These results provide one of the few measurements of organism thermal tolerance across altitude and the first evidence for geographical differences in tolerance of temperature extremes in heterothermic bumble bees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombus 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3ageographical distribution 3ageographical variation 3aheat tolerance 3alatitude 3aWyoming 0aBumble bees 0aCritical thermal limits 0aElevation 0aCTmin 0aCTmax 0aTrec1 aGiri, Susma1 aDillon, Michael E.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2016 July, v. 59 p.52-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.04.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01481naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245007500166300001800241500001900259520031400278592002800592650001200620650002100632650002200653700001500675700002000690700001800710700001900728700005700747700005800804700005600862773012100918856008301039852000901122655001201131IND60719716220221120094051.0201204e20201123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071971622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c037302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Chenyun10aInternal Alkyne-Directed Fluorination of Unactivated C(sp³)–H Bonds  ap. 9398-9403.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA silver-mediated internal alkyne-guided fluorination of unactivated C(sp³)–H bonds is described.

However, little information is available on the efficiency of nutrient application and use by trees. Therefore, this work verified the effects of soil and foliar applications of boron in a commercial citrus orchard. An experiment was conducted with fertigated 4-year-old ‘Valencia’ sweet orange trees on ‘Swingle’ citrumelo rootstock. Boron (isotopically-enriched ¹⁰B) was supplied to trees once or twice in the growing season, either dripped in the soil or sprayed on the leaves. Trees were sampled at different periods and separated into different parts for total B contents and ¹⁰B/¹¹B isotope ratios analyses. Soil B applied via fertigation was more efficient than foliar application for the organs grown after the B fertilization. Recovery of labeled B by fruits was 21% for fertigation and 7% for foliar application. Residual effects of nutrient application in the grove were observed in the year after labeled fertilizer application, which greater proportions derived from the soil supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aboron 3afertigation 3afoliar application 3afruit growing 3afruits 3agrowing season 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3aoranges 3aresidual effects 3arootstocks 3atrees 3atropical soils 0asweet orange 0aisotope technique 0afertigation 0afoliar spray 0aplant nutrition1 aQuaggio, José Antônio1 aMattos, Dirceu1 aMuraoka, Takashi1 aBoaretto, Antonio Enedi0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 34, no. 6 p.839-849dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2011.544353  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245013300171300001600304520121100320592002801531650001801559650002101577650001801598650002401616650001701640650001201657650001901669650001301688650001501701650001701716650002101733650002201754650002101776653002301797653003201820653002301852653002201875700005801897700001901955700001701974700001601991700001602007700001502023700001602038773009102054856009002145852000902235655001202244IND60644331820221122223141.0190606e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064433182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Junya10aCoupling hybrid of BN nanosheets and carbon nanotubes to enhance the mechanical and tribological properties of fabric composites  ap. 132-140.  aHerein, composites of boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) and carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with different compositions are prepared for the first time by covalent crosslinking using the carbodiimide reaction. The microstructure, functional groups, and phase composition of obtained BN1−xCx (x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75) hybrid nanosheets are characterized by a variety of spectroscopic techniques and thermal analysis. Tensile and thermogravimetric testing results show that the fabric composites filled with BN1−xCx hybrid nanosheets display remarkable enhancement in tensile strength and thermal stability, superior than that of pure fabric composites and composites reinforced by BNNSs and CNTs alone, thanks to the synergetic coupled effect between BN nanosheets and CNTs, as well as improved interface interaction between BN1−xCx and resin matrix. Thereinto, the BN0.5C0.5 with uniformly distributed CNTs and BN ultrathin nanosheets especially exhibits satisfactory performance. Furthermore, the BN0.5C0.5/fabric composites also manifest prominent anti-wear and friction-reduction characteristics attributed to the load-carrying capacity of CNTs and self-lubricating effect of BN nanosheets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylation 3acomposite materials 3acrosslinking 3afabrics 3amicrostructure 3amoieties 3ananosheets 3aspectroscopy 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aPolymer composites 0aBN1−xCx hybrid nanosheets 0aSynergistic effect 0aFriction and wear1 aZhang, Zhaozhu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1247-03711 aYang, Mingming1 aWu, Liangfei1 aLi, Peilong1 aGuo, Fang.,1 aMen, Xuehu1 aLiu, Weimin0 tComposites.g2019 Aug., v. 123 p.132-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2019.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245023800166300001600404520109200420592002801512650003501540650002101575650000901596650001901605650001501624650002401639653002301663653001301686653002601699653001101725653001701736700001801753700002101771700001601792700001801808773013701826856008201963852000902045655001202054IND60622112020221117170513.0181123e199812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062211202DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013298004006092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeriago, P.M.10aNote.

Ex perimental data obtained after isothermal heating were analyzed using a two-step linear regression procedure and a one-step nonlinear regression method. Results obtained using both analytical tech niques were close, but the 90% interval of confidence for predictions was lower when the one-step nonlinear regression was used. These results indicated the convenience of using the one-step nonlin ear regression method to obtain thermal kinetic parameters for bacterial spores. Also, the parameters obtained by a non-isothermal program followed by an isothermal heating period were similar to those obtained after isothermal heating. Nevertheless, the joint confidence regions at 90% did not overlap, indicating that there are significant differences. The z values obtained under isothermal (7.0 °C) and non-isothermal (8.5 °C) conditions are close and characteristic for this microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3abacterial spores 3aheat 3amicroorganisms 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 0athermobacteriology 0akinetics 0aB. stearothermophilus 0aspores 0ainactivation1 aLeontidis, S.1 aFernández, P.S.1 aRodrigo, C.1 aMartinez, A.,0 tFood science and technology international.g1998 Dec., v. 4, no. 6 p.443-447dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013298004006093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245010000205300001800305520174400323592002802067650001302095650001102108650001902119650001302138650001302151650000902164650002302173700002702196700002102223700002502244700001502269773013502284856008002419852000902499655001202508IND60606114420180918000000.0180724e20180212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060611442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b006082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAramburu, J.

Many interesting properties of these materials rest on the strong correlation between electronic structure and local geometry. As up to now no reliable information on the pressure dependence of Cu²⁺–X– distances (X = Cl, F) has been reported, we have derived it from first-principles calculations on several representative hybrid and inorganic Cu²⁺-layered compounds. As a salient feature, we find that in all cases the out-of-plane Cu²⁺–X– distance is nearly insensitive to pressure, contrary to what is found for the short and long in-plane distances. These results thus disprove the widely assumed idea that the local structure arises from a Jahn–Teller effect involving a principal axis in the layer plane. By contrast, the present work demonstrates that the ground state and the local geometry are governed by two main factors. On one hand, the axial internal electric field, due to the rest of the lattice ions, which favors placing the hole of the CuX₆⁴– unit in the 3z²-r² level. On the other hand, the existence of an additional orthorhombic instability in the layer plane that nevertheless preserves the dominant 3z²-r² character, in agreement with experimental data of pure and doped Cu²⁺-layered compounds. This instability is favored in pure compounds by a cooperative mechanism that is also discussed. The present calculations on these systems under pressure show that a slightly elongated CuX₆⁴– unit can also have the hole in the axial 3z²-r² level, an unexpected situation that can only be explained with the introduction of the often ignored internal electric field.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorine 3acopper 3aelectric field 3afluorine 3ageometry 3aions 3aphysical chemistry1 aGarcía-Fernández, P.1 aMathiesen, N.

Degradation indicators calculated from process measurements need to be approximated with degradation models that smooth the variations in the measurements and give predictions of future values of the indicator. Existing models for performance degradation assume that the performance monotonically decreases with time. In consequence, the models yield suboptimal performance in performance-based maintenance as they do not take into account that performance degradation can reverse itself. For instance, deposits on the blades of a turbomachine can be self-cleaning in some conditions. In this study, a data-driven algorithm is proposed that detects if the performance degradation indicator is increasing or decreasing and adapts the model accordingly. A moving window approach is combined with adaptive regression analysis of operating data to predict the expected value of the performance degradation indicator and to quantify the uncertainty of predictions. The algorithm is tested on industrial performance degradation data from two independent offshore applications, and compared with four other approaches. The parameters of the algorithm are discussed and recommendations on the optimal choices are made.

Interwoven Sb/TiO₂ can be readily activated and can also buffer drastic volumetric variations during storage of alkaline ions (e.g. Li⁺, Na⁺), thereby demonstrating high capacity and superior cycling ability in rechargeable batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3abatteries 3achemical reactions 3aions 3alithium 3asodium 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide1 aCheng, Yong1 aSun, Qujiang1 aSun, Lianshan1 aWang, Chunli1 aWang, Xuxu1 aYin, Dongming1 aWang, Limin1 aMing, Jun0 tChemical communications.g2018 Apr. 17, v. 54, no. 32 p.4049-4052dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc01279b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245017200158300002000330520135100350592002801701650000801729650001001737650002001747650001701767650002201784650002301806650001601829700001501845700001201860700001601872700001601888700001501904700001601919700001901935700005201954773013802006856008002144852000902224655001202233IND60747858920221122115417.0210820e20210809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074785892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c048902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Pu10aTheoretical Calculation of Bond Energy, Self-Reduction Phenomenon, and Photoluminescence Properties of Eu/Ce Single-Doped and Codoped Ba₂CaB₂Si₄O₁₄ Phosphors  ap. 17820-17830.  aThe self-reduction of Eu³⁺ to Eu²⁺ and Ce⁴⁺ to Ce³⁺ can first be found by doping rare earth ions RE (RE = Eu, Ce) in Ba₂CaB₂Si₄O₁₄ (BCBSO). The Eu²⁺/Eu³⁺ codoped BCBSO and Ce⁴⁺/Ce³⁺ codoped BCBSO and Eu/Ce codoped BCBSO were synthesized by a high-temperature solid-phase method in air and reducing atmospheres, respectively. By comparing the photoluminescence spectra in air and reducing atmospheres, the self-reduction phenomenon of Eu³⁺ and Ce⁴⁺ in the BCBSO were verified adequately. The theoretical method of the bond energy was used to analyze the occupancy and self-reduction of Eu or Ce ions. The experimental results are in agreement with the theoretical ones. The color tuning phosphors were achieved in BCBSO:Eu and BCBSO:Ce. The codoped system BCBSO:Eu, Ce was studied and it was found that the position and shape of the emission spectra changed with the change in the excitation wavelength, and the change in the corresponding color could be seen from the CIE chromaticity coordinates. Its emission peak shifts from 481 to 595 nm with the increase in the Ce³⁺ concentration in the codoped system under the excitation of 365 nm. Based on the fluorescence lifetime, the energy transfer process between Eu²⁺–Ce³⁺ is proved, and its emission color can be adjusted to a certain extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acolor 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3awavelengths1 aXu, Zefeng1 aLuo, Qi1 aHe, Zongjie1 aChen, Yuhui1 aMiao, Qiqi1 aHuang, Cong1 aLiu, Xiaoguang1 aLi, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3027-58280 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 09, v. 125, no. 32 p.17820-17830dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c048903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245013000162300001800292500001900310520145300329592002801782650001101810650001701821650002301838650002201861700001301883700001901896700005601915773013501971856008002106852000902186655001202195IND60724317120221118091747.0210121e20210112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072431712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c095822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Taiping10aOrigin of High-Efficiency Near-Infrared Organic Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence: The Role of Electronic Polarization  ap. 1249-1255.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo unveil the underlying mechanisms of high-efficiency near-infrared (NIR) organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), we investigated the transition natures of the low-lying excited states for two donor–acceptor structured TADF emitters (TPAAP and TPAAQ) with the best external quantum efficiencies among NIR organic light-emitting diodes by self-consistent quantum mechanics/embedded charge (QM/EC) calculations. The results show that both the first excited singlet (S₁) and triplet (T₁) states of the two emitters are characteristics of hybridized charge transfer (CT) and local excitation but with distinct proportions, thus ensuring both sufficient oscillator strengths for S₁ and considerable spin–orbit couplings between S₁ and T₁. Particularly, owing to a stronger CT component, the S₁ energy is more stabilized by electronic polarization than T₁, leading to a much reduced S₁ excitation energy and small energy difference between S₁ and T₁ in the solid phase. Moreover, the calculations on the J-dimers point out that the intramolecular excited states of the dimers correspond well to the monomer states, and the lowest intermolecular CT states are very close to the monomer S₁ states in the solid phase. These results indicate that electronic polarization will play a crucial role in simultaneously achieving fast fluorescence radiation and reverse intersystem crossing for high-efficiency NIR TADF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aquantum mechanics1 aTu, Zeyi1 aHan, Guangchao1 aYi, Yuanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0052-93640 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Jan. 12, v. 125, no. 2 p.1249-1255dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c095823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245013900202300001600341500002000357520151100377592002801888596003201916596005101948650001701999650001502016650001102031650001202042650003102054650001502085650001102100650000702111650001202118650001302130650001202143650001102155700005802166700006002224700006302284700006302347773012902410856007702539852000902616655001202625IND60789665120221116174025.0220822e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078966512DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0128462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriggs, Ellen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0202-862410aPhysical and Biological Drivers of Biogeochemical Tracers Within the Seasonal Sea Ice Zone of the Southern Ocean From Profiling Floats  ap. 746-758.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHere we present initial findings from nine profiling floats equipped with pH, O₂, NO3–, and other biogeochemical sensors that were deployed in the seasonal ice zone (SIZ) of the Southern Ocean in 2014 and 2015 through the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modelling (SOCCOM) project. A large springtime phytoplankton bloom was observed that coincided with sea ice melt for all nine floats. We argue this bloom results from a shoaling of the mixed layer depth, increased vertical stability, and enhanced nutrient and light availability as the sea ice melts. This interpretation is supported by the absence of a springtime bloom when one of the floats left the SIZ in the second year of observations. During the sea ice covered period, net heterotrophic conditions were observed. The rate of uptake of O₂ and release of dissolved inorganic carbon (derived from pH and estimated total alkalinity) and NO3– is reminiscent of biological respiration and is nearly Redfieldian for the nine floats. A simple model of mixed layer physics was developed to separate the physical and biological components of the signal in pH and O₂ over one annual cycle for a float in the Ross Sea SIZ. The resulting annual net community production suggests that seasonal respiration during the ice covered period of the year nearly balances the production in the euphotic layer of up to 5 mol C m⁻² during the ice free period leading to a net of near zero carbon exported to depth for this one float.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundation  aNSF PLR −1425989cDivision of Polar Programs 3aalgal blooms 3aalkalinity 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3ageophysics 3amodels 3apH 3aphysics 3aresearch 3asea ice 3aspring1 aMartz, Todd R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1996-71451 aTalley, Lynne D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1574-729X1 aMazloff, Matthew R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1650-58501 aJohnson, Kenneth S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5513-55840 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Feb., v. 123, no. 2 p.746-758dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0128463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017300166500002200339520110900361592002801470650001601498650002701514650001001541650001901551650001301570650001701583650002401600653000901624653001401633653001001647653001201657700001601669700001601685700001501701700001601716700001801732773010201750856004901852852000901901655001201910IND60795338320221120133738.0221004e20220929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079533832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuendia, A.J.10aEvaluation of a commercial double-recognition ELISA for caprine tuberculosis diagnosis: Sensitivity, specificity, and correlation to macroscopic and microscopic lesions  aPre-press version  aAnte-mortem diagnosis of caprine tuberculosis, as in other ruminant species, is a complex process. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to apply a combination of methods that increases the sensitivity of diagnosis while maintaining adequate specificity. In the present study, we analysed the use of ELISA based on a double-recognition methodology for the diagnosis of goat tuberculosis. Serum samples from animals with tuberculosis, confirmed by histopathological studies and presence of Ziehl-Neelsen-positive bacteria in the lesions, were used to assess sensitivity. Sera from flocks without tuberculosis were used to assess diagnostic specificity. The relationship between ELISA results and the type of tuberculous lesions, both macroscopic and microscopic, was analysed. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA test were 69.9% and 97.9%, respectively. Sensitivity was higher in animals with macroscopic lesions, indicating more advanced forms of the disease. Similarly, a higher sensitivity was found in animals with microscopic lesions associated with active tuberculosis, such as cavitary lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3adiagnostic specificity 3agoats 3ahistopathology 3aresearch 3atuberculosis 3aveterinary medicine 0aGoat 0aDiagnosis 0aELISA 0aLesions1 aSanchez, J.1 aSalinas, J.1 aOrtega, N.1 aDel Rio, L.1 aNavarro, J.A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2022 Sept. 29, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2022.09.034  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245010700214520184300321592002802164650001702192650001102209650001502220650001102235650002402246650000902270653003102279653002902310653002102339653002502360653002702385700001702412700006602429773009802495856008702593852000902680655001202689IND60695412020221119022631.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1149382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchholz, Stefanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3546-817810aSensitivity analysis of time aggregation techniques applied to capacity expansion energy system models  aTime aggregation techniques have shown great potential for efficiently solving comprehensive energy system models. Numerous studies document significant solution time reductions while maintaining high solution qualities. However, most of these studies lack providing guidelines for which aggregation techniques to use in a given setup, and why. A recent interest of comparing different aggregation techniques has arisen, and this paper contributes to that trend. We present a sensitivity analysis methodology that studies how different problem changes, influence the aggregation technique performances. The performance is measured as the ability of the aggregated problem to fully or partially replicate the solution achieved by the non-aggregated problem. The applicability of the methodology is illustrated through a case study considering three types of problem changes namely changes in the wind availability, changes in the aggregated problem size, and changes in the energy system design. By applying the suggested methodology to ten different aggregation techniques, key properties which seem to ensure promising performance are identified.Results show that, independently of the sensitivity measure applied, aggregations based on grouping strategies and day selections lead to better and more consistent performance and to the largest improvements in solution times. Strong and very consistent performance is also observed for the Optimized criteria Selection which furthermore outperforms any other technique in scenarios closely replicating real life applications. Contrarily, the Residual Load Duration Curve (RLDC) Selection consistently shows the worst performance which might be related to its configuration of constructing time elements from the selection of hours causing important within day/week chronologies to be lost.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3amodels 3asystems engineering 3awind 0aCapacity expansion problem 0aSolution time reductions 0aTime aggregation 0aSensitivity analysis 0aPerformance comparison1 aGamst, Mette1 aPisinger, D.q(David),1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7695-96620 tApplied energy.g2020 July 01, v. 269 p.114938-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1149383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015500153300002000308520180900328592002802137650002102165650004402186650002602230650002202256650001502278650001502293650002902308650002402337650003702361650001502398650001302413650001202426650001102438650000702449650001302456650002302469650001202492650001302504700001502517700001402532700001902546773012402565856007502689852000902764655001202773IND60778927420221120081318.0220603e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077892742DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01651f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Zhao10aIon-imprinted guanidine-functionalized zeolite molecular sieves enhance the adsorption selectivity and antibacterial properties for uranium extraction  ap. 15470-15478.  aThe important properties in the development of adsorbents for uranium extraction from seawater include specific selectivity to uranium ions and anti-biofouling ability in the ocean environment. In this paper, we report a novel strategy for efficient selective extraction of uranium from aqueous solutions and good anti-bacterial properties by surface ion-imprinted zeolite molecular sieves. Guanidine-modified zeolite molecular sieves 13X (ZMS-G) were synthesized and used as the support for the preparation of uranium(vi) ion-imprinted adsorbents (IIZMS-G) by ligands with phosphonic groups. The prepared IIZMS-G adsorbent was characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results showed that guanidine groups have been successfully introduced onto the support while its morphology structure was maintained. The adsorption performance and selectivity to U(vi) ions, antibacterial property, and reusability of IIZMS-G were evaluated. The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity reached 141.09 mg g⁻¹ when the initial concentration of metal ions was 50 mg L⁻¹ at pH 6 and 20 °C. The adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The IIZMS-G exhibits an efficient selective adsorption of U(vi) ions from aqueous solutions with competing ions. In addition, the IIZMS-G exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and the inhibitory rate was 99.99% and 98.96% respectively. These results suggest that the prepared IIZMS-G adsorbent may promote the development strategy of novel high selectivity and antifouling adsorbents for uranium recovery from seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aguanidines 3akinetics 3aligands 3amodels 3apH 3aseawater 3asorption isotherms 3auranium 3azeolites1 aJunwen, Li1 aSijin, Wu1 aHaiming, Cheng0 tRSC advances.g2022 May 20, v. 12, no. 24 p.15470-15478dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra01651f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011600157300001600273500001100289520224600300592002802546650001402574650002502588650002002613650001802633650001702651650002102668650002802689650001102717650001502728650001702743650001702760650001102777650001802788650001502806650001502821773013102836856007302967852000903040655001203049IND60587390120221120171711.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739012DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.127402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmerón, I.10aFermented cereal beverages: from probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic towards Nanoscience designed healthy drinks  ap. 114-124.  aREVIEW  aThe consumption of fermented foods by human kind goes a long way back in history and there are as many types of fermented food as civilizations. Food Science and Technology has progressed from designing nutritional foods towards food with health improvement characteristics such as functional foods. In this sense, the area of food with properties to improve gastrointestinal health such as probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics has been the most important segment within functional foods. Most of these products are dairy‐based so the development of nondairy gut improvement products has been of great interest for the food industry, resulting in the rise of cereal‐based probiotic and synbiotic products. Finally, through Nanoscience and the application of Nanotechnology techniques in the food sector, it has been possible to design fermented beverages with synbiotic properties, and the incorporation of nanoparticles with unique and specific bioactivity, which has opened a new horizon in this segment of food created to improve human health and well‐being. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: There is currently a great interest in producing healthy food in particular that which has an impact in improving the gastrointestinal health such as probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Most of these functional foods are dairy based and have been greatly accepted worldwide. Nevertheless, there has been a need for the development of nondairy probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic products. This has encouraged food scientists to study the feasibility of applying other fermenting substrates such as cereals for the development of innovative nondairy fermented functional foods. Therefore, in this review we have addressed the significance of applying cereals and their fractions for the development of probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic beverages. Furthermore, we have presented the importance of including nanoscience and nanotechnology techniques for the creation of fermented cereal beverages that contain specific bioactive nanoparticles. Thus, this work provides the guidelines to promote the development of novel nano‐designed fermented cereal beverages that could significantly have an impact on the health of the consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abioactive properties 3afermented foods 3afood industry 3afood science 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal system 3agrains 3aguidelines 3ahealthy diet 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ananoparticles 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2017 Aug., v. 65, no. 2 p.114-124dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.127403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245006200177520162200239592002801861650001901889650001601908650001701924650000901941650001101950650001701961650001201978650001601990650001302006653002902019653002902048653002702077653003802104653004302142700001702185700002102202773009802223856008702321852000902408655001202417IND60695412320221119022423.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1149502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunniyoor, Vijayaraj10aValue of closed-cycle gas turbines with design assessment  aCurrently, there is considerable interest in the design and development of closed-cycle gas turbines to exploit its various advantages like heat source adaptability, fuel flexibility, compactness, etc. In the current context of depleting fossil fuels, there is an inevitable need to make use of renewable energy sources like solar energy. A detailed review of closed-cycle gas turbines is carried out in this paper. Three research gaps have been identified on closed-cycle gas turbines and are addressed. A thermodynamic analysis of a recuperated closed Brayton cycle with and without intercooling has been carried out with different working fluids to study their effect on cycle efficiency and net specific power. The analysis shows that supercritical carbon dioxide gives considerably higher efficiencies at mild turbine inlet temperatures of 400–700 °C. Helium can be considered at higher temperatures. The main objective of the current study is to survey closed-cycle gas turbine designs from literature and bring those designs with multiple fluids on to one platform: in the form of two unique charts which can be used as turbomachinery design assessment tools for different closed-cycle gas turbine working fluids. Enthalpy-mass flow rate-diameter chart is created for the compressors and turbines, clearly showing the zones of various working fluids at a glance. The specific speed and specific diameter values are calculated for the turbomachinery designs of different working fluids, and the selected values are superimposed on the Balje’s specific speed- specific diameter charts to see their regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acompressors 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3ahelium 3asolar energy 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aturbines 0aClosed cycle gas turbine 0aDifferent working fluids 0aThermodynamic analysis 0aEnthalpy-mass flow-diameter chart 0aSpecific speed-specific diameter chart1 aSingh, Punit1 aNadella, Karthik0 tApplied energy.g2020 July 01, v. 269 p.114950-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1149503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002400147245011300171500001500284520161900299592002801918650002901946650002601975650002102001650001202022650001802034650001502052650002002067650002302087650001402110650001602124650001402140650002302154650003102177650001802208651001202226653001802238700002202256700002002278773011702298852000902415856008402424655001202508IND4380607120221118063423.0181130s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438060712DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-2005-1129-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeletti, Michael J.10aIntegrated Management of Angular Leaf Spot (Phaeoisariopsis griseola (Sacc.) Ferr.) on Snap Beans in Ontario  a2019-12-06  aAngular leaf spot (ALS) caused by the fungus Phaeoisariopsis griseola (Sacc.) Ferr. was first observed and confirmed on snap beans growing in three commercial fields in southern Ontario during the 2000 growing season. The potential impact of this disease on the bean industry in Ontario is not known but this disease is severe in many other regions. The objective of this study was to develop a disease management strategy for ALS in Ontario by investigating the survival of P. griseola in Ontario, and assessing the influence of bean varieties and fungicides on disease development. P. griseola survived at least one winter on crop debris in Ontario and survived better on the soil surface in comparison to burial in soil at depths of 5 or 25 cm. Fifteen snap bean varieties were compared for susceptibility to ALS in a growth room, and nine varieties were compared in a naturally-infested field from 2001-2003. Most varieties reacted similarly to P. griseola in both environments. For example, the varieties Carlo, Storm, and Bush Blue Lake 47 were least susceptible whereas Gold Rush was most susceptible in field and growth room experiments. Boscalid, pyraclostrobin, pyramethanil, vinclozolin, and thiophanate-methyl were tested for effectiveness in managing ALS under field conditions. Overall, pyraclostrobin was most effective. Results indicate that an effective disease management strategy for ALS in snap bean in Ontario should include burying infested plant debris through deep plowing, crop rotation for two years, growing the least susceptible varieties, and applying a registered effective fungicide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeoisariopsis griseola 3apesticide application 3acultural control 3aplowing 3acrop residues 3afungicides 3adisease control 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aleaf spot 3agreen beans 3avarieties 3adisease resistance 3aintegrated pest management 3acrop rotation 3aOntario 0aleaf spotting1 aMelzer, Melody S.1 aBoland, Greg J.0 tPlant health progress.g2005, v. 6, no. 1dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:6160x1535-10257nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHP-2005-1129-01-RS3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01394naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159300001800261520039400279592002800673650002300701650001700724650001700741650001100758650001600769700001900785700001300804700001700817700001700834773013400851856007400985852000901059655001201068IND60617487020221119021359.0181025e20180419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061748702DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01293h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wen-Jin10aBright violet-to-aqua-emitting cadmium-free Ag-doped Zn–Ga–S quantum dots with high stability  ap. 4176-4179.  aHerein, we report a new series of ultra-stable Cd-free Ag:Zn–Ga–S/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with an overall short emission wavelength tunable from 370 to 540 nm via a facile one-pot non-injection method.

To understand the mechanisms involved in these changes, this research characterized the dynamics of the loss and emergence of volatile compounds during cashew apple juice concentration, reporting their impact on beverage sensory quality. Fresh cashew apple juice (10.3°Brix) was concentrated in a thermal-siphon type evaporator operating in a closed system. Five samples were taken throughout the concentration process with the following soluble solids contents: 11.8°Brix, 14.9°Brix, 20.2°Brix, 29.6°Brix and 42.1°Brix. Trained judges rated the aroma note intensities, described as “fresh cashew apple” and “cooked” as perceived in the fresh and concentrated beverages. The headspace volatiles of the six samples were identified and quantified by GC–MS. The results indicated the esters as the major component in the fresh juice (226.46μgkg−1) representing 45.0% of the total mass of volatiles, followed by the terpenes (118.98μgkg−1), acids (45.23μgkg−1), aldehydes (39.10μgkg−1), alcohols (18.91μgkg−1), lactones (19.15μgkg−1), hydrocarbons (18.02μgkg−1) and ketones (11.05μgkg−1). Predictive statistical models (R2>0.956, p≤0.002) revealed that on reaching 14.9°Brix, the ester concentration declined more than 90%, the terpene content almost 100%, alcohols 85%, aldehydes 80% and hydrocarbons 90%. At 14.9°Brix, the intensity of “fresh cashew apple” aroma still predominated in the juice, but the panelists detected the presence of a weak “cooked” aroma. Concentration of the beverage to 20.2°Brix or above expressively increased the cooked aroma intensity and the concentration of hydrocarbons, alcohols and some aldehydes usually associated with off-flavors such as pentanal and decanal. This raises the possibility that some of these compounds might have been formed during juice processing. Juice with better sensory quality could possibly be obtained by concentrating the beverage to levels below 20.2°Brix, recovering the esters that evaporated off the juice until ~15°Brix is reached, and re-adding them to the juice concentrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aterpenoids 3avolatile compounds 3ajuices 3aconsumer acceptance 3alactones 3aoff flavors 3atotal soluble solids 3aAnacardium occidentale 3aheadspace analysis 3aacids 3aaldehydes 3acashew fruit 3astatistical models 3aodors 3aalcohols 3abeverages 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aDynamic headspace 0aesters 0aConcentrated juice 0aCashew apple 0aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry 0aAroma1 aSampaio, Karina de Lemos1 aMarques, Emanuel José Nascimento1 ada Silva, Maria Aparecida Azevedo Pereira0 tFood research international.g2015 Mar., v. 69 p.224-234dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245009800182300001600280520077300296592002801069650001301097650001801110650000901128650001501137650002001152700002201172700002101194773008201215856008901297852000901386655001201395IND60095872320221119155748.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009587232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawpan, Moyeenuddin A.10aFlexural properties of hemp fibre reinforced polylactide and unsaturated polyester composites  ap. 519-526.  aIn this work, flexural strength and flexural modulus of chemically treated random short and aligned long hemp fibre reinforced polylactide and unsaturated polyester composites were investigated over a range of fibre content (0–50wt%). Flexural strength of the composites was found to decrease with increased fibre content; however, flexural modulus increased with increased fibre content. The reason for this decrease in flexural strength was found to be due to fibre defects (i.e. kinks) which could induce stress concentration points in the composites during flexural test, accordingly flexural strength decreased. Alkali and silane fibre treatments were found to improve flexural strength and flexural modulus which could be due to enhanced fibre/matrix adhesion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3afiber content 3ahemp 3apolyesters 3apolylactic acid1 aPickering, Kim L.1 aFernyhough, Alan0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.519-526dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245010500207300001800312506007600330520086500406592002801271506003701299650001901336650002001355650001401375650002301389650002201412650001201434650001301446650001401459650002501473700002601498700012401524700002101648773013201669856007401801852000901875655001201884IND60617487220221207051656.0181025e20180503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061748722DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc01297k2doi7 aPMC59343272pmcid7 a296755182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Camille R.12aA photoactive semisynthetic metalloenzyme exhibits complete selectivity for CO₂ reduction in water  ap. 4681-4684.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA series of artificial metalloenzymes containing a ruthenium chromophore and [Niᴵᴵ(cyclam)]²⁺, both incorporated site-selectively, have been constructed within an azurin protein scaffold. These light-driven, semisynthetic enzymes do not evolve hydrogen, thus displaying complete selectivity for CO₂ reduction to CO. Electrostatic effects rather than direct excited-state electron transfer dominate the ruthenium photophysics, suggesting that intramolecular electron transfer from photogenerated Ruᴵ to [Niᴵᴵ(cyclam)]²⁺ represents the first step in catalysis. Stern–Volmer analyses rationalize the observation that ascorbate is the only sacrificial electron donor that supports turnover. Collectively, these results highlight the important interplay of elements that must be considered when developing and characterizing molecular catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron transfer 3aenzymes 3ahydrogen 3aruthenium 3ascaffolding proteins1 aManesis, Anastasia C.1 aStevensonCurrent address: Department of Chemistry, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA., Michael J.1 aShafaat, Hannah,0 tChemical communications.g2018 May 3, v. 54, no. 37 p.4681-4684dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc01297k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245007600178500002200254520155300276592002801829650001901857650001001876650001201886650001601898650001501914650001101929650002001940650001701960651001101977651001101988651002901999651001202028651001902040653001102059653002402070653001302094653002002107700003202127700002002159700002102179773011702200856005302317852000902370655001202379IND60795338920221120133901.0221004e20220924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079533892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.1047782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Benedetti, Claudia10aHistory of Tilia in Europe since the Eemian: Past distribution patterns  aPre-press version  aWith the aim of reconstructing past distribution patterns of the genus Tilia in Europe from the Eemian interglacial to present, a number of over 2600 pollen and macrofossil records from the literature and from online databases have been examined. As for the Eemian, patterns inferred from pollen and supported by macrofossils reveal that Tilia was widespread and taxonomically diverse in Poland and adjacent regions, as well as in the East-European Plain, Britain, the Alpine region, and the Italian and Balkan Peninsulas. In the early Weichselian interstadials (MIS 5c and 5a) the range of lime was much reduced, but still with occurrences in the Baltic Countries, Poland and Ukraine, in addition to southern Europe. During the Last Glacial Maximum lime did not take part in the zonal ecosystems of Europe, but its lateglacial and postglacial spread reflects the multiple locations and taxonomical pattern of glacial refugia, which were not limited to southern and mid-altitude Europe, but also included micro- and cryptorefugia in NW France and possibly in the Baltic region and other regions. Lime spread rapidly over Europe in the Early Holocene, reaching its maximum diffusion around 7000 cal BP. Afterwards, Tilia declined and even disappeared in some areas at the northern and southern boundaries of its range. The generalist species T. cordata proved to be the most successful lime species under the pre-industrial Holocene climate, and likewise is found to be the most tolerant lime to increasing drought stress caused by Global Warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aTilia 3aclimate 3apaleobotany 3apalynology 3apollen 3arefuge habitats 3awater stress 3aFrance 3aPoland 3aSouthern European region 3aUkraine 3aUnited Kingdom 0aEemian 0aLast glacial period 0aHolocene 0aGlacial refugia1 aGerasimenko, N.q(Natalia),1 aRavazzi, Cesare1 aMagri, Donatella0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2022 Sept. 24,  p.104778-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2022.104778  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245015500176300001800331500001900349520149900368592002801867650004401895650002201939650001401961650002101975650002101996650001902017650002702036650001502063650001402078650002602092650001702118650001602135650001802151650003702169650001302206650001102219650001402230650001902244650000702263653002202270653001802292653001802310700001902328700001702347773013702364856008702501852000902588655001202597IND60707450420221117060810.0201111e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070745042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPooresmaeil, Malihe10aSimple method for fabrication of metal-organic framework within a carboxymethylcellulose/graphene quantum dots matrix as a carrier for anticancer drug  ap. 2301-2311.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiocompatible drug delivery vehicles with sustained drug release property are valuable in cancer therapy and can reduce some of the side effects. Hence, to achieve the biocompatible system with sustained drug release behavior a new drug carrier was fabricated via in situ synthesis of MIL-53 (MIL = Materials of Institute Lavoisier) within the carboxymethylcellulose/graphene quantum dots matrix (CMC/GQDs) as a biological macromolecule based platform (MIL-53@CMC/GQDs). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed successful synthesis of MIL-53@CMC/GQDs. The mean pore diameter of MIL-53@CMC/GQDs obtained 18.66 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) exhibited that MIL-53 is well distributed in hydrogel matrix. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded about 55.80% and 88.90% into the MIL-53 and MIL-53@CMC/GQDs, respectively. Drug release studies showed the pH-dependent DOX release behavior for DOX@MIL-53@CMC/GQDs. The cytotoxic assay approved the biocompatibility of MIL-53@CMC/GQDs against the human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB 231). The fragmentation of nuclei and condensation of chromatin after treatment with DOX@MIL-53@CMC/GQDs displayed its capability in cancer treatment. Moreover, an arrest in sub-G1 of cell cycle after treatment with MIL-53@CMC/GQDs showed cell's apoptosis. The results conveyed a new concept that the MIL-53@CMC/GQDs could be proposed as a potential carrier for the delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatibility 3abreast neoplasms 3acancer therapy 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acell cycle 3achromatin 3acoordination polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug carriers 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 0aBio-nanocomposite 0aBreast cancer 0aDrug delivery1 aNamazi, Hassan1 aSalehi, Roya0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.2301-2311dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.08.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245009500202300001600297500002000313520165100333592002801984650001602012650001302028650002202041650000902063650000902072650001502081650001302096650002902109650001302138650002502151650001102176650002402187650001802211650001802229650000902247650001802256651000902274700005602283700001902339700001802358773013102376856007502507852000902582655001202591IND60785874620221120095507.0220729e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078587462DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.203662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaring, Emily Rose1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0995-880810aImpact of nitrogen fertilizer timing on nitrate loss and crop production in northwest Iowa  ap. 696-707.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the U.S. Midwest, nitrate in subsurface tile drainage from corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems is detrimental to water quality at local and national scales. The objective of this replicated plot study in northwest Iowa, performed in 2015–2020, was to investigate the influence of nitrogen (N) fertilizer timing on crop production and NO₃ load in subsurface (tile) drainage discharge. Four treatments applied to corn included fall anhydrous ammonia with a nitrification inhibitor (F), spring anhydrous ammonia (S), split‐banded urea at planting and mid‐vegetative growth (SS), and no N fertilizer (0N). Across crops and years, NO₃–N concentration in subsurface drainage discharge was the same at 11.7 mg L–¹ for F and S applied anhydrous ammonia (AA). The NO₃–N concentration was statistically lower with SS urea (10 mg L–¹) than F and S, and 0N was lower than SS at 8.3 mg L–¹. Average annual NO₃–N loads were not different between any treatments due to plot variability in drainage discharge. Corn responded to N application, with overall mean yield the same for F, S, and SS. There were no agronomic or water quality benefits for applying AA in spring compared with fall, where the F included a nitrification inhibitor and was applied to cold soils. Split‐applied urea had a small positive water quality impact but no crop yield enhancement. This study shows that there were improvements to NO₃–N concentration in subsurface drainage discharge, but more nutrient reduction practices are needed than fertilizer N management alone to reduce nitrate load to surface water systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aanhydrous ammonia 3acold 3acorn 3acrop yield 3anitrates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aspring 3asubsurface drainage 3asurface water 3atile drainage 3aurea 3awater quality 3aIowa1 aSawyer, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4080-96161 aPederson, Carl1 aHelmers, Matt0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2022 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.696-707dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.203663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245010300174500001900277520146900296592002801765650001401793650002801807650001301835650001701848650001601865650001701881650001601898650001101914650000901925650001101934650002601945650000701971650000901978650001501987650001802002650002402020653002902044653002202073653002602095653001702121653002502138700001702163700001402180700001702194700001502211700001702226700001702243700001802260700001902278700002002297700003602317700001902353700001602372700001802388700001802406773009302424856009102517852000902608655001202617IND60707450520221117060534.0210108e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070745052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1202652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jongjin10aSelective elimination of human pluripotent stem cells by Anti-Dsg2 antibody-doxorubicin conjugates  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe self-renewal properties of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) contribute to their efficacy in tissue regeneration applications yet increase the likelihood of teratoma formation, thereby limiting their clinical utility. To address this issue, we developed a tool to specifically target and neutralize undifferentiated hPSCs, thereby minimizing tumorigenicity risk without negatively affecting regenerated and somatic tissues. Specifically, we conjugated a monoclonal antibody (K6-1) previously generated in our laboratory against desmoglein 2 (Dsg2), which is highly differentially expressed in undifferentiated hPSCs versus somatic tissues, to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX). The K6-1-DOX conjugates were selectively targeted and incorporated into Dsg2-positive hPSCs, leading to pH-dependent endosomal release and nuclear localization of DOX with subsequent cytotoxicity via an apoptotic caspase cascade. Conversely, Dsg2-negative fibroblasts showed minimal conjugate uptake or cytotoxicity, suggesting that K6-1-DOX treatment would yield few side effects owing to off-target effects. Selective removal of undifferentiated stem cells was also supported by in vivo studies using a mouse xenograft model, wherein hIgG-DOX- but not K6-1-DOX-pretreated-hPSC injection led to teratoma development. Together, these results validated the ability of the Dsg2-targeted antibody-anticancer drug conjugate to facilitate the safety of stem cell therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiocompatible materials 3acaspases 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3amice 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3arisk 3astem cells 3atissue repair 3axenotransplantation 0aAntibody-drug conjugates 0aTargeted delivery 0aPluripotent stem cell 0aDesmoglein-2 0aTeratoma elimination1 aLee, Na Geum1 aOh, Mihee1 aSong, Jinhoi1 aKim, Wooil1 aKwon, Min-Gi1 aKim, Seul Gi1 aHan, Baek Soo1 aBae, Kwang-Hee1 aLee, Dong Gwang1 aLee, Paul S.q(Paul Sang Hyun),1 aPark, Jong-Gil1 aKim, Jae Ho1 aLee, Jangwook1 aMin, Jeong-Ki0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Nov., v. 259 p.120265-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1202653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009800170520215800268592002802426650001902454650001202473650002002485650002302505650001602528650001702544650002202561650001702583650002902600650002102629650001702650650001302667650002402680650001302704650001902717650002102736650001702757650002002774650001502794653002102809653001702830653002702847653003502874653002002909653001702929700002202946773009802968856008703066852000903153655001203162IND60695412720221119022323.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069541272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1150112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLux, Benjamin12aA supply curve of electricity-based hydrogen in a decarbonized European energy system in 2050  aAlongside substituting fossil fuels with renewable energies and increasing energy efficiency, the utilization of electricity-based hydrogen or its derived synthetic fuels is a potential strategy to meet ambitious European climate protection targets. As synthetic hydrocarbons have the same chemical properties as their fossil substitutes, existing infrastructures and well-established application technologies can be retained while CO₂ emissions in energy conversion, transport, industry, and residential and services can be reduced. However, the conversion processes, especially the generation of hydrogen necessary for all e-fuels, are associated with energy losses and costs. To evaluate the techno-economic hydrogen production potential and the impact of its utilization on the rest of the energy system, a supply curve of electricity-based hydrogen in a greenhouse gas emission-free European energy system in 2050 was developed. It was found that hydrogen quantities of the order of magnitude envisaged in the 1.5 °C scenarios by the European Commission's long-term strategic vision (1536–1953 TWhH₂) induce marginal hydrogen production costs of over 110 €₂₀₂₀/MWhH₂ and electrolyzer capacities of more than 615 GWₑₗ. Although the generation of these amounts of hydrogen using electrolysis provides some flexibility to the electricity system and can integrate small amounts of local surplus electricity, an additional 766 GWₑₗ of wind power and 865 GWₑₗ of solar power must be installed to cover the additional electricity demand for hydrogen production. It was furthermore found that the most important techno-economic properties of electrolyzers used in an energy system dominated by renewable energies are the ability to operate flexibly and the conversion efficiency of electricity into hydrogen. It is anticipated that the shown analysis is valuable for both policy-makers, who need to identify research, subsidy and infrastructure requirements for a future energy system, and corporate decision-makers, whose business models will be significantly affected by the future availability of electricity-based fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3adecision making 3aeconometric models 3aelectricity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy efficiency 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3aproduction costs 3asolar energy 3asynthetic fuels 3awind power 0aCost of hydrogen 0aPower-to-Gas 0aEnergy system modeling 0aElectricity system flexibility 0aSector coupling 0aElectrolysis1 aPfluger, Benjamin0 tApplied energy.g2020 July 01, v. 269 p.115011-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1150113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012500170520122200295592002801517650001501545650001301560650001301573650002301586650001401609650002101623650001701644650001901661650001901680650001901699650001901718650001101737650000701748650001601755650002401771650001901795650003301814650001101847650002001858650001001878650000901888650001701897653002201914653002501936653002401961653003301985653002902018700001702047700001702064700001602081700001602097773010502113856008702218852000902305655001202314IND60684210320221121060049.0200221e20200505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068421032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1245462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamburova, K.10aApplication of polymeric modified polyaniline-silica particles for improved corrosion resistance of hybrid zinc coatings  aPolyaniline (PANI) is a conducting polymer that can be used for active corrosion protection of metals and metallic structures. In the present work, we describe the preparation of stable aqueous suspension of positively charged colloidal PANI-SiO₂ particles suitable for electrodeposition with zinc on cathode (steel) surface. Stabilization of the suspension against aggregation is realized by adsorption of commercially available tri-block amphiphilic copolymer Pluronic F127 on the PANI-SiO₂ particles surface. The polymer consists of polyethylene oxide (PEO) blocks as hydrophilic segments and polypropylene oxide (PPO) blocks as the hydrophobic part. Stability of the suspension is proved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and visual investigations. The PANI-SiO₂ particles are incorporated into the zinc coating by co-deposition of the particles and zinc from zinc sulfate electrolyte solution. The surface morphology of the hybrid zinc coatings is investigated by recording the SEM images before and after treatment in a model corrosion medium (5% NaCl solution with pH 6.7). The electrochemical tests revealed higher resistance of the hybrid coating to corrosion compared to the ordinary zinc coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acathodes 3acoatings 3acomposite polymers 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3apH 3apolyaniline 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asodium chloride 3asteel 3azinc 3azinc sulfate 0aElectrodeposition 0aCorrosion protection 0aConducting polymers 0aModified PANI-SiO2 particles 0aHybrid PANI-zinc coating1 aBoshkova, N.1 aTabakova, N.1 aBoshkov, N.1 aRadeva, Ts.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 May 05, v. 592 p.124546-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1245463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245014600170520189100316592002802207650002102235650001602256650002202272650002102294650001902315650001602334650001002350650001402360650001902374650001902393650001502412650000902427650001502436650002502451653003902476653003102515653002802546653003002574653002702604700001402631700001502645700001202660700001802672700001802690773009102708856009002799852000902889655001202898IND60782060820221122002750.0220830e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078206082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Qiansu10aVisible light active graphene oxide modified Ag/Ag2O/BiPO4/Bi2WO6 for photocatalytic removal of organic pollutants and bacteria in wastewater  aWastewater problems caused by antibiotics and bacteria contamination have become the primary environmental concern due to their harm to terrestrial organisms and health risk. To obtain the efficient removal approach of antibiotics and bacteria, visible driven advanced oxidation process by photocatalyst for the efficient removal and reducing waterborne disease was demonstrated in this study. 2D/2D GO−Ag/P/BWO heterostructure photocatalyst (GO: graphene oxide, Ag: Ag, Ag₂O; P: BiPO₄; BWO: Bi₂WO₆) were synthesized for effectively purification of antibiotics and bacteria contaminated wastewater. GO added in synthesis of BWO (1st-hydrothermal) and induced of Ag dopants (2nd-hydrothermal) of GO–Ag/P/BWO were fabricated separately and marked as GO₍I₎–Ag/P/BWO and GO₍II₎–Ag/P/BWO, characterized by different tests (FT-IR, XRD, Raman, XPS, SEM, TEM, TG, UV-VIS, PL, photocurrent density, and EIS). To testify the visible light driven photocatalytic activity of the fabricated photocatalysts, Rhodamine B (Rh B) and amoxicillin (AMX) was chosen as model emerging organic contaminants and antibiotics, respectively. While gram-negative strain Escherichia coli (E. coli) was selected as model waterborne bacteria. The results showed that GO₍II₎–Ag/P/BWO photocatalyst was synthesized successfully, and possessed high crystallinity, low generated electron-hole recombination rate, and high photocurrent density. The system can produce energetic active species (h⁺, O₂⁻ and OH), exhibiting a superior performance towards removal of Rh B, AMX and E. coli under visible light irradiation. Comparing to other reported GO modified Bi based photocatalyst, GO₍II₎–Ag/P/BWO had stronger photocatalytic performance in degradation of Rh B, AMX and E. coli, which indicated its high prospects for practical application in environmental wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aamoxicillin 3acrystal structure 3aelectric current 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3alight 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3arhodamines 3arisk 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aAg/Ag2O/BiPO4/Bi2WO6 photocatalyst 0aInducing of graphene oxide 0aWastewater purification 0aAntibiotics decomposition 0aBacterial disinfection1 aMing, Jie1 aSun, Xiang1 aLiu, Na1 aChen, Guoping1 aYang, Yingnan0 tChemosphere.g2022 Nov., v. 306 p.135512-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1355123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013700155300001600292500002000308520198300328592002802311650001602339650000802355650002202363650002702385650001302412650001502425650001202440650001402452650001902466650002002485650004302505650001802548650000902566700001802575700001502593700001402608700001502622773013102637856007302768852000902841655001202850IND60587390620221120161446.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739062DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.127552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayne, M.S.10aOne‐step simultaneous detection of Ureaplasma parvum and genotypes SV1, SV3 and SV6 from clinical samples using PlexPCR technology  ap. 153-158.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUreaplasma spp. are associated with preterm birth. In recent times, it has become apparent that Ureaplasma parvum, but not Ureaplasma urealyticum, is of most relevance. We recently demonstrated this in Australian pregnant women and using high‐resolution melt (HRM) PCR, further showed that U. parvum genotype SV6 was of particular significance. However, our assay was unable to identify multiple genotypes in the same sample, required a separate species‐level qPCR for low titre samples and was not ideal for diagnostic laboratories due to the nature of HRM PCR result interpretation. Consequently, our current study developed a novel, one‐step PlexPCR assay capable of detecting U. parvum and genotypes SV1, SV3 and SV6 in a single reaction directly from clinical samples. We then validated this using vaginal swab DNA from our Australian cohort of pregnant women. The PlexPCR was highly sensitive, detecting all targets to between 0.4 × 10⁻⁵ ng DNA (SV3) and 0.4 × 10⁻⁶ ng DNA (U. parvum, SV1 and SV6). Compared to our HRM PCR, the PlexPCR defined genotype distribution in all seven cases previously reported as ‘mixed’, and detected another eight cases where multiple genotypes (two) were present in samples previously reported as single genotypes using HRM PCR. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ureaplasma spp. have been associated with prematurity for decades, however, only a minority of studies have examined this beyond the genus level. In those that have, Ureaplasma parvum has been strongly associated with preterm birth. We recently demonstrated this in Australian women and further showed that U. parvum genotype SV6 was of particular significance. Our PlexPCR assay allows rapid detection and concurrent genotyping of U. parvum in clinical samples and may be of particular interest to obstetricians, particularly those caring for women at a high risk of preterm birth, and any other disease phenotypes where U. parvum is of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3aDNA 3aUreaplasma parvum 3aUreaplasma urealyticum 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amelting 3aphenotype 3apregnant women 3apremature birth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3arisk1 aFurfaro, L.L.1 aTucker, R.1 aTan, L.Y.1 aMokany, E.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2017 Aug., v. 65, no. 2 p.153-158dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.127553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245008400210300001200294506007600306520103500382592002801417506003701445650002101482650001701503650002101520650001701541650001001558650002801568650001801596650001201614650002601626650001201652650001301664650001301677650001601690653001801706653001201724653001401736653002601750653001701776700001501793700001701808700002401825700001801849700002201867773011201889856008402001852000902085655001202094IND60530741120221207063252.0180905e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053074112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meteno.2015.11.0012doi7 aPMC57797252pmcid7 a294681092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingwei10aMetabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the biosynthesis of 2-pyrrolidone  ap. 1-7.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a2-Pyrrolidone is a valuable bulk chemical with myriad applications as a solvent, polymer precursor and active pharmaceutical intermediate. A novel 2-pyrrolidone synthase, ORF27, from Streptomyces aizunensis was identified to catalyze the ring closing dehydration of γ-aminobutyrate. ORF27's tendency to aggregate was resolved by expression at low temperature and fusion to the maltose binding protein (MBP). Recombinant Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered for the production of 2-pyrrolidone from glutamate by expressing both the genes encoding GadB, a glutamate decarboxylase, and ORF27. Incorporation of a GadB mutant lacking H465 and T466, GadB_ΔHT, improved the efficiency of one-pot 2-pyrrolidone biosynthesis in vivo. When the recombinant E. coli strain expressing the E. coli GadB_ΔHT mutant and the ORF27-MBP fusion was cultured in ZYM-5052 medium containing 9g/L of l-glutamate, 7.7g/L of l-glutamate was converted to 1.1g/L of 2-pyrrolidone within 31h, achieving 25% molar yield from the consumed substrate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces 3abinding proteins 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3aglutamate decarboxylase 3aglutamic acid 3amaltose 3ametabolic engineering 3amutants 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atemperature 0a2-Pyrrolidone 0aE. coli 0aGlutamate 0aMetabolic engineering 0aBiosynthesis1 aKao, Emily1 aWang, George1 aBaidoo, Edward E.K.1 aChen, Matthew1 aKeasling, Jay.

The experimental results demonstrated that the dominant sorption mechanism of biochars for CBZ was evolved from partition to adsorption with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The CBZ concentration–dependent contributions of partition and adsorption were controlled by the relative noncarbonized and carbonized fractions of biochars. The partition medium changed from a polymeric aliphatic fraction (mangrove plant residue [MPR]200–MPR400) to a more condensed aromatic phase (MPR500–MPR600), which made the partition less favorable. Meanwhile, the adsorption was selectively regulated by polarity (MPR200–MPR300) and porosity (MPR400–MPR700) for different biochars. A pragmatic model including the sorbent aromaticity index (H/C) was put forward to predict CBZ sorption to MPR200–MPR700 and other carbonaceous materials reported in the literature. The findings can be helpful in understanding CBZ–biochar interactions and developing effective sorbents (such as biochars) for pollutant sequestration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3aenvironmental quality 3aevolution 3amodels 3aplant residues 3apollutants 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3asorbents 3atemperature1 aLi, Yasong1 aKong, Xiangke1 aZhu, Xiaohua0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2022 July, v. 51, no. 4 p.745-754dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.203593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245010000176300001600276520101800292592002801310650001101338650001301349650001101362650001801373650002401391650001401415650001301429650001301442650001501455650001301470650001301483650001601496700001201512700001401524700001301538773008201551856008901633852000901722655001201731IND60095872720221119155731.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009587272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoddamzadeh, A.10aNovel wear-resistant materials – Carbon fiber reinforced low-carbon Stellite alloy composites  ap. 344-352.  aThis paper reports the design and development of a class of new composite materials, which are low-carbon Stellite alloy matrices reinforced with carbon fibers. The focus of the research is to compare the different effects of carbon fibers versus carbides on Stellite alloys. Stellite 25 was selected as the matrix because of its very low carbon content (0.1wt.%), thus minimal carbide volume fraction. The composite specimens are fabricated using the hot isostatic pressing and sintering techniques. The microstructures of the specimens are examined with optical microscopy in order to identify the possible carbide formation from the carbon fibers. The material characterization of the specimens is achieved through hardness test, sliding wear test and corrosion test. These novel materials exhibit superior properties compared to existing Stellite alloys and are expected to spawn a new generation of materials used for high temperature, severe corrosion, and wear resistant applications in various industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acarbides 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acomposite materials 3acorrosion 3ahardness 3aindustry 3amicroscopy 3apressing 3aspawning 3atemperature1 aLiu, R.1 aLiang, M.1 aYang, Q.0 tComposites.g2012 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.344-352dElsevier Ltdx1359-835X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2011.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011400151300001600265500002000281520203100301592002802332650000802360650002202368650001602390650002302406650001802429650002002447650002202467650001002489650001102499650002102510650000902531650002402540650001702564650001802581650001402599650003002613650001302643700001902656700001402675700001102689700001402700700001502714773013102729856007302860852000902933655001202942IND60587390820221120181943.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058739082DNAL7 a10.1111/lam.127612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, H.10aSpecific PCR detection of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani: a causal agent of Fusarium wilt on radish plants  ap. 133-140.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFusarium oxysporum, a causal agent of Fusarium wilt, is one of the most important fungal pathogens worldwide, and detection of F. oxysporum DNA at the forma specialis level is crucial for disease diagnosis and control. In this study, two novel F. oxysporum f. sp. raphani (For)‐specific primer sets were designed, FOR1‐F/FOR1‐R and FOR2‐F/FOR2‐R, to target FOQG_17868 and FOQG_17869 ORFs, respectively, which were selected based on the genome comparison of other formae speciales of F. oxysporum including conglutinans, cubense, lycopersici, melonis, and pisi. The primer sets FOR1‐F/FOR1‐R and FOR2‐F/FOR2‐R that amplified a 610‐ and 425‐bp DNA fragment, respectively, were specific to For isolates which was confirmed using a total of 40 F. oxysporum isolates. From infected plants, the FOR2‐F/FOR2‐R primer set directly detected the DNA fragment of For isolates even when the radish plants were collected in their early stage of disease development. Although the loci targeted by the For‐specific primer sets were not likely involved in the pathogenesis, the primer set FOR2‐F/FOR2‐R is available for the determination of pathogenicity of radish‐infecting F. oxysporum isolates. This study is the first report providing novel primer sets to detect F. oxysporum f. sp. raphani. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Because plant pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum has been classified into special forms based on its host specificity, identification of F. oxysporum usually requires a pathogenicity assay as well as knowledge of the morphological characteristics. For rapid and reliable diagnosis, this study provides PCR primer sets that specifically detect Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani (For) which is a devastating pathogen of radish plants. Because one of the primer sets directly detected the DNA fragment of For isolates from infected plants, the specific PCR method demonstrated in this study will provide a foundation for integrated disease management practices in commodity crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aDNA primers 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3adisease control 3adisease diagnosis 3afungi 3agenome 3ahost specificity 3aloci 3aopen reading frames 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aradishes1 aHwang, S.‐M.1 aLee, J.H.1 aOh, M.1 aHan, J.W.1 aChoi, G.J.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2017 Aug., v. 65, no. 2 p.133-140dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl37648x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.127613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016800170500002200338520128300360592002801643650002701671650001501698650002001713650001701733650001401750653002801764653002001792653002601812653002901838653003601867700001701903700001901920700001201939700001801951700001401969700001701983700001702000700001302017773008702030856005202117852000902169655001202178IND60795339420221120144826.0221004e20220924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079533942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1239702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Xiaojun10aDevelopment of a digital Anti-Müllerian hormone immunoassay: Ultrasensitive, accurate and practical strategy for reduced ovarian reserve monitoring and assessment  aPre-press version  aAnti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is an ideal biomarker for the assessment of ovarian reserve. However, its application in determining ovarian reserve reduction is restricted due to the low sensitivity of existing AMH assays. Herein, a homebrew ultrasensitive digital AMH assay (UD-AMH) was established based on a single-molecule array (SiMoA, HD-X platform), and the analytical performance of UD-AMH was evaluated systematically. The limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) of UD-AMH were 0.13 and 0.14 pg/mL, respectively, which is approximately 100-fold higher than that of the current reported general clinical AMH assay. A comparison study showed a high correlation, with r = 0.988 for the Beckman Access AMH assay and r = 0.945 for the Kangrun AMH assay. In addition, we found that the AMH concentrations of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) patients were very low (2.59 (0.86, 31.79) pg/mL) and similar to those of perimenopausal women (2.37 (0.65, 35.88) pg/mL) but significantly higher than those of menopausal women (0.43 (0.28, 1.17) pg/mL). Furthermore, we observed that the AMH concentration of most HT-treated POI patients decreased sharply, suggesting that the ovarian reserve of POI patients declines over time even under HT-treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-Mullerian hormone 3abiomarkers 3adetection limit 3aimmunoassays 3amenopause 0aanti-Müllerian hormone 0aOvarian reserve 0aSingle-molecule array 0aUltrasensitive detection 0aPremature ovarian insufficiency1 aWei, Liutong1 aHuang, Yuanxin1 aJi, Min1 aTang, Yongzhe1 aWei, Bing1 aYang, Shuang1 aLai, Dongmei1 aXu, Hong0 tTalanta.g2022 Sept. 24,  p.123970-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.123970  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245019500166520175600361592002802117650003402145650002602179650001502205650001002220650002402230650001002254650001602264650001102280650004302291650001102334650002002345650001102365650002002376650001702396653002202413653002702435653005402462653001902516700001502535700001402550700001802564700001702582700001502599700001802614700005802632700001702690773009202707856005202799852000902851655001202860IND60795339520221120144849.0221004e20230201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079533952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1239712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yiwei10aConstruction of a novel blood brain barrier-glioma microfluidic chip model: Applications in the evaluation of permeability and anti-glioma activity of traditional Chinese medicine components  aSince most anti-glioma drug candidates hardly permeate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), preclinical models that can integrate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and the structure and function of the BBB is urgently needed for the treatment of glioma. Herein, we constructed an in vitro BBB-glioma microfluidic chip model lined by primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes and glioma cells, which could recapitulate the high level of barrier function of the in vivo human BBB and glioma microenvironment. The BBB unit in BBB-glioma microfluidic chip (BBB–U251 chip) displayed selective permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer-dextran (FITC-dextran) with different molecular weights and three model drugs with different permeability behavior across BBB, which indicated that this glioma model included a functional barrier. Six potential anti-glioma components in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were delivered into the blood channel and the permeated amount was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with ultraviolet (HPLC-UV). The permeated drugs then directly acted on 3D cultured glioma cells (U251) to evaluate the drug efficacy. The results of permeability coefficients of drugs showed that the data were closer to the in vivo data of traditional Transwell model. The effect of the drugs on U251 cells in the BBB-U251 chip was significantly lower due to the existence of BBB. Drug responses on glioma demonstrated the necessity to take BBB into account during the development of anti-glioma new drugs. Therefore, this 3D glioma microfluidic models integrating the BBB functionality can be a useful platform for screening the anticancer drug for brain tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantineoplastic agents 3aastrocytes 3ablood 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3afluorescein 3aglioma 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aisothiocyanates 3amodels 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apermeability 0aMicrofluidic chip 0aTumor microenvironment 0aActive components of traditional Chinese medicine 0aDrug screening1 aHe, Xiaoli1 aWang, Hui1 aDai, Jianying1 aFang, Jiahao1 aHe, Yuzhen1 aChen, Xiaofei1 aHong, Zhanying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6384-13661 aChai, Yifeng0 tTalanta.g2023 Feb. 01, v. 253 p.123971-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.123971  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245006200195300001600257500002000273520129100293592002801584596009301612596004801705650001301753650001701766650001001783650002001793650001501813650002701828650002101855650001501876650001201891650001501903650002401918650001301942650001501955650002901970650001301999650001802012650001302030650001402043651001102057651001802068700005502086700005902141700005902200700006602259700007202325700007302397700005902470773012602529856007302655852000902728655001202737IND60624043120221122150530.0181130e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062404312DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.125652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgha, Mickey1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0961-834412aA review of wildlife camera trapping trends across Africa  ap. 694-701.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCamera traps (CTs) are used for wildlife monitoring globally. How CTs are used in wildlife studies across Africa, however, remains unknown. We provide the first literature review of CT studies conducted across Africa, to describe where, to what end, and by whom CTs are used, and to identify apparent gaps in the use of CTs. We found 172 CT studies published across 60 scientific journals, conducted in 30 of 55 African countries from 2005 to 2017. Most studies were conducted over a single year/season (74%) and primarily addressed habitat use/species distribution (43%), species presence/richness (38.4%), behaviour (35.5%) or demographics (29.7%). Most studies took place in forest (52%), woodland (33%) and grassland (33%) habitat types, and focused on a single species (45.3%). Carnivores were the most commonly studied species group (86%), followed by large herbivores (58%) and primates (38%). Our results suggest that camera trapping is rapidly increasing in use across Africa and potentially driven by country‐based economic factors; however, there is room for improvement. CTs could be expanded in use for studies on underrepresented taxa (i.e. small mammals, reptiles and birds), investigations of human–wildlife conflict and understudied ecoregions (i.e. Sahara Desert).  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of California, Davis—Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology  a88881.128140/2016-01cCAPES/Doutorado Pleno 3aPrimates 3abiogeography 3abirds 3acamera trapping 3acarnivores 3ademographic statistics 3aeconomic factors 3aecoregions 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3areptiles 3asmall mammals 3awildlife 3awoodlands 3aAfrica 3aSahara Desert1 aBatter, Tom1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3957-37251 aBolas, Ellen C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5604-29421 aCollins, Amy C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9697-87961 aGomes da Rocha, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0100-31021 aMonteza‐Moreno, Claudia M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2537-20651 aPreckler‐Quisquater, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8885-52971 aSollmann, Rahel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1607-20390 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 56, no. 4 p.694-701dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.125653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245012500174500001900299520160300318592002801921650001201949650002101961650002801982650002102010650001802031650000902049650001202058650001502070650000902085653003802094653002802132653003402160653004002194653002202234653002402256700001402280700001202294700001802306700001102324700001602335700001502351700001602366700001602382773009302398856009102491852000902582655001202591IND60707450920221117060305.0210108e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070745092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1202882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Haizhu10aConstruction and performance evaluation of Hep/silk-PLCL composite nanofiber small-caliber artificial blood vessel graft  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo meet the growing clinical demand for small-caliber blood vessel grafts to treat cardiovascular diseases, it is necessary to develop safe and long-term unobstructed grafts. In this study, a biodegradable graft made of composite nanofibers is introduced. A composite nanofiber core-shell structure was prepared by a combination of conjugate electrospinning and freeze-dry technology. The core fiber was poly(l-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL)-based and the core fibers were coated with heparin/silk gel, which acted as a shell layer. This special structure in which the core layer was made of synthetic materials and the shell layer was made of natural materials took advantage of these two different materials. The core PLCL nanofibers provided mechanical support during vascular reconstruction, and the shell heparin/silk gel layer enhanced the biocompatibility of the grafts. Moreover, the release of heparin in the early stage after transplantation could regulate the microenvironment and inhibit the proliferation of intima. All of the graft materials were biodegradable and safe biomaterials, and the degradation of the graft provided space for the growth of regenerated tissue in the late stage of transplantation. Animal experiments showed that the graft remained unobstructed for more than eight months in vivo. In addition, the regenerated vascular tissue provided a similar function to that of autogenous vascular tissue when the graft was highly degraded. Thus, the proposed method produced a graft that could maintain long-term patency in vivo and remodel vascular tissue successfully.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3ablood vessels 3agels 3aheparin 3ananofibers 3asilk 0aSmall-caliber blood vessel grafts 0aVascular reconstruction 0aRegulate the microenvironment 0aInhibit the proliferation of intima 0aLong-term patency 0aComposite nanofiber1 aWang, Yao1 aShi, Yu1 aYao, Wangchao1 aHe, Xi1 aLiu, Xuezhe1 aMo, Xiumei1 aLu, Shuyang1 aZhang, Peng0 tBiomaterials.g2020 Nov., v. 259 p.120288-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1202883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245014200169300002000311520106700331592002801398650002301426650001501449650001501464650001101479650001101490650003701501650002101538650001901559700001901578700002301597700002101620700006101641773013801702856008001840852000901920655001201929IND60747860120221119014105.0210820e20210805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074786012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c054042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalakhovsky, Pavel10aElectrostatic Deposition Kinetics of Colloidal Silver Nanoplates onto Optically and E-Beam Transparent Water-Insoluble Polycationic Films  ap. 17870-17880.  aWe developed a convenient method for fabricating thin acrylate polycationic films as a substrate for electrostatic deposition of colloidal silver nanoplates allowing their parallel UV–vis spectroscopy and TEM examination. The deposition rate in the initial diffusion-limited regime is proportional to the molar concentration of nanoplates in colloidal solution and almost independent of the surface zeta potential of polycationic film. Switching to the adsorption-limited regime, the maximum 24 h surface coverage of nanoplates depends linearly on the surface zeta potential and is independent of their molar concentration. To unveil the deposition kinetics, we developed a simple ab initio model of the two-dimensional adsorption of hard and soft disks based on the random sequential adsorption algorithm involving the principle of effective exclusion radius. The Monte Carlo simulation gives a good approximation of the experimental kinetic curves when the effective exclusion radius squared is inversely proportional to the substrate surface zeta potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3asilver 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awater solubility 3azeta potential1 aReznikov, Ivan1 aAniskevich, Yauhen1 aMurausky, Dmitry1 aArtemyev, Mikhail1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6608-00020 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Aug. 05, v. 125, no. 32 p.17870-17880dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c054043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007400139245013200213300001600345500002000361520138900381592002801770596002901798596002701827596002701854596002701881650002501908650002801933650002601961650002601987650000902013650001002022650001202032650001702044650002302061650001202084650001102096650002402107651001302131700002302144700001902167700003502186700002702221700003102248700002202279700002202301773012602323856007302449852000902522655001202531IND60624043220221122175920.0181130e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062404322DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamgaing, Towa Olivier William1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5653-901910aPopulation density estimates of forest duikers (Philantomba monticola & Cephalophus spp.) differ greatly between survey methods  ap. 908-916.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEstimating duiker populations is essential for conservation programmes in Central Africa, but what the most reliable survey method is remains unclear. We estimated forest duiker population densities in Southeast Cameroon using three line‐transect methods: dung counts and diurnal direct observation over 338.2 km, and nocturnal direct observation over 334.7 km. Nocturnal observations resulted in 59.8 and 9.0 individuals km⁻² for the blue duiker (Philantomba monticola) and red duikers (Cephalophus callipygus, C. dorsalis, C. leucogaster and C. nigrifrons), respectively, which were much higher than estimates by dung counts and diurnal observation. Only dung counting was applicable for the yellow‐backed duiker (0.8 individuals km⁻²), due to low encounter rates obtained by the other methods. We argue that nocturnal observation is the most accurate method because the torchlight can pick out duikers' eyes even if the animals are shy and hiding and because multiple counts are unlikely. By contrast, the other methods probably underestimate densities due to poor visibility and reliance on dung production and decay rates calculated in different areas. These results can affect figures used in wildlife management decisions, such as the maximum sustainable yield of game animals, which generally have been based on densities estimated using a single survey method.  aPublisher supplied data  cJST/JICA SATREPS program  a26550115cJSPS KAKENHI  a15H02598cJSPS KAKENHI  a16H05661cJSPS KAKENHI 3aCephalophus dorsalis 3aCephalophus silvicultor 3aPhilantomba monticola 3aconservation programs 3aeyes 3afeces 3aforests 3agame animals 3apopulation density 3asurveys 3avision 3awildlife management 3aCameroon1 aBobo, Kadiri Serge1 aDjekda, Daniel1 aAzobou, Keumbeng Blondel Vasco1 aHamadjida, Bobo Réné1 aBalangounde, Moaga Yannick1 aSimo, Kamdem Joel1 aYasuoka, Hirokazu0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2018 Dec., v. 56, no. 4 p.908-916dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.125183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009000171300001600261520117200277592002801449650001101477650002001488650001201508650001601520650002501536650001801561650001701579650002101596650002001617650001501637650001301652650001101665650004401676650001401720650002101734650001201755650003201767650002201799650002801821650001701849653003301866653002001899653002501919653001701944700001901961700001901980700001701999700002302016700002002039700003102059773011002090856008602200852000902286655001202295IND60543267620221118100936.0190410e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054326762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa, Antonella10aComparative antioxidant activity and 1H NMR profiling of Mediterranean fruit products  ap. 322-330.  aIn this study the antioxidant activity of methanol extracts obtained from Mediterranean fruit products (prickly pear fruit jam and cream, myrtle berries jam, orange and mandarin-orange marmalades) was evaluated and compared in several in vitro models of oxidative stress. The compositional profile of methanol extracts (carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, and main phenolic compounds) was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and the total phenol content was estimated by the Folin–Ciocalteu procedure. All extracts showed protective effect against thermal-cholesterol degradation, strictly correlated to total phenols. Extracts from prickly pear cream and myrtle berries jam preserved liposomes from Cu2+-induced oxidation, inhibiting the reduction of polyunsaturated fatty acids and the increase of malondialdehyde. Extracts from prickly pear cream and citrus marmalades significantly reduced the reactive oxygen species generation induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide in Caco-2 cell culture. The results of this work qualify all tested Mediterranean fruit preserves as a good source of biologically active components with considerable antioxidant potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aMyrtus communis 3aOpuntia 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbohydrates 3acell culture 3ahuman cell lines 3amalondialdehyde 3amarmalades 3amethanol 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphenols 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3asmall fruits 0aMediterranean fruit products 0aLipid oxidation 0aAntioxidant activity 0aCaco-2 cells1 aAtzeri, Angela1 aDeiana, Monica1 aScano, Paola1 aIncani, Alessandra1 aPiras, Cristina1 aCesare Marincola, Flaminia0 tFood research international.g2015 Mar., v. 69 p.322-330dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245006600194300001800260500002000278520178900298592002802087596007502115596007202190650005202262650001202314650001402326650001502340650001102355650001302366650001302379650001302392650001602405650001902421650001602440651001502456700001802471773013102489856007702620852000902697655001202706IND60789666720221116174033.0220822e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078966672DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JC0134272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3843-818510aUncertainties in Climatological Seawater Density Calculations  ap. 2192-2212.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn most applications, with seawater conductivity, temperature, and pressure data measured in situ by various observation instruments e.g., Conductivity‐Temperature‐Depth instruments (CTD), the density which has strong ties to ocean dynamics and so on is computed according to equations of state for seawater. This paper, based on density computational formulae in the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS‐10), follows the Guide of the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and assesses the main sources of uncertainties. By virtue of climatological decades‐average temperature/Practical Salinity/pressure data sets in the global ocean provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), correlation coefficients between uncertainty sources are determined and the combined standard uncertainties uc(ρ) in seawater density calculations are evaluated. For grid points in the world ocean with 0.25° resolution, the standard deviations of uc(ρ) in vertical profiles cover the magnitude order of 10⁻⁴ kg m⁻³. The uc(ρ) means in vertical profiles of the Baltic Sea are about 0.028kg m⁻³ due to the larger scatter of Absolute Salinity anomaly. The distribution of the uc(ρ) means in vertical profiles of the world ocean except for the Baltic Sea, which covers the range of (0.004,0.01) kg m⁻³, is related to the correlation coefficient r(SA,p) between Absolute Salinity SA and pressure p. The results in the paper are based on sensors' measuring uncertainties of high accuracy CTD. Larger uncertainties in density calculations may arise if connected with lower sensors' specifications. This work may provide valuable uncertainty information required for reliability considerations of ocean circulation and global climate models.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFF0200900cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a61505056cNational Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China 3aNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aclimate 3aequations 3ageophysics 3aoceans 3aresearch 3asalinity 3aseawater 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3auncertainty 3aBaltic Sea1 aZhang, Xining0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.2192-2212dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27942x2169-92757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC0134273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169300001600281520148200297592002801779650002101807650001201828650001601840650003101856650001801887650001901905650001301924650001401937650001501951650001401966650000901980650001101989650001202000650000902012653002002021653001502041653001202056653002902068700002202097700001802119773011102137856005102248852000902299655001202308IND50086031920221123031235.0140412e20110120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008603192DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2011.5368792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFageria, N. K.10aGrowth, yield and yield components of lowland rice as influenced by ammonium sulfate and urea fertilization  ap. 371-386.  aNitrogen (N) is one of the most important nutrients in increasing lowland rice yield. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate influence of ammonium sulfate and urea fertilization on growth, yield and yield components of lowland rice. The nitrogen rates used were 0, 50, 100, 150, 300 and 400 mg N kg⁻¹ of soil. Shoot dry weight and grain yield were significantly (P < 0.01) increased in a quadratic fashion when N rate increased from 0 to 400 mg kg⁻¹ by ammonium sulfate as well as urea fertilization. Maximum grain yield was obtained at 168 mg N kg⁻¹ soil by ammonium sulfate and at 152 mg N kg⁻¹ soil by urea. Maximum grain yield at average N rate (160 mg kg⁻¹) was 22% higher with the application of ammonium sulfate compared to urea, indicating superiority of ammonium sulfate compared to urea. Rice yield components, N uptake and use efficiency were significantly influenced with the increasing N rate from 0 to 400 mg kg⁻¹ of soil by both the sources of N. Plant height, shoot dry weight, grain harvest index, 1000 grain weight and N uptake and use efficiency in shoot and grain had significant positive association with grain yield. However, spikelet sterility was negatively associated with grain yield. Soil pH, soil calcium, phosphorus, and potassium contents were significantly influenced by N treatments with urea fertilization. These soil properties were not influenced significantly by ammonium sulfate treatment, except P content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3acalcium 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aharvest index 3ainflorescences 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arice 3ashoots 3asoil pH 3aurea 0aOryza sativa L. 0aInceptisol 0asoil pH 0aN utilization efficiency1 ados Santos, A.

Four novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): HQ692911:g.93C>T in exon 8, JX088659:g.69C>T in intron 8, JX0692914:g.47C>T in intron 9 as well as JX088658:g.100G>A in the 3&rsquo;flanking region were identified by DNA sequencing. By applying the PCR-RFLP method, the SNPs (g.93C>T/HaeIII and g.47C>T/Tsp45I) were genotyped in 401 Polish Holstein-Friesian bulls and their association with carcass traits was analyzed. Statistical analysis showed that the g.93C>T SNP was significantly associated with weight of lean (WLVC) and fat in valuable cuts (WFVC). Animals with the TT genotype had significantly higher WLVC (P < 0.05) and lower WFVC (P < 0.05) than those with the CC and CT genotypes. No significant relationship with carcass traits was found for the g.47C>T SNP (P > 0.05) in intron 9. Moreover, we found a significant effect of the combined genotypes onWFVC (P < 0.01), percent of lean (PLVC) (P < 0.05), and fat (PFVC) in valuable cuts (P < 0.01). This suggested that MEF2D is a strong candidate gene that affects carcass traits in cattle.&nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHolstein 3aexons 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aintrons 3astatistical analysis1 aWicińska, K.1 aOprządek, J.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 58, no. 6 p.262-269dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/6824-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001100146245011300157300002000270520103700290592002801327650001101355650001501366650001101381650002301392650002401415650001201439700001201451700002001463700001501483700001201498700002001510700005501530773013701585856008001722852000901802655001201811IND60606111620221118025146.0180724e20180502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060611162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b004272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Di10aLow-Energy Structures and Electronic Properties of Large-Sized SiN Clusters (N = 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 170)  ap. 11086-11095.  aGlobal search based on semiempirical and first-principles calculations has been performed to determine the lowest-energy structures of large-sized silicon (Si) clusters: SiN (N = 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 170). We found that the stuffed-cage structural motif is dominant for these large clusters, where the ratio of the number of surface atoms to core atoms agrees well with a previously proposed space-filling model up to N = 120 and the structures of outer cages contain not only the majority of the pentagonal and hexagonal rings but also a few seven-membered or eight-membered rings. Triple-layered stuffed-cage structures are found for Si₁₅₀ and Si₁₇₀. Based on the lowest-energy structures, the physical properties of Si clusters (including binding energy, ionization potential, adiabatic detachment energy, electronic gap, and photoelectron spectrum) are computed and compared with the experimental data. For the first time, our theoretical study provides a fundamental picture for large Si clusters up to 170 atoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aionization 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3aphysical properties 3asilicon1 aWu, Xue1 aLiang, Xiaoqing1 aShi, Ruili1 aLi, Zhe1 aHuang, Xiaoming1 aZhao, Jijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3263-71590 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 May 02, v. 122, no. 20 p.11086-11095dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b004273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100001500144245014900159300001600308500001500324520194700339592002802286650001702314650001302331650001502344650001102359650001102370650002502381650003402406650001102440650002402451650001702475650001302492650002302505650001002528650001002538650001202548650001702560653001602577653002002593653001702613653001502630653002602645653002302671653001202694653001202706653001902718700001602737700001602753700002002769700001302789773013802802852000902940856008002949655001203029IND4410460920221122132229.0181123e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441046092DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132080941192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraell, J.10aQuality and Volatile Emission Changes of `Mondial Gala' Apples during On-tree Maturation and Postharvest Storage in Air or Controlled Atmosphere  ap. 285-294.  a2019-12-06  aStarch index (SI), color, firmness, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids content (SSC), ethylene production, and aroma volatile emission were recorded weekly during on-tree maturation of `Mondial Gala' apples. Fruit were harvested on commercial date and held for 3.5 and 6.5 months in regular atmosphere (RA) or in three controlled atmospheres (CA) (2% O₂ :2% CO₂, 1% O₂ : 1 % CO₂ and 1% O₂ :3% CO₂). After each storage period plus 0 and 7 days at 20 °C, color, firmness, TA, SSC, aroma volatile emission, acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations, and sensory acceptability were evaluated. At orchard, changes in SI, SSC, background color, and aroma volatile emission were almost concomitant or slightly previous to the increase in ethylene production. During storage, all three CA conditions, regardless of storage period, led to better preservation of standard quality. CA-stored fruit also received higher acceptability scores, although aroma volatile emission was decreased in response to these storage conditions. At the end of long storage (plus shelf life period), fruit stored in 1 :1 atmosphere showed a good retention of firmness and TA in comparison to the rest of CA-fruit. Fruit stored under all considered CA conditions showed similar aroma volatile emission after 3.5 or 6.5 months of storage. Storage period had no apparent influence on the aroma volatile emission of CA-stored apples, with the exception of fruit stored in 2:2 atmosphere immediately upon removal from storage. No significant differences in sensory acceptability were found either for fruit stored under different CA conditions during 3.5 months immediately after transfer to 20 °C. In contrast, fruit stored in either 1 : 1 or 2: 2 atmospheres during 6.5 months were better accepted by consumers than those stored in 1 : 3 atmosphere upon removal from cold storage. However, these differences disappeared after 7 days of shelf-life at 20 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aharvest date 3aorchards 3ashelf life 3aapples 3afruits 3atotal soluble solids 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3astarch 3aethylene production 3astorage time 3afirmness 3atitratable acidity 3acolor 3aodors 3aethanol 3acold storage 0aapple fruit 0aaroma volatiles 0aacetaldehyde 0aatmosphere 0alow oxygen atmosphere 0aon-tree maturation 0aquality 0astorage 0asoluble solids1 aLopez, M.L.1 aFuentes, T.1 aEcheverría, G.1 aLara, I.0 tFood science and technology international.g2008 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.285-294dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132080941193Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02688naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245005700171300001800228500002400246520155800270650001901828650001701847650002901864650002001893650001001913650001601923650001301939650000701952650001301959650001401972650002201986650001102008700001702019700001802036700001702054773011802071852000902189856009202198655001202290IND4457989520221122030840.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445798952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.04988.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuobariene, L.10aPhytase-active yeasts from grain-based food and beer  ap. 1370-1380.  aIncludes references  aAims: To screen yeast strains isolated from grain-based food and beer for phytase activity to identify high phytase-active strains. Methods and Results: The screening of phytase-positive strains was carried out at conditions optimal for leavening of bread dough (pH 5·5 and 30°C), in order to identify strains that could be used for the baking industry. Two growth-based tests were used for the initial testing of phytase-active strains. Tested strains belonged to six species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus, Saccharomyces bayanus, Kazachstania exigua (former name Saccharomyces exiguus), Candida krusei (teleomorph Issachenkia orientalis) and Arxula adeninivorans. On the basis of initial testing results, 14 strains were selected for the further determination of extracellular and intracellular (cytoplasmic and/or cell-wall bound) phytase activities. The most prominent strains for extracellular phytase production were found to be S. pastorianus KVL008 (a lager beer strain), followed by S. cerevisiae KVL015 (an ale beer strain) and C. krusei P2 (isolated from sorghum beer). Intracellular phytase activities were relatively low in all tested strains. Conclusions: Herein, for the first time, beer-related strains of S. pastorianus and S. cerevisiae are reported as phytase-positive strains. Significance and Impact of the Study: The high level of extracellular phytase activity by the strains mentioned previously suggests them to be strains for the production of wholemeal bread with high content of bioavailable minerals. 3aCandida krusei 3aKazachstania 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abakery industry 3abeers 3abread dough 3aminerals 3apH 3aphytases 3ascreening 3awhole wheat bread 3ayeasts1 aHansen, A.S.1 aJespersen, L.1 aArneborg, N.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2011 June, v. 110, no. 6 p.1370-1380dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.04988.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03206naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245019200170300001800362500002400380520164000404650001802044650002602062650002402088650002102112650001702133650002702150650001402177650001002191650002102201650001802222650001002240650001802250650001202268650001802280650002502298700002102323700001502344700001702359700001102376700001302387700002902400700001802429700001502447700001902462773011802481852000902599856009202608655001202700IND4457989920221122030849.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445798992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2011.04992.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalmokoff, M.10aContinuous feeding of antimicrobial growth promoters to commercial swine during the growing/finishing phase does not modify faecal community erythromycin resistance or community structure  ap. 1414-1425.  aIncludes references  aAims: To investigate the effect of continuous feeding of antimicrobial growth promoters (tylosin or virginiamycin) on the swine faecal community. Methods and Results: The study consisted of two separate on-farm feeding trials. Swine were fed rations containing tylosin (44 or 88 mg kg⁻¹ of feed) or virginiamycin (11 or 22 mg kg⁻¹ of feed) continuously over the growing/finishing phases. The temporal impact of continuous antimicrobial feeding on the faecal community was assessed and compared to nondosed control animals through anaerobic cultivation, the analysis of community 16S rRNA gene libraries and faecal volatile fatty acid content. Feeding either antimicrobial had no detectable effect on the faecal community. Conclusions: Erythromycin methylase genes encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) antimicrobials are present at a high level within the faecal community of intensively raised swine. Continuous antimicrobial feeding over the entire growing/finishing phase had no effect on community erm-methylase gene copy numbers or faecal community structure. Significance and Impact of the Study: Antimicrobial growth promoters are believed to function by altering gut bacterial communities. However, widespread MLSB resistance within the faecal community of intensively raised swine likely negates any potential effects that these antimicrobials might have on altering the faecal community. These findings suggest that if AGP-mediated alterations to gut communities are an important mechanism for growth promotion, it is unlikely that these would be associated with the colonic community. 3aRNA libraries 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3adigestive system 3aerythromycin 3afatty acid composition 3afinishing 3agenes 3agrowth promotion 3aribosomal RNA 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3atylosin 3avirginiamycin 3avolatile fatty acids1 aWaddington, L.M.1 aThomas, M.1 aLiang, K.-L.1 aMa, C.1 aTopp, E.1 aDandurand, U.

Cotyledons were excised from 2-day-old seedlings and incubated in liquid Murashige and Skoog's modified medium supplemented with 5.4 micromole naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 4.4 micromole benzylaminopurine (BAP). After two weeks in culture, the whole upper surface of regenerating explants was covered with green shootlets. The percentages of regenerating explants of three genotypes varied between 60 and 70%, and the number of shoots per regenerating explant was highly increased. The shootlets were transferred to solid Murashige and Skoog's medium allowing shoot development, then to rooting medium. Rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized and gave fertile plants. The role of liquid medium culture in the induction of sunflower regeneration is discussed. 3aHelianthus annuus 3acotyledons 3ashoots 3ain vitro culture 3aculture media 3aliquids 3aplant growth substances 3agenotype 0aregenerative ability1 aCastelle, J.C.1 aLatche, A.1 aRoustan, J.P.1 aFallot, J.0 tPlant cell reports.g1992, v. 10, no. 12 p.617-620x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002323823Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01326naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245013900132300001600271500001500287520032400302650002800626650002300654650001200677650001900689650001300708651001000721653001200731653005600743700002100799700001500820773007800835852000900913939003300922945000800955946001300963655001200976991600110010742620221122030830.0840731e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840041702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlrich, C.P.13aAn epidemiological survey of wild caught and domestic born rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) for Anatrichosoma (Nematoda: Trichinellida)  ap. 726-727.  a2019-12-04  aAnatrichosoma, 54% of wild caught rhesus monkeys from India who were reported positive in survey 3 years earlier gave negative results upon reexamination, while one monkey was found positive that had been previously reported negative, none of the domestic born infant rhesus monkeys examined were positive for infection 3aepidemiological studies 3alaboratory animals 3amonkeys 3aMacaca mulatta 3aNematoda 3aIndia 0asurveys 0aAnatrichosoma [sp.] (Nematoda)Macaca mulatta (Host)1 aHenrickson, R.V.1 aKarr, S.L.0 tComparative medicine.g1981 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.726-727x0023-67647nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840731c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02025naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245010700174300001600281520093300297650001501230650001101245650001901256650002601275650001801301650002501319650001101344653001401355653001401369700001701383700001601400700002001416773007201436852000901508856007801517939003301595946001101628655001201639IND9201387520221122005814.0920313s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920138752DNAL7 a242128702pmid7 a10.1007/BF002323782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPillai, K.G.10aInduction of division and differentiation of somatic embryos in the leaf epidermis of Gaillardia picta  ap. 599-603.  aSomatic embryos and subsequent plant regeneration were obtained from isolated leaf epidermis of Gaillardia picta.

Direct exposure of adults of Zabrotes subfasciatus (Bohem.) to milled, dried O. canum leaves resulted in 100% mortality of males and 50% mortality of females after 48 hr. Dose-response curves for linalool were completed with adult Z. subfasciatus, Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say), Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), and Sitophilus oryzae (L.) using a filter paper bioassay. The LC50 values were: 428 microgram/cm2 for Z. subfasciatus; 405 microgram/cm2 for A. obtectus; 428 microgram/cm2 for R. dominica; 427 microgram/cm2 for S. oryzae. Knockdown was occasionally followed by recovery at doses less than the LC50 for all species. There are significant differences in the LC50 and LT50 values for male and female Z. subfasciatus. At the lower dosages hyperactivity rarely preceded moribundity and mortality where these occurred, while at higher dosages hyperactivity occurred soon after initial exposure and preceded imminent death. A concentration increase from 250 to 750 microgram/cm2, representing a tripling of dosage, spanned the 10-100% response mortality for all species at 24hr. Air-exposure of linalool-treated papers (500 microgram/cm2) for up to 24 hr significantly decreased toxicity to both sexes of Z. subfasciatus. Quantitative analysis showed the only significant decrease in the amount of linalool to occur after 0.25 hr, and this did not fully correlate with the resulting decrease in efficacy against both sexes of Z. subfasciatus. The results are discussed in terms of the efficacy of using 0. canum for the protection against loss due to insects in the traditional food storage systems of Rwanda. 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3apostharvest losses 3aleaves 3alinalool 3aOcimum americanum 3adose response 3aAcanthoscelides obtectus 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aZabrotes subfasciatus 3astorage pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3aRwanda1 aDunkel, F.V.1 aNtezurubanza, L.1 aJackson, L.L.1 aStock, D.T.0 tJournal of stored products research.g1991 Oct., v. 27, no. 4 p.213-220x0022-474X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01518naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009800123300001600221520066400237650002200901650002600923650001800949650001800967650001800985650001401003650001801017650001401035653002101049773008101070852000901151939003301160946001101193655001201204IND9201372320221122005708.0920317s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920137232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGade, G.10aHyperglycaemia or hypertrehalosaemia?

In stick insects, the hypertrehalosaemic effect could be detected only in ligated animals, the haemolymph of non-ligated insects showing no change in any sugar component after neuropeptide injection. 3aCarausius morosus 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aTenebrionidae 3ablood glucose 3ahyperglycemia 3ahemolymph 3aneuropeptides 3atrehalose 0aaophobas rugipes0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 7 p.483-487x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01806naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245015100124300001600275500001500291520086900306650002701175650001801202650001001220650001201230650002101242653002701263700001801290700001901308700001901327773008101346852000901427939003301436946001101469655001201480IND9201372220221122005706.0920317s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920137222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriss, C.10aLocalization in the central nervous system of larval Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) of areas responsible for aspects of feeding behaviour  ap. 477-482.  a2019-12-04  aThe role of certain parts of the central nervous system in the control of feeding behaviour, and especially of chewing, has been investigated by the use of lesions. Cutting the connectives behind the suboesophageal ganglion disinhibits chewing, so that continuous rhythmic mandibular movements occur even in the absence of mechano- or chemostimulation of the mouthparts. Stimulation of the mouthparts with plant material leads to an increased rate of chewing and to maintained ingestion. Isolating the suboesophageal ganglion from the protocerebrum does not prevent the induction of chewing and maintained ingestion. Severing the frontal connectives (uni- or bilaterally) eliminates maintained ingestion but not the ability to chew. The centrally isolated suboesophageal ganglion is capable of producing a co-ordinated chewing behaviour, but not of ingesting food. 3acentral nervous system 3aManduca sexta 3amouth 3aganglia 3afeeding behavior 0aanatomy and morphology1 aSimpson, S.J.1 aRohrbacher, J.1 aRowell, C.H.F.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 7 p.477-482x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02327naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011600125300001600241500001500257520131800272650001901590650002201609650002601631650001301657650001401670650002301684650001501707650001901722650002701741653001701768653002901785700001701814773008101831852000901912939003301921946001101954655001201965IND9201372820221122005743.0920317s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920137282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCotton, G.12aA biochemical and structural study on the effects of methoprene on fat body development in Locusta migratoria L  ap. 525-539.  a2019-12-04  aAn investigation was made of the developmental changes in fat body of Locusta migratoria (L) during the last larval instar and early adult life, and how this was disrupted by treatment with the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene. Fifth-instar larvae (12 plus or minus 12h) were topically treated with 475 microgram of methoprene and fat bodies were subsequently removed for histological and ultrastructural study at regular intervals until the 8th day of adult life. In the first half of the larval stadium, fat body cells showed increases in nuclear size and increased levels of RNA and rough endoplasmic reticulum. These changes were exaggerated and prolonged by methoprene treatment, especially in female insects. In the latter half of the instar, fat body stored increasing amounts of lipid and glycogen. Structural studies indicated that methoprene reduced the levels of stored material but extraction and quantification of fat body lipid and glycogen showed there was no significant difference from controls. Analysis of haemolymph samples showed that methoprene treatment caused the precocious appearance of a female-specific protein band in the blood. Treatment also caused the formation of mitotic bodies in fat body cells, reduced levels of heterochromatin and possibly disrupted autophagic processes. 3ablood proteins 3ahematologic tests 3apesticidal properties 3afat body 3ahemolymph 3aLocusta migratoria 3amethoprene 3aultrastructure 3abiological development 0abiochemistry 0ajuvenile hormone analogs1 aAnstee, J.H.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g1991, v. 37, no. 7 p.525-539x0022-19107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01687naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009300130300001600223520064300239650001200882650001500894650001800909650001500927650001000942650001800952650001800970650001400988650001501002650000701017651001401024653001801038653004001056700001601096700001901112700001901131773008601150852000901236939003301245946001101278655001201289IND9201371620221122005758.0920313e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920137162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaheshkumar, S.10aMethod for the concentration of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus from hatchery water  ap. 211-218.  aA method was developed for concentrating infectious pancreatic necrosis virus from hatchery water using positively charged 1-MDS filters.

The virus adsorbed efficiently to 1-MDS filters when the pH of the water was 5.5 and was eluted optimally with 3% beef extract solution (pH 10).

The results indicate that both a starch annealing process and an increase in the water absorption capacity of gluten take place during seed drying.

Hsiao  ap. 265-273.  aIncludes references  aIsoflavonoids are a group of phenolic secondary metabolites found almost exclusively in leguminous plants. Formononetin, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside (CG) are isoflavonoid products in the CG pathway. Accumulation of the three isoflavonoids plus daidzein and expression of six genes of enzymes involved in the CG pathway were studied in Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Our results showed that (1) main isoflavonoids in roots, stems and leaves were CG, daidzein and calycosin, respectively; they accumulated significantly under the induction of UV irradiation during 8 days but their content declined later; (2) expression of six genes of enzymes involved in the CG pathway was inhibited slightly at early stage but the expression was increased greatly afterward; (3) chalcone synthase, chalcone reductase and chalcone isomerase were expressed to their individual maximum level within shorter hours than were cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, isoflavone synthase (IFS) and isoflavone 3′-hydroxylase and (4) more calycosin but less daidzein accumulated in leaves. IFS was highly expressed in leaves, which might lead to high accumulation of the common precursor of daidzein and 2,7-dihydroxy-4′-O-methoxy-isoflavanone, the latter of which would be converted to formononetin, calycosin and CG via a series of reactions. Little daidzein accumulated in leaves, which suggested that rather than be converted to daidzein, the 2,7,4′-trihydroxyisoflavanone was probably more easily caught by 2-hydroxyisoflavanone 4′-O-methyltransferase and hence provided more precursors for formononetin. The findings were discussed in terms of the influence of UV irradiation in the accumulation of isoflavonoids. 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3achalcone isomerase 3adaidzein 3aformononetin 3agene expression 3agenes 3airradiation 3aleaves 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aroots 3asecondary metabolites 3astems 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAstragalus propinquusxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aBiosynthetic Pathwaysxradiation effects 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGlucosidesxmetabolism 2aIsoflavonesxmetabolism 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTranscription, Geneticxradiation effects 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aNan, Peng1 aYang, Yixin1 aPan, Haiyun1 aZhou, Tongshui1 aChen, Jiakuan0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2011 July, v. 142, no. 3 p.265-273dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01474.x 7aarticle03151naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010600128300001600234500002400250500001500274520176900289650001202058650001902070650001602089650001802105650002502123650001602148650001102164650001202175650001902187650003902206650002002245650000902265650002002274650002802294650003702322650001202359653001502371700002202386700002302408700002502431700001502456700002402471700002202495700002002517700002102537773007802558852000902636655001202645IND4457906720221121121629.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445790672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Bih-Rong10aCapacity for resolution of Ras-MAPK-initiated early pathogenic myocardial hypertrophy modeled in mice  ap. 109-118.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aActivation of Ras signaling in cardiomyocytes has been linked to pathogenic myocardial hypertrophy progression and subsequent heart failure. Whether cardiomyopathy can regress once initiated needs to be established more fully. A 'tet-off' system was used to regulate expression of H-Ras-G12V in myocardium to examine whether Ras-induced pathogenic myocardial hypertrophy could resolve after removal of Ras signaling in vivo. Ras activation at weaning for 2 wk caused hypertrophy, whereas activation for 4 to 8 wk led to cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Discontinuing H-Ras-G12V transgene expression after cardiomyopathy onset led to improved survival and cardiomyopathy lesion scores, with reduced heart:body weight ratios, demonstrating the reversibility of early pathogenic hypertrophy. Activation of Ras and downstream ERK 1/2 was associated with elevated expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclins B1 and D1, indicating cell-cycle activation and reentry. Coordinate elevation of broad-spectrum cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21, p27, and p57) and Tyr15 phosphorylation of cdc2 signified the activation of cell-cycle checkpoints; absence of cell-cycle completion and cardiomyocyte replication were documented by using immunohistochemistry for mitosis and cytokinesis markers. After resolution of cardiomyopathy, cell-cycle activators and inhibitors examined returned to basal levels, a change that we interpreted as exit from the cell cycle. Cardiac cell-cycle regulation plays a role in recovery from pathogenic hypertrophy. The model we present provides a means to further explore the underlying mechanisms governing cell-cycle capacity in cardiomyocytes, as well as progression and regression of pathogenic cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. 3amitosis 3acardiomyopathy 3ahypertrophy 3aheart failure 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acytokinesis 3amodels 3aweaning 3acardiomyocytes 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3agene expression 3amice 3aphosphorylation 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3acyclins 0amyocardium1 aMartin, Philip L.1 aHoover, Shelley B.1 aSpehalski, Elizabeth1 aKumar, Mia1 aHoenerhoff, Mark J.1 aRozenberg, Julian1 aVinson, Charles1 aSimpson, R.

Different statistical analyses (Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, parsimony network, F-statistics, PCA) were performed. Mitochondrial sequences produced an unresolved polytomy including samples from peninsular Italy, Balkans and Greece, and three main clades: southern France, Corsica-Sardinia and Portoscuso (SW Sardinia). Nuclear markers confirm these data, further highlighting a more significant divergence at the regional scale. The results obtained for the peri-Tyrrhenian area agree with major paleogeographic and paleoclimatic events that shaped the biodiversity of the local fauna. K. flavicollis biodiversity and its phylogeographic pattern are also evaluated in the light of the data available for the other native European termite taxon (genus Reticulitermes), in order to produce a more complete scenario of the Mediterranean. In the area comprised between southern France and Italy, the degree of diversity is similar; however, in the eastern area, while K. flavicollis is differentiated only at the population level, the genus Reticulitermes comprises at least six entities of specific and/or subspecific level. This discrepancy may be explained by taking into account the different evolutionary histories of the two taxa. 3aKalotermes flavicollis 3aReticulitermes 3abiodiversity 3afauna 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBayes Theorem 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aIsopteraxgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aShort Interspersed Nucleotide Elementsxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 3aBalkans 3aCorsica 3aFrance 3aGreece 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 3aSardinia 0aMediterranean Region1 aLuchetti, A.1 aGhesini, S.1 aMarini, M.1 aMantovani, B.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2011 June, v. 101, no. 3 p.353-364dCABI Pubx0007-48537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748531000060X3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02969naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245015700176300001600333500002400349520185500373650001102228650001102239650000902250650001602259650000902275650001302284650001302297650001402310650001302324650001102337651001602348700001802364700002102382773008902403852000902492856009402501655001202595IND4457947920221121121635.0110513s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445794792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1474-919X.1997.tb04659.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolando, Antonio.12aA comparative analysis of the foraging behaviour of the Chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax and the Alpine Chough Pyrrhocorax graculus coexisting in the Alps  ap. 461-467.  aIncludes references  aThe foraging behaviour of the Chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax and the Alpine Chough Pyrrhocorax graculus was studied during summer and autumn in the western Italian Alps. We assessed feeding times, feeding rates and foraging techniques associated with different foraging habitats. The Alpine Chough is mainly a ground surface feeder, stays for a rela-tively short time at a feeding site (on average 2.1 min) and feeds quickly (on average 9.2 items/min). In contrast, the Chough is almost exclusively an undersurface feeder (digger and prober), stays at a feeding site twice as long as the Alpine Chough (5.4 min) and feeds four times as slowly (2.2 items/min). These differences suggest that the degree of actual ecological overlap is almost as low as possible for two species using the same Alpine pastures as foraging sites. Interspecific coexistence has occurred through a clear differentiation of foraging strategies and diets. The foraging efficiency (in terms of feeding rate)of the Alpine Chough was always higher than that of the Chough in all habitats where they occurred together. The Alpine Chough was more variable in the use of foraging techniques and more diversified in the use of foraging habitats than the Chough. In both species, juveniles fed less efficiently than adults; the foraging behaviour of the Chough is probably more difficult to learn than that of the Alpine Chough. Other data have also shown that the Alpine Chough is more opportunistic than the Chough in using seasonally available food. Considering the above, we suggest that the foraging behaviour of the Alpine Chough is more flexible and, perhaps, better adapted to the high mountain Alpine environment than that of the Chough. Two hypotheses concerning the ultimate reason why the Alpine Chough and the Chough have evolved divergent beak morphology are discussed. 3aadults 3aautumn 3abeak 3acorrelation 3adiet 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3apastures 3asummer 3aAlps region1 aLAIOLO, PAOLA1 aFORMICA, MASSIMO0 tIbis.g1997 July, v. 139, no. 3 p.461-467dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-10197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1997.tb04659.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02176naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245010800169300001600277500002400293520109400317650001001411650001101421650001501432650001201447650002001459650001101479650000901490650000901499650001301508650001301521650001301534650002301547651001001570700001801580773008901598852000901687856009401696655001201790IND4457947720221121121728.0110513s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445794772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1474-919X.1997.tb04657.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCAMPOS, F.10aTemporal variations in the feeding habits of the Purple Heron Ardea purpurea during the breeding season  ap. 447-451.  aIncludes references  aThe foraging strategies of adult Purple Herons Ardea purpurea from an increasing colony in northern Spain were studied in the feeding areas (nonagricultural habitats) during the breeding season (May-July). In this area, herons were mainly piscivorous, and there was no seasonal variation in prey type. Small fish (<12.5 cm) were more abundant in the diet in June and medium-sized fish (12.5-25 cm) in May and July. Foraging strategies varied seasonally: (1) More time was spent by the herons in the feeding areas in June than in May or July, whereas foraging time was only significantly greater in June than in July. (2) The biomass captured by the adults in each foraging session was similar in May and June but greater in July. (3) Feeding attempts were more numerous (but not more successful) in shallow water in June and July. (4) Aggression rates between conspecifics were higher in June than in both May and July. Probably the hatching of chicks (June) was the cause of these changes in diet and foraging strategies as well as increased intraspecies competition for foraging habitat. 3aArdea 3aadults 3aaggression 3abiomass 3abreeding season 3achicks 3adiet 3afish 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ahatching 3aseasonal variation 3aSpain1 aLEKUONA, J.M.0 tIbis.g1997 July, v. 139, no. 3 p.447-451dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-10197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1997.tb04657.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02546naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245011600170300001600286500002400302500001500326520151700341650001201858650001101870650001301881650001301894650001101907651001301918653001001931700002001941700002001961700002301981773008902004852000902093856009402102655001202196IND4457947820221121121703.0110513s1997    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445794782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1474-919X.1997.tb04658.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHEDD, APRIL10aDiving behaviour of the Shy Albatross Diomedea cauta in Tasmania: initial findings and dive recorder assessment  ap. 452-460.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe diving behaviour of the Shy Albatross Diomedea cauta was investigated using archival time-depth recorders (TDRs) and maximum depth gauges (MDGs). Data from birds carrying multiple devices and from diving simulations indicated that the degree of correspondence between TDRs and MDGs varied with the dive depth, duration and frequency, as well as with body placement. The MDGs were the most reliable when the diving depth was greater than 0.5 m, when the diving frequency was low and when gauges were placed on the birds' backs. The TDRs were used during late incubation and early chick rearing in 1994. Fifty-two dives (0.4 m) were recorded during 20 foraging trips of 15 individuals. The majority of dives were within the upper 3 m of the water column and lasted for less than 6 s. However, dives to 7.4 m and others lasting 19 s were recorded. The albatrosses dived between 07.00 h and 22.00 h, with peaks in their diving activity near midday and twilight. Mean diving depth varied throughout the day. with the deepest dives occurring between 10.00 h and 12.00 h. Two dive types were identified on the basis of the relationship between dive depth and descent rate. Plunge dives were short (5 s), and the birds reached a maximum depth of 2.9 m. Swimming dives were both longer and deeper. The characteristics of Shy Albatross plunge dives were similar to those of gannets Morus spp., which are known to be proficient plunge divers. Swimming dives suggest that Shy Albatrosses actively pursue prey underwater. 3arearing 3agauges 3aswimming 3aforaging 3achicks 3aTasmania 0abirds1 aGALES, ROSEMARY1 aBROTHERS, NIGEL1 aRobertson, Graham.0 tIbis.g1997 July, v. 139, no. 3 p.452-460dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-10197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1997.tb04658.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02567naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012400123300001600247500002400263520153000287650002701817650001601844650001201860650002101872650001001893650001601903650001301919650001301932650001201945650002601957650000901983650001001992651001302002700001402015700001702029700001602046773011002062852000902172655001202181IND4457901620221121121629.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445790162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, S.C.10aEfficacy of Exserohilum longirostratum on barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli spp. crusgalli) under field conditions  ap. 449-460.  aIncludes references  aAn isolate of Exserohilum longirostratum obtained from Rottboelia cochinchinensis in Malaysia was highly pathogenic to barnyardgrass (Echinocloa crus-galli,) a serious weed in rice fields in Malaysia. In glasshouse trials, high levels of barnyardgrass control were achieved when E. longirostratum was applied as a conidial concentration at 105 conidia/mL. This conidial concentration may not be sufficient for field use; therefore, a mini plot trial was carried out to assess the bioherbicidal potential of the fungus and the efficacy of different inoculum types under field conditions. Excellent barnyard grass disease as indicated by Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) was achieved with mycelium (AUDPC = 583.8 unit2); mycelium + pretichlaclor (AUDPC = 610.4 unit2) and conidia alone (AUDPC = 468.3 unit2) compared to conidia + pretichlaclor (AUDPC = 395.8 unit2). Although conidia caused lower disease severity on barnyard grass compared to mycelium, this inoculum equally reduced the competition from barnyard grass as indicated by lower mean dry weight and fewer barnyard grass tiller numbers. Positive correlations between AUDPC of rice and its tiller number and AUDPC of rice and its dry weight were recorded while negative correlations were observed for the AUDPC of barnyard grass and its tiller number and AUDPC of barnyard grass and its dry weight. These findings confirmed that E. longirostratum applied either in the form of conidia or mycelium was effective against barnyard grass under field conditions. 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aExserohilum 3aconidia 3adisease severity 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3ainoculum 3amycelium 3apaddies 3apesticidal properties 3arice 3aweeds 3aMalaysia1 aKadir, J.1 aHailmi, M.S.1 aRahim, A.A.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2011, v. 21, no. 3-4 p.449-460dCarfax Publishing Cox0958-31577nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245014900156300001600305500002400321500002300345500001500368520123600383650001701619650001401636650002601650650001901676650003301695650002101728650001101749650001901760650001301779650001601792650001801808650001201826650001501838651001101853651001801864653003701882700002101919700002201940700001401962700002101976773014901997852000902146856007502155655001202230IND4457902020221121121647.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445790202DNAL7 a10.1139/X10-1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Amanda B.10aDendroclimatic relationships and possible implications for mountain birch and Scots pine at treeline in northern Sweden through the 21st century  ap. 450-459.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aChanging climate in the Arctic is expected to have significant effects on the pattern and distribution of terrestrial vegetation. Species characteristic of specific zones in the mountains of northern Sweden have been shown to migrate up- and down-slope with changes in climate over the Holocene. This study evaluates the potential for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to become a treeline dominant at Fennoscandian treelines, replacing mountain birch (Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii (Orlova) Hämet-Ahti). Data from paired mountain birch and Scots pine tree-ring chronologies for eight locations in northern Sweden are used to develop climate – tree ring width index (RWI) relationships. Modeled climate–RWI relationships are then used to predict the relative RWI values of the two species under a suite of climate-forcing scenarios using an ensemble of three global climate models. Results indicate that mountain birch and Scots pine RWI are both correlated with summer temperatures, but Scots pine is more likely than mountain birch to be influenced by moisture conditions. Predictions of RWI under future climate conditions indicate that mountain birch is unlikely to be replaced by Scots pine within the next century. 3agrowth rings 3amountains 3aecological succession 3aclimate change 3aBetula pubescens var. pumila 3aPinus sylvestris 3asummer 3aclimate models 3atreeline 3atemperature 3awater content 3aclimate 3aprediction 3aSweden 3aArctic region 0aBetula pubescens subsp. tortuosa1 aCairns, David M.1 aLafon, Charles W.1 aMoen, Jon1 aMartin, Laura E.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2011 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.450-459dNRC Research Press, National Research Council Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X10-1163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02794naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100003200135245011400167300001600281500002400297500002300321520154300344650001801887650002201905650002101927650001601948650001901964650001201983650001801995650001602013650002302029650001402052650001002066650001302076650001002089650001402099700002302113773016402136852000902300856007502309655001202384IND4457902120221121094446.0110513s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445790212DNAL7 a10.1139/X10-1832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, Geneviève Dufour10aBlack spruce regeneration at the treeline ecotone: synergistic impacts of climate change and caribou activity  ap. 460-468.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aTree regeneration at treeline is often inhibited by harsh climatic conditions and ecological constraints such as the presence of a continuous lichen cover. The objective of this study was to verify if recent climate warming and increased caribou (Rangifer tarandus L.) activity, which destroys the lichen cover, could act synergistically to increase black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) regeneration. We collected cones produced in 2006–2007 to compare seed viability with data from 1989 to 1995. We conducted experimental plantations (field and controlled conditions) to determine if germination and seedling emergence were higher in disturbed environments where mineral soil was exposed. We sampled naturally established seedlings to evaluate the relationship between the year of establishment and caribou activity and to compare growth in disturbed and undisturbed environments. We found that seed viability was significantly higher in 2006–2007 compared with 1989–1995. The number of germinated seeds per cone increased by a factor >1000. Germination and seedling establishment were higher in the disturbed environment (mineral soil). Finally, although seedling establishment in areas with continuous lichen cover was rather constant over the last 50 years, 73.5% of the seedlings recorded on bare mineral soil became established in the years following high caribou activity. Our results suggest that climate warming and caribou activity are likely to act synergistically to promote black spruce regeneration at treeline. 3aPicea mariana 3aRangifer tarandus 3aclimatic factors 3agermination 3aglobal warming 3alichens 3amineral soils 3aplantations 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3atreeline 3atrees 3aviability1 aBoudreau, Stephane0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2011 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.460-468dNRC Research Press, National Research Council CanadawJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X10-1833Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02856naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245010000205300001800305506007600323520123600399506003701635650001601672650001401688650001001702650001301712650002201725650001601747650001101763650001701774650003601791650001501827650002901842700002701871700001501898700002101913700002001934700002501954700002001979700002001999700002002019773017302039852000902212856008302221930003302304946001302337655001202350IND4388012220221207073911.0070218e20070213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438801222DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06109931042doi7 aPMC18929562pmcid7 a172845922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaverna, Sean D.10aLong-distance combinatorial linkage between methylation and acetylation on histone H3 N termini  ap. 2086-2091.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndividual posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on histones have well established roles in certain biological processes, notably transcriptional programming. Recent genomewide studies describe patterns of covalent modifications, such as H3 methylation and acetylation at promoters of specific target genes, or "bivalent domains," in stem cells, suggestive of a possible combinatorial interplay between PTMs on the same histone. However, detection of long-range PTM associations is often problematic in antibody-based or traditional mass spectrometric-based analyses. Here, histone H3 from a ciliate model was analyzed as an enriched source of transcriptionally active chromatin. Using a recently developed mass spectrometric approach, combinatorial modification states on single, long N-terminal H3 fragments (residues 1-50) were determined. The entire modification status of intact N termini was obtained and indicated correlations between K4 methylation and H3 acetylation. In addition, K4 and K27 methylation were identified concurrently on one H3 species. This methodology is applicable to other histones and larger polypeptides and will likely be a valuable tool in understanding the roles of combinatorial patterns of PTMs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylation 3achromatin 3agenes 3ahistones 3amass spectrometry 3amethylation 3amodels 3apolypeptides 3apost-translational modification 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics)1 aUeberheide, Beatrix M.1 aLiu, Yifan1 aTackett, Alan J.1 aDiaz, Robert L.1 aShabanowitz, Jeffrey1 aChait, Brian T.1 aHunt, Donald F.1 aAllis, C.

A recently developed technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR), is used to examine the relationships between land use and water quality in eastern Massachusetts, USA. GWR models make great improvements of model performance over OLS models, which is proved by F-test and comparisons of model R ² and corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) from both GWR and OLS. GWR models also improve the reliabilities of the relationships by reducing spatial autocorrelations. The application of GWR models finds that the relationships between land use and water quality are not constant over space but show great spatial non-stationarity. GWR models are able to reveal the information previously ignored by OLS models on the local causes of water pollution, and so improve the model ability to explain local situation of water quality. The results of this study suggest that GWR technique has the potential to serve as a useful tool for environmental research and management at watershed, regional, national and even global scales. 3aspatial variation 3aland use 3awater quality 3ahydrologic models 3amathematical models 3aregression analysis 3awater pollution 2aAgriculture 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aGeographic Information Systemsxstatistics & numerical data 2aQuality Control 2aRegression Analysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Supplyxstandards 3aMassachusetts 0aMassachusetts1 aXia, Zong-Guo0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.358-378dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.09.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20090117b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03239naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100002400179245008500203300001600288500002400304500001500328520129700343650001401640650000901654650001501663650002601678650001401704650001001718650000901728650001201737650001101749650001101760650001201771650001301783650001301796650001801809650001101827650000901838650001201847650000701859650001301866650001101879650002901890650003301919650002901952650002701981650003402008650003102042650002102073650002202094650004102116651001102157651001102168653001102179700001502190700001802205700002502223773011202248852000902360856009102369930003302460945002502493946001102518655001202529IND4413101720140724000000.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310172DNAL7 a188042592pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.07.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM3001 aWällstedt, Teresia10aInfluence of liming on metal sequestration in lake sediments over recent decades  ap. 405-417.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSediment profiles from five limed and six reference softwater lakes included in Swedish monitoring programmes were subjected to multi-element analysis to investigate the influence of lime treatment since 1977 on the sequestration of metals in lake sediments. We hypothesised that liming causes increased sedimentation of elements for which the mobility is primarily controlled by pH, e.g. Al, Cd, Co, Ni and Zn, whereas elements that are less influenced by pH fluctuations, e.g. Hg and Pb, are not affected by lime treatment. Further, we introduce a normalisation of metal concentrations with respect to Cu concentration in order to separate the effects of lime treatment from those related to temporal trends in airborne metal deposition or short-term variations in environmental conditions. This approach is shown to emphasise the effect of liming on the sediment accumulation of metals, thus separating it from other sources of variability. We found that liming causes increased sequestration of Al, As, Cd, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn, in the case of As and Co probably at least partly caused by an increased adsorption to Al, Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides. On the other hand, no influence of lime treatment could be demonstrated for Hg, Pb, Cr, V and P, despite an increase of pH by about two units. 3amanganese 3alead 3aphosphorus 3abiogeochemical cycles 3asediments 3alakes 3airon 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aarsenic 3avanadium 3achromium 3aacidification 3aliming 3azinc 3amercury 3apH 3aaluminum 3anickel 3aenvironmental monitoring 2aCalcium Compoundsxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aOxidesxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aSweden 0aSweden 0ametals1 aBorg, Hans1 aMeili, Markus1 aMörth, Carl-Magnus.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.405-417dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.07.0623Available from publisher's Web site  a20090117b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245007100202300001800273506007600291520098500367506003701352650002001389650001901409650002301428650002101451650001401472650001101486650002101497650001801518650002301536650001701559700002301576700002201599773017301621852000901794856008301803930003301886946001301919655001201932IND4388011820221207080028.0070218e20070213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438801182DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06073261042doi7 aPMC18929752pmcid7 a172846112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikovska, Ema10aEukaryotic RNase P RNA mediates cleavage in the absence of protein  ap. 2062-2067.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe universally conserved ribonucleoprotein RNase P is involved in the processing of tRNA precursor transcripts. RNase P consists of one RNA and, depending on its origin, a variable number of protein subunits. Catalytic activity of the RNA moiety so far has been demonstrated only for bacterial and some archaeal RNase P RNAs but not for their eukaryotic counterparts. Here, we show that RNase P RNAs from humans and the lower eukaryote Giardia lamblia mediate cleavage of four tRNA precursors and a model RNA hairpin loop substrate in the absence of protein. Compared with bacterial RNase P RNA, the rate of cleavage (kobs) was five to six orders of magnitude lower, whereas the affinity for the substrate (appKd) was reduced [almost equal to]20- to 50-fold. We conclude that the RNA-based catalytic activity of RNase P has been preserved during evolution. This finding opens previously undescribed ways to study the role of the different proteins subunits of eukaryotic RNase P.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGiardia lamblia 3aRNA precursors 3acatalytic activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3ahumans 3aprotein subunits 3aribonucleases 3aribonucleoproteins 3atransfer RNA1 aSvärd, Staffan G.1 aKirsebom, Leif A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 13, v. 104, no. 7 p.2062-2067dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06073261043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070218b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03532naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245013600205300001800341506007600359520177300435506003702208650001302245650002302258650002102281650001602302650001902318650002302337650001702360650001502377650002302392650000902415650001902424650001302443650001802456650001802474650003002492650001402522700001802536700001902554700002002573700001602593700001902609700002302628700001602651773017302667852000902840856008302849930003302932946001302965655001202978IND4388011620221207080024.0070218e20070213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438801162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06085821042doi7 aPMC18929852pmcid7 a172676092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCedervall, Tommy10aUnderstanding the nanoparticle-protein corona using methods to quantify exchange rates and affinities of proteins for nanoparticles  ap. 2050-2055.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDue to their small size, nanoparticles have distinct properties compared with the bulk form of the same materials. These properties are rapidly revolutionizing many areas of medicine and technology. Despite the remarkable speed of development of nanoscience, relatively little is known about the interaction of nanoscale objects with living systems. In a biological fluid, proteins associate with nanoparticles, and the amount and presentation of the proteins on the surface of the particles leads to an in vivo response. Proteins compete for the nanoparticle "surface," leading to a protein "corona" that largely defines the biological identity of the particle. Thus, knowledge of rates, affinities, and stoichiometries of protein association with, and dissociation from, nanoparticles is important for understanding the nature of the particle surface seen by the functional machinery of cells. Here we develop approaches to study these parameters and apply them to plasma and simple model systems, albumin and fibrinogen. A series of copolymer nanoparticles are used with variation of size and composition (hydrophobicity). We show that isothermal titration calorimetry is suitable for studying the affinity and stoichiometry of protein binding to nanoparticles. We determine the rates of protein association and dissociation using surface plasmon resonance technology with nanoparticles that are thiol-linked to gold, and through size exclusion chromatography of protein-nanoparticle mixtures. This method is less perturbing than centrifugation, and is developed into a systematic methodology to isolate nanoparticle-associated proteins. The kinetic and equilibrium binding properties depend on protein identity as well as particle surface characteristics and size.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalbumins 3abinding properties 3abinding proteins 3acalorimetry 3acentrifugation 3acomposite polymers 3adissociation 3afibrinogen 3agel chromatography 3agold 3ahydrophobicity 3amedicine 3ananoparticles 3astoichiometry 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atitration1 aLynch, Iseult1 aLindman, Stina1 aBerggård, Tord1 aThulin, Eva1 aNilsson, Hanna1 aDawson, Kenneth A.1 aLinse, Sara0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 13, v. 104, no. 7 p.2050-2055dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06085821043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070218b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03414naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002200188245010600210300001600316500002400332520176000356650002302116650001702139650001902156650002002175650001802195650001002213650002802223650001702251650001102268650001102279650001402290650002002304650000902324650001002333650003102343650002902374650002202403650003102425650003002456650001702486651001002503653002902513700002502542773011202567852000902679856009102688930003302779945002502812946001102837655001202848IND4413100620140724000000.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310062DNAL7 a188055712pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aK8101 aGarcía-Marco, S.10aShort- and medium-term effects of fire and fire-fighting chemicals on soil micronutrient availability  ap. 297-303.  aIncludes references  aThe impact of fire and three fire-fighting chemicals (FFC) on soil micronutrient availability was evaluated 1, 90 and 365 days after a prescribed fire. Five treatments were considered: unburnt soil (US) and burnt soil with 2 l m⁻² of water (BS) or water with foaming agent Auxquímica RFC-88 at 1% (BS+Fo), Firesorb at 1.5% (BS+Fi) and FR-Cross ammonium polyphosphate at 20% (BS+Ap). Pre-fire contents of available micronutrient were homogeneous among plots and high (Fe, Zn) or insufficient (Co, Cu, Mn) for plant nutrition. At t =1 day, Fe availability decreased greatly in burnt treatments, with significant differences in BS+Fi (-50%) and BS+Ap (-75%), contrasting with Fe richness of the ammonium polyphosphate. The fire induced a significant increase (9-16x) of available Mn in burnt treatments that lasted for at least three months; the FFC effect on soil available Mn was imperceptible, despite the noticeable amounts of Mn they supplied (especially Firesorb and ammonium polyphosphate). In burnt soils, the Fe/Mn ratio also decreased strongly (92-99%) and significantly till t =90 days. A high increase was also found, at t =1 day, for the available Zn in all burnt treatments and, although the ammonium polyphosphate provided more Zn than the Firesorb, the increment was only significant in BS+Fi plots (+100%). Neither fire nor FFC effects on soil Cu availability were found. The slight increase of Co availability in BS, BS+Fo and BS+Ap at t =1 day was followed by a transient decrease in all burnt treatments at t =90 days. Except the Mn and the Fe/Mn ratio in BS+Ap, which remained significantly higher and lower, respectively, the indices of available micronutrients at t =365 days in all burnt soils were similar to the pre-fire levels. 3aprescribed burning 3aforest fires 3asoil nutrients 3abioavailability 3afire fighting 3afoams 3aammonium polyphosphates 3aforest soils 3acobalt 3acopper 3amanganese 3aplant nutrition 3airon 2aFires 2aFlame Retardantsxanalysis 2aMicronutrientsxanalysis 2aPlant Development 2aSoilxanalysisxstandards. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aTime Factors 3aSpain 0afire-fighting chemicals;1 aGonzález-Prieto, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.297-303dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20090117b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03032naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008900168300001600257500002400273520197400297650001502271650001402286650001502300650000902315653002402324653000802348653001402356653002702370653003902397700002502436700002302461700002302484773010602507852000902613856004802622655001202670IND4396245620221121053131.0071021e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439624562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-006-9021-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgüera, Francisco10aMinimising the Earthwork Cost in the Construction of Irrigation Offstream Reservoirs  ap. 375-397.  aIncludes references  aIn the majority of agricultural areas it is necessary to construct irrigation offstream reservoirs to store the required amount of water to be available at any time. In this type of projects, the earthwork can represent up to 80% of the total budget, therefore, one of the criteria in their design is minimising this cost. Due to the fact that the minimising process is carried out by the trial and error method, calculating the cost in different locations and devoting a great deal of time and effort to these calculations, finding the definite location for the lowest earthwork cost is very complicated and difficult to achieve. In this study a computer application which carries out this process is presented. Once the geometry of the offstream reservoir has been defined, as well as that of the land where it will be located and the cut and fill surfaces slopes, a boundary can be fixed within which it will be constructed, and the computer application will perform automatically the calculation of the cost of the earthwork in a series of locations. The different locations within the defined limit are obtained by moving the offstream reservoir along West-East and South-North directions, changing the crown elevation, and even making it rotate with regard to a vertical axis. The range of values for these movements and the increase in variation as they go from one to the next will determine the number of places where the cost of the earthwork will be calculated. The cost function incorporated to the programme allows to take into account the types of materials that will be excavated and the disposition of the soil layers. In the first place, a series of algorithms are detailed which have been developed to do the calculations, then the computer application is described which integrates these algorithms, and finally an application of the programme is explained in which the minimum cost is sought for an offstream reservoir with a capacity of 100000 m³. 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3airrigation 3asoil 0aoffstream reservoir 0aDTM 0aearthwork 0aminimum earthwork cost 0aoptimal offstream reservoir design1 aAguilar, Fernando J.1 aAguilar, Manuel A.1 aCarvajal, Fernando0 tWater resources management.g2007 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.375-397dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-006-9021-7 7aarticle03280naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160100001900169245009500188300001600283500002400299500001500323520171700338650002302055650001902078650002502097650001502122650003002137650002102167650003502188650002002223650001602243650001502259650001402274650002102288650001502309651001102324653001402335700001702349700001902366700001702385700001702402700001602419700002202435773011202457852000902569856009102578930003302669945002502702946001102727655001202738IND4413103220221121042933.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aW0001 aCentofanti, T.10aDevelopment of agro-environmental scenarios to support pesticide risk assessment in Europe  ap. 574-588.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper describes work carried out within the EU-funded FOOTPRINT project to characterize the diversity of European agricultural and environmental conditions with respect to parameters which most influence the environmental fate of pesticides. Pan-European datasets for soils, climate, land cover and cropping were intersected, using GIS, to identify the full range of unique combinations of climate, soil and crop types which characterize European agriculture. The resulting FOOTPRINT European agro-environmental dataset constitutes a large number of polygons (approximately 1,700,000) with attribute data files for i) area fractions of annual crops related to each arable-type polygon (as an indicator of its probability of occurrence); and, ii) area fractions of each soil type in each polygon (as an indicator of its probability of occurrence). A total of 25,044 unique combinations of climate zones, agricultural land cover classes, administrative units and soil map units were identified. The same soil/crop combinations occur in many polygons which have the same climate while the fractions of the soils and arable crops are different. The number of unique combinations of climate, soil and agricultural land cover class is therefore only 7961. 26-year daily meteorological data, soil profile characteristics and crop management features were associated with each unique combination. The agro-environmental scenarios developed can be used to underpin the parameterization of environmental fate models for pesticides and should also have relevance for other agricultural pollutants. The implications for the improvement and further development of risk assessment procedures for pesticides are discussed. 3aenvironmental fate 3aagroecosystems 3aenvironmental models 3aestimation 3agroundwater contamination 3acropping systems 3ageographic information systems 3arisk assessment 3amethodology 3asoil types 3adatabases 3aclimatic factors 3apesticides 3aEurope 0apollution1 aHollis, J.M.1 aBlenkinsop, S.1 aFowler, H.J.1 aTruckell, I.1 aDubus, I.G.1 aReichenberger, S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.574-588dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090121b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02797naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002200154245014500176300001600321500002400337520143100361650002301792650001501815650001101830650001501841650001001856650001101866650001001877650002501887650004601912650002901958650002801987650002402015650002702039650004802066650002502114700002202139700001802161700001902179773010602198852000902304856003802313655001202351IND4449368020221121043026.0110211e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444936802DNAL7 a211047932pmid7 a10.1002/ps.20622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adeBoer, Gerrit J.14aThe impact of uptake, translocation and metabolism on the differential selectivity between blackgrass and wheat for the herbicide pyroxsulam  ap. 279-286.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Wheat shows selectivity to pyroxsulam, a new broad-spectrum herbicide with high activity on blackgrass. Studies were performed to establish whether uptake, translocation or metabolism were responsible for the differential activity in wheat compared with blackgrass. In addition, the effect of the safener cloquintocet-mexyl on metabolism was evaluated in wheat and blackgrass shoots. RESULTS: Root uptake of pyroxsulam in blackgrass was significantly higher than in wheat, suggesting a possible activity enhancement in blackgrass owing to root uptake. Translocation to foliage from root uptake as well as translocation out of treated foliage following foliar applications was low in wheat compared with blackgrass, likely owing to the rapid metabolism of pyroxsulam in wheat. Wheat metabolized pyroxsulam significantly faster than blackgrass to the less active O-dealkylation product. Wheat shoots metabolized pyroxsulam faster when the safener cloquintocet-mexyl was present, but cloquintocet-mexyl did not increase the rate of metabolism in blackgrass. CONCLUSIONS: The selectivity of pyroxsulam to wheat relative to blackgrass was connected primarily with differences in the rate of metabolism and generation of an inactive metabolite. Metabolism in wheat restricted subsequent movement of radioactivity out of the treated leaf. The rapid metabolism in wheat was increased by the addition of cloquintocet-mexyl. 3afoliar application 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aroots 3ashoots 3awheat 2aBiological Transport 2aHerbicidesxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPoaceaexmetabolism 2aQuinolinesxmetabolism 2aSulfonamidesxmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 2aTriticumxmetabolism1 aThornburgh, Scott1 aGilbert, Jeff1 aGast, Roger E.0 tPest management science.g2011 Mar., v. 67, no. 3 p.279-286dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.2062 7aarticle04132naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001400197245011500211300001600326500002400342500001500366520193100381650001402312650001702326650000902343650001602352650001602368650002202384650001302406650001302419650000902432650001202441650002602453650002702479650002702506650002002533650001102553650001202564650001302576650001302589650000902602650001302611650001802624650001202642650004402654650003802698650006802736650006002804650005802864650001702922651001002939651001002949653002802959653001902987700001503006700001603021700002703037700001403064700001503078773011203093852000903205856009103214930003303305945002503338946001103363655001203374IND4413103920221121032553.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310392DNAL7 a188356312pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.07.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aW000 0aF3001 aSorbo, S.10aTrace element accumulation in Pseudevernia furfuracea (L.)

Faito (province of Naples), were transplanted and exposed in bags at different sites in Acerra district, classified into three different site types (urban, rural and industrial). We aimed to test the hypothesis that P. furfuracea, when transplanted in the district of Acerra, would respond to air pollution accumulating trace elements and that element concentrations in the exposed lichens were different in relation to the three different environments, characterised by different pollution sources. Samples were exposed for six months, periodically collected and examined by ICP MS spectrometer assays to measure concentrations of 10 trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, V and Zn). The exposed samples showed increases in concentrations of all the examined elements; the trace element concentrations were evaluated by calculating exposed to control (EC) ratios, for each site and each trace element, to better understand the accumulation rates. EC ratios were evaluated after 3 and 6 month exposures, at the end of spring and summer respectively: 6 month EC values were the highest. The urban sites showed EC ratios generally higher than industrial and rural; the most accumulated elements were Pb and Cu (at the urban sites), Cu and Zn (at the industrial sites), and Cu and As (at the rural sites). The chemical data were then processed using a multivariate approach (ordination, PCA) to better understand environmental gradients. Bioaccumulation data and PCA analysis showed the sampling sites separated by different trace element abundance. Trace element abundance patterns in the three site types are discussed in relation to the land use and the pollution sources. 3amanganese 3aParmeliaceae 3alead 3aurban areas 3arural areas 3amass spectrometry 3aland use 3aindustry 3airon 3acadmium 3amultivariate analysis 3apoint source pollution 3aenvironmental exposure 3abioaccumulation 3acopper 3aarsenic 3avanadium 3achromium 3azinc 3aaluminum 3aair pollution 3alichens 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aLichensxchemistryxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aTrace Elementsxanalysisxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aUrbanization 3aItaly 0aItaly 0aPseudevernia furfuracea 0atrace elements1 aAprile, G.1 aStrumia, S.1 aCastaldo Cobianchi, R.1 aLeone, A.1 aBasile, A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.647-654dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.07.0713Available from publisher's Web site  a20090121b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03105naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100002300218245004500241300001800286506007600304520150300380506003701883650002901920650001101949650001701960650002101977650002301998650001802021650001602039650001502055650002902070650002602099650003102125650001502156653002202171653002802193700002202221700002002243773017302263852000902436856008302445930003302528945002502561946001302586655001202599IND4388014820221207054947.0070218e20070213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438801482DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06066771042doi7 aPMC17942182pmcid7 a172846132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Many essential cellular functions have been shown to be separated temporally during each cycle; however, the regulatory mechanisms involved in oscillatory dynamics remain to be elucidated. Through GC-MS analysis we found that the majority of metabolites show oscillatory dynamics, with 70% of the identified metabolite concentrations peaking in conjunction with NAD(P)H. Through statistical analyses of microarray data, we identified that biosynthetic events have a defined order, and this program is initiated when respiration rates are increasing. We then combined metabolic, transcriptional data and statistical analyses of transcription factor activity, identified the top oscillatory parameters, and filtered a large-scale yeast interaction network according to these parameters. The analyses and controlled experimental perturbation provided evidence that a transcriptional complex formed part of the timing circuit for biosynthetic, reductive, and cell cycle programs in the cell. This circuitry does not act in isolation because both have strong translational, proteomic, and metabolic regulatory mechanisms. Our data lead us to conclude that the regulation of the respiratory oscillation revolves around coupled subgraphs containing large numbers of proteins and metabolites, with a potential to oscillate, and no definable hierarchy, i.e., heterarchical control.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ayeasts 3acell culture 3acell respiration 3atemporal variation 3acytochemistry 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3agene expression regulation 3acell cycle 0ahigh cell density 0arespiratory oscillation1 aBeckmann, Manfred1 aKitano, Hiroaki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 13, v. 104, no. 7 p.2241-2246dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06066771043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070913b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle03735naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001500179245012500194300001600319500002400335500001500359520175100374650001402125650001402139650002702153650001102180650001102191650001902202650000902221650001302230650000902243650001302252650000902265650001702274650001202291650001102303650002102314650001902335650003802354650003302392650004002425650001802465650002202483650001502505650004102520650005302561651001102614651001202625651001102637653001102648700001202659700001502671700001902686700001602705700001902721700001602740773011202756852000902868856009102877930003302968945002503001946001103026655001203037IND4413102120221121032531.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310212DNAL7 a188346162pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aLesven, L.10aEarly diagenetic processes aspects controlling the mobility of dissolved trace metals in three riverine sediment columns  ap. 447-459.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe behaviour of Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Cd, Pb and Ni has been studied during early diagenesis in three different riverine sediments (Spierre, Lys and Sheldt). For that purpose (1) pore waters were extracted from sediment cores by centrifugation under nitrogen and further analyzed for the determination of total dissolved metal concentrations and (2) DET and DGT probes have been deployed in situ for the determination of high resolution profiles of labile and total dissolved metal concentrations. Furthermore, sulfidization processes have been examined; they revealed a production of pyrite near the water-sediment interface at Helkijn and Wervik sampling sites, probably due to a partial re-oxidation of reduced sulphur species. In Spierre sediments, where Eh values are the most negative, pyrite production should be mainly due to strict anaerobic processes. Concentrations of AVS in Spierre sediments are also very high and result in low TI values and low trace metal concentrations in the pore waters. Otherwise, in Wervik sediments, the low pH values combined to a TI value close to 0 results in the highest observed dissolved trace metal levels. DOS remains low at the three sites, since it does not exceed 0.4. In Wervik and Helkijn, the limitation is probably due to low sedimentary inputs of sulphate. In Spierre, sulphate is never exhausted in the pore water, suggesting a limitation of the DOS by a lack of bio-degradable organic matter. Values of Cd, Cu and Pb DGT concentrations remain low in pore waters whatever the site, due to their strong affinity with the reduced sulphur pool. It has also been demonstrated that the labile fractions of Pb and Cd are the lowest and do not exceed 0.5, while Co and Ni are the most available metals. 3asediments 3amanganese 3asediment contamination 3arivers 3acobalt 3aorganic matter 3azinc 3asulfates 3alead 3asulfides 3airon 3ageochemistry 3acadmium 3anickel 3abiodegradability 3acentrifugation 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysisxchemistry. 2aParticle Size 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSolubility 2aTrace Elementsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 3aFrance 3aBelgium 0aFrance 0ametals1 aGao, Y.1 aBillon, G.1 aLeermakers, M.1 aOuddane, B.1 aFischer, J.-C.1 aBaeyens, W.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.447-459dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0333Available from publisher's Web site  a20090117b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03932naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001900188245010400207300001600311500002400327500001500351520202300366650004402389650002402433650002102457650001502478650002402493650001402517650002102531650001102552650001702563650002002580650001402600650002002614650001502634650001802649650001402667650001302681650002902694650003102723650002302754650002802777650003002805650001302835650003102848650001302879651001402892651001402906653001202920700001702932700002002949700002002969773011202989852000903101856009103110930003303201945002503234946001103259655001203270IND4413102320221121032556.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310232DNAL7 a188483452pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ2001 aDodla, Syam K.10aDenitrification potential and its relation to organic carbon quality in three coastal wetland soils  ap. 471-480.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCapacity of a wetland to remove nitrate through denitrification is controlled by its physico-chemical and biological characteristics. Understanding these characteristics will help better to guide beneficial use of wetlands in processing nitrate. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) quality and denitrification rate in Louisiana coastal wetlands. Composite soil samples of different depths were collected from three different wetlands along a salinity gradient, namely, bottomland forest swamp (FS), freshwater marsh (FM), and saline marsh (SM) located in the Barataria Basin estuary. Potential denitrification rate (PDR) was measured by acetylene inhibition method and distribution of carbon (C) moieties in organic C was determined by ¹³C solid-state NMR. Of the three wetlands, the FM soil profile exhibited the highest PDR on both unit weight and unit volume basis as compared to FS and SM. The FM also tended to yield higher amount of N₂O as compared to the FS and SM especially at earlier stages of denitrification, suggesting incomplete reduction of NO₃ ⁻ at FM and potential for emission of N₂O. Saline marsh soil profile had the lowest PDR on the unit volume basis. Increasing incubation concentration from 2 to 10 mg NO₃ ⁻-N L⁻¹ increased PDR by 2 to 6 fold with the highest increase in the top horizons of FS and SM soils. Regression analysis showed that across these three wetland systems, organic C has significant effect in regulating PDR. Of the compositional C moieties, polysaccharides positively influenced denitrification rate whereas phenolics (likely phenolic adehydes and ketonics) negatively affected denitrification rate in these wetland soils. These results could have significant implication in integrated assessment and management of wetlands for treating nutrient-rich biosolids and wastewaters, non-point source agricultural runoff, and nitrate found in the diverted Mississippi River water used for coastal restoration. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asoil organic carbon 3anitrate nitrogen 3asoil depth 3aregression analysis 3abiosolids 3asalt marsh soils 3acoasts 3asalt marshes 3alowland forests 3aacetylene 3adenitrification 3awastewater 3awetland soils 3aestuaries 3anitrates 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHumic Substancesxanalysis 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrous Oxidexanalysis 2aPolysaccharidesxanalysis 2aSalinity 2aSoilxanalysisxstandards. 2aWetlands 3aLouisiana 0aLouisiana 0amarshes1 aWang, Jim J.1 aDeLaune, Ron D.1 aCook, Robert L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.471-480dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20090117b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03418naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100002500179245010400204300001400308500002400322520185700346650001902203650001702222650001602239650003002255650001702285650002102302650001602323650002902339650005502368650004002423650003002463651001802493651001202511651002002523651001202543700002002555700002002575700001902595700001902614773011002633852000902743856009102752930003302843945002502876946001102901655001202912IND4413102820221121032603.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310282DNAL7 a188381532pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aKalinovich, Indra K.10aRemediation of PCB contaminated soils in the Canadian Arctic: Excavation and surface PRB technology  ap. 53-66.  aIncludes references  aThe site BAF-5 is located on the summit of Resolution Island, Nunavut, just southeast of Baffin Island at 61° 35'N and 60° 40'W. The site was part of a North American military defense system established in the 1950s that became heavily contaminated with PCBs during and subsequent, its operational years. Remediation through excavation of the PCB contaminated soil at Resolution Island began in 1999 and at its completion in 2006 approximately 5 tonnes of pure PCBs in approximately 20,000 m³ of soil were remediated. Remediation strategies were based on both quantity of soil and level of contamination in the soil. Excavation removed 96% of the PCB contaminated soil on site. In 2003, a surface funnel-and-gate permeable reactive barrier was design and constructed to treat the remaining contamination left in rock crevices and inaccessible areas of the site. Excavation had destabilized contaminated soil in the area, enabling contaminant migration through erosion and runoff pathways. The barrier was designed to maximize sedimentation through settling ponds. This bulk removal enabled the treatment of highly contaminated fines and water through a permeable gate. The increased sediment loading during excavation required both modifications to the funnel and a shift to a more permeable, granular system. Granulated activated charcoal was chosen for its ability to both act as a particle retention filter and adsorptive filter. The reduction in mass of PCB and volume of soils trapped by the funnel of the barrier indicate that soils are re-stabilizing. In 2007, nonwoven geotextiles were re-introduced back into the filtration system as fine filtering could be achieved without clogging. Monitoring sites downstream indicate that the barrier system is effective. This paper describes the field progress of PCB remediation at Resolution Island. 3apolluted soils 3afrozen soils 3aremediation 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apermeability 3aactivated carbon 3ageotextiles 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysis 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 3aArctic region 3aNunavut 0aArctic regions. 0aNunavut1 aRutter, Allison1 aPoland, John S.1 aCairns, Graham1 aRowe, R.

The prevalence of sensitization to various allergens were as follows: Dermatophagoides farinae (74.56%), Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (53.51%), house dust (26.32%), American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) (23.68%), Para glass (21.93%) and mixed ants (20.18%). No relationship was noted between the various allergen groups and the location of the skin lesions except for those animals that reacted to pollens which appeared to have be more likely to have lesion affecting the perineum and tail area (p =0.022; OR, 6.429; 95% CI, 1.003-40.292). 3adogs 3adog diseases 3aatopic dermatitis 3aetiology 3aallergens 3aaerosols 3arisk assessment 3aepidemiological studies 3aurban areas 3askin tests 3aallergenicity 3askin lesions 3apruritus 3aDermatophagoides farinae 3aDermatophagoides pteronyssinus 3aGlycyphagus domesticus 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aFormicidae 3aglass 2aAllergensxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aDermatitis, Atopicxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aDogs 2aDust 2aFungi 2aInsecta. 2aIntradermal Testsxveterinary 2aPollen 2aPyroglyphidae 3aThailand 0aThailand1 aAnaman, Sawanya1 aBuathet, Krissanee0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.256-262dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.07.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/12/29  aNon-US 7aarticle04348naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001500197245017200212300001600384500002400400520205000424650001802474650001702492650000902509650001402518650001602532650001902548650001502567650001902582650001002601650002102611650003102632650001902663650002502682650001902707650002502726650001602751650002002767650001902787650001802806650002302824650002002847650001702867650002602884650001602910650004002926650004602966650002903012650002903041650003703070650007103107650003303178650003703211650001703248650001203265651001003277651001003287700002403297773011203321852000903433856009103442930003303533945002503566946001103591655001203602IND4413104320221121014319.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310432DNAL7 a189628262pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aW000 0aF2001 aRai, Richa10aEvaluation of physiological and biochemical responses of two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars to ambient air pollution using open top chambers at a rural site in India  ap. 679-691.  aIncludes references  aAir pollutant concentrations are rising in India, causing potential threats to crop production. As air pollutants are known to interfere with physiological processes, this study was conducted to assess the relative responses of physiological and biochemical characteristics of two cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Saurabh 950 and NDR 97) leading to variable yield responses. Twelve hour monitoring of ambient concentrations of SO₂, NO₂ and O₃ in filtered chambers (FCs), non-filtered chambers (NFCs) and open plots (OPs) showed that O₃ was the main pollutant at the experimental site. Ozone concentrations often exceeded 40 ppb during anthesis but not during the vegetative growth period. Photosynthetic rate (Ps), stomatal conductance (g s) and Fv/Fm ratio, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities and photosynthetic pigments, ascorbic acid, total phenolics and protein contents were assessed at different developmental stages and yield of grains were quantified. Lipid peroxidation, SOD and POD activities, ascorbic acid and total phenolics were higher, whereas Ps, g s, Fv/Fm ratio and contents of protein and photosynthetic pigment were lower in plants of NFCs as compared to FCs. Yield decreased significantly in both cultivars grown in NFCs. NDR 97 showed less reductions in physiological characteristics, photosynthetic pigments and protein, but a greater increase in the antioxidative defense system as compared to Saurabh 950. Yield reduction was higher in NDR 97 than in Saurabh 950. This suggested that NDR 97 utilized more photosynthate in maintaining the metabolic machinery against O₃ stress leading to lower translocation of photosynthate to reproductive parts. The study concluded that under natural field conditions, physiological and biochemical responses of plants varied with pollutant concentrations leading to different translocation strategies in plants, modifying their yield responses. NDR 97, a fast growing and high yielding cultivar was more sensitive than slow growing Saurabh 950. 3aair pollution 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3acultivars 3arural areas 3aplant response 3acrop yield 3asulfur dioxide 3aozone 3anitrogen dioxide 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3agrowing season 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aperoxidases 3aenzyme activity 3aplant pigments 3aascorbic acid 3aphenolic compounds 3aprotein content 3aantioxidants 3afield experimentation 2aAgriculture 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aAir Pollutionxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aOryzaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aPigments, Biologicalxmetabolism 2aRural Health 2aSeasons 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aAgrawal, Madhoolika0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.679-691dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.09.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090121b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03562naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002500188245015900213300001600372500002400388500001500412520126200427650001001689650001701699650001101716650000801727650001101735650001801746650001301764650001201777650002701789650001101816650001201827650001501839650001301854650001401867650000901881650002401890650001101914650002401925650002101949650002901970650001501999650001002014650000902024650002502033650003802058650003602096650003902132650001102171650002202182650001102204650001502215650000902230650002502239650001602264650001602280651001002296651001002306653001102316700002102327700001802348700002702366700002002393700001702413700002102430773011202451852000902563856009102572930003302663945002502696946001102721655001202732IND4413104120140724000000.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310412DNAL7 a188422892pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX385 0aW0001 aAguilera, Inmaculada10aBiomonitoring of urinary metals in a population living in the vicinity of industrial sources: A comparison with the general population of Andalusia, Spain  ap. 669-678.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Ria of Huelva (south-west Spain) is one of the most polluted fluvial-estuarine systems in the world. Industrial activity delivers huge amounts of pollutants to the local environment, particularly heavy metals and arsenic. Here we aimed to determine urinary levels of As, Cd, Cr, Cu and Ni in a representative sample (n =857) of adults living in the Ria of Huelva. Levels were compared to those from a representative sample of 861 adults of the general urban population of Andalusia (southern Spain) and multiple regression models were developed to identify individual factors associated with urinary levels of these elements. Arsenic levels were significantly higher in the Ria of Huelva as compared to other Andalusian cities, whereas Cd and Ni levels were significantly lower. Despite these differences, levels in both groups were similar to the reference values reported in previous studies for general population. Age, gender, diet and lifestyle were the major factors contributing to the interindividual variation in urinary metals. In conclusion, despite living in a highly polluted area, the population of the Ria of Huelva failed to show higher urinary levels of the studied metals as compared to a reference urban population of the same region. 3aurine 3aheavy metals 3agender 3aage 3aadults 3apublic health 3aindustry 3acadmium 3aenvironmental exposure 3acopper 3aarsenic 3apollutants 3achromium 3alifestyle 3adiet 3aregression analysis 3anickel 3areference standards 3aurban population 3aenvironmental monitoring 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCase-Control Studies 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxurine 2aExtraction and Processing Industry 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMetals, Heavyxurine 2aMiddle Aged 2aYoung Adult 3aSpain 0aSpain 0ametals1 aDaponte, Antonio1 aGil, Fernando1 aHernández, Antonio F.1 aGodoy, Patricia1 aPla, Antonio1 aRamos, Juan Luis0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.669-678dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.08.0413Available from publisher's Web site  a20090121b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02953naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001900179245010600198300001400304500002400318520114600342650000901488650001301497650001901510650002001529650001901549650003001568650001201598650002101610650002001631650001601651650001601667650003401683650002301717650003901740650002001779650005101799650002401850650004501874650002301919650005301942650001301995651001502008700002502023700001802048700003002066773011002096852000902206856009102215930003302306945002502339946001102364655001202375IND4413105020221121014245.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310502DNAL7 a189379632pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aZhang, Yiqiang10aEffect of zero-valent iron and a redox mediator on removal of selenium in agricultural drainage water  ap. 89-96.  aIncludes references  aEffective and economical removal of selenium (Se) in agricultural drainage water is very important in Se bioremediation. Zero-valent iron (ZVI) and a redox mediator [anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS)] were assessed for their ability to enhance the removal of Se(VI) or Se(IV) (500 μg/L) in synthetic drainage water by Enterobacter taylorae. The results showed that E. taylorae was capable of using inexpensive sucrose to remove Se from the drainage water. During a 7-day experiment, Se(VI) was almost entirely reduced to Se(0) and transformed to organic Se in the drainage water with sucrose levels of 500 to 1000 mg/L. Addition of ZVI to the drainage water increased the removal of total soluble Se to 94.5-96.5% and limited the production of organic Se. Addition of AQDS to the drainage water with or without ZVI decreased Se(VI) removal, but enhanced the removal of Se(IV), suggesting that E. taylorae only can use anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AHQDS, a reduced form of AQDS) to respire Se(IV), and not Se(VI). These results show that ZVI has promising application potential in the bioremediation of Se in Se-contaminated water. 3airon 3aselenium 3adrainage water 3awater treatment 3abioremediation 3aEnterobacter cancerogenus 3asucrose 3awater solubility 3awater pollution 3aagriculture 2aAgriculture 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDrainage, Sanitary 2aEnterobacterxgrowth & development 2aIronxchemistry 2aOrganoselenium Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSelenium Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSucrosexchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWetlands 0aCalifornia1 aAmrhein, Christopher1 aChang, Andrew1 aFrankenberger, William T.0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.89-96dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.09.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090114b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03362naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100002300235245005500258300001800313500001500331506007600346520160400422506003702026650002402063650002502087650000902112650001402121650001002135650002502145650002802170653001002198653001102208653001502219700001502234700001902249700002302268700001302291700002402304700001402328700001902342700002302361700002002384700001402404700001802418773017302436852000902609856008302618930003302701945002502734946001302759655001202772IND4388015320221207075249.0070218e20070213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438801532DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06103851042doi7 aPMC18929652pmcid7 a172845992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A suitable observation for this purpose would consist of polymorphic data on a large and unbiased collection of genes from two closely related species, each having a large and stable population. In this study, we sequenced 419 genes from 24 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives. Together with data from Drosophila simulans, these data reveal the following. (i) Approximately 10% of the loci in regions of normal recombination are much less polymorphic at silent sites than expected, hinting at the action of selective sweeps. (ii) The level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with the rate of nonsynonymous divergence across loci. Thus, even under strict neutrality, the ratio of amino acid to silent nucleotide changes (A:S) between Drosophila species is expected to be 25-40% higher than the A:S ratio for polymorphism when data are pooled across the genome. (iii) The observed A/S ratio between species among the 419 loci is 28.9% higher than the (adjusted) neutral expectation. We estimate that nearly 30% of the amino acid substitutions between D. melanogaster and its close relatives were adaptive. (iv) This signature of adaptive evolution is observable only in regions of normal recombination. Hence, the low level of polymorphism observed in regions of reduced recombination may not be driven primarily by positive selection. Finally, we discuss the theories and data pertaining to the interpretation of adaptive evolution in genomic studies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila simulans 3agenetic polymorphism 3aloci 3aevolution 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aDrosophila melanogaster 0alines 0agenome 0aDrosophila1 aHuang, Wei1 aZhang, Chenhui1 aHubisz, Melissa J.1 aLu, Jian1 aTurissini, David A.1 aFang, Shu1 aWang, Hurng-Yi1 aHudson, Richard R.1 aNielsen, Rasmus1 aChen, Zhu1 aWu, Chung -I.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 13, v. 104, no. 7 p.2271-2276dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06103851043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070913b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle02444naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100002000235245005500255300001800310500001500328506007600343520094800419506003701367650002301404650002801427650002501455650002501480653003201505653002201537653001501559653002901574653002601603700002101629773017301650852000901823856008301832930003301915945002501948946001301973655001201986IND4388015420221207075259.0070218e20070213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438801542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06071051042doi7 aPMC18929842pmcid7 a172873572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We have analyzed polymorphisms and substitutions in Drosophila, using a more sensitive inference method for adaptations than the standard population-genetic tests. We find evidence that selection itself is strongly time-dependent, with changes occurring at nearly the rate of neutral evolution. At the same time, higher than previously estimated levels of selection make adaptive responses by a factor 10-100 faster than the pace of selection changes, ensuring that adaptations are an efficient mode of evolution under time-dependent selection. The rate of selection changes is faster in noncoding DNA, i.e., the inference of functional elements can less be based on sequence conservation than for proteins. Our results suggest that selection acts not only as a constraint but as a major driving force of genomic change.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atemporal variation 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3agenetic polymorphism 3aartificial selection 0anonsynonymous substitutions 0aadaptive response 0aadaptation 0atime-dependent selection 0afluctuating selection1 aLässig, Michael0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 13, v. 104, no. 7 p.2277-2282dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06071051043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070912b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle03832naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100002000204245018500224300001600409500002400425520159700449650001302046650002702059650002002086650003702106650001702143650002102160650002002181650001002201650001802211650002002229650001702249650002102266650001202287650005002299650001102349650002802360650002702388650004502415650002402460650003702484650000902521650002402530650004602554650004702600650004602647650003002693650005202723700002302775700002002798700001602818700001802834700001802852773009702870852000902967856008902976930003303065945002503098946001103123655001203134IND4413108320221121001352.0081128e20081211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310832DNAL7 a189807822pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL200 0aM0011 aYamauchi, Ryoko10aEffects of synthetic polycyclic musks on estrogen receptor, vitellogenin, pregnane X receptor, and cytochrome P450 3A gene expression in the livers of male medaka (Oryzias latipes)  ap. 261-268.  aIncludes references  aThis study demonstrates the effects of synthetic polycyclic musks such as Galaxolide (HHCB), Tonalide (AHTN), Traseolide (ATII), Celestolide (ADBI), Phantolide (AHMI) and Cashmeran (DPMI), both on the early life stage and on gene expression in the livers of male medaka (Oryzias latipes). The toxicity ranking (the 96-h median lethal concentration) of the chemicals tested on 24-h-old medaka larvae descended in the order HHCB (0.95mg/L)=ATII (0.95mg/L)>AHTN (1.0mg/L)>AHMI (1.2mg/L)>ADBI (2.0mg/L)[double greater-than sign]DPMI (12mg/L), indicating high acute toxicity of these compounds on the early life stages of medaka. Expression analysis of hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) protein showed potential estrogenic effects upon the addition of AHTN and HHCB, indicative of the induction of VTG synthesis in the livers of male medaka. We also investigated mRNA expression levels of two estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes (ERα and β), two VTGs (VTG I and II), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and two cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3As (CYP3A38 and 3A40) in the livers of male medaka treated with AHTN and HHCB at 5, 50 and 500μg/L. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that hepatic ERα, VTG I, VTG II, and CYP3A40 mRNA responded to 500μg/L of AHTN and/or HHCB after 3 days exposure, whereas no effects of these compounds on ERβ, PXR, and CYP3A38 mRNA transcription were observed. These results suggest that certain polycyclic musks, including AHTN and HHCB, induce the expression levels of hepatic ERα and VTG mRNA/protein and modulate expression levels of CYP3A40 mRNA in the livers of male medaka. 3aperfumes 3apersonal care products 3awater pollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3acytotoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3aOryzias latipes 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3avitellogenin 3acytochrome P-450 2aAnimals 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP3Axgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aFish Proteinsxgenetics 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aOryziasxmetabolism 2aPolycyclic Compoundsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aReceptors, Estrogenxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Steroidxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVitellogeninsxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity.1 aIshibashi, Hiroshi1 aHirano, Masashi1 aMori, Taiki1 aKim, Joon-Woo1 aArizono, Koji0 tAquatic toxicology.g2008 Dec. 11, v. 90, no. 4 p.261-268dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.09.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20081217b20090206c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/12/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03704naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185072000900194100002100203245012900224300001600353500002400369500001500393520144000408650001701848650001401865650001801879650001201897650001701909650001401926650002701940650001201967650002501979650002202004650002302026650002302049650000902072650001802081650002302099650002002122650002702142650002602169650002102195650003802216650002402254650001202278650002202290650002902312650004002341650002402381650005702405650002802462650002502490650003102515653002802546653002602574653003402600700001902634700002402653773011502677852000902792856008802801930003302889945002502922946001102947655001202958IND4413108020221121001520.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310802DNAL7 a189379802pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aM001 0aM120 0aL8211 aOurth, Donald D.10aIsolation of mannose-binding C-type lectin from sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) plasma and binding to Aeromonas salmonicida  ap. 407-412.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a parasitic cartilaginous fish of the North American Great Lakes and a predator of many bony fish species of commercial importance to the fishing industry. Mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) was isolated by mannan-agarose affinity chromatography from sea lamprey plasma. Mannose-binding lectin has not before been identified and quantitated in the plasma of this sea lamprey species. The affinity-purified and 2-ME reduced lamprey MBL showed two bands of 35kDa and 65kDa by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using guinea pig anti-MBL IgG as the primary antibody. Amino acid composition analysis (mol%) of the purified lamprey MBL found high amounts of histidine, threonine, tyrosine and phenylalanine present when compared with three other vertebrate MBLs. N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation for the first 10 residues gave XXXTKGCPDA. Lamprey plasma contained 261μg of MBL/ml of plasma. Plasma protein concentration was 40.1mg/ml. Lamprey MBL was present then in plasma at 6.5μg MBL/mg total protein. The sea lamprey MBL also specifically binds to mannose on the surface of the pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida. The presence of MBL in high concentration in lamprey plasma could be important in their innate immunity and resistance to infection. This study describes the presence of MBL in sea lamprey plasma and evidence for a C-type lectin complement pathway of innate immunity. 3afish culture 3aparasites 3afish industry 3alectins 3ablood plasma 3apredators 3abiochemical mechanisms 3amannose 3aamino acid sequences 3aanimal physiology 3abinding properties 3adisease resistance 3afish 3aimmune system 3aPetromyzon marinus 3aimmune response 3aamino acid composition 3aAeromonas salmonicida 3ain vitro studies 2aAeromonas salmonicidaxmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aMannosexmetabolism 2aMannose-Binding Lectinxbloodxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPetromyzonxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 0amolecular sequence data 0abiological resistance 0amannose-binding C-type lectin1 aRose, Wendy M.1 aSiefkes, Michael J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.407-412dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.08.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/12/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03622naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002000185245016100205300001600366500002400382500001500406520134100421650001801762650001401780650002001794650001301814650000901827650001801836650001701854650001401871650002001885650002501905650001501930650002001945650002001965650002101985650001502006650002302021650001202044650002302056650000902079650003102088650004302119650003002162650005202192650005102244650006402295650003002359653001502389653001502404653001602419653003802435700001402473700002002487700002202507700001902529700001402548700001502562700001802577773011502595852000902710856008802719930003302807945002502840946001102865655001202876IND4413107220221121001532.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310722DNAL7 a187623402pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL2001 aAltmann, Scott.10aHigh Mobility Group Box 1-Protein expression in canine haematopoietic cells and influence on canine peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferative activity  ap. 367-372.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHigh Mobility Group Box 1-Protein (HMGB1) is a nuclear chromosomal protein occurring ubiquitary in mammalian tissues. HMGB1 demonstrates cytokine function and induces inflammation when actively released by haematopoietic cells or passively released during cell necrosis. This study aimed at the determination of HMGB1 expression in different cell types and at the evaluation of the role of HMGB1 in PBMC proliferation. Therefore we investigated the HMGB1 mRNA expression level in different canine haematopoietic cell types and the influence of exogenous rhHMGB1 on canine PBMC proliferation. Differentiated haematopoietic blood cells showed lower relative HMGB1 expression levels compared to CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells. Relative HMGB1 expression seemed also to decrease during differentiation of CD34+ stem cells into dendritic cells. Furthermore, peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes and granulocytes showed a lower relative HMGB1 expression in comparison to CD3+ T-lymphocytes. When exogenous rhHMGB1 at low concentrations was added to single PBMC cultures an increase of proliferation was obvious. However, in higher concentrations HMGB1 lost its stimulative effect. In conclusion, HMGB1 is broadly expressed in canine haematopoietic cells with highest levels in haematopoietic stem cells. HMGB1 induced directly PBMC proliferation. 3amessenger RNA 3amonocytes 3aanimal proteins 3anecrosis 3adogs 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainflammation 3acytokines 3adendritic cells 3abiochemical pathways 3astem cells 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3ain vitro studies 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 2aAnimals 2aCell Proliferation 2aDogs 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aGene Expression Regulationximmunology 2aHMGB1 Proteinxmetabolism 2aHematopoietic Stem Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 0acell death 0aamphoterin 0ablood cells 0aHigh Mobility Group Box 1-Protein1 aLange, S.1 aPommerencke, J.1 aMurua Escobar, H.1 aBullerdiek, J.1 aNolte, I.1 aFreund, M.1 aJunghanss, C.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.367-372dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.07.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090204b20090301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/12/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03547naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100002100157245012600178300001600304500002400320520219700344650000902541650001702550650001302567650003002580650001302610650001802623650001402641650001002655653002902665700001602694700002302710700002702733700002102760700001702781700002202798773011502820852000902935856008802944930003303032945002503065946001103090655001203101IND4413106720221121001529.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441310672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aYamazaki, Jumpei10aQuantitative assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) in canine lymphoma by using real-time polymerase chain reaction  ap. 321-331.  aIncludes references  aLymphoma is the most common hematopoietic malignancy in dogs. Although a large proportion of dogs with lymphoma can achieve clinical remission by initial chemotherapy, most dogs die as a consequence of tumor relapse. We established a quantitative detection system for minimal residual disease (MRD) in canine lymphoma by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A canine T-cell lymphoma-derived cell line, namely, UL-1, was used to examine the specificity and sensitivity of the MRD detecting system. Allele-specific oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed based on the sequence of T-cell receptor γ chain (TCRγ) gene fragment of UL-1 cells in conjunction with its downstream sequence, which were obtained from the dog genome database. The real-time PCR system for plasmid DNA containing the TCRγ gene derived from UL-1 cells and the genomic DNA of UL-1 cells revealed that the system was accurate for 10-100,000 copies per reaction and its sensitivity was 1 cell per 10,000 cells. In order to monitor the kinetics of tumor cell number in canine lymphoma, we quantified the level of MRD in the peripheral blood of 7 dogs with lymphoma under chemotherapy. Since the lymphoma cells from the 7 patients were shown to be B-cell origin from the finding of clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene, allele-specific oligonucleotide primers and probes were prepared based on the sequence of rearranged IgH gene in each case. The number of peripheral blood tumor cells measured by the real-time PCR was comparable to that estimated by conventional hematological examination in 2 cases of stage V lymphoma. MRD in the peripheral blood was detectable in all 7 cases, even in the complete remission (CR) phase. In the 7 lymphoma dogs, changes in the MRD levels of peripheral blood generally paralleled with the changes in the volumes of lymph nodes. Molecular CR, in which the MRD level was below the detection limit, was not observed in any of these 7 patients under chemotherapy. The MRD level detected by the real-time PCR method described here would be useful for investigating the kinetics of tumor cell growth and its regression in canine lymphoma patients. 3adogs 3adog diseases 3alymphoma 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aantigens 3aT-lymphocytes 3aremission 3agenes 0aminimal residual disease1 aBaba, Kenji1 aGoto-Koshino, Yuko1 aSetoguchi-Mukai, Asuka1 aFujino, Yasuhito1 aOhno, Koichi1 aTsujimoto, Hajime0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 126, no. 3-4 p.321-331dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.09.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20110713b20110805c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/12/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02581naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245007300199300001800272506007600290520111300366506003701479650001401516650001501530650001601545650002501561650001601586650001001602650001101612650001801623650001901641650002301660650002601683700002001709700002001729700001401749700001701763700002101780773017201801852000901973856008301982930003302065946001302098655001202111IND4387775620221207075949.0070211e20070206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438777562DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06055621042doi7 aPMC17840142pmcid7 a172642182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Junli10aBLIMP1 regulates cell growth through repression of p53 transcription  ap. 1841-1846.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTight regulation of p53 is essential for maintaining normal cell growth. Here we report that BLIMP1 acts in an autoregulatory feedback loop that controls p53 activity through repression of p53 transcription. p53 binds to and positively regulates BLIMP1, which encodes for a known B cell transcriptional repressor. Knockdown of BLIMP1 by siRNA results in both apoptosis and growth arrest in human colon cancer cells and cell-cycle arrest in primary human fibroblasts. Interestingly, the levels of both p53 mRNA and protein are substantially increased after BLIMP1 depletion, which is accompanied by the induction of p53 target genes. Importantly, the apoptosis induced by BLIMP1 depletion in HCT116 cells is largely abrogated in cells lacking p53 or in cells depleted in p53 by siRNA. We further demonstrate that BLIMP1 binds to the p53 promoter and represses p53 transcription, and this provides a mechanistic explanation for the induction of p53 response in cells depleted of BLIMP1. Hence, suppression of p53 transcription is a crucial function of endogenous BLIMP1 and is essential for normal cell growth.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acolorectal neoplasms 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3arepressor proteins 3asmall interfering RNA1 aJiang, Jianming1 aLim, Ching Aeng1 aWu, Qiang1 aNg, Huck-Hui1 aChin, Keh-Chuang0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 6, v. 104, no. 6 p.1841-1846dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06055621043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070211b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04155naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188072000900197100001900206245014100225300001600366500002400382500001500406520197200421650001902393650001002412650001702422650001302439650002102452650002402473650001402497650002302511650002302534650001302557650002402570650002102594650005602615650001202671650005102683650001502734650002202749650002302771650002202794650002402816650002802840650005002868650002402918650001702942650002402959651001102983653002402994653002103018700002703039700001903066700002403085700002003109700002303129773011203152852000903264856009103273930003303364945002503397946001103422655001203433IND4413099620140724000000.0081128e20081215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441309962DNAL7 a189548942pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aL600 0aF820 0aL8201 aSage, Mickaël10aKinetics of bromadiolone in rodent populations and implications for predators after field control of the water vole, Arvicola terrestris  ap. 211-222.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe document the kinetics of bromadiolone in two rodent populations after a field control of water voles, and their implications for predator exposure. Water voles and common voles were trapped aboveground and underground from 1 to 135 days after bromadiolone treatment in the field. Livers, digestive tracts, and rests of the body were analyzed separately. Our results indicate that 99.6% of the water voles trapped underground and 41% of the common voles trapped aboveground contain bromadiolone residues. Concentrations were maximal between 3.3 and 6.5 days after treatment, according to the tissues examined and the model applied for water voles, and after 1.3 to 3.7 days for common voles. Water voles appeared available almost exclusively for foraging predators. Common voles, found less likely to be poisoned and exhibiting weaker concentrations, were mainly sampled aboveground. The liver, primarily eaten by some predators and scavengers, contains a larger bromadiolone quantity (59% of the total amount found in water voles). The rejection of the digestive tract by those species may lead to a subsequent consumption of voles with higher bromadiolone concentrations (from +3.8 to +5.8% of concentration) and provide a moderate risk increase. After 135 days, eight of the ten water voles and one of the two common voles exhibited detectable residues. Additionally, one specimen presented higher concentrations than the others, and similar to those measured in Voles trapped between the first 15-20 days. This may have consequences on predator intoxications several months after treatment. These results integrate individual differences for the two main rodent species present in treated areas. Implications for predator exposure were investigated at the end of the study and suggest that, if the risk of secondary poisoning is maximal during the first 15-20 days when the rodent densities remain high, exposure conditions are maintained for at least 135 days. 3arodent control 3aliver 3abromadiolone 3aArvicola 3aMicrotus arvalis 3atissue distribution 3apredators 3apesticide residues 3apopulation density 3akinetics 3anontarget organisms 3avertebrate pests 2a4-Hydroxycoumarinsxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aArvicolinaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aFood Chain 2aFoxesxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aRodent Controlxmethods 2aRodenticidesxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Distribution 3aFrance 0aArvicola terrestris 0adigestive system1 aCœurdassier, Michaël1 aDefaut, Régis1 aGimbert, Frédéric1 aBerny, Philippe1 aGiraudoux, Patrick0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Dec. 15, v. 407, no. 1 p.211-222dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.09.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090117b20090206c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/01/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03733naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245014700210300001800357506007600375520189300451506003702344650002402381650003102405650001902436650001302455650001602468650002702484650001602511650001602527650002102543650001202564650000902576650001802585650001702603650002002620700001902640700001902659700002502678700001902703700002502722700002102747700002402768700002202792700002102814700002202835773017202857852000903029856008303038930003303121946001303154655001203167IND4387777420221207074440.0070211e20070206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438777742DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06057281042doi7 aPMC17943142pmcid7 a172642172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeize, Robert Van der12aA gene cluster encoding cholesterol catabolism in a soil actinomycete provides insight into Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival in macrophages  ap. 1947-1952.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRhodococcus sp. strain RHA1, a soil bacterium related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, degrades an exceptionally broad range of organic compounds. Transcriptomic analysis of cholesterol-grown RHA1 revealed a catabolic pathway predicted to proceed via 4-androstene-3,17-dione and 3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-seconandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione (3,4-DHSA). Inactivation of each of the hsaC, supAB, and mce4 genes in RHA1 substantiated their roles in cholesterol catabolism. Moreover, the hsaC⁻ mutant accumulated 3,4-DHSA, indicating that HsaCRHA₁, formerly annotated as a biphenyl-degrading dioxygenase, catalyzes the oxygenolytic cleavage of steroid ring A. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that 51 rhodococcal genes specifically expressed during growth on cholesterol, including all predicted to specify the catabolism of rings A and B, are conserved within an 82-gene cluster in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin. M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin grew on cholesterol, and hsaC and kshA were up-regulated under these conditions. Heterologously produced HsaCH₃₇Rv and HsaDH₃₇Rv transformed 3,4-DHSA and its ring-cleaved product, respectively, with apparent specificities [almost equal to]40-fold higher than for the corresponding biphenyl metabolites. Overall, we annotated 28 RHA1 genes and proposed physiological roles for a similar number of mycobacterial genes. During survival of M. tuberculosis in the macrophage, these genes are specifically expressed, and many appear to be essential. We have delineated a complete suite of genes necessary for microbial steroid degradation, and pathogenic mycobacteria have been shown to catabolize cholesterol. The results suggest that cholesterol metabolism is central to M. tuberculosis's unusual ability to survive in macrophages and provide insights into potential targets for novel therapeutics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3abioinformatics 3abiphenyl 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3amacrophages 3ametabolites 3amultigene family 3amutants 3asoil 3asoil bacteria 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics1 aYam, Katherine1 aHeuser, Thomas1 aWilbrink, Maarten H.1 aHara, Hirofumi1 aAnderton, Matthew C.1 aSim, E.q(Edith)1 aDijkhuizen, Lubbert1 aDavies, Julian E.1 aMohn, William W.1 aEltis, Lindsay D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 6, v. 104, no. 6 p.1947-1952dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06057281043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070212b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03122naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009900206300001800305506007600323520176100399506003702160650001802197650001602215650002102231650001302252650002302265650000902288650001402297650001002311650001802321650001202339650001602351700002302367773017202390852000902562856008302571930003302654946001302687655001202700IND4387776520221207074448.0070211e20070206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438777652DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.06096011042doi7 aPMC17942682pmcid7 a172617992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPritham, Ellen J.10aMassive amplification of rolling-circle transposons in the lineage of the bat Myotis lucifugus  ap. 1895-1900.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRolling-circle (RC) transposons, or Helitrons, are a newly recognized group of eukaryotic transposable elements abundant in the genomes of plants, invertebrates, and zebrafish. We provide evidence for the colonization of a mammalian genome by Helitrons, which has not been reported previously. We identified and characterized two families of Helitrons in the little brown bat Myotis lucifugus. The consensus sequence for the first family, HeliBat1, displays the hallmarks of an autonomous Helitron, including coding capacity for an [almost equal to]1,500-aa protein with an RC replication motif and a region related to the SF1 superfamily of DNA helicases. The HeliBatN1 family is a nonautonomous Helitron family that is only distantly related to HeliBat1. The two HeliBat families have attained high copy numbers ([almost equal to]15,000 and > 100,000 copies, respectively) and make up at least [almost equal to]3% of the M. lucifugus genome. Sequence divergence and cross-species analyses indicate that both HeliBat families have amplified within the last [almost equal to]30-36 million years and are restricted to the lineage of vesper bats. We could not detect the presence of Helitrons in any other order of placental mammals, despite the broad representation of these taxa in the databases. We describe an instance of HeliBat-mediated transduction of a host gene fragment that was subsequently dispersed in [almost equal to]1,000 copies throughout the M. lucifugus genome. Given the demonstrated propensity of RC transposons to mediate the duplication and shuffling of host genes in bacteria and maize, it is tempting to speculate that the massive amplification of Helitrons in vesper bats has influenced the evolutionary trajectory of these mammals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA helicases 3aDanio rerio 3aMyotis lucifugus 3abacteria 3aconsensus sequence 3acorn 3adatabases 3agenes 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3atransposons1 aFeschotte, Cédric0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2007 Feb. 6, v. 104, no. 6 p.1895-1900dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.06096011043Available from publisher's Web site  a20070211b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01837naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245013500175300001600310520076600326650001401092650001601106650001801122650002301140650001901163650002301182650002701205653001901232700001801251773008501269852000901354856007801363939003301441946001301474655001201487IND9204325920221120195122.0920710e199003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920432592DNAL7 a242636112pmid7 a10.1007/BF010165062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendall, D.M.10aPhytohormone ecology: Herbivory by Thrips tabaci induces greater ethylene production in intact onions than mechanical damage alone  ap. 981-991.  aHerbivory by Thrips tabaci affected production of the phytohormone ethylene from living onion foliage. Ethylene analysis was performed by gas chromatography on intact onion tissue. Thrips feeding damage and a crushed thrips extract stimulated significantly greater production of ethylene than could be explained by either one-time or semicontinuous mechanical damage alone, suggesting that ethylene-inducing cues may be transferred to the plant during feeding. This is the first demonstration of increased ethylene production from insect-infested intact plants. This study suggests that herbivores affect both the phytohormone physiology and secondary chemistry of living plants because ethylene has been shown to enhance production of defensive phytochemicals. 3anutrition 3aAllium cepa 3aThrips tabaci 3aethylene releasers 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aplant-insect relations 0ainsect feeding1 aBjostad, L.B.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1990 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.981-991x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF010165063Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01562naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245006400131300001400195300001900209520081700228650001101045653001901056653001301075653001901088653001601107653001101123773006301134852000901197939003301206945000801239946001301247655001201260991600092760742620221120195319.0830520e198205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830017952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemke, Ron.10aJob competencies: Can they help you design better training?  ap. 28-31.  ap. 28-31. ill.  aThree distinct approaches are used to develop job competency models: Modified Task Analysis (MTA); Critical Trait (CT) and Situational (SA).

Four prominent theorists and their adult developmental theories are described and applied to four stages through which trainers pass in their work experience. The four stages are labeled trainer-centered, program-centered, results-centered, and integration/creativity. Self awareness helps the trainer set goals, strategise personal growth, and better deal with frustrations and career opportunities. A diagram of the four stages is included. 3amotivation 3ahuman development 0aBehavioral sciences 0aOccupational guidance 0aSelf actualization 0aTrainers 0aVocational development0 tTraining.g1978 Dec., v. 15, no. 12 p.30-34x0895-15197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800717c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01758naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245004200131300001100173300002100184520089400205650001301099650002101112650001301133650001201146650002301158650002001181653002001201653002401221653001101245653002401256773006501280852000901345930003301354945000801387946001301395655001201408991600092000742620221120184843.0800821e197911  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800019542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemke, Ron.10aTry behavioral contracts and feedback  ap. 32.  ap. 32,34. chart.  aFor companies interested in promoting wellness for employees and officials, simply providing facilities is not enough. Evidently, the exercise habit must be relearned, since one poll shows that only 15% of the population get enough vigorous exercise to affect cardiovascular performance and 41% get no exercise! One technique tested to build and evaluate exercise habits was a 3 phase program to measure baseline level on an aerobic point system; to participate in a 10-week contract to earn back deposited valuables; and to report habits after a year. Participants worked in pairs during the first 2 phases. Even considering dropouts, 58% were exercising regularly after one year. Of those who contracted, 75% reported regular exercise and 100% of course completers were still exercising at levels above baseline. The positive reinforcement of working in pairs was considered significant. 3aexercise 3aphysical fitness 3aresearch 3asurveys 3adisease prevention 3abehavior change 0ahealth programs 0apreventive medicine 0ahabits 0aLearning experience0 tTraining.g1979 Nov., v. 16, no. 11 p.32-32x0895-15197nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01262naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245004300134300001400177520047000191650001400661650001700675653001100692653002800703653002300731653002500754653001700779653002400796773006500820852000900885939003300894945000800927946001300935655001200948991600091910742620221120184751.0790904e197811  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794850142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Judson.10aHow to choose and use slide projectors  ap. 44-49.  aAmong the most valuable assets in any training session are slides and the slide projector.

Wheat seed without chemical dressing is sown in boxes and allowed to grow 10 cm high. Plants are then lifted. After washing off soil and discarding the roots and apical half of the leaves, the central succulent part of the plant is chopped up with scissors into very fine pieces. These pieces are crushed in a basin and after adding sufficient water to give a thick suspension, finally macerated for about 5 minutes (a top-drive macerator, Townson and Mercer Ltd. was used). This thick suspension is then centrifuged for 5 minutes at a speed of 5000 revolutions per minute and filtered through a Seitz filter. In the following techniques the filtrate is referred to as “nutrient solution” and the suspension as “macerated wheat”. Rigid bacteriological standards of sterility are maintained throughout the techniques. 3aDelia coarctata 3aTriticum 3aaseptic conditions 3afiltrates 3ainsect larvae 3aleaves 3aroots 3asoil 3awashing 3awheat0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1966 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.484-485dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1966.tb01008.x 7aarticle01341naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245003300133300001100166300002500177520057500202650001800777650001800795650002100813653002900834653003600863653001300899773006400912852000900976939003300985945000801018946001301026655001201039991600090990742620221120175342.0880115e198601  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870025242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, C.R.13aAn outline for team building  ap. 48.  ap. 48, 50-52. forms.  aEffective teamwork, important to the success of an organization, can only survive in an environment that fosters teamwork.

The trunks of dead palms were sampled for R. ferrugineus and for the presence of entomopathogenic nematodes. While 20% of Phoenix canariensis Hort. were found to be killed by R. ferrugineus, only 2 trees from other species, 1 Washingtonia filifera (L. Linden) and 1 Phoenix dactlylifera L., were killed. Only one species of entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora ( Poinar, 1975 ) (Nematoda: Heterorhabditidae), was isolated from the R. ferrugineus specimens. Seasonal mortality rate in the total larval population (total 565 larval specimens) of R. ferrugineus was 69%. H. bacteriophora resulted in a significant mortality rate (80%) in the pupae population (total 314 pupal specimens). Overall, 70% of the total of 879 pre-adult specimens were found to be fatally infested by the attacks of this nematode. Heterorhabditis bacteriophora killed few adults, corresponding to 2% of the overall mortality rate. It is concluded that H. bacteriophora could be evaluated as a potential candidate for biological control of R. ferrugineus in the Mediterranean region. 3aHeterorhabditis bacteriophora 3aPhoenix canariensis 3aRhynchophorus ferrugineus 3aWashingtonia filifera 3aadults 3abiological control 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3alarvae 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3apupae 3arecreation areas 3atrees 3aMediterranean region1 aElekçioğlu, I.H.1 aGözel, U.1 aGüneş, Ç.1 aYüksel, O.0 tBulletin OEPP.g2009 Aug., v. 39, no. 2 p.189-193dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0250-80527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2338.2009.02288.x 7aarticle02570naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012400129300001500253500001500268520136700283650001601650650001501666650001401681650002801695650002301723650001501746650001901761650001401780650003801794650002001832650001301852650001101865653001401876653001001890700001301900700001601913700001601929700001701945773009401962852000902056930003302065945001302098946001302111655001202124IND2059774420221120160417.0970919e199610  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205977442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiechers, D.E.10aVariability of glutathione S-transferase levels and dimethenamid tolerance in safener-treated wheat and wheat relatives  ap. 88-101.  a2019-12-05  aGlutathione S-transferase (GST) levels were quantified in shoots of wheat and wheat relatives to determine if variation existed for GST levels, with or without treatment with herbicide safeners, and if GST levels could be used as an accurate biochemical marker for wheat seedling tolerance to the herbicide dimethenamid. Wheat lines and relatives were either unsafened or treated with the safeners fluxofenim (CGA-133205) or cloquintocet-mexyl (CGA-185072). GST levels were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay utilizing a maize GST antibody (GST-ELISA) and an enzyme activity assay using dimethenamid as a substrate (GST-D). In general, the GST-ELISA indicated that significant GST was present constitutively (in untreated plants) and that the two safeners increased GST levels to a similar extent. In contrast to the GST-ELISA, the GST-D assay generally detected little or no constitutive GST-D activity; fluxofenim increased GST-D activity more than cloquintocet-mexyl. Tolerance to dimethenamid in fluxofenim-safened wheat seedlings in the greenhouse was correlated with GST-D activity (r2 = 0.51) but not with GST-ELISA (r2 = 0.03). These data suggest that screening wheat and wheat relatives for safener-increased GST-D activity can be used as a biochemical marker to predict and select for increased wheat seedling tolerance to dimethenamid. 3awild plants 3abiomarkers 3aseedlings 3aglutathione transferase 3aherbicide safeners 3aherbicides 3aplant extracts 3abioassays 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aenzyme activity 3aTriticum 3ashoots 0atolerance 0alines1 aYang, K.1 aIrzyk, G.P.1 aJones, S.S.1 aFuerst, E.P.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g1996 Oct., v. 56, no. 2 p.88-101x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02756naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245009300150300001800243520160100261650001001862650001001872650001901882650002501901650001201926650001701938650001501955650002201970650001201992650002602004650002002030650002402050650000902074650002302083650004502106650003202151700001602183773008002199852000902279939003302288946001302321655001202334IND9204333620221120160330.0920710e199205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920433362DNAL7 a15645682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, R.L. VI.10aDevelopmental changes in glucose and butyrate metabolism by isolated sheep ruminal cells  ap. 1149-1153.  aThe ontogeny of glucose and butyrate metabolism in developing sheep ruminal epithelium was determined using an isolated ruminal cell system. Ruminal cells were isolated from 21 lambs at seven ages before weaning. Rumen weight increased in proportion to increases in body weight, except between 28 and 42 d, when rumen weight increased threefold, whereas body weight increased only 33%. Glucose oxidation rates [expressed as nmol/(1 x 10(6) ruminal cells-120 min)] by ruminal cells were low at birth (14.2 +/- 5.08), increased sharply by 14 d (71.38 +/- 16.71), and remained elevated until 42 d. Following 42 d, glucose oxidation declined to rates lower than those observed at birth (6.11 +/- 0.83). Butyrate oxidation to CO2 increased from birth (20.03 +/- 3.41) to a peak at 4 d (134.0 +/- 31.71) and decreased throughout the remainder of the preweaning period (56 d; 36.32 +/- 7.48). Butyrate inhibited glucose oxidation by ruminal cells isolated at 14, 28 and 42 d. Similarly, glucose inhibited butyrate oxidation by ruminal cells isolated from 4 d to 28 d following birth. beta-Hydroxybutyrate production [nmol/(1 X 10(6) ruminal cells-120 min)] from butyrate by ruminal cells was undetectable at birth, but measurable by 4 d (3.28 +/- 2.15). Rates of beta-hydroxybutyrate production remained unchanged through 42 d; however, by 56 d, production had increased 10-fold (36.71 +/- 0.67). The metabolic adaptations of the ruminal epithelium are intimately associated with the physical development of the tissue, and major shifts in the fate of glucose and butyrate carbon occur prior to weaning. 3asheep 3arumen 3acultured cells 3adevelopmental stages 3aglucose 3abutyric acid 3ametabolism 2aAgingxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aButyratesxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aMale 2aOxygen Consumption 2aRumenxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSheepxgrowth & development1 aJesse, B.W.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1992 May, v. 122, no. 5 p.1149-1153x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03306naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007800128300001600206500001500222520206100237650001402298650001502312650001502327650002302342650001502365650001702380650002502397650001402422650003702436650002602473650002502499650001002524650001602534653002202550653001402572653002602586653001102612700001902623700001502642700001602657773009502673852000902768930003302777945001302810946001302823655001202836IND2059774620221120160311.0970919e199610  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205977462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldrop, M.P.10aFate of prometryn in prometryn-tolerant and -susceptible cotton cultivars  ap. 111-122.  a2019-12-05  aPrometryn is a soil-applied herbicide used in cotton production; however, it can cause cotton injury. Our objective was to determine the mechanism of differential tolerance among cultivars as related to differences in prometryn absorption, translocation to photosynthetic tissue or lysigenous glands, and metabolism. The prometryn-tolerant cultivars, Pima S-7 (Gossypium barbadense L.), a Pima-type cotton, and Acala 1517-75 (G. hirsutum L.), an Upland-type cotton, were compared to the prometryn-sensitive Upland-type cultivars, Delta Pine 5415 (G. hirsutum) and Acala 2711 glandless (G. hirsutum). Uptake and metabolism of prometryn by excised tissue in solution, uptake and translocation of prometryn by roots or hypocotyls in whole plants in soil, and the concentrations of prometryn in lysigenous glands in whole plants were compared among the cultivars. In the excised tissue study, root tissue absorbed more prometryn than did excised hypocotyl tissue over 2 hr for all cultivars; Pima S-7 root and hypocotyl tissue absorbed more prometryn than Acala 1517-75 or Delta Pine 5415 over time, and no metabolites of prometryn were found in any of the tissues. In the whole-plant study where roots or hypocotyls were exposed to prometryn in soil, prometryn root uptake by Delta Pine 5415 was lower than by Pima S-7 or Acala 1517-75, while hypocotyl uptake and translocation did not differ among cultivars. Therefore, differential prometryn tolerance among these cultivars cannot be explained by differences in uptake or translocation. However, uptake and translocation were greater in root-treated compared to hypocotyl-treated seedlings, regardless of cultivar, over time. Lysigenous glands contained higher levels of prometryn relative to other stem tissue; however, the amount of prometryn in glands was no greater in susceptible Delta Pine 5415 than in tolerant Pima S-7. Thus, differential prometryn tolerance in these cotton cultivars is not due to differential prometryn absorption, translocation, metabolism, or concentration in lysigenous glands. 3acultivars 3ametabolism 3ahypocotyls 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aabsorption 3aplant glands 3aGossypium barbadense 3aprometryn 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aresistance mechanisms 3aherbicide resistance 3aroots 3ametabolites 0alysigenous glands 0aGossypium 0abiological resistance 0auptake1 aSterling, T.M.1 aKhan, R.A.1 aMolin, W.T.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g1996 Oct., v. 56, no. 2 p.111-122x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01498naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245004400115300001400159520076000173650002000933650001300953653002500966653001500991653001401006653002301020653001301043773006401056852001301120939003301133945000801166946001301174852000901187655001201196991600088350742620221120144221.0851011e198408  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850079092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL14aThe Good housetraining seal of approval  ap. 84-86.  aA 5-part manifesto that addresses issues such as "learning needs," "learning outcomes," and "assessment" was presented at the April meeting of the Council on Continuing Education.

We found that this clone contains a gene which produces 2.6-, 1.3- and 1.1-kilobase (kb) RNAs. While the 2.6-kb RNA is expressed only in the head, the 1.3-kb RNA is present exclusively in the body. The 1.1-kb RNA, however, is found in both the head and body, but in much higher concentration in the head. DNA sequence analysis of a 2.6-kb RNA-specific cDNA showed that this gene encodes a 70-amino acid polypeptide which is the putative Drosophila homologue to the gamma subunit of the bovine G-protein. The Drosophila protein, named D-G gamma 1, shares 46, 43, and 28% identity, and 59, 52, and 60% similarity, with the gamma 2, gamma 3, and gamma t proteins of bovine G proteins, respectively. Sequencing of the 1.1-kb RNA-specific cDNA clone revealed that the 1.1-kb RNA is produced from the 2.6-kb transcription unit by usage of an alternative polyadenylation site, and has a coding region identical to that of the 2.6-kb RNA. Genomic Southern blot hybridization indicated that the Drosophila genome has only one D-G gamma 1 gene. Throughout development the 1.1-kb RNA is found to be the most prevalent species; its level peaks between 9 and 12 h of embryogenesis. As is the case for the other G protein genes of Drosophila, the D-G gamma 1 gene is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system of the fly. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aguanosine diphosphate 3abinding proteins 3astructural genes 3acentral nervous system 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein subunits 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCattle 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGTP-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNervous System Physiological Phenomena 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aRNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSoftware 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m85042 0aembl/m850421 aGanguly, R.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 Mar. 25, v. 267, no. 9 p.6086-6092x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03164naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245018600127300001500313500001500328520185200343650002202195650001102217650001802228650001302246650001002259650001102269650001902280650002002299650001402319650001902333650001502352650002402367650002002391650002702411651001002438653001802448653001702466653001302483653001802496700001802514773009402532852000902626930003302635945001302668946001302681655001202694IND2163519120221120133733.0980820e199706  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216351912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhavan, P.S.10aAlterations in concentrations of protein, carbohydrate, glycogen, free sugar, and lipid in the prawn Macrobrachium malcolmsonii on exposure to sublethal concentrations of endosulfan  ap. 89-101.  a2019-12-05  aJuveniles of Macrobrachium malcolmsonii (4.5-5.0 cm in size and 1.0-1.25 g in weight) were exposed to three sublethal concentrations of endosulfan (10.6, 16.0, and 32.0 ng/L) for 21 days. Samples were taken from the hemolymph, hepatopancreas, gills, and muscle of representative prawns from each test and control group on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 21st day after the start of the experiment. The total protein concentration was found to be higher in the hemolymph (on all sampling days) and hepatopancreas (only on days 1 and 8) of test prawns, particularly those exposed to 10.6 ng/L of endosulfan, than in the same tissues of controls. However, the total protein concentration in the gills and muscle of test prawns was found to be lower, on all sampling days, than that in the same tissues of controls; the total protein content of gills and muscle was lowest in prawns that had been exposed to 32.0 ng/L of endosulfan. The total carbohydrate and glycogen content was found to he lower, in comparison to controls, in the hepatopancreas, gills, and muscle of test prawns, especially those exposed to 32.0 ng/L of endosulfan; this was seen on all sampling days. The total free sugar was found to be higher in the hemolymph of test prawns, particularly in those exposed to 32.0 ng/L of endosulfan, than in that of controls. The content of total lipid was found to be higher in the hepatopancreas of the test prawns, especially those exposed to 32.0 ng/L of endosulfan, than in the hepatopancreas of controls. These data strongly suggest that endosulfan is toxic to M. malcolmsonii since it seriously impairs the metabolic functions, resulting in alterations in major biochemical constituents, particularly in the muscle. Since the nutritive value of this prawn is greatly affected by exposure to endosulfan, suitable remedial measures are necessary. 3asublethal effects 3asugars 3aMacrobrachium 3aglycogen 3agills 3alipids 3ahepatopancreas 3anutritive value 3ahemolymph 3amuscle tissues 3aendosulfan 3anontarget organisms 3aprotein content 3aenvironmental exposure 3aIndia 0acarbohydrates 0afood quality 0atoxicity 0aconcentration1 aGeraldine, P.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g1997 June, v. 58, no. 2 p.89-101x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02454naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001400154245012000168300001600288500002400304520108700328650001801415650002101433650003001454650002201484650002301506650001401529650001801543650001601561650000901577650001201586650001201598650001101610650002301621650001101644650001401655650002201669650001001691700001801701700001601719700001401735700001301749700001401762773013001776852000901906856005701915655001201972IND4456278820221120133745.0110408e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445627882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb00656.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelé, E.10aIn vitro bioassay for the effect of Ajuga reptans phytoecdysteroids on Trialeurodes vaporariorum larval development  ap. 163-168.  aIncludes references  aA rapid and reliable in vitro bioassay method to test the effects of synthetic and natural compounds on the development of greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood (Homoptera Aleyrodidae) is described. Leaf fragments of Nicotiana glauca Graham infested with eggs of whitefly were cultured under aseptic conditions on half-strength Murashige-Skoog medium. The development of the insect in vitro and in vivo were comparable except for a higher mortality rate in the first larval instar. Ecdysteroids from Ajuga reptans L. were applied to leaf fragments by immersion in aqueous solution of the compounds or by addition to the culture medium. A high mortality rate of first larval instars was detected with 29-norsengosterone and ajugalactone treatments. This effect was specially pronounced when the products were incorporated in the medium. A significant increase in mortality was also recorded in the pupal state with a 20-hydroxyecdysone treatment. This effect was never observed before, because all whitefly larvae on A. reptans leaves die in the first larval instar. 3aAjuga reptans 3aNicotiana glauca 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3aaqueous solutions 3aaseptic conditions 3abioassays 3aculture media 3aecdysterone 3aeggs 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alarval development 3aleaves 3amortality 3aphytoecdysteroids 3apupae1 aMesseguer, J.1 aGabarra, R.1 aTomas, J.1 aColl, J.1 aCamps, F.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1992 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.163-168dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw36074x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb00656.x 7aarticle01951naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012800123300001600251520094400267650001001211650000901221650001101230650002001241650001901261650002501280650002001305650001901325650002301344650002401367650001501391653001301406700001501419700001601434773007201450852000901522939003301531946001301564655001201577IND9204338020221120133747.0920710e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920433802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoly, T.10aHyaluronic acid as a substitute for proteins in the deep-freezing of embryos from mice and sheep: an in vitro investigation  ap. 473-480.  aThe aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of frozen-thawed mouse and sheep embryos to develop in vitro after introducing hyaluronic acid (HA) into the freezing medium as a substitute for biological proteins. A total of 443 mouse embryos and 120 sheep embryos were divided into equal numbers to be frozen in one of two freezing media containing either 4 mg/ml BSA (control) or 1 mg/ml HA (treated). Overall, 80% of the mouse embryos developed after thawing, with no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the two freezing media. Similarly, 75% of the frozen-thawed sheep embryos developed in culture after thawing, with no differences (P > 0.05) between the two groups. It was concluded that although the handling of embryos is more difficult with the HA compound than with BSA, the HA compound may be safely substituted for BSA for international movement of embryos, if these preliminary results are confirmed in vivo. 3asheep 3amice 3amorula 3aembryo transfer 3afrozen storage 3abovine serum albumin 3ahyaluronic acid 3aembryo culture 3adisease prevention 3aembryonic mortality 3ablastocyst 0ain vitro1 aNibart, M.1 aThibier, M.0 tTheriogenology.g1992 Feb., v. 37, no. 2 p.473-480x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01453naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245009700115300001400212500001500226520067000241650001500911650002300926650002000949653002600969653002400995653001701019773006401036852000901100939003301109945000801142946001301150655001201163991600086260742620221120124310.0790920e197907  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794558022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aGiving things to recognize and reward improved performance on the job - and in the classroom  ap.

The biggest potential payoff for companies is in employee "empowerment", tapping the creative resources in the current workforce. Incentives within the company can result in substantial cost reductions each year. Successful incentive systems demand clear goals, good feedback and accurate measurement.

It is still obscure how the protein is involved in this function at the molecular level. We formerly found that the 30K protein is localized to the plasmodesmata of TMV-infected plants. We also reported that the 30K protein was detected in a nuclei-rich fraction of TMV-infected protoplasts after biochemical fractionation. To clarify the inconsistency, the 30K protein was immunocytologically localized in TMV-infected protoplasts using a newly prepared antibody against the 30K protein. On some sections, the 30K protein was found near the nucleus but not in or on the nucleus. At later stages of infection a novel electron-transparent structure was detected in the cytoplasm where the 30K proteins were localized. This structure might reflect an intermediate form between its synthesis in the cytoplasm and its targeting to the plasmodesmata in whole plants. 3aNicotiana 3aprotoplasts 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aRNA 3aviral proteins 3ainfection 3aplasmodesmata 3aimmunochemistry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Compartmentation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlant Viral Movement Proteins 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxmicrobiology 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxmetabolism 2aViral Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0anuclei 0amovement 0acell-to-cell movement1 aHosokawa, D.1 aKawagishi, M.1 aWatanabe, Y.1 aOkada, Y.0 tVirology.g1992 Apr., v. 187, no. 2 p.809-813x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01964naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008700127300001800214300003000232520098500262650001501247650001201262650002601274650001101300650002101311650002401332650001801356651001201374653002401386700001601410700001901426700001701445773008501462852000901547939003301556946001301589655001201602IND9100978020221120104138.0910225e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910097802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiff, S.L.10aDissolved organic carbon cycling in forested watersheds: a carbon isotope approach  ap. 2949-2957.  ap. 2949-2957. ill., maps.  aDissolved organic carbon (DOC) is important in the acid-base chemistry of acid-sensitive freshwater systems; in the complexation, mobility, persistence, and toxicity of metals and other pollutants; and in lake carbon metabolism. Carbon isotopes (13C and 14C) are used to study the origin, transport, and fate of DOC in a softwater catchment in central Ontario. Precipitation, soil percolates, groundwaters, stream, beaver pond, and lake waters, and lake sediment pore water were characterized chemically and isotopically. In addition to total DOC, isotopic measurements were made on the humic and fulvic DOC fractions. The lake is a net sink for DOC. delta 14C results indicate that the turnover time of most of the DOC in streams, lakes, and wetlands is fast, less than 40 years, and on the same time scale as changes in acidic deposition. DOC in groundwaters is composed of older carbon than surface waters, indicating extensive cycling of DOC in the upper soil zone or aquifer. 3awatersheds 3aforests 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3aisotope labeling 3awatershed hydrology 3awater quality 3aOntario 0aacid-base chemistry1 aAravena, R.1 aTrumbore, S.E.1 aDillon, P.J.0 tWater resources research.g1990 Dec., v. 26, no. 12 p.2949-2957x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02535naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245011200140300001600252500001500268520078500283650003501068650002001103650001101123650003001134650001701164650002801181650001201209650002901221650001901250650000801269650001101277650002601288650003001314650002101344650002501365650001701390650003301407650004501440650001301485650002501498650002701523650002401550650002901574650004001603650002201643653001301665653000801678653001401686653003001700700001401730700001301744700001701757700001301774773006701787852000901854939003301863946001301896655001201909IND9204340620221120104229.0920710e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920434062DNAL7 a15464512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGal, S.10aAgroinfection of transgenic plants leads to viable cauliflower mosaic virus by intermolecular recombination  ap. 525-533.  a2019-12-04  aIntermolecular reconstitution of a plant virus has been detected in whole plants in a system using a defective cauliflower mosaic virus genome and transgenic host plants containing the missing viral gene.

In several cases, upper leaves contained replicating viral DNA which was able to incite CaMV symptoms on turnip plants.

Continuous, three-dimensional soil moisture energy conditions were monitored in two discrete catchment positions for a series of storm events in 1987. Tensiometric response was related to the soil water characteristic curve, hillslope throughflow, and total catchment runoff. For events yielding << 2 mm hr-1 peak runoff, near-stream valley bottom groundwater systems discharged water volumes sufficient to account for storm period streamflow. This process was assisted by regular low (< -40 cm H2O) matric potential conditions and rapid filling of available soil water storage. For events yielding > 2 mm hr-1 peak storm flow, hillslope hollow drainage into steeply sloping first-order channels dominated old water production and most of the catchment storm flow. Highly transient macropore-driven processes of crack infiltration (bypass flow), slope water table development, and lateral pipe flow enabled large volumes of stored water to be delivered to the first-order channel bank at the appropriate time to satisfy catchment storm flow volumes and water isotopic and chemical composition. 3asoil water 3amacropores 3amacropore flow 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3amineral soils 3asoil water potential 3astorms 3aNew Zealand 0asloping land 0astorm flow0 tWater resources research.g1990 Nov., v. 26, no. 11 p.2821-2832x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03025naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002300128245010800151300001600259500001500275520128300290650001701573650002401590650002901614650002001643650001101663650001901674650002301693650001701716650002201733650000801755650001801763650002301781650002601804650002101830650002401851650002801875650003001903650004101933650002801974650003002002650002502032650002902057650002502086650002402111650002302135653003502158653001702193653001102210653001602221653002002237700001502257700001702272773006702289852000902356939003302365946001302398655001202411IND9204341420221120104148.0920710e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920434142DNAL7 a15464652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinesh-Kumar, S.P.10aPrecise mapping and in vitro translation of a trifunctional subgenomic RNA of barley yellow dwarf virus  ap. 711-722.  a2019-12-04  aThe barley yellow dwarf virus genome consists of a single 5.7-kb RNA encoding six open reading frames (ORFs). The four ORFs in the 3' half of the genome were proposed to be expressed via subgenomic mRNAs. Here, we show that the PAV serotype of barley yellow dwarf virus generates two subgenomic RNAs of 2.9 and 0.8 kb in infected plants and protoplasts. The 5' end of the larger subgenomic RNA (sgRNA1) was precisely mapped to base 2769 by ribonuclease protection and primer extension methods. Synthetic sgRNA1, containing the exact 5' and 3' ends, was generated by in vitro transcription, translated in vitro, and shown to serve as a message for three ORFs. Translation initiated at the first two AUG codons in sgRNA1, yielding the 22-kDa viral coat protein (CP) and a 17-kDa protein encoded by an overlapping, out-of-frame ORF. In addition, readthrough of the amber stop codon of the CP ORF gave rise to a 72-kDa fusion product of the CP ORF and an in-frame 50K ORF immediately 3' of the CP termination codon. The 0.8-kb sgRNA2 was present in greater abundance than sgRNA1 and likely serves as a message for a 6.7K ORF at the 3' end of the genome. Sequences that may control subgenomic RNA synthesis and the translational events are compared with those of other plant viruses. 3agenetic code 3aopen reading frames 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3acodons 3aviral proteins 3achromosome mapping 3aAvena sativa 3agenetic variation 3aRNA 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHordeumxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxchemistry 2aPlant Virusesxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Alignment 0abarley yellow dwarf luteovirus 0apav serotype 0agenome 0atranslation 0afusion proteins1 aBrault, V.1 aMiller, W.A.0 tVirology.g1992 Apr., v. 187, no. 2 p.711-722x0042-68227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02454naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008500130300001600215300002200231520143300253650001601686650001801702650000901720650001301729650001601742650001501758650002301773650001101796650001501807651000901822653003601831700002701867700002201894700001501916773008201931852000902013939003302022946001302055655001202068IND9101016420221120104203.0910226e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910101642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrajewski, W.F.12aA Monte Carlo study of rainfall sampling effect on a distributed catchment model  ap. 119-128.  ap. 119-128. maps.  aA Monte Carlo study of a physically based distributed-parameter hydrologic model is described. The catchment model simulates overland flow and streamflow, and it is based on the kinematic wave concept. Soil Conservation Service curves are used to model rainfall excess within the basin. The model was applied to the Ralston Creek watershed, a small (7.5 km2) rural catchment in eastern Iowa. Sensitivity of the model response with respect to rainfall-input spatial and temporal sampling density was investigated. The input data were generated by a space-time stochastic model of rainfall. The generated rainfall fields were sampled by the varied-density synthetic rain gauge networks. The basin response, based on 5-min increment input data from a network of high density with about 1 gauge per 0.1 km2 was assumed to be the "ground truth," and other results were compared against it. Included in the study was also a simple lumped parameter model based on the unit hydrograph concept. Results were interpreted in terms of hydrograph characteristics such as peak magnitude, time-to-peak, and total runoff volume. The results indicate higher sensitivity of basin response with respect to the temporal resolution than to the spatial resolution of the rainfall data. Also, the frequency analysis of the flood peaks shows severe underestimation by the lumped model. This may have implications for the design of hydraulic structures. 3astream flow 3aoverland flow 3arain 3asampling 3arain gauges 3awatersheds 3aMonte Carlo method 3amodels 3akinematics 3aIowa 0adistributed hydrological models1 aPrasāda, Lakṣmi Ji.1 aGeorgakakos, K.P.1 aJain, S.C.0 tWater resources research.g1991 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.119-128x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02347naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010000125300001800225300003000243520128900273650001501562650001801577650002101595650001501616650001701631650001301648650002001661650001801681650001901699650001401718650001401732650001201746651001301758653002101771700001701792773008501809852000901894939003301903946001301936655001201949IND9100978220221120094532.0910225e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910097822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMast, M.A.10aChemical weathering in the Loch Vale Watershed, Rocky Mountain Mountain National Park, Colorado  ap. 2971-2978.  ap. 2971-2978. ill., maps.  aMineralogic, hydrologic, and geochemical data were used to determine the source of solutes to surface waters draining the Loch Vale Watershed (LVWS), an alpine-subalpine drainage located in the Front Range of Colorado. The flux of dissolved solids from LVWS is primarily controlled by interactions between snowmelt and materials derived from the local bedrock; the biomass has only a minor effect on solute budgets except for ammonium. LVWS is underlain by Precambrian granite and gneiss, the major minerals include quartz, microcline, plagioclase, biotite, and sillimanite. Small amounts of calcite were found along hydrothermally altered zones in the bedrock. Mass balance calculations indicate that the weathering of calcite contributes nearly 40% of the cations derived within the basin. The importance of calcite weathering in LVWS is a result of its chemical reactivity and the high rate of physical erosion in this alpine environment. The average cationic denudation rate in the drainage (390 eq/ha/yr) is similar to long-term rates in forested Adirondack watersheds (500-600 eq/ha/yr), but much lower than the average for the North American Continent (3800 eq/ha/yr). Surface waters in LVWS are susceptible to acidification should acid deposition from the atmosphere increase. 3awatersheds 3asurface water 3asurface drainage 3aweathering 3ageochemistry 3aminerals 3aacid deposition 3aacidification 3anational parks 3ahighlands 3amountains 3asolutes 3aColorado 0abedrock minerals1 aDrever, J.I.0 tWater resources research.g1990 Dec., v. 26, no. 12 p.2971-2978x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03775naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245015100171300001600322500013200338520202700470650003002497650001502527650001002542650002802552650001802580650001102598650001502609650002002624650001702644650001102661650001302672650001402685650001402699650001402713650001902727650001702746650001502763650001602778650001702794650001502811650002102826650001302847650001002860700001702870700001302887700002402900700001502924700001602939700001702955700001602972773014502988856005503133852000903188655001203197IND60595144720180925000000.0180529e20171130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059514472DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1188.382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEitle, M.

The monophagous parasite affects the host by inhibition of water- and mineral uptake, sink-source translocation, changes in secondary metabolisms and manipulation of root growth. Grafted phylloxerated vines rarely show severe plant damage. Compensation effects on leaf galled vines have been proposed, however no information is available for root galled vines. In two experiments we aimed to determine effects of root phylloxeration on the primary metabolism of Vitis spp. We hypothesise that affected vines respond with a compensation strategy consisting of an increased root growth, leaf respiration and photosynthetic activity. Experiment 1 was conducted to analyse phylloxeration effects on carbohydrate mobility within grafted vines (V. vinifera L. 'Pinot Noir' on SO4). Experiment 2 analyzed potential phylloxeration effects on vines under nitrogen deficiency on Teleki 5C (V. berlandieri × V. riparia). Assessed parameters included plant phenology, quantitative plant growth, levels of macro and micro nutrients, photosynthetic activity, gas exchange and activity of enzymes related to carbohydrate mobility (sucrose synthase, vacuolar invertase, cell wall invertase). Our results showed an increased root mass in combination with elevated carbon and nitrogen levels in the root system of phylloxerated vines. Gas exchange and enzymatic activity of enzymes related to carbohydrate mobility were increased upon phylloxeration. However shoot and berry growths were not reduced. In conclusion these results show that more carbohydrates are imported in the root system upon phylloxeration without reductions of shoot and berry growth indicating a compensation strategy of the host. However it is unclear whether grape phylloxera actively triggers the import of carbohydrates to the root system by potential effectors or the host counteracts the lack of nutrients withdrawn by the parasite. 3aDaktulosphaira vitifoliae 3aPhylloxera 3aVitis 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon 3acell walls 3aenzyme activity 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aparasites 3aphenology 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant damage 3aroot galls 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3arootstocks 3asucrose synthase 3avacuoles 3avines1 aCargnoni, M.1 aAcar, A.1 aMartinez, S.

The galls (histoid leaf galls, root nodosities or tuberosities) are characterized by altered gene expression and highly active metabolism supplying the parasite with nutrients. In this study we analysed the endogenous regulation and role of stress-related hormones in plant-defence in galls to understand the physiological crosstalk and metabolism of the compatible phylloxera grapevine root interaction. Concentrations of main phytohormones were quantified on nodosities from Teleki 5C (V. riparia × V. berlandieri) combined with a phylloxera single founder lineage biotype C. Our results suggest pivotal and positive role of cytokinins for root gall formation whereas the auxin homeostasis was downregulated in infested nodosities. We conclude that phylloxera is able to impose specific changes in hormone pools, thus modulating hormone-based defence in strict dependence on their parasitism stage. 3aPhylloxera 3aVitis 3aauxins 3abiotypes 3acytokinins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahomeostasis 3ahormones 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aleaf galls 3ametabolism 3anutrients 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3aplant hormones 3aroot galls1 aGriesser, M.1 aDobrev, F.1 aVankova, R.1 aForneck, A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 30, , no. 1188 p.255-264dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1188.33  aDNAL 7aarticle01017naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009300129300001800222520028900240650002200529650001400551650002000565700001700585773008300602852000900685930003300694945001300727946001100740655001200751IND2039234320221120035741.0940504e19931217enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203923432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRickards, R.W.13aAn efficient asymmetric synthesis of the higher dipteran juvenile hormone III bisepoxide  ap. 8369-8372.  a(2E,6S,7S,10R)-Juvenile hormone III bisepoxide, the putative characteristic juvenile hormone of higher dipteran insects, has been synthesised efficiently and in high stereochemical purity from geraniol by application of Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation and dihydroxylation procedures. 3ajuvenile hormones 3asynthesis 3astereochemistry1 aThomas, R.D.0 tTetrahedron letters.g1993 Dec. 17, v. 34, no. 51 p.8369-8372x0040-40397nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01159naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011200128300001600240500001500256520017000271650001300441650003600454650002300490650002200513650001500535653001400550653001400564700001800578700002000596700001700616700001800633773008000651852000900731930003300740945001300773946001100786655001200797IND2039535620221120034927.0940517e19940124enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203953562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFielder, D.A.10aIsolation and characterization of 4-acetyl-benzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a new benzosazolinone from Zea mays  ap. 521-524.  a2019-12-05  aThe previously unreported 4-acetyl-benzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA, 1) was isolated from corn kernels.

The main goal of the presented research was assessment of genetic diversity of wild grape samples from different places of Europe and Mediterranean basin by using complete chloroplast DNA Illumina sequencing. The analyzed sequences were compared with the plastid genomes of Georgian wild grape samples from our previous research. The presented work is a first attempt of studying a wide range of the genus Vitis L., in particular wild grape samples from Europe and Mediterranean basin with next-generation technologies and adopting this application for the tracing of grape ancestry. The obtained results will help to understand the genetic relationships between wild and cultivated grapes from different geographical locations and explain the molecular bases of grape origin and evolution. Phylogenetic trees representing evolutionary relationship between analyzed grape samples are presented. 3aVitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris 3aancestry 3achloroplast DNA 3adomestication 3agenetic variation 3agrapes 3aphylogeny 3aplastid genome 3aCaucasus region 3aEurope 3aMediterranean region1 aKunelauri, N.1 aGogniashvili, M.1 aKotaria, N.1 aKotorashvili, A.1 aLacombe, T.1 aTabidze, V.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Nov. 30, , no. 1188 p.351-356dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1188.47  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245015100166300001600317520187500333650002002208650001402228650002002242650001502262650000902277650001402286650001302300650002502313650001502338650001402353650001402367650001302381650001102394650002902405650001202434650002402446700002502470700001802495700002002513700002302533773017202556856004602728852000902774655001202783IND60595148420221120034759.0180529e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059514842DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.241.6.7542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAprea, Francesco10aEffect of extradurally administered morphine on postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing surgery for thoracolumbar intervertebral disk extrusion  ap. 754-759.  aObjective—To investigate the effect of intraoperative extradural morphine administration on postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing thoracolumbar spinal surgery to treat disk extrusion.    Design—Prospective clinical trial.    Animals—26 client-owned dogs undergoing thoracolumbar spinal surgery.    Procedures—Animals were randomly allocated to receive morphine (0.1 mg/kg [0.045 mg/lb], extradurally) or no treatment (control group). Following preanesthetic medication with methadone (0.25 mg/kg [0.11 mg/lb], IM), anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane or sevoflurane in oxygen. Lidocaine and fentanyl were administered during surgery in both groups at fixed rates. In the morphine administration group, morphine was splashed over the dura mater immediately prior to wound closure. Postoperative analgesia was assessed for 48 hours by assessors unaware of group allocation, and methadone was administered as rescue analgesic. Demographic characteristics, urinary output, days of hospitalization, and perioperative use of analgesics were compared via a Mann-Whitney U test.    Results—Demographic data were similar between groups. In the morphine administration group, 2 of 13 dogs required postoperative methadone, and in the control group, methadone was administered to 11 of 13 dogs. The total number of doses of methadone administered in the 48 hours after surgery was 28 in the control group and 3 in the morphine administration group. No adverse effects were recorded in any group.    Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Intraoperative extradural morphine administration was effective in reducing postoperative analgesic requirement. Dogs undergoing thoracolumbar spinal surgery benefited from topical administration of preservative-free morphine administered directly on the dura mater as part of analgesic management. 3aadverse effects 3aanalgesia 3aclinical trials 3ademography 3adogs 3aextrusion 3afentanyl 3aintervertebral disks 3aisoflurane 3alidocaine 3amethadone 3amorphine 3aoxygen 3apreanesthetic medication 3asurgery 3atopical application1 aCherubini, Giunio B.1 aPalus, Viktor1 aVettorato, Enzo1 aCorletto, Federico0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 241, no. 6 p.754-759dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.241.6.754  aDNAL 7aarticle01227naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014200127300001800269500001500287520031200302650001300614650002100627650001900648650001400667653002500681653001400706700001700720700001500737773008300752852000900835930003300844945001300877946001100890655001200901IND2038791220221117183030.0940414e19931119enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203879122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuyama, Y.10aConcise synthesis of belamcandaquinones A and B by palladium (O) catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of bromoquinone with arylboronic acids  ap. 7637-7638.  a2019-12-05  aBelamcandaquinones A (1) and B (2), new dimeric 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives with cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity have been synthesized by palladium (0) catalyzed cross-coupling reaction between bromoquinone and arylboronic acids readily derived from belamcandol B (3), their common biogenetic precursor. 3aquinones 3amedicinal plants 3aIris domestica 3asynthesis 0aBelamcanda chinensis 0aIridaceae1 aKiriyama, Y.1 aKodama, M.0 tTetrahedron letters.g1993 Nov. 19, v. 34, no. 47 p.7637-7638x0040-40397nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01464naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012100127300001800248500001500266520033800281650001000619650002100629650002200650650003600672650001900708650002300727653002500750653001400775653001400789653002300803653001600826653001700842700001700859700001400876700001500890773008300905852000900988930003300997945001301030946001101043655001201054IND2038790920221117182956.0940414e19931119enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203879092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuyama, Y.10aBelamcandaquinones A and B, novel dimeric 1,4-benzoquinone derivatives possessing cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity  ap. 7633-7636.  a2019-12-05  aBelamcandaquinone A (1), a new dimeric 1,4-benzoquinone derivative, has been isolated as specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor (IC50 8.33 microM) from the seed of Belamcanda chinensis together with belamcandaquinone B (2), an inactive congener, and their structures elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data and chemical degradation. 3aseeds 3amedicinal plants 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3aIris domestica 3achemical structure 0aBelamcanda chinensis 0astructure 0aIridaceae 0astructural formula 0aderivatives 0abenzoquinone1 aKiriyama, Y.1 aOkino, J.1 aKodama, M.0 tTetrahedron letters.g1993 Nov. 19, v. 34, no. 47 p.7633-7636x0040-40397nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02725naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009600164300001600260520177400276650001302050650001602063650001602079650001602095700002302111700002202134700002002156700002002176773017202196856004602368852000902414655001202423IND60595149120221117182941.0180529e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059514912DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.241.6.7822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRead, Robyn L.10aAssessment of on-screen measurements, magnification, and calibration in digital radiography  ap. 782-787.  aObjective—To compare calibration methods for digital radiography in terms of measurement accuracy and interobserver variability.    Design—Prospective study.    Sample—Digital radiographic images of a 155-mm-long Steinmann pin.    Procedures—Measurement of pin length on digital radiographs was determined with a 25.4-mm-diameter calibration ball and commercially available software program via 3 calibration methods (ie, no calibration, autocalibration, and manual calibration). Digital radiographs of the calibration ball and pin were obtained with each placed at various vertical heights from the table (7 heights) and horizontal distances from the center of the beam (4 distances). Measurements of pin length on digital radiographs were made by 4 observers who were blinded to the orientation of the calibration ball and pin.    Results—Pin lengths obtained by each calibration method were significantly different from each other and from the true value. Manual calibration was the most accurate. There was no significant interobserver variability in measurements. There was no significant change in measurements when the calibration ball was moved horizontally, but pin length measurements changed significantly when the ball was moved vertically (away from the table) with an approximate magnification error of 1% per centimeter of distance between the calibration ball and pin.    Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—For digital radiography, manual calibration is recommended to achieve the most accurate measurements. Ideally, the calibration ball should be placed at the same vertical height as the object to be measured; however, if this cannot be achieved, the magnification error can be expected to be approximately 1% per centimeter of distance. 3aaccuracy 3acalibration 3ameasurement 3aradiography1 aDuncan, Colleen G.1 aWallace, Aaron D.1 aPerry, James A.1 aDuerr, Felix M.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 241, no. 6 p.782-787dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.241.6.782  aDNAL 7aarticle01190naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015700125300001800282520024400300650001400544650001700558650001400575650003200589650003600621650002100657653003300678700001700711773008200728852000900810930003300819945001300852946001100865655001200876IND2037082720221117183016.0940202e19930604enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203708272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGant, T.G.10aOxazoline-mediated synthesis of the Gossypium sesquiterpene lacinilene C-7 methyl ether and a structurally related HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase inhibitor  ap. 3707-3710.  aAn efficient synthesis of the phytoalexin, lacinilene C-7 methyl ether, via its probable biosynthetic precursor, 2-hydroxy-7-methoxycadalene is described.

The technique is used in this study to predict the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of streams in the Southern Blue Ridge Province (SBRP). ANC measurements between pairs of streams surveyed in this region were found to be spatially correlated over distances up to around 40 km. Predictions were improved by including elevation in the analysis to represent the combined influence of elevational gradients in climate, geology, soils, hydrology, and vegetation on stream ANC. The cokriging analysis identified specific stream reaches predicted to be most sensitive to acidification and located areas of high uncertainty. Stream ANC levels below 50 microeq/L were predicted for one-fifth of the upper nodes associated with digitized headwater reaches in the SBRP. The majority of these were located in the higher elevations of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, in the vicinity of Mount Mitchell, and in the Blue Ridge Mountains in southern North Carolina. 3aestimation 3astreams 3awater quality 3aacidification 3aNorth Carolina 0aassessment 0aspatial autocorrelation 0aacid neutralizing capacity1 aSale, M.J.1 aSchmoyer, R.L.0 tWater resources research.g1990 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.1401-1412x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02209naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013600127300001800263300002400281520124200305650001501547650002401562650001301586650001801599650001601617650002001633650002201653650001101675651001501686653003101701773008401732852000901816939003301825946001301858655001201871IND9004463120221117173616.0900914e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900446312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssaid, H.I.12aA multilayered sharp interface model of coupled freshwater and saltwater flow in coastal systems: model development and application  ap. 1431-1454.  ap. 1431-1454. maps.  aA quasi three-dimensional, finite difference model, that simulates freshwater and saltwater flow separated by a sharp interface, has been developed to study layered coastal aquifer systems. The model allows for regional simulation of coastal groundwater conditions, including the effects of saltwater dynamics on the freshwater system. Vertically integrated freshwater and saltwater flow equations incorporating the interface boundary condition are solved within each aquifer. Leakage through confining layers is calculated by Darcy's law, accounting for density differences across the layer. The locations of the interface tip and toe, within grid blocks, are tracked by linearly extrapolating the position of the interface. The model has been verified using available analytical solutions and experimental results. Application of the model to the Soquel-Aptos basin, Santa Cruz County. California, illustrates the use of the quasi three-dimensional, sharp interface approach for the examination of freshwater-saltwater dynamics in regional systems. Simulation suggests that the interface, today, is still responding to long-term Pleistocene sea level fluctuations and has not achieved equilibrium with present day sea level conditions. 3afreshwater 3asaltwater intrusion 3aaquifers 3ahydrodynamics 3agroundwater 3aphysical models 3asimulation models 3acoasts 3aCalifornia 0aflow in stratified systems0 tWater resources research.g1990 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.1431-1454x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03265naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011100127300001800238300002400256520213100280650001502411650001302426650001702439650002602456650002202482650001802504650001202522650001302534651001302547651001402560653002502574700001902599700001702618700001602635700002002651700001902671700001402690773008402704852000902788939003302797946001302830655001202843IND9004463020221117173607.0900913e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900446302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCronan, C.S.12aA comparative analysis of aluminum biogeochemistry in a northeastern and a southeastern forested watershed  ap. 1413-1430.  ap. 1413-1430. maps.  aThis comparative biogeochemical analysis focused on the patterns and processes of aluminum cycling in two small watersheds, one in the west-central Adirondacks of New York and the other on Cumberland Plateau of eastern Tennessee. Despite shared similarities in soil acidity, soil exchangeable aluminum concentrations, and elevated inputs of acidic deposition, the northern and southern sites exhibited strong differences in aqueous aluminum chemistry and transport. Soil and stream drainage waters in the northern watershed were more acidic, and contained higher concentrations of base cations, sulfate, nitrate, and organic carbon than waters in the southern ecosystem. Mean concentrations of biologically active labile inorganic aluminum, Al(i), ranged from 17 to 46 micromole L-1 in soil solutions and stream water in the northern drainage basin, and from 0 to 2 micromole L-1 in the southern system. The major differences in aluminum chemistry and transport between the two watersheds were related to different patterns of alkalinity generation and mobile anion transport in these contrasting systems. In the northern watershed, atmospheric inputs of acidity were partially neutralized through the release of mixed cations (Ca, Al, Mg, K, and Na) from soils and detritus. Because of the high mobility of sulfate and nitrate in the northern watershed, there was significant transport of Al through the soil profile and into stream water. At the southern watershed, soil sulfate adsorption, biological retention of nitrate, and base cation release were the major sources of acid neutralizing capacity for soil drainage waters and surface waters. Because these processes resulted in both the release of alkalinity and the removal of mobile strong acid anions, concentrations of labile Al remained low throughout most of the drainage profile in the southern watershed. At the ecosystem level, results indicated that aluminum cycling at the southern site was controlled more by biotic transfers (e,g., plant uptake and litterfall), while solution transfers (e.g., soil leaching) dominated aluminum cycling at the northern site. 3awatersheds 3aaluminum 3aforest soils 3abiogeochemical cycles 3achemical analysis 3asoil solution 3astreams 3aleaching 3aNew York 3aTennessee 0asoil water relations1 aDriscoll, C.T.1 aNewton, R.M.1 aKelly, J.M.1 aSchofield, C.L.1 aBartlett, R.J.1 aApril, R.0 tWater resources research.g1990 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.1413-1430x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03005naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009600131300001400227500002400241520201700265650001302282650001302295650002202308650001102330650001602341650002302357650001702380650001302397650001402410650001402424650001002438650001302448650001002461650001602471651002802487651001902515773007602534852000902610655001202619IND4463153820221117161305.0120507s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446315382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandák, Bohumil10aGermination requirements of invasive and non-invasive Atriplex species: a comparative study  ap. 45-54.  aIncludes references  aAtriplex sagittata, A. hortensis, A. tatarica and A. rosea are annual heterocarpic early succesional species not native in Central Europe. All of them inhabit predominantly urban areas, road margins, dumps or railways. Whereas A. sagittata and A. tatarica are relatively frequent species in warmer areas where they are highly invasive, A. hortensis and A. rosea are relatively rare species. Hence, the four closely related species constitute two natural invasive and non-invasive pairs, i.e. A. sagittata - A. hortensis and A. tatarica - A. rosea. Using comparative ecology I have tried to find differences in germination requirements of the two pairs of species and searched for attributes contributing to their invasiveness. Thus, both species pairs were compared in relation to the role of heterocarpy, dormancy breaking mechanism and germination requirements under different nitrate and salinity levels. All the Atriplex species tested possess a remarkable heterocarpy with a similar dormancy pattern, i.e. one type of fruit is non-dormant and one (in case of A. tatarica and A. rosea) or two (in case of A. sagittata and A. hortensis) fruit types showed different dormancy levels. The main result of this study is that in a comparison of germination requirements of the two species pairs, the germinability pattern is clearly different. In the A. sagittata - A. hortensis group the species differed in dormancy level and germinability of particular seed types. Invasibility of A. sagittata could be explained as the ability to time germination and consequently extend the germination period over several years. In contrast, the invasive A. tatarica and the non-invasive A. rosea did not show much difference, despite having very different distributions in the Czech Republic and the explanation of invasibility probably lies in other life history traits such as competitive ability, resource allocation to reproductive structures, relative growth rate, ability to spread in space or resistance to predators. 3aAtriplex 3adormancy 3adormancy breaking 3afruits 3agermination 3aindigenous species 3alife history 3anitrates 3apredators 3arailroads 3aroads 3asalinity 3aseeds 3aurban areas 3aCentral European region 3aCzech Republic0 tFlora.g2003, v. 198, no. 1 p.45-54dG.

Insects may use the flags as indicators of food rewards in the inflorescences below, as long-distance cues for locating and choosing flowering patches, or both. Clipping of all flags from patches of inflorescences in the field reduced the number of arriving insects, but not the total number of inflorescences and flowers visited by them. The number of flowers visited per inflorescence increased with inflorescence size, and inflorescence and flower visits rates significantly increased with patch size. Six percent of the plants in the study population did not develop any flag during blooming, yet suffered no reduction in seed set as compared to flag-bearing neighboring individuals. Removal of flags from all inflorescences in a patch reduced seed set in comparison with untreated controls, while flag clipping from ten randomly selected inflorescences in a patch did not decrease seed production. These results suggest that flags signal long-distance information to potential pollinators (possibly indicating patch location or size), while flower-related cues may indicate inflorescence quality. Plants that do not develop flags probably benefit from the flag signals displayed by their neighbors, without bearing the costs of signal production. Greenhouse-grown S. viridis plants allocated a low proportion of their biomass to flags. Plants grown under water stress did not reduce biomass allocation to flags as compared to irrigated controls. Water loss rates of picked flags were lower than those of picked leaves. These findings suggest that the expenses of flag production and maintenance are modest, reducing the selective advantage of individuals that do not carry flags. We discuss additional potential evolutionary mechanisms that may select for flag production. 3aSalvia viridis 3abiomass 3adry matter partitioning 3aflowers 3afoods 3ainsects 3aleaves 3apollinators 3aseed set 3aseeds 3awater stress1 aSadeh, Adi1 aGerchman, Yoram1 aShmida, A.0 tOikos.g2009 Nov., v. 118, no. 11 p.1752-1759dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17626.x 7aarticle02905naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010800163300001600271500002400287500001500311520156600326650000901892650001801901650001101919650002101930650001301951650001101964650001601975650001501991650002302006650002102029653003302050653002402083653002602107653001602133653001702149653002302166653002702189700001902216700001702235700002002252773010602272852000902378856004802387655001202435IND4430752320221117161322.0100101e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443075232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-009-9448-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Woo Seok14aThe Development of Rating Curve Considering Variance Function Using Pseudo-likelihood Estimation Method  ap. 321-348.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper employs a new estimation method for estimating stage-discharge rating curve parameters. In typical practical applications, the original non-linear rating curve is transformed into a simple linear regression model by log-transforming the measurement without examining the effect of heteroscedasticity of residuals. Therefore, the model with pseudo-likelihood estimation is developed in this study to deal with heteroscedasticity of residuals in the original non-linear model. The parameters of rating curves and variance functions of errors are simultaneously estimated by the pseudo-likelihood estimation (P-LE) method. Also simulated annealing, a sort of global optimization techniques, is adapted to minimize the log likelihood of the weighted residuals. At first, the developed P-LE model was applied to a hypothetical site where stage-discharge data were generated by incorporating various errors for statistical test. Also, the limit of stages for segmentation is estimated in the process of P-LE using the Heaviside function. For the validation of effects of the developed P-LE model, the results of the conventional log-transformed linear regression (LT-LR) model and the P-LE model are estimated and compared. After statistical simulation, the developed P-LE model is then applied to the real data sets from six gauge stations in the Geum River basin. It can be suggested that this new estimation method is applied to real river sites to successfully determine the weights taking into account error distributions from observed discharge data. 3aGeum 3alinear models 3arivers 3aresidual effects 3avariance 3agauges 3amethodology 3awatersheds 3aheteroskedasticity 3anonlinear models 0aPseudo-likelihood estimation 0aSimulated annealing 0aNon-linear regression 0anew methods 0aSegmentation 0aHeteroscedasticity 0aDischarge rating curve1 aLee, Kil Seong1 aKim, Sang Ug1 aChung, Eun-Sung0 tWater resources management.g2010 Jan., v. 24, no. 2 p.321-348dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-009-9448-8 7aarticle03209naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002200154245012200176300001600298500002400314520180200338650002602140650002702166650002102193650000902214650001802223650002002241650002002261650001002281650001602291650001802307650001002325650001702335650001302352650001202365650001702377650001002394650002202404700002002426700002302446700002102469700002102490773012502511852000902636856009402645655001202739IND4463129520221123023311.0120503e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446312952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2003.tb00054.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTidwell, James H.10aEffect of Water Temperature on Growth, Survival, and Biochemical Composition of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides  ap. 175-183.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of water temperature on growth rate, survival, and biochemical composition of juvenile largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were evaluated under controlled conditions in tanks for 12 wk. Feed-trained juvenile largemouth (9.1 +/- 1.9 g) were stocked into nine 3,610-L polyethylene tanks inside a greenhouse structure at 140 fish/m3 (500 fish/tank). Three treatment temperatures were evaluated (20, 26, and 32 C) with three replicates per treatment. Bass were fed to apparent satiation twice daily using a commercially available floating salmonid diet (45% crude protein and 16% lipid). After 97 d bass grown at 26 and 32 C had significantly higher (P < 0.05) average weights, SGR, condition factor (K), and production rates (kg/m3) than those in the 20 C treatment. Bass in the 26 C treatment had significantly lower (P 0.05) FCR and higher percent protein deposit (PPD) than bass raised at 20 and 32 C, which were not significantly different (P >0.05). There were no significant differences (P >0.05) in survival among treatments which averaged 97%, overall. Bass raised at 32 C had higher (P 0.05) lipid levels in the liver than other treatments. Whole body amino acid concentrations were not significantly impacted (P >0.05) by culture temperature. Largemouth bass raised at 26 C had significantly lower (P 0.05) levels of stearic acid (18:0) and significantly higher (P 0.05) levels of arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) than bass raised at 20 or 32 C. Bass raised at 32 C had significantly higher (P 0.05) levels of Linoleic acid (18:2 n-6), total saturates, and dienes than bass raised at 26 or 20 C. These data indicate that growth and feed conversion efficiency are reduced at 20 C. Growth is similar at 26 and 32 C, but feed and dietary protein are more efficiently utilized at 26 C. 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aamino acid composition 3aarachidonic acid 3abass 3acrude protein 3adietary protein 3afeed conversion 3afeeds 3agreenhouses 3alinoleic acid 3aliver 3apolyethylene 3aproteins 3asatiety 3astearic acid 3atanks 3awater temperature1 aCoyle, Shawn D.1 aBright, Leigh Anne1 aVan Arnum, Aaron1 aYasharian, David0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2003 June, v. 34, no. 2 p.175-183dWorld Aquaculture Societyx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2003.tb00054.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03003naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245009200184300001600276500002400292520122500316650002801541650001701569650001601586650002001602650001701622650001701639650001801656650001001674650001901684650001401703650001901717650001601736650001201752650004301764650003701807650005701844650002801901650001101929650005801940650004701998650001102045650004102056650000902097650003102106650002202137650004202159700001602201700001502217700001302232773011602245852000902361856005502370655001202425IND4439930520221123023207.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443993052DNAL7 a191440392pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01328.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNash, DM10aEndometrial Explant Culture to Study the Response of Equine Endometrium to Insemination  ap. 670-676.  aIncludes references  aMating-induced endometritis (MIE) is ubiquitous in the horse after natural mating and artificial insemination with frozen/thawed semen causing the most aggressive response. The majority of mares eliminate MIE 24-48 h after insemination. An endometrial explant culture was tested as a potential in vitro exemplar for sperm-induced MIE. Endometrial prostaglandin F₂α (PGF₂α) secretion and expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) were used as markers of inflammation. Endometrial explants were cultured from uteri collected from follicular phase mares. Explants were challenged with 1 or 10 x 10⁶ sperm/ml frozen/thawed semen, chilled semen, washed sperm or seminal plasma. Medium was collected 24 and 72 h after challenge and assayed for PGF₂α by radioimmunoassay. Treatment of endometrial explants with frozen/thawed, chilled semen or washed sperm did not change the secretion of PGF₂α compared with untreated controls. However, 24 h after challenge cultured explants expressed IL-8. The in vitro endometrial explant system did not represent the in vivo response to semen when PGF₂α was used as a marker of inflammation, yet the use of gene expression as an inflammatory marker warrants further investigation. 3aartificial insemination 3aendometritis 3aendometrium 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3ainsemination 3ainterleukin-8 3amares 3anatural mating 3asecretion 3aseminal plasma 3aspermatozoa 2aAnimals 2aCryoprotective Agentsxadverse effects 2aDinoprostxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndometritisxetiologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aEndometriumxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHorse Diseasesxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aHorses 2aInterleukin-8xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSemenxphysiology 2aTissue Culture Techniquesxveterinary1 aSheldon, IM1 aHerath, S.1 aLane, EA0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2010 Aug., v. 45, no. 4 p.670-676dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01328.x 7aarticle02966naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013500164300001400299500002400313500001500337520161500352650002701967650002201994650001102016650002502027650001402052650003002066650002202096650001102118651001302129651002002142651001202162651001402174653001702188700002302205700002102228700002602249700002502275700001802300700002302318773011002341852000902451856004802460655001202508IND4431797620221123023201.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443179762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-009-0292-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtterby, Helen10aPopulation genetic structure of the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) in western Europe and the associated occurrence of rabies  ap. 67-81.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe Daubenton's bat is widespread and common in the UK and countries bordering the English Channel and North Sea. European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2), a rabies virus, has been detected in Daubenton's bats in the UK and continental Europe. Investigating the relatedness of colonies and gene flow between these regions would allow regional estimates of the movement of Daubenton's bats and thus the potential for disease transmission. The genetic structure of the Daubenton's bat in western Europe was investigated by analysing variability at eight microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was found to be high at all sites (H E = 0.73-0.84), with little differentiation between bats sampled in the UK and continental Europe. Mantel tests indicated a significant correlation between geographic distance and pair-wise F ST (P = 0.000), between colonies sampled in Scotland and northern England. However, this was not continuous throughout the sampled range, with evidence of panmixia within the area sampled in continental Europe. Assignment tests show no evidence that the (potential) EBLV-2 sero-positive and virus positive bats were more likely to have originated from the continental rather than UK populations. There is no sufficient significant genetic differentiation amongst most UK and continental colonies to conclude that EBLV-2 is maintained in the UK by immigration. Results show that it is likely to be maintained at a low endemic level within the UK. The relative genetic uniformity of UK and continental populations implies that there is no migration barrier to EBLV-2, between these regions. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aRabies lyssavirus 3arabies 3adisease transmission 3agene flow 3aEuropean bat lyssavirus 2 3agenetic variation 3aMyotis 3aScotland 3aEnglish Channel 3aEngland 3aNorth Sea 0aRabies virus1 aAegerter, James N.1 aSmith, Graham C.1 aConyers, Christine M.1 aAllnutt, Theodore R.1 aRuedi, Manuel1 aMacNicoll, Alan D.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2010 Feb., v. 56, no. 1 p.67-81dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-009-0292-1 7aarticle02683naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007400164300001400238500002400252500001500276520153000291650002901821650001301850650001101863650001601874650002501890650001701915651001001932653002501942653002201967653001601989653003702005653001602042653002102058700001702079700001602096773010402112852000902216856004802225655001202273IND4446839420221122234909.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444683942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-010-9686-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wensheng10aWavelet Transform Method for Synthetic Generation of Daily Streamflow  ap. 41-57.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSynthetic generation of daily streamflow sequences is one of the most critical issues in stochastic hydrology. In this study, a new wavelet transform method is developed for synthetic generation of daily streamflow sequences. Firstly, daily streamflow sequences with different frequency components are decomposed into the series of wavelet coefficients W ₁(t), W ₂(t),...,W P (t) and scale coefficients (the residual) C P (t) at a resolution level P using wavelet decomposition algorithm. Secondly, the series of W ₁(t), W ₂(t),...,W P (t) and C P (t) are divided into a number of sub-series based on a yearly period. Thirdly, random sampling is performed from sub-series of W ₁(t), W ₂(t),...,W P (t) and C P (t), respectively. Based on these sampled sub-series, a large number of synthetic daily streamflow sequences are obtained using wavelet reconstruction algorithm. The advantages of this newly developed method include: (1) it is a nonparametric approach; (2) it is able to avoid assumptions of probability distribution types (Normal or Pearson Type III) and of dependence structure (linear or nonlinear); (3) it is not sensitive to the original data length and suitable for any hydrological sequences; and (4) the generated sequences from this method could capture the dependence structure and statistical properties presented in the data. Finally, a case study in Jinsha River, China, indicates that the new method is valid and efficient in generating daily streamflow sequences based on historical data. 3aprobability distribution 3asampling 3arivers 3astream flow 3anucleotide sequences 3acase studies 3aChina 0aSynthetic generation 0aWavelet transform 0amethodology 0aDecomposition and reconstruction 0anew methods 0aDaily streamflow1 aHu, Shixiong1 aLi, Yueqing0 tWater resources management.g2011 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.41-57dSpringer Netherlandsx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-010-9686-9 7aarticle02322naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011300166300001600279500002400295520133600319650001101655650001001666650001601676650003001692650000901722650002401731650001001755700001801765700001601783700001601799773011201815852000901927856004801936655001201984IND4382980220221122223806.0060821e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438298022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-006-7376-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Moujabber, M.10aComparison of Different Indicators for Groundwater Contamination by Seawater Intrusion on the Lebanese Coast  ap. 161-180.  aIncludes references  aIn order to evaluate the state of groundwater salination by seawater intrusion on the Lebanese coast, the region of Choueifat-Rmeyle, situated in the south of Mount-Lebanon, was chosen as a study zone. Overall, six wells were chosen and water sampling was done for three years starting from 1999 till 2002. Sampling was done on a monthly basis for ten months per year, from July till April. A complete physico-chemical analysis was done for all the water samples taken. Seawater intrusion in the Choueifat-Rmeyle region was studied through the interrelations between the chemical and physical constituents of groundwater. Results showed that the regions of Choueifat, Jiye and Rmeyle were subject to seawater intrusion. This intrusion was directly and simultaneously related to the pumping period and intensity but weakly linked to the quantity of rainfall. It was also related to the geologic nature of the study area. Furthermore, the actual intrusion in the study zone increases the already existing salinity problems. The salinity rates of wells water oscillated between 0.7 dS/m and 5.5 dS/m with the majority above 2 dS/m. This is leading to intolerable levels of water and soil salinity, inadequate for the cultivation of many crops, thus threatening their growth and production and reducing the agrodiversity in the region. 3acoasts 3acrops 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3arain 3asaltwater intrusion 3awells1 aBou Samra, B.1 aDarwish, T.1 aAtallah, T.0 tWater resources management.g2006 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.161-180dKluwer Academic Publishersx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-006-7376-4 7aarticle02778naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245008800211300001600299520138700315592002801702650001801730650001101748650002001759650001701779651001201796651002001808653001801828653001401846653001201860653001201872653002301884653001201907700002201919700002001941700001901961700001701980700002201997700001902019700002102038700002602059700002102085773010802106856008502214852000902299655001202308IND60607426920221120041015.0180904e20160729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060742692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulazzani, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4281-097914aThe emergence of the Neolithic in North Africa: A new model for the Eastern Maghreb  ap. 123-143.  aThis paper is focused on cultural and subsistence changes in North African societies during the Early and Middle Holocene, with a special emphasis on the emergence of a productive economy in the Eastern Maghreb. An overview of Western Mediterranean Neolithic spread is first given in order to verify the trajectories evinced in European and North African contexts as well as the different models for neolithisation recently proposed in both contexts. A chrono-stratigraphical, economical and technological analysis carried out from coastal (SHM-1) and inland (Doukanet el Khoutifa and Kef Hamda) Tunisian sites is then proposed. New AMS dates offer insights on Upper Capsian development as well as on the Neolithic transition during the 9th and 8th millennium cal BP. Information gathered at SHM-1 and Kef Hamda indicates the acquisition of some specific Neolithic features such as decorated pottery in a hunter–gatherer context dated to 8000 cal BP. Data from Doukanet el Khoutifa hint at a Neolithic productive economy from 7400 cal BP based on pastoral activities and integrating the consumption of wild animals and plants, with no evidence for agriculture. These data confirm the specific North African pathways identified in other local contexts, where an active role of Epipalaeolithic groups is at the basis of the Neolithic transition through an acculturation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacculturation 3amodels 3aplants (botany) 3awild animals 3aMaghreb 3aNorthern Africa 0aUpper Capsian 0aNeolithic 0aEconomy 0aPottery 0aRadiocarbon dating 0aTunisia1 aBelhouchet, Lotfi1 aSalanova, Laure1 aAouadi, Nabiha1 aDridi, Yosra1 aEddargach, Wassel1 aMorales, Jacob1 aTombret, Olivier1 aZazzo, A.q(Antoine),1 aZoughlami, Jamel0 tQuaternary international.g2016 July 29, v. 410 p.123-143dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011000154300002000264520112600284592002801410650002301438650002401461650001201485650001901497650001901516650001101535650001801546650001001564650002001574700001801594700001401612700001401626773012401640856007401764852000901838655001201847IND60696742820221120054150.0200529e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069674282DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra02668a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Lin12aA highly hydrophilic benzenesulfonic-grafted graphene oxide-based hybrid membrane for ethanol dehydration  ap. 20358-20367.  aA new type of hybrid membrane was prepared by blending sodium alginate (SA) with benzenesulfonic-grafted graphene oxide (BS@GO), which showed higher hydrophilicity and more defects or edges than GO to create channels for the transfer of water molecules. BS@GO was synthesized by reacting aryl diazonium salts with graphene oxide (GO). The BS@GO sheets were aligned parallelly to the membrane surface and affected the interactions between the SA chains. BS@GO could improve the hydrophilicity and pervaporation properties of SA-based hybrid membranes. Also, compared to GO fillers, BS@GO fillers could supply higher water permeance to improve the pervaporation flux and separation factor. For the pervaporation of 90 wt% aqueous ethanol at 343 K, the optimum hybrid membrane with 1.5 wt% BS@GO in the SA matrix showed the maximum permeate flux of 703 ± 89 g m⁻² h⁻¹ (1.4 times higher than that of an SA membrane), and the highest separation factor was 5480 ± 94 (5.6 times higher than that of the SA membrane). Moreover, the hybrid membrane exhibited good stability and separation ability during long-term testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3adiazonium compounds 3aethanol 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrophilicity 3amixing 3apervaporation 3asalts 3asodium alginate1 aLu, YingYing,1 aYao, Lulu1 aCui, Peng0 tRSC advances.g2020 May 27, v. 10, no. 34 p.20358-20367dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra02668a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245008500215300002000300520112700320592002801447650002201475650001501497650001001512650001901522650001701541650001101558650001301569650001401582650001601596650002101612700005501633700002101688700002201709700002101731700002301752773012301775856008701898852000901985655001201994IND60673198720221120073941.0191018e20190911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067319872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b023942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlade, Olalekan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1657-973710aKinetics of Thermal Decomposition of Tar in the Presence of Air and Nitrogen Gas  ap. 10167-10175.  aThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) provides useful information, which can be used in thermal processing and conversion kinetic modeling of materials, including hydrocarbons. In the present study, a series of TGA experiments were conducted in the presence of air (combustion) and under inert conditions (pyrolysis) using nitrogen gas with the focus of obtaining quantitative information to compare thermal decomposition characteristics of the two processes. The analysis was performed at different gas injection rates (10–50 mL/min) and heating rates (10–30 °C/min) under non-isothermal conditions from 30 to 600 °C. It was observed that the gas injection rates did not have significant impact on the thermal decomposition of the tar sample. However, increasing the heating rate shifted the peak temperatures of the reactions to higher temperatures. In addition, the combustion process generally has a higher conversion and peak rate of conversion than the pyrolysis process. Moreover, the activation energy, Eₐ (kJ mol–¹), obtained for the combustion process was observed to be higher than those of the pyrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acombustion 3afuels 3aheat treatment 3ahydrocarbons 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aMahmoud, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4395-95671 aAl Shehri, D.

Several subclasses of type IV pili have been described according to the characteristics of the structural prepilin subunit. Although type IVa pili have been implicated in the virulence of Ralstonia solanacearum, type IVb pili have not previously been described in this plant pathogen. Here, we report the characterization of two distinct tad loci in the R. solanacearum genome. The tad genes encode functions necessary for biogenesis of the Flp subfamily of type IVb pili initially described for the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. To determine the role of the tad loci in R. solanacearum virulence, we mutated the tadA2 gene located in the megaplasmid that encodes a predicted NTPase previously reported to function as the energizer for Flp pilus biogenesis. Characterization of the tadA2 mutant revealed that it was not growth impaired in vitro or in planta, produced wild-type levels of exopolysaccharide galactosamine, and exhibited swimming and twitching motility comparable with the wild-type strain. However, the tadA2 mutant was impaired in its ability to cause wilting of potato plants. This is the first report where type IVb pili in a phytopathogenic bacterium contribute significantly to plant pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3abiogenesis 3aexopolysaccharides 3afimbriae 3agalactosamine 3agenes 3aloci 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aplasmids 3apotatoes 3avirulence 3awilting1 avan der Waals, Jacquie E.1 avan Schalkwyk, Antoinette1 aTheron, Jacques0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.546-556dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-06-11-01663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05437naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024001700120024002100137024003000158024002200188024001100210040001800221100001400239245017300253300001800426500001500444506007600459506017300535520281600708592002803524506003703552650002303589650002803612650001603640650002103656650003003677650001303707650001203720650001403732650001803746650002603764650002403790650001903814650003503833650002003868650001903888650001603907650002203923650003503945650001803980650001903998650002504017650002004042653002504062653002804087700001904115700001804134700001704152700002304169700001704192700001804209773013704227856011204364856007604476956014504552961000904697852000904706655001204715IND60005986520221214231435.0150505e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000598652DNAL7 ano direct match2pmid7 a3043112aris7 a10113/598652hdl7 a10.1128/JVI.01321-142doi7 aPMC41359662pmcid8 ans5810  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wei10aNewcastle Disease Virus (NDV) Recombinants Expressing Infectious Laryngotracheitis Virus (ILTV) Glycoproteins gB and gD Protect Chickens against ILTV and NDV Challenges  ap. 8397-8406.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aInfectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease of chickens caused by infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). The disease is controlled mainly through biosecurity and vaccination with live attenuated strains of ILTV and vectored vaccines based on turkey herpesvirus (HVT) and fowlpox virus (FPV). The current live attenuated vaccines (chicken embryo origin [CEO] and tissue culture origin [TCO]), although effective, can regain virulence, whereas HVT- and FPV-vectored ILTV vaccines are less efficacious than live attenuated vaccines. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop safer and more efficacious ILTV vaccines. In the present study, we generated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) recombinants, based on the LaSota vaccine strain, expressing glycoproteins B (gB) and D (gD) of ILTV using reverse genetics technology. These recombinant viruses, rLS/ILTV-gB and rLS/ILTV-gD, were slightly attenuated in vivo yet retained growth dynamics, stability, and virus titers in vitro that were similar to those of the parental LaSota virus. Expression of ILTV gB and gD proteins in the recombinant virus-infected cells was detected by immunofluorescence assay. Vaccination of specific-pathogen-free chickens with these recombinant viruses conferred significant protection against virulent ILTV and velogenic NDV challenges. Immunization of commercial broilers with rLS/ILTV-gB provided a level of protection against clinical disease similar to that provided by the live attenuated commercial vaccines, with no decrease in body weight gains. The results of the study suggested that the rLS/ILTV-gB and -gD viruses are safe, stable, and effective bivalent vaccines that can be mass administered via aerosol or drinking water to large chicken populations. IMPORTANCE This paper describes the development and evaluation of novel bivalent vaccines against chicken infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) and Newcastle disease (ND), two of the most economically important infectious diseases of poultry. The current commercial ILT vaccines are either not safe or less effective. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop safer and more efficacious ILT vaccines. In the present study, we generated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) recombinants expressing glycoproteins B (gB) and D (gD) of infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) using reverse genetics technology. These recombinant viruses were safe, stable, and immunogenic and replicated efficiently in birds. Vaccination of chickens with these recombinant viruses conferred complete protection against ILTV and NDV challenge. These novel bivalent vaccines can be mass administered via aerosol or drinking water to large chicken populations at low cost, which will have a direct impact on poultry health, fitness, and performance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease prevention 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3avaccination 3abroiler chickens 3aGallid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aaerosols 3aviruses 3avirulence 3aglycoproteins 3agenetic recombination 3avaccine development 3adrinking water 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aadverse effects 3atissue culture 3aweight gain 3aprotein synthesis 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3alive vaccines 3aviral proteins 3arecombinant vaccines 3agenetic vectors 0aGallid herpesvirus 1 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aSpatz, Stephen1 aZhang, Zhenyu1 aWen, Guoyuan1 aGarcia, Maricarmen1 aZsak, Laszlo1 aYu, Qingzhong0 tJournal of virology.g2014 Aug. 1, v. 88, no. 15 p.8397-8406dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:J000001378x0022-538X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/598653Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.01321-143Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Newcastle%20disease%20virus%20%28NDV%29%20recombinants...304311_0.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012600163300001400289520151200303592002801815650002401843650001901867650001901886650002501905650002901930651001101959700001801970700002001988700001502008773009702023856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60559007620221122121416.0161122e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900762DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2016.12358082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Wu10aMitigation of ionospheric phase delay error for SAR interferometry: an application of FR-based and azimuth offset methods  ap. 58-67.  aSynthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals interact with the ionosphere layer when they propagate through the atmosphere, leading to the phase delay error for SAR interferometry (InSAR). Although several methods have been proposed to mitigate the ionospheric phase delay, the application of these methods has not been fully investigated. In this study, an application of two ionospheric mitigating methods, azimuth offset and Faraday Rotation (FR), is investigated and analysed through processing two Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 full-polarimetric SAR images over Alaska. The result indicates that both methods can effectively mitigate the ionospheric phase delay error for SAR interferometry, where the standard deviations of the ionosphere-corrected result have decreased to 3.2 cm for FR-based method and 2.0 cm for azimuth offset method compared to those before correction (7.3 cm). However, it is also found that the FR-based method is easily contaminated by the noise, which may be a limitation in practical applications. Moreover, analysis of the residual ionospheric phase from azimuth offset method suggests that the residual phase contribution in the azimuth offset and interferometric phase images is a limitation when using the azimuth offset to mitigate the ionospheric effect on SAR interferometry. This study may provide useful information when using these two methods to mitigate the ionospheric phase delay error on InSAR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication methods 3ainterferometry 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aAlaska1 aDing, Xiao-Li1 aJung, Hyung-Sup1 aZhang, Qin0 tRemote sensing letters.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 8, no. 1 p.58-67dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2016.12358083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245012000209300001800329520168600347592002802033650001902061650000902080650001702089650002002106650001002126650001302136650000902149650002502158650001602183650001202199650001902211650000702230650001702237650001302254650001502267650002202282650002002304650001402324650001402338700001902352700001702371700001502388773012102403856008702524852000902611655001202620IND60673198820221120074001.0191018e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067319882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b024192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kaiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3076-244X10aLaboratory Evaluation of a Low pH and Low Polymer Concentration Zirconium-CMHPG Gel System for Hydraulic Fracturing  ap. 9720-9735.  aLow pH fracturing fluids, such as the transition metal cross-linked guar derivative, can reduce the formation damage caused by clay swelling and fines migration in hydraulic fracturing treatments. However, a major disadvantage of the fluids is the uncontrollable rapid viscosity development, especially cross-linking under a pH below 3.0. In this paper, a novel delayed organic zirconium cross-linker with lactate and ethylene glycol as ligands was designed to overcome the shortcoming. Carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar (CMHPG), which results in a low gel residue after breaking, was used as the polymer at low concentration. The impact of gelation parameters on the properties of zirconium-CMHPG gel system was systematically investigated using a Sydansk bottle-testing method combined with a controlled stress rheometer. Desirable gelation time delay with agreeable rheological performance could be obtained by optimizing the polymer and cross-linker concentrations even at a pH as low as 2.0. Uniformly and compactly generated 3D network microstructures could firmly lock the free water within the gel, which further improved the thermostability and acid-resistance of the system. Meanwhile, the structures could also maintain the viscoelasticity of the fluid at a high level to ensure the efficient transportation of the proppants. Proppant settling and gel breaking tests demonstrated that the low pH and low polymer concentration gel system generated fewer insoluble residues with an uncompromised suspension performance. Moreover, the formation damage evaluation revealed that the low pH fracturing fluid system produced a better return permeability than the high pH system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid tolerance 3aclay 3acrosslinking 3aethylene glycol 3afuels 3agelation 3agels 3ahydraulic fracturing 3alactic acid 3aligands 3amicrostructure 3apH 3apermeability 3apolymers 3arheometers 3athermal stability 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 3azirconium1 aZhang, Guodong1 aLi, Zhuojing1 aHou, Jirui0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 33, no. 10 p.9720-9735dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b024193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003000145245016400175300001600339520120400355592002801559650002501587650002601612650003401638650001101672650001201683650001801695650001601713650001001729650002001739650001101759650001201770650001801782650002001800650000901820650002201829650003001851700002001881700001701901700002501918700002001943700001901963700002101982773015202003856007902155852000902234655001202243IND60548862520221118164150.0160905e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054886252DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-06-11-01672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkimoto-Tomiyama, Chiharu10aXopR, a Type III Effector Secreted by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Suppresses Microbe-Associated Molecular Pattern-Triggered Immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 505-514.  aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is the causal agent of bacterial blight of rice. The XopR protein, secreted into plant cells through the type III secretion apparatus, is widely conserved in xanthomonads and is predicted to play important roles in bacterial pathogenicity. Here, we examined the function of XopR by constructing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing it under control of the dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible promoter. In the transgenic plants treated with DEX, slightly delayed growth and variegation on leaves were observed. Induction of four microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-specific early-defense genes by a nonpathogenic X. campestris pv. campestris hrcC deletion mutant were strongly suppressed in the XopR-expressing plants. XopR expression also reduced the deposition of callose, an immune response induced by flg22. When transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana, a XopR::Citrine fusion gene product localized to the plasma membrane. The deletion of XopR in X. oryzae pv. oryzae resulted in reduced pathogenicity on host rice plants. Collectively, these results suggest that XopR inhibits basal defense responses in plants rapidly after MAMP recognition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aXanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae 3ablight 3acallose 3adexamethasone 3agene fusion 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aleaves 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3aplasma membrane 3arice 3atransgenic plants 3atype III secretion system1 aFurutani, Ayako1 aTsuge, Seiji1 aWashington, Erica J.1 aNishizawa, Yoko1 aMinami, Eiichi1 aOchiai, Hirokazu0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.505-514dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-06-11-01673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008500164300001400249520114200263592002801405650002001433650001201453650001101465650001901476700001401495700001501509700001701524700001301541700001601554773009701570856008501667852000901752655001201761IND60559007720221122064434.0161122e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900772DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2016.12358092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Lei12aA novel bundle adjustment method with additional ground control point constraint  ap. 68-77.  aBundle adjustment (BA) using parallax angle feature parameterization (ParallaxBA), has been recently reported to have better convergence and more accurate structure estimation in. However, ParallaxBA is a merely free-net BA model and is incapable of geolocating tie points in the global (geodetic) coordinate system. This study presents a novel BA method that incorporates Ground Control Points (GCPs) into ParallaxBA based on hybrid feature parameterization (ParallaxBA-GCP). Different from other BA methods based on feature parameterization using Euclidean xyz coordinates, the tie points in ParallaxBA are parameterized with three types of angles: azimuth, elevation and parallax angles. Therefore, the observation function of the tie points and that of GCPs were described with hybrid feature parameterization in the form of angles and xyz parameterization, respectively. The result of one real data set demonstrates that, when a poor initialization is given, ParallaxBA-GCP can converge within a very few iterations and rapidly triangulate high-quality tie points that satisfies the accuracy requirement of the aerial triangulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ageodesy 3amodels 3aremote sensing1 aChen, Rui1 aSun, Huabo1 aSun, Yanbiao1 aLiu, Lei1 aWang, Qiang0 tRemote sensing letters.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 8, no. 1 p.68-77dTaylor & Francisx2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2016.12358093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014300168300001800311520100500329592002801334650001501362650001601377650002101393650001801414650001801432650002001450650001301470700002901483700002801512700001701540700001201557700002201569700002001591700005501611700005601666773012901722856008401851852000901935655001201944IND60598660020221119124149.0180702e20180409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059866002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.8b010902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, I-Hsuan10aAnalytical Pipeline for Discovery and Verification of Glycoproteins from Plasma-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as Breast Cancer Biomarkers  ap. 6307-6313.  aGlycoproteins comprise more than half of current FDA-approved protein cancer markers, but the development of new glycoproteins as disease biomarkers has been stagnant. Here we present a pipeline to develop glycoproteins from extracellular vesicles (EVs) through integrating quantitative glycoproteomics with a novel reverse phase glycoprotein array and then apply it to identify novel biomarkers for breast cancer. EV glycoproteomics show promise in circumventing the problems plaguing current serum/plasma glycoproteomics and allowed us to identify hundreds of glycoproteins that have not been identified in blood. We identified 1,453 unique glycopeptides representing 556 glycoproteins in EVs, among which 20 were verified significantly higher in individual breast cancer patients. We further applied a novel glyco-specific reverse phase protein array to quantify a subset of the candidates.

Despite numerous unknown which will have to be resolved by future investigations, it already appears that pottery production and animal domestication of ovicaprines started very early in that area. These data were obtained for the first time at the site of Haua Fteah, a huge cave excavated in the 1950s and nearly fifty years later by the University of Cambridge. The discoveries made on the new site of Abu Tamsa confirm that the Neolithic began in north Cyrenaica as early as the beginning of the 8th millennium cal BP. The elements we possess indicate that this Libyan region had many traits in common with the eastern regions from where people obtained domesticated animals and shared technological lithic practices. Nonetheless, although the influence of Egypt is present, the local character of the industries dominates. The study of the Neolithic assemblage of Abu Tamsa indicates that there are no visible contacts with the Maghreb Capsian in the west, a hypothesis first supported by McBurney for Haua Fteah's Holocene industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3adomestic animals 3adomestication 3aindustry 3apeople 3aEgypt 3aLibya 3aMaghreb 0aNeolithic 0aCyrenaica 0aLibya 0aHaua Fteah 0aAbu Tamsa0 tQuaternary international.g2016 July 29, v. 410 p.144-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245020200156300001800358520151200376592002801888650004401916650002301960650002201983650002102005650001502026650002002041650001502061650001102076650000902087650000902096650001702105650001102122650001302133650000702146650001302153650003302166650002702199650002302226650001302249700001602262700001402278700001202292700001802304700001602322700001502338773012102353856007402474852000902548655001202557IND60631261320221119093604.0190220e20190211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063126132DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra09992h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenhua10aSynthesis and characterization of a surface-grafted Pb(ii)-imprinted polymer based on activated carbon for selective separation and pre-concentration of Pb(ii) ions from environmental water samples  ap. 5110-5120.  aEven the lowest concentration level of lead (Pb) in the human body is dangerous to health due to its bioaccumulation and high toxicity. Therefore, it is very important to develop selective and fast adsorption methods for the removal of Pb(ii) from various samples. In this paper, a new Pb(ii) ion-imprinted polymer (Pb(ii)-IIP) was prepared with surface imprinting technology by using lead nitrate as a template, for the solid-phase extraction of trace Pb(ii) ions in environmental water samples. The imprinted polymer was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms. The separation/pre-concentration conditions for Pb(ii) were investigated, including the effects of pH, shaking time, sample flow rate, elution conditions and interfering ions. Compared with non-imprinted particles, the ion-imprinted polymer had a higher selectivity and adsorption capacity for Pb(ii). The pseudo-second-order kinetics model and Langmuir isotherm model fitted well with the adsorption data. The relative selectivity factor values (αᵣ) of Pb(ii)/Zn(ii), Pb(ii)/Ni(ii), Pb(ii)/Co(ii) and Pb(ii)/Cu(ii) were 168.20, 192.71, 126.13 and 229.39, respectively, which were all much greater than 1. The prepared Pb(ii)-imprinted polymer was shown to be promising for the separation/pre-concentration of trace Pb(ii) from natural water samples. The adsorption and desorption mechanisms were also proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abioaccumulation 3adesorption 3ahumans 3aions 3alead 3alead nitrate 3amodels 3anitrogen 3apH 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity1 aChen, Lihua1 aSu, Qiong1 aWu, Lan1 aWei, Xiaohong1 aZeng, Liang1 aLi, Muchen0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 11, v. 9, no. 9 p.5110-5120dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra09992h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04237naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002600192245007400218300001800292506007600310520197200386592002802358506003702386650004402423650002002467650002502487650001102512650001702523650002402540650002202564650002502586650001402611650001802625650001302643651001802656653000802674653000902682653000902691653000802700653000802708653000802716653000802724653000802732653000802740653001002748653000802758653000802766653000802774653000802782653000802790653001002798653000902808653001102817653000802828653000902836653000902845653000802854653001002862653000902872653000902881653000802890653000902898653000802907653000702915653001002922653000802932653000902940653001102949653000802960653004002968653001703008653001203025653001503037653001103052700002103063700002003084700002503104773009903129856008603228852000903314655001203323IND60589639720221207082128.0200509e20180307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058963972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.0682doi7 aPMC71155462pmcid7 a294223692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Kimberly M.14aThe National Vaccine Advisory Committee at 30: Impact and opportunity  ap. 1330-1344.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThirty years after passage of legislation that created the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) “to achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization and to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions to vaccines,” this review reflects NVAC’s role and impact on the U.S. vaccine and immunization enterprise as an external advisor to the Department of Health and Human Services. We reviewed the history of NVAC in the context of the principles of its establishment, with a focus on its reports and recommendations. We performed a systematic literature review to identify NVAC reports published in widely-accessible public health journals, and we reviewed the available archives to identify other reports and resolutions approved by the committee not published in journals. We characterized key issues considered by NVAC according to the five goals of the 2010 National Vaccine Plan. The predominance of NVAC activities to date related to the implementation of immunization across the lifespan and the many aspects of the system needed to foster the goal of full immunization. Reflecting on the impacts of NVAC to date, this review identified 30 NVAC approved reports published in journals, 22 stand-alone resolutions, and 26 unique unpublished reports. The development of new and improved vaccines continues to represent a significant priority for NVAC, and we identified several challenges related to future vaccine innovation. Given the many factors that impact on policy changes in the vaccine and immunization enterprise, we encountered challenges associated with demonstrating attribution of specific policy changes to NVAC recommendations. Although difficult to quantify, this review suggests that NVAC played an important role in the improvements in the U.S. immunization enterprise over the past 30 years and that NVAC can and will continue to play an important role supporting U.S. immunization going forward.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDepartment of Health and Human Services 3aadverse effects 3abusiness enterprises 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3ainfectious diseases 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3alongevity 3apublic health 3avaccines 3aUnited States 0aACA 0aACIP 0aACCV 0aAPM 0aASH 0aCDC 0aCMV 0aEBV 0aFDA 0aHEDIS 0aHHS 0aHib 0aHIV 0aHPV 0aIOM 0aMACRA 0aMIPS 0aNAAIDC 0aNAM 0aNBSB 0aNCQA 0aNIH 0aNPRSB 0aNVAC 0aNVPO 0aNVP 0aOASH 0aRSV 0aTB 0aUSAID 0aVFC 0aVICP 0aVRBPAC 0aWHO 0aNational Vaccine Advisory Committee 0aImmunization 0aSystems 0aInnovation 0aSafety1 aGellin, Bruce G.1 aHinman, Alan R.1 aOrenstein, Walter A.0 tVaccine.g2018 Mar. 07, v. 36, no. 11 p.1330-1344dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245007800171300001800249520127400267592002801541650002301569650001601592650002001608650001901628700001401647700002001661700002201681700002601703700001901729700001801748700006001766700005501826700005701881700006301938773014702001856007602148852000902224655001202233IND60639213020221121232727.0190501e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063921302DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b129822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandrabose, Sreelakshmi10aHigh Exciton Diffusion Coefficients in Fused Ring Electron Acceptor Films  ap. 6922-6929.  aModest exciton diffusion lengths dictate the need for nanostructured bulk heterojunctions in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells; however, this morphology compromises charge collection. Here, we reveal rapid exciton diffusion in films of a fused-ring electron acceptor that, when blended with a donor, already outperforms fullerene-based OPV cells. Temperature-dependent ultrafast exciton annihilation measurements are used to resolve a quasi-activationless exciton diffusion coefficient of at least 2 × 10–² cm²/s, substantially exceeding typical organic semiconductors and consistent with the 20–50 nm domain sizes in optimized blends. Enhanced three-dimensional diffusion is shown to arise from molecular and packing factors; the rigid planar molecular structure is associated with low reorganization energy, good transition dipole moment alignment, high chromophore density, and low disorder, all enhancing long-range resonant energy transfer. Relieving exciton diffusion constraints has important implications for OPVs; large, ordered, and pure domains enhance charge separation and transport, and suppress recombination, thereby boosting fill factors. Further enhancements to diffusion lengths may even obviate the need for the bulk heterojunction morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3adiffusivity 3aenergy transfer 3asemiconductors1 aChen, Kai1 aBarker, Alex J.1 aSutton, Joshua J.1 aPrasad, Shyamal K.

For its functional role, GPR120 could be considered a potential target gene in animal nutrigenetics. In this work we resequenced the porcine GPR120 gene by high throughput Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing of amplified fragments obtained from 8 DNA pools derived, on the whole, from 153 pigs of different breeds/populations (two Italian Large White pools, Italian Duroc, Italian Landrace, Casertana, Pietrain, Meishan, and wild boars). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), two synonymous substitutions and one in the putative 3′-untranslated region (g.114765469C > T), were identified and their allele frequencies were estimated by sequencing reads count. The g.114765469C > T SNP was also genotyped by PCR-RFLP confirming estimated frequency in Italian Large White pools. Then, this SNP was analyzed in two Italian Large White cohorts using a selective genotyping approach based on extreme and divergent pigs for back fat thickness (BFT) estimated breeding value (EBV) and average daily gain (ADG) EBV. Significant differences of allele and genotype frequencies distribution was observed between the extreme ADG-EBV groups (P < 0.001) whereas this marker was not associated with BFT-EBV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aMeishan 3aPietrain 3aalleles 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3abreeding value 3afat thickness 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3alandraces 3anutrigenomics 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aswine 3awild boars 0aAssociation study 0aGPR120 0aHeavy pigs 0aIon Torrent semiconductor sequencing 0aSNP1 aBertolini, Francesca1 aScotti, Emilio1 aSchiavo, Giuseppina1 aColombo, Michela1 aTrevisi, Paolo1 aRibani, Anisa1 aButtazzoni, Luca1 aRusso, Vincenzo1 aDall'Olio, Stefania0 tAnimal biotechnology.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 26, no. 2 p.92-97dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2014.8813693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01605naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245006300204300002000267500001900287520067000306592002800976650001501004650001401019650001301033650001901046650001101065773015001076856008001226852000901306655001201315IND60718044420221120224850.0201118e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071804442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b070072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlynn, Nick E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2915-200010aChemistry of Aged Beer and Spirits: Symposium Introduction  ap. 12776-12778.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Chemistry of Aged Beer and Spirits Symposium was organized at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall 2019 National Meeting & Exposition, San Diego, CA, U.S.A. in August 2019 with a keynote address, three informational talks, and six research-based talks.

The symposium was well-attended and supplemented with an introduction to brewing processes at a local brewery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeer aging 3achemistry 3adiacetyl 3afood chemistry 3awhisky0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 68, no. 46 p.12776-12778dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b070073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245013500200300002000335520140000355592002801755650001101783650001101794650002101805650002101826650002201847650002201869650000901891650001301900650001301913650001101926650001401937653001701951653002301968653003001991653004102021653002402062700006202086700005702148700006502205700006302270700006102333773014202394856007802536852000902614655001202623IND60707058220221119165812.0200812e20200717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070705822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c080862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandan, Ravi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9244-359410aInner Sphere Electron Transfer Promotion on Homogeneously Dispersed Fe-Nₓ Centers for Energy-Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction  ap. 36026-36039.  aThe study reports the optimized incorporation of pyridinic nitrogen in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to realize effective Fe-Nₓ centers throughout the framework. The study unveils nitrogen as a valuable asset to promote the homogeneous dispersion of Fe moieties throughout the CNT framework, which is a necessary component to institute uniform Fe-Nₓ centers. In addition, pyridinic nitrogen causes disruption in strongly delocalized π-electrons, which impart electron-withdrawing nature in the carbon matrix, resulting in an anodic shift in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) onset potential (Eₒₙₛₑₜ). The direct interaction of Fe-Nₓ with O₂, as evidenced by poisoning and computational studies, ensures the preferential inner sphere electron transfer mechanism. Despite the alkaline medium, the outer sphere electron transfer mechanism was muted, with suppressed HO₂– generation, preferential 4e– reduction pathways, and excellent cyclic stability. The study indicates the dependency of ORR half-wave potential on the electron transfer mechanism. The poisoning study unveils the direct involvement of Fe-Nₓ electroactive centers in facilitating ORR in alkaline medium. It further indicates a noticable increase (up to ∼25%) in peroxide generation—an unwanted ORR intermediate—and concomitant reduction in average electron transfer no. per oxygen molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy efficiency 3airon 3amoieties 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apoisoning 0aFe-Nx center 0apyridinic nitrogen 0aoxygen reduction reaction 0ainner/outer sphere electron transfer 0ametal−air battery1 aDevi, Hemam Rachna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9667-26901 aKumar, Ritesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6345-67911 aSingh, Abhishek Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7631-67441 aSrivastava, Chandan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9732-48421 aNanda, Karuna Kar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9496-14080 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 17, v. 12, no. 32 p.36026-36039dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c080863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245016300162300002000325500001900345520138700364592002801751650002501779650002401804650001701828650001801845650001201863650001901875650002801894650001801922650001201940650002101952653001201973653001901985653001602004653001602020653001802036700001602054700005702070773015002127856008002277852000902357655001202366IND60718044520221121005545.0201118e20200407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071804452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b071232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuhao10aEncapsulation of Phloretin in a Ternary Nanocomplex Prepared with Phytoglycogen–Caseinate–Pectin via Electrostatic Interactions and Chemical Cross-Linking  ap. 13221-13230.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we chemically modified a phytoglycogen structure to introduce negative surface charge via carboxymethylation (CMPG) and then prepared CMPG-based ternary nanocomplex particles through electrostatic interactions with sodium caseinate (core) and chemical cross-linking with pectin (shell). The chemical cross-linking process by glutaradehyde was systematically optimized under various temperatures and durations. The cross-linked ternary nanocomplex was comprehensively characterized, and our results showed that it had a size of 86 nm with a spherical shape, smooth surface, homogeneous distribution, and negative surface charge. The chemical cross-linking process significantly improved colloidal stability of the nanocomplex under simulated gastrointestinal fluids with digestive enzymes. The as-prepared nanocomplex exhibited exceptional capability to encapsulate phloretin, a natural dihydrochalcone, as a model lipophilic bioactive compound. The nanocomplex not only showed a slow and sustained kinetic release of phloretin under simulated gastrointestinal fluids but also dramatically enhanced its antioxidant activity under an aqueous environment compared to pure phloretin dissolved in ethanol. Findings from this work revealed the promising features of the as-prepared ternary nanocomplex as a potential oral delivery system for lipophilic bioactive compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acrosslinking 3aencapsulation 3aethanol 3afood chemistry 3agastrointestinal system 3alipophilicity 3apectins 3asodium caseinate 0aprotein 0apolysaccharide 0ananocomplex 0ainteraction 0across-linking1 aXue, Jingyi1 aLuo, Yangchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0001-11940 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Apr. 07, v. 68, no. 46 p.13221-13230dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b071233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011400170300001400284520106000298592002801358650001501386650001601401650001101417650002601428650001101454650001301465650002301478650001201501650000901513650001501522650001701537650001201554653002901566653003101595653002601626653002601652653002301678653001301701700001501714700001801729700002501747700002201772700002801794700003301822773010101855856008101956852000902037655001202046IND60604074620221117063532.0180716e20150220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060407462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2015.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Inés,10aHydrocarbons adsorption on metal trimesate MOFs: Inverse gas chromatography and immersion calorimetry studies  ap. 36-42.  aTwo commercial metal-organic frameworks, Cu3(BTC)2 and Fe(BTC), have been selected to compare the adsorption parameters obtained on these materials by two different techniques: immersion calorimetry and inverse gas chromatography (IGC), in order to find a relationship between thermodynamic parameters obtained by so different techniques. From comparison between the enthalpy of adsorption obtained from IGC and the enthalpy of immersion, three molecules of the same number of carbon atoms have been selected: n-heptane, methylcyclohexane and toluene. Both by IGC and immersion calorimetry, the interaction is stronger in Fe(BTC), being the aromaticity of TOL determinant in the strength of the interaction. However, splitting of the enthalpy of adsorption into the dispersive and specific components allows to deduce that both parameters are more important on the Cu3(BTC)2, due to the higher available surface area in the case of the dispersive interaction; and for the specific interaction, due to the high potential of interaction into the micropores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acalorimetry 3acarbon 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3aenthalpy 3agas chromatography 3aheptane 3airon 3amicropores 3asurface area 3atoluene 0aMetal-organic frameworks 0aInverse gas chromatography 0aImmersion calorimetry 0aAdsorption properties 0aSurface properties 0aBasolite1 aDiaz, Eva,1 aVega, Aurelio1 aOrdóñez, Salvador,1 aGuerrero-Ruiz, A,1 aCastillejos-López, Eva1 aRodríguez-Ramos, Inmaculada0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Feb. 20, v. 602 p.36-42dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2015.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01709naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013300160300002000293520077600313592002801089650001501117650002201132650001101154650001301165650001301178700002101191773012401212856007401336852000901410655001201419IND60696743520221120033436.0200529e20200527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069674352DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra02896g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaeyaert, Frits10aDesign of organic structure directing agents to guide the synthesis of zeolites for the separation of ethylene–ethane mixtures  ap. 20313-20321.  aIndustrial production of ethylene entails a costly separation from the ethane by-product, and this separation is the dominant consumer of energy in the process. Zeolites have been proposed as a next generation material for this separation process, and a molecular screen of all known zeolites has revealed several promising candidate materials. None of the identified materials has yet been synthesized in the all-silica form evaluated in the screen. We here design organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) for four of the zeolites with the best predicted separation performance, two that are ethylene selective and two that are ethane selective. The designed OSDAs may enable the synthesis of these zeolites for more energy efficient separation of ethylene and ethane.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3aenergy efficiency 3aethane 3aethylene 3azeolites1 aDeem, Michael W.0 tRSC advances.g2020 May 27, v. 10, no. 34 p.20313-20321dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra02896g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012800160300001600288520130100304592002801605650001901633650001401652650001101666650002301677650002901700650001001729650001201739650001101751650002401762650001301786650001001799650002301809650001501832650001101847651001601858700001601874700001901890700001601909700002201925700002201947773014001969856004002109852000902149655001202158IND50089011720221119103818.0140425e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008901172DNAL7 a10.1111/jai.124102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrevé, N.

The majority of records (about 60% of the total) originate from a 12 km dammed section of the River Meuse in the province of Limburg. This paper reports on a study conducted to obtain information on the behaviour and habitat preferences of catfish at this location, whereby 20 adult Silurus glanis were implanted with both acoustic and transponder tags and their behavior monitored using a combination of passive and active methodologies. All fish remained within the study area and did not enter either the contiguous riverine sections or connected lakes. The catfish expressed schooling, nocturnal activity and strong site fidelity to a specific river section containing artificial habitat (in the form of moored boats) and were influenced by the presence and operation of nearby energy generation plants. The results are discussed in relation to the potential growth and dispersal of catfish populations and the extent to which anthropogenic activities (particularly energy generation schemes) at the site have inadvertently created favourable habitat that has assisted the colonization of catfish and impacted negatively on the wider fish community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilurus glanis 3aacoustics 3aadults 3aanimal communities 3aanthropogenic activities 3aboats 3acatfish 3aenergy 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alakes 3anocturnal activity 3aphilopatry 3arivers 3aNetherlands1 aVerspui, R.1 aLaak, G.

Bacteria were isolated from winter wheat from irrigated and rainfed fields in Hebei and Jiangsu provinces in China, respectively. Samples from rhizosphere soil, roots, stems, and leaves were plated onto King's medium B agar and 553 isolates were selected. On the basis of in vitro tests, 105 isolates (19% of the total) inhibited G. graminis var. tritici and all were identified as Pseudomonas spp. by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Based on biocontrol assays, 13 strains were selected for further analysis. All of them aggressively colonized the rhizosphere of wheat and suppressed take-all. Of the 13 strains, 3 (HC9-07, HC13-07, and JC14-07, all stem endophytes) had genes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) but none had genes for the production of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyoluteorin, or pyrrolnitrin. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of 2-day-old cultures confirmed that HC9-07, HC13-07, and JC14-07 produced PCA but no other phenazines were detected. HPLC quantitative time-of-flight 2 mass-spectrometry analysis of extracts from roots of spring wheat colonized by HC9-07, HC13-07, or Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79 demonstrated that all three strains produced PCA in the rhizosphere. Loss of PCA production by strain HC9-07 resulted in a loss of biocontrol activity. Analysis of DNA sequences within the key phenazine biosynthesis gene phzF and of 16S rDNA indicated that strains HC9-07, HC13-07, and JC14-07 were similar to the well-described PCA producer P. fluorescens 2-79. This is the first report of 2-79-like bacteria being isolated from Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aagar 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiosynthesis 3aendophytes 3afungi 3agenes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3airrigation 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenazines 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal DNA 3aroot diseases 3aroots 3asoil 3aspring wheat 3astems 3atake-all disease 3awinter wheat 2aAscomycotaxgrowth & development 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEndophytesxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMutation 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPhenazinesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aPlant Leavesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPlant Stemsxmicrobiology 2aPopulation Density 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRhizosphere 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTriticumxmicrobiology 3aChina 0aChina 0aantibiotic1 aMavrodi, Dmitri V.1 aMavrodi, Olga V.1 aBonsall, Robert F.1 aParejko, James A.1 aPaulitz, Timothy C.1 aThomashow, Linda S.1 aYang, He-Tong1 aWeller, David M.1 aGuo, Jian-Hua0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Dec., v. 101, no. 12 p.1481-1491dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPHYTO-04-11-00963Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02519naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245016700164300001600331500001900347520109500366592002801461650002301489650001601512650002201528650001501550650001801565650001001583650001401593650001601607650001101623650001001634650002001644650000701664650000901671650002901680653001601709653001601725653001401741653001301755700001701768700001901785773015801804856007801962852000902040655001202049IND60716768520221122045727.0201107e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071676852DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-11322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMhalaskar, S.R.13aAn investigation on fermentative changes during the production of food biocolours through solid state fermentation of broken rice by Monascus purpureus (MTCC 410)  ap. 310-315.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn attractive and stable colour is important in the marketability of foods and beverages. The utilization of broken rice as a by-product from agricultural farm can be of immense importance to convert relatively high-energy by-products into more useful and highly nutritious end product by use of microorganisms. In this respect the present investigation was aimed to address the fermentative changes in broken rice as a substrate during the production of food bio-colours through solid state fermentation by using Monascus purpureus (MTCC 410). The 7 days of SSF process was accompanied with the increase in the levels of protein, crude fat, crude fiber and ash content by values of 8.98% to 14.14%, 1.50% to 2.07%, 0.70% to 6.61% and 2.70% to 3.69% respectively while decrease in the level of carbohydrate by values of 74.32% to 27.71%, with lowering pH from 6.6 to 5.5. Present findings concluded that broken rice possesses good potentials for the bioconversion of the high energy organic materials into more useful and highly nutritious food bio-colours by Monascus purpureus (MTCC 410).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus purpureus 3aash content 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3acarbohydrates 3acolor 3acrude fat 3acrude fiber 3aenergy 3afarms 3amilk production 3apH 3arice 3asolid state fermentation 0aBio-Colours 0aBroken Rice 0aColorants 0aMonascus1 aThorat, S.S.1 aDeshmukh, Y.R.0 tJournal of dairying, foods & home sciences.g2017 Dec., v. 36, no. 4 p.310-315dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2084x0976-05637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ajdfr.DR-11323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010200167500001900269520134100288592002801629650002301657650002001680650001901700650001901719650001801738650001501756650001801771650002401789650001601813650001001829650001601839653002101855653000901876653001601885653000901901653003301910700002201943700001601965700001601981700001901997700002102016700002102037773012802058856008402186852000902270655001202279IND60684246720221120095308.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068424672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeech, Calvin10aBioaccessibility constrains the co-composting bioremediation of field aged PAH contaminated soils  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCo-composting for the remediation treatment of aged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in field contaminated soil was examined in this study. Two PAH contaminated soils collected from a manufacturing gas plant site with high PAH concentrations (184.00 ± 3.99 mg kg⁻¹ and 490.0 ± 43.53 mg kg⁻¹) were co-composted with cattle manure and wheat straw for up to 56 days in laboratory microcosms. A range of optimised co-composting treatments including addition of Triton-X100 surfactant and a biological surfactant from the Australian Red Ash tree (Alphitonia excelsa) were tested. There was no significant decrease in the PAH concentrations in any of the different co-composting treatments for either of the soils, despite an 87% decrease in a phenanthrene spike (100 mg kg⁻¹), and evidence of PAH microbial catabolic activity. Non-exhaustive extraction using hydroxypropl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) and linear regression modelling confirmed that PAH bioaccessibility constrained PAH co-composting remediation in these soils. The results demonstrate that co-composting alone is not an effective remediation strategy for certain aged PAH contaminated soils. For these soils some form of pre-composting chemical or engineering treatment is required to overcome bioaccessibility limitations in successful remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlphitonia excelsa 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acattle manure 3acomposting 3aphenanthrenes 3aregression analysis 3asurfactants 3atrees 3awheat straw 0aBioaccessibility 0aPAHs 0aRemediation 0aSoil 0aHydroxypropl-β-cyclodextrin1 aTighe, Matthew K.1 aPereg, Lily1 aWinter, Gal1 aMcMillan, Mary1 aEsmaeili, Atefeh1 aWilson, Susan C.0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Apr., v. 149 p.104922-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245013700170300002000307520220900327592002802536650001502564650001602579650001702595650002102612650002202633650001002655650001602665650001802681650001902699650001302718650002202731650001402753650001302767650001302780650003102793650001402824650001702838653005202855653005202907653001702959653001802976653001902994653002403013653003703037700003303074700002703107773012603134856008003260852000903340655001203349IND60566207120221120140442.0170405e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056620712DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b008102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonucci, Alessandra10aNoncovalent Protein and Peptide Functionalization of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Biodelivery and Optical Sensing Applications  ap. 11321-11331.  aThe exquisite structural and optical characteristics of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), combined with the tunable specificities of proteins and peptides, can be exploited to strongly benefit technologies with applications in fields ranging from biomedicine to industrial biocatalysis. The key to exploiting the synergism of these materials is designing protein/peptide-SWCNT conjugation schemes that preserve biomolecule activity while keeping the near-infrared optical and electronic properties of SWCNTs intact. Since sp² bond-breaking disrupts the optoelectronic properties of SWCNTs, noncovalent conjugation strategies are needed to interface biomolecules to the nanotube surface for optical biosensing and delivery applications. An underlying understanding of the forces contributing to protein and peptide interaction with the nanotube is thus necessary to identify the appropriate conjugation design rules for specific applications. This article explores the molecular interactions that govern the adsorption of peptides and proteins on SWCNT surfaces, elucidating contributions from individual amino acids as well as secondary and tertiary protein structure and conformation. Various noncovalent conjugation strategies for immobilizing peptides, homopolypeptides, and soluble and membrane proteins on SWCNT surfaces are presented, highlighting studies focused on developing near-infrared optical sensors and molecular scaffolds for self-assembly and biochemical analysis. The analysis presented herein suggests that though direct adsorption of proteins and peptides onto SWCNTs can be principally applied to drug and gene delivery, in vivo imaging and targeting, or cancer therapy, nondirect conjugation strategies using artificial or natural membranes, polymers, or linker molecules are often better suited for biosensing applications that require conservation of biomolecular functionality or precise control of the biomolecule’s orientation. These design rules are intended to provide the reader with a rational approach to engineering biomolecule-SWCNT platforms, broadening the breadth and accessibility of both wild-type and engineered biomolecules for SWCNT-based applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3abiocatalysis 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical elements 3adrugs 3aengineering 3agene transfer 3aimage analysis 3amedicine 3amembrane proteins 3aneoplasms 3apeptides 3apolymers 3aprotein tertiary structure 3asynergism 3atherapeutics 0asingle-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs or SWNTs) 0amulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs or MWNTs) 0abiomolecules 0ananoparticles 0abioconjugation 0aoptical nanosensors 0anear-infrared (nIR) fluorescence1 aKupis-Rozmysłowicz, Justyna1 aBoghossian, Ardemis A.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.11321-11331dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b008103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011400170506002800284520120100312592002801513506003701541650001501578650001001593650001401603700002001617773009601637856008301733852000901816655001201825IND60739865920221207051441.0201112s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986592DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/202026000122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArtem, Poteshkin10aDifferentiated methodology of coordinating abilities upbringing in children with infantile cerebral paralysis  aResource is Open Access  aIn the article the authors give the example of own created methodology of coordinating abilities estimation and upbringing in children with spastic diplegia and hemiparetic forms of infantile cerebral paralysis at the age of 11-12 of the Ist level of functional abilities according to Gross Motor Function Classification Systems.

In this study, we established a novel assay to detect food samples contaminated by PAT. First of all, we proposed a truncation protocol based on the secondary structure of aptamer. By removing the stem-loop structure one by one, an optimized truncated PAT aptamer (P-30) was obtained. To the best of our knowledge, the mechanism between PAT and P-30 was elaborated in the assisting of molecular docking and circular dichroism for the first time. Furthermore, we developed a sensitive aptasensor platform to detect PAT in food samples. The aptamer modified with gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) was used as fluorescent probe, and BSA-directed synthesized MnO₂ nanoflakes (MnO₂ NFs) as fluorescence receptor. Additionally, fluorescence signal amplification strategy assisted by DNase Ⅰ successfully improved the sensitivity of aptasensor. The developed assay had a low detection limit of 8.5 ng/L, and can be effectively used in apple and grape juice samples. Thus, the established aptasensor shows a broad application prospect in PAT detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3aaptasensors 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adeoxyribonucleases 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afood safety 3agrape juice 3ahuman health 3ananogold 3aoligonucleotides 3apatulin 0aTruncated aptamer 0aMolecular docking 0aAuNCs-Modified 0aAptasensor1 aSun, Yuhan1 aMa, Pengfei1 aKhan, Imran Mahmood1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5752-68341 aDuan, Nuo1 aWang, Zhouping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3868-81250 tFood control.g2022 Jan., v. 131 p.108430-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1084303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04065naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001700163245013400180300001800314500001500332520228800347592002802635650001802663650001402681650001502695650002102710650002202731650001402753650001602767650002302783650001702806650002002823650001402843650001802857650001902875650001602894650000902910650001302919650001502932650002102947650002402968650002302992650004303015650001203058650001703070650002403087650002403111651001503135651001503150653002403165700001703189700001503206700002303221773011603244852000903360856008203369655001203451IND4462449120221122234046.0160907e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446244912DNAL7 a220702802pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-08-10-02072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLieth, J. H.10aModeling Cold Curing of Pierce's Disease in Vitis vinifera ‘Pinot Noir’ and ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ Grapevines in California  ap. 1492-1500.  a2019-12-05  aPierce's disease (PD) of Vitis vinifera grapevines is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, a pathogen with a wide plant host range. Exposure of X. fastidiosa-infected plant tissue to cold temperatures has been shown to be effective at eliminating the pathogen from some plant hosts such as grapevines. This “cold curing” phenomenon suggests itself as a potential method for disease management and perhaps control. We investigated cold therapy of PD-affected ‘Pinot Noir’ and ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’ grapevine. In the fall, inoculated plants and controls of each cultivar were transported to each of four field sites in California (Foresthill, McLaughlin, Hopland, and Davis) that differed in the magnitude of cold winter temperatures. A model for progression of the elimination of plant disease in relation to temperature was conceptualized to be a temperature-duration effect, where temperatures below a particular threshold kill X. fastidiosa with increasing efficacy as the temperature decreases to some value <6°C. The temperature effect was modeled as a likelihood of a particular temperature killing the pathogen and is termed the “killing index”. We developed a mathematical model for cold curing of grapevines inoculated with X. fastidiosa and calibrated the model with cold-curing data collected in a field study. Parameter estimation resulted in lowest sum of squared differences across all 10 trials to be low temperature below which the organism is killed (T₀) == 6°C, number of hours to achieve 100% cure (N₁₀₀) == 195 h, number of hours to achieve 10% cure (N₁₀) == 20 h, and killing index (Kₓ) == 0.45 for Pinot Noir and T₀ == 6°C, N₁₀₀ == 302 h, N₁₀ == 170 h, and Kₓ == 0.41 for Cabernet Sauvignon. With the parameter estimates optimized by model calibration, the simulation model was effective at predicting cold curing in four locations during the experiment, although there were some differences between Hopland for Pinot Noir and Davis for Cabernet Sauvignon. Using historical temperature data, the model accurately predicted the known severity of PD in other grape-growing regions of California, suggesting that it may have utility in assessing the relative risk of developing PD in proposed new vineyard sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant tissues 3acultivars 3ahost range 3aPierce's disease 3asimulation models 3avineyards 3ahost plants 3aXylella fastidiosa 3atherapeutics 3adisease control 3apathogens 3arelative risk 3aVitis vinifera 3atemperature 3acold 3abacteria 3aprediction 2aCold Temperature 2aMicrobial Viability 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxtherapy. 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aVitisxmicrobiology 2aXylellaxphysiology 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0amathematical models1 aMeyer, M.

This study explores tourist loyalty to World Heritage Sites based on traditional gastronomy and in particular the role played by tourists’ satisfaction with restaurants serving local cuisine. First, a literature review was carried out, on the basis of which a questionnaire was developed to administer to a sample of tourists who had experienced the local gastronomy of the city. The objective of this study is to analyse whether the gastronomic satisfaction with the traditional cuisine of the place influences the overall image that visitors have of a World Heritage City, as well as the cognitive and affective image, and their future behaviour in terms of repeating the visit and subsequently recommending the city of Córdoba (Spain). The research method used is PLS-SEM with a structural equation model to evaluate the eight proposed hypotheses. The results show how satisfaction with traditional restaurants influences visitors’ cognitive, affective and overall image of the city, and also positively influences their loyalty to this destination. A novel aspect of this research concerns the influence that satisfaction with traditional restaurants exerts on the image of a destination. As a result, potential areas for improvement in traditional gastronomy at World Heritage sites have been identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3acuisine 3agastronomy 3aquestionnaires 3astructural equation modeling 3atourists 3aSpain 0aTraditional restaurant 0aLoyalty to destination 0aCognitive image 0aAffective image 0aOverall image1 aHernandez-Rojas, Ricardo David0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2022 Mar., v. 27 p.100470-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2022.1004703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011500161300002000276520116500296592002801461650002401489650001301513650002001526650001301546650000901559650001201568650002301580650001801603650002101621653004401642653002601686653001801712653001901730653004501749700002101794773012601815856008001941852000902021655001202030IND60566207420221120140611.0170405e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056620742DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b009042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shuang10aInteraction between Iron and Graphene Nanocavity: Formation of Iron Membranes, Iron Clusters, or Iron Carbides  ap. 12100-12108.  aMotivated from a recent experimental study on filling of a graphene nanocavity by iron membrane at room temperature (Science 2014, 343, 1228), we perform a comprehensive study of morphology changes of two-dimensional Fe membranes and iron carbides embedded in graphene nanocavities with specific sizes and shapes using the first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations show that Fe atoms tend to gradually seal the graphene nanocavity via growing a metastable Fe membrane until the nanocavity is completely covered. Notably, a densely packed Fe membrane in the graphene nanocavity shows higher structural stability than a loosely packed one as long as more triangular lattices can form to release high tensile strain. The Fe membrane under high tensile strain tends to collapse and turns into a three-dimensional Fe cluster upon detaching from the edge. The structural transformation of Fe nanostructures follows the melting recrystallization mechanism at ambient temperatures in high vacuum. Moreover, the iron carbide can also exist in the graphene nanocavity and once formed can be highly stable even at 1200 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarbides 3acrystallization 3agraphene 3airon 3amelting 3amolecular dynamics 3ananomaterials 3atensile strength 0atwo-dimensional Fe membranes/monolayers 0aultrafine Fe clusters 0airon carbides 0agraphene edges 0aab initio molecular dynamics simulations1 aZeng, Xiao Cheng0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.12100-12108dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b009043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009700166500001900263520103400282592002801316650001701344650002101361650001301382650001901395650001401414650001801428650002001446650001101466650000701477650001501484650002501499653003001524653001801554653001701572653001301589700002301602700002001625700002301645700001901668700002001687773012801707856008401835852000901919655001201928IND60684247020221116152156.0200228e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068424702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzizan, Asma10aUsing proteomics for an insight into the performance of activated sludge in a lab-scale WWTP  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe performance of a lab-scale wastewater treatment plant during the start-up phase was investigated. A period of varying pH resulted in the loss of ammonium removal efficiency together with a decrease in the specific autotrophic oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB). To understand how the AOB were affected at the molecular level, we used shotgun proteomics to quantify the relative protein levels in the system. Label-free quantification (LFQ) showed that during the time of poor ammonium removal, the marker enzyme hydroxylamine oxidase from Nitrosomonas sp. was massively reduced in intensity. The result of this study shows that quantitative proteomics has the potential to be used as a monitoring tool. Nevertheless, there are still some restrictions when measuring activated sludge using proteomic methods such as the availability of a suitable proteomic database. In this paper, we describe our experience of using publicly available databases for identification of activated sludge proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aactivated sludge 3aammonium 3abiodegradation 3adatabases 3ahydroxylamine 3aoxidoreductases 3aoxygen 3apH 3aproteomics 3awastewater treatment 0aLabel-free quantification 0aNitrification 0aRespirometry 0aLC-MS/MS1 aKaschani, Farnusch1 aBarinas, Hellen1 aBlaskowski, Svenja1 aKaiser, Markus1 aDenecke, Martin0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Apr., v. 149 p.104934-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002100157245013700178300001800315500001500333520183500348592002802183650002602211650001302237650002302250650001702273650001602290650001902306650001402325650001402339650001702353650000802370650002102378650002402399650001302423650002002436650001402456650001002470650002002480650003602500650001302536650001402549653001702563700003502580700002302615700002002638700002602658700001702684700002002701773009902721856009102820990002302911852000902934655001202943IND60098799020221119191854.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009879902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButturini, Elena10aMild oxidative stress induces S-glutathionylation of STAT3 and enhances chemosensitivity of tumoural cells to chemotherapeutic drugs  ap. 1322-1330.  a2019-12-06  aSTAT3 is a transcription factor constitutively activated in a variety of cancers that has a critical role in the inhibition of apoptosis and induction of chemoresistance. Inhibition of the STAT3 signaling pathway suppresses cell survival signals and leads to apoptosis in cancer cells, suggesting that direct inhibition of STAT3 function is a viable therapeutic approach. Herein, we identify the naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone cynaropicrin as a potent inhibitor of both IL-6-inducible and constitutive STAT3 activation (IC₅₀=12μM). Cynaropicrin, which contains an α-β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and acts as potent Michael reaction acceptor, induces a rapid drop in intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration, thereby triggering S-glutathionylation of STAT3. Furthermore, glutathione ethylene ester, the cell permeable form of GSH, reverts the inhibitory action of cynaropicrin on STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings suggest that this sesquiterpene lactone is able to induce redox-dependent post-translational modification of cysteine residues of STAT3 protein to regulate its function. STAT3 inhibition led to the suppression of two anti-apoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and survivin, in DU145 cells that constitutively express active STAT3. This event may be responsible for the decline in cell viability after cynaropicrin treatment. As revealed by PI/annexin-V staining, PARP cleavage, and DNA ladder formation, cynaropicrin cytotoxicity is mediated by apoptosis. Finally, cynaropicrin displayed a slight to strong synergism with two well-established chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin and docetaxel. Taken together our studies suggest that cynaropicrin suppresses the STAT3 pathway, leading to the down-regulation of STAT3-dependent gene expression and chemosensitization of tumour cells to chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3aethylene 3achemosensitization 3adrug therapy 3aglutathione 3acell viability 3acisplatin 3aneoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3aDNA 3aoxidative stress 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine 3agene expression 3asynergism 3agenes 3aphosphorylation 3apost-translational modification 3acysteine 3aapoptosis 0achemotherapy1 aCarcereri de Prati, Alessandra1 aChiavegato, Giulia1 aRigo, Antonella1 aCavalieri, Elisabetta1 aDarra, Elena1 aMariotto, Sofia0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.1322-1330dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.09.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245008400185300001600269520114600285592002801431650001201459650001201471650002001483650001701503650002001520650001201540650001001552650001401562650001701576650000901593650000901602650001201611650001101623650002101634650002901655650002401684650000901708650002901717650002901746650003201775700001801807700001501825700001701840700001801857700002001875700001901895773009501914856004802009852000902057655001202066IND50064609020221116164450.0130424e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006460902DNAL7 a235037652pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-013-1032-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Chi-Chien10aTail loss compromises immunity in the many-lined skink, Eutropis multifasciata   ap. 379-384.  aTail autotomy incurs energetic costs, and thus, a trade-off in resource allocation may lead to compromised immunity in lizards. We tested the hypothesis that tailless lizards will favor constitutive innate immunity responses over an energetically costly inflammatory response. The influence of fasting and colorful ornamentation was also investigated. We experimentally induced tail autotomy in the lizard Eutropis multifasciata and found that inflammation was suppressed by tail loss, but not further affected by fasting; the suppressive effect of colorful ornamentation was manifested only in males, but not in females. Constitutive innate immunity was not affected by any of these factors. As expected, only costly inflammation was compromised, and a less expensive constitutive innate immunity might be favored as a competent first-line defense during energetically demanding periods. After considering conventional trade-offs among tail regeneration and reproduction, further extending these studies to incorporate disease risk and how this influences escape responses to predators and future reproduction would make worthwhile studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3afasting 3afemales 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainnate immunity 3alizards 3amales 3apredators 3areproduction 3arisk 3atail 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aImmunity, Innate 2aInflammationximmunology 2aLizardsximmunology 2aMale 2aPigmentationximmunology 2aRegenerationximmunology 2aTailximmunologyxinjuries.1 aYao, Chiou-Ju1 aLin, Te-En1 aLiu, Hsu-Che1 aHsu, Yu-Cheng1 aHsieh, Ming-Kun1 aHuang, Wen-San0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2013 Apr., v. 100, no. 4 p.379-384dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-013-1032-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100003100180245009900211300001800310506007600328520118700404592002801591506003701619650002101656650002301677650001901700650001301719650002001732650001001752650001001762650001301772650002101785650002901806700002601835700001501861700001801876700002801894773012101922856004202043852000902085655001202094IND4501657420221207070302.0150427e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450165742DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.06827-112doi7 aPMC33024792pmcid7 a222875282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenzo-DÃ­az, FabiÃ¡n10aAutoregulation of the Synthesis of the MobM Relaxase Encoded by the Promiscuous Plasmid pMV158  ap. 1789-1799.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe streptococcal promiscuous plasmid pMV158 (5,540 bp) replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism and can be mobilized among a wide number of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The plasmid region involved in its conjugative transfer includes the mobM gene, which encodes the MobM relaxase, and the cis-acting origin of transfer (oriT). MobM initiates transfer by cleavage of supercoiled pMV158 DNA at a specific dinucleotide within oriT. In the present work, we have performed a detailed transcriptional analysis to assess the role of MobM in the control of its own gene expression. By in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that mobM transcription in Escherichia coli was mostly initiated from a promoter (Pmob2) different from the one (Pmob1) used in Lactococcus lactis. Whereas promoter Pmob1 was embedded within the oriT sequence, promoter Pmob2 was placed apart from but adjacent to oriT. Further, MobM was able to repress the expression of its own gene from both promoters. Given the promiscuity of pMV158, the organization of the mobM promoter region suggests a strategy of the plasmid to cope with different transcription machineries of the hosts it colonizes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactococcus lactis 3aautoregulation 3abacteria 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahosts 3aplasmids 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics)1 aSolano-Collado, Virtu1 aLurz, Rudi1 aBravo, Alicia1 aEspinosa Apolo, Manuel,0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 194, no. 7 p.1789-1799dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.06827-11  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245018000163500001900343520191400362592002802276650001902304650001202323650001502335650001102350650002102361650001102382650001302393653003802406653001402444653003202458653004702490700001702537700001702554700001802571700001702589700001402606700001302620700001602633700001302649700001402662700001902676773012802695856008302823852000902906655001202915IND60684247320221116152134.0200217e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068424732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yuan10aAntifouling potential of multi-walled carbon nanotubes-modified chlorinated rubber-based composites on the colonization dynamics of pioneer biofilm-forming eukaryotic microbes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aChlorinated rubber (CR)-based materials available for artificial surfaces have important commercial and industrial applications. However, CR-based materials are susceptible to diverse biofouling. In this study, different amounts (i.e. 0.2 wt % and 2 wt %) of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were incorporated into the CR matrix (CF₀), respectively, in order to prepare the MWCNTs-modified CR composites (MCRCs, CF₁ and CF₂) with improved antifouling (AF) properties. The CR-based coatings were characterized using the SEM technique and then examined in the natural seawater via long-term field exposure assays. The impact of MCRCs on the colonization dynamics of pioneer eukaryotic microbes (PEM) in the natural biofilms with regard to their diversity, abundance, distribution patterns and succession process was investigated using the single-stranded conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) technique. MCRCs demonstrated differential surface structure features and enhanced AF properties compared with the unfilled CR matrix. The diversity and abundance of the PEM on the MCRC surfaces were found to be lower than that of the CR matrix, particularly reduced on the CF₂ surfaces (P < 0.05); while the dominant population of PEM on the MCRCs was significantly higher than that of the CR matrix (P < 0.05). This indicated the colonization of the PEM on MCRC surfaces was greatly perturbed by the incorporation of MWCNTs in the CR matrix, as well supported by the reduced Evenness index and the clustering patterns. It seems that MWCNTs incorporated in the CR matrix would result in differential surface structures, enhanced AF properties and reinforced perturbation effect on PEM, which would further impede the development of natural biofilms and conduce to the prevention of macrofouling formation. MCRCs would have potential applications in future coating industries for biofouling mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3arubber 3aseawater 0aChlorinated rubber-based coatings 0aDiversity 0aPioneer eukaryotic microbes 0aSingle-stranded conformation polymorphisms1 aLang, Yanghe1 aSun, Tiedong1 aLiu, Qianqian1 aPan, Yusheng1 aQi, Zheng1 aLing, Na1 aFeng, Yajie1 aYu, Miao1 aJi, Yubin1 aZhang, Zhizhou0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Apr., v. 149 p.104921-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245013100208506011700339506007600456520115500532592002801687506003701715650002801752650002401780650000901804650000901813650002001822650001501842650002101857650001501878650002001893650001401913650002301927650001701950653001401967653002301981653001202004653001502016653001602031700002202047700005602069700001802125700006002143700002802203773010602231856008202337961001302419852000902432655001202441IND60768746120221207064601.0220507e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076874612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2022.1017962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuiatte, Vinicius1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4817-939110aInclusion of high-flavonoid corn in the diet of broiler chickens as a potential approach for the control of necrotic enteritis  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAvian necrotic enteritis (NE) is an infectious disease that impacts poultry worldwide causing economic losses. Discontinued use of antimicrobial growth promoters has been associated with high incidence of the disease, which has led to a necessity for finding new therapeutic alternatives. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds that have been studied for their health-promoting properties in animals and humans. This study presents a flavonoid-rich corn (PennHFD), as a potential alternative for ameliorating NE in broiler chickens. The effect of a diet formulated with PennHFD was compared to a diet based on commercially available corn in chickens subjected to a controlled challenge of NE based on a co-infection of Eimeria maxima and Clostridium perfringens. Birds fed on the PennHFD-based diet had lower incidence of intestinal lesions (P = 0.048), higher body weight gain (P < 0.01), lower feed conversion ratio (P < 0.01), and lower mortality rates (P = 0.023) compared to the control diet. Therefore, we concluded that the inclusion of the high-flavonoid PennHFD reduces the severity of an experimental challenge of NE in broiler chickens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium perfringens 3abody weight changes 3acorn 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3aflavonoids 3ahealth promotion 3aintestines 3amixed infection 3amortality 3anecrotic enteritis 3atherapeutics 0aflavonoid 0anecrotic enteritis 0apoultry 0aphytogenic 0aperformance1 aDominguez, Dorian1 aLesko, Tyler1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3059-85601 aJenkins, Mark1 aChopra, Surinder1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2614-49641 aLorenzoni, Alberto Gino0 tPoultry science.g2022 May, v. 101, no. 5 p.101796-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2022.1017963Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245011800166500001900284520122300303592002801526650001901554650001501573650002601588650001901614650002401633650002601657650002401683650001901707650001101726653001801737653003201755653002301787653002101810700001701831700001601848700001601864700001401880700001601894700001501910700001801925700001201943700001901955700001801974700001701992700001402009700001902023773012802042856008302170852000902253655001202262IND60684247420221116151923.0200217e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068424742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guolan10aMore effective removal of antibiotic resistance genes from excess sludge by microwave integrated fenton treatment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and class 1 integrons (intI1) in excess sludge, this study explored the effect of alkaline, microwave, fenton and the integrated treatments on ARGs removal. At the same time, the alteration of microbial community composition caused by different treatments was determined to explain the potential hosts of ARGs. By comparison, alkaline and microwave treatment increased the abundance of several ARGs and intI1, but fenton treatment largely reduced ARGs and intI1 abundance. Moreover, it was found that alkaline integrated fenton and microwave integrated fenton treatment strongly reduced target genes abundance, and the reduced amount was higher than fenton only. Additionally, the microbial community structure was slightly changed by alkaline and microwave treatment, but was remarkably altered by fenton treatment. After fenton treatment, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria was obviously elevated, suggesting that Firmicutes and Actinobacteria might be the possible hosts for the remaining ARGs. It is expected that this study could provide crucial information for reducing the risk of ARGs from excess sludge entering in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aFirmicutes 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiodegradation 3acommunity structure 3amicrobial communities 3amicrowave treatment 3arisk reduction 3asludge 0aExcess sludge 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aAlkaline treatment 0aFenton treatment1 aDeng, Dahang1 aHu, Chunyan1 aLou, Liping1 aLuo, Ling1 aHe, Jinsong1 aTian, Dong1 aXiao, Yinlong1 aHe, Yan1 aZhang, Shirong1 aDeng, Shihuai1 aDeng, Ouping1 aLan, Ting1 aHuang, Huagang0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2020 Apr., v. 149 p.104920-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2020.1049203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001800157245009300175300001800268520128000286592002801566650001701594650002001611650002101631650001101652650000901663650002101672650001401693650002801707650001501735700002101750700002501771700001701796700002101813700002101834700001901855773009901874856009101973990002302064852000902087655001202096IND60098799620221119190007.0141105e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009879962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonno, Tasuku10aReactive oxygen species exacerbate autoimmune hemolytic anemia in New Zealand Black mice  ap. 1378-1384.  aElevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage occur in the red blood cells (RBCs) of SOD1-deficient C57BL/6 mice. This leads to autoimmune responses against RBCs in aged mice that are similar to autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). We examined whether a SOD1 deficiency and/or the human SOD1 transgene (hSOD1) would affect phenotypes of AIHA-prone New Zealand Black (NZB) mice by establishing three congenic strains: those lacking SOD1, those expressing hSOD1 under a GATA-1 promoter, and those lacking mouse SOD1 but expressing hSOD1. Levels of intracellular ROS and oxidative stress markers increased, and the severity of the AIHA phenotype was aggravated by a SOD1 deficiency. In contrast, the transgenic expression of hSOD1 in an erythroid cell-specific manner averted most of the AIHA phenotype evident in the SOD1-deficient mice and also ameliorated the AIHA phenotype in the mice possessing intrinsic SOD1. These data suggest that oxidative stress in RBCs may be an underlying mechanism for autoimmune responses in NZB mice. These results were consistent with the hypothetical role of reactive oxygen species in triggering the autoimmune reaction in RBCs and may provide a novel approach to mitigating the progression of AIHA by reducing oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aerythrocytes 3agene expression 3ahemolytic anemia 3ahumans 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3areactive oxygen species 3atransgenes1 aOtsuki, Noriyuki1 aKurahashi, Toshihiro1 aKibe, Noriko1 aTsunoda, Satoshi1 aIuchi, Yoshihito1 aFujii, Junichi0 tFree radical biology & medicine.g2013 Dec., v. 65 p.1378-1384dElsevier Inc.x0891-58497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2013.09.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014900167520105700316592002801373650001201401650001701413650001601430650002401446650001001470650001601480650001601496650001401512650000701526650001601533650001801549650001101567650001301578650003401591650001101625650002101636653002201657653002801679653003201707700001601739700001801755700001701773700001601790700001801806700002101824700001801845700001501863700001601878700001101894700001201905773009601917856008702013852000902100655001202109IND60745229620221118024109.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074522962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1084412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Yiwen10aNovel pH sensitivity and colorimetry-enhanced anthocyanin indicator films by chondroitin sulfate co-pigmentation for shrimp freshness monitoring  aA pH-sensitive food freshness indicator film (PS-CS-BA) was fabricated with potato starch (PS) as film-forming substrate, blueberry anthocyanins (BA) as an indicator, and chondroitin sulfate (CS) as an enhancer.

It has been shown that similar to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) this chiral selector is useful for separation of enantiomers of neutral, basic and acidic analytes also in nano-LC. In comparison to our previous research, in which the chiral selector (CS) was bonded on native silica, in this study, the CS was immobilized on APS silica in order to improve chromatographic performance towards basic analytes. In fact, some improvement was observed and surprisingly not only for basic but also for neutral and acidic analytes. Again, quite unexpectedly almost no electroosmotic flow (EOF) was observed in capillaries packed with ca. 20% (w/w) amylose tris(3-chloro-5-methylphenylcarbamate) immobilized onto APS silica although the same APS silica before attachment of chiral selector exhibited significant EOF. In order to generate EOF in the capillaries with the CSP and enable capillary electrochromatographic (CEC) experiment on it, the short segment of the capillary column was packed with APS silica without chiral selector. The EOF in such capillary enabled CEC experiment and some preliminary results are reported here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aamylose 3achemical bonding 3achemical species 3aelectrochromatography 3aelectroosmosis 3aenantiomers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3asilica 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 0aAmylose tris(3-chloro-5-methylphenylcarbamate) 0aCapillary electrochromatography 0aCovalently immobilized polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phase 0aEnantioseparations 0anano-Liquid Chromatography1 aFanali, Chiara1 aFanali, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8221-61331 aGentili, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9541-38571 aKarchkhadze, Marina1 aChankvetadze, Bezhan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 July 19, v. 1623 p.461213-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4612133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007300160300001400233520074500247592002800992650001801020650002101038650002601059650001601085650001901101650002201120650001301142650001601155650002101171653001601192653000801208653000901216653001101225653001201236700001401248700001701262700001901279700001601298700001501314700001601329700001601345700005301361773009601414856008201510852000901592655001201601IND60626422720221117192726.0200516e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062642272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jing10aLigustilide inhibits the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts  ap. 58-64.  aThe purpose of this work was to study the effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of ligustilide on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The effects of ligustilide on the growth of CAFs and splenocytes were detected by MTT assay, and flow cytometry was used to detect effects on T-cell proliferation. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of CAF-related proteins after ligustilide treatment. This study found that ligustilide had no effect on the growth of splenocytes but that it could change the immunosuppressive function of CAFs through the TLR4-NF-κB pathway and restore T-cell proliferation previously inhibited by the CAF supernatant. Thus, ligustilide is expected to be a candidate for new antitumor drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic agents 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3aimmunosuppression 3aproteins 3asplenocytes 3atoxicity testing 0aLigustilide 0aCAF 0aTLR4 0aα-SMA 0aInhibit1 aXu, Yuwei1 aZheng, Qilin1 aWang, Yuanyuan1 aHu, Minghua1 aMa, Fangli1 aLong, Hanan1 aQin, Zhihai1 aTao, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0021-49950 tLife sciences.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 218 p.58-64dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009800157300001800255500002000273520164000293592002801933596007201961596006202033596005902095596009002154650002202244650001302266650001802279650001302297650001202310650000902322650001502331650002902346650001802375650001102393650002302404650001302427650002502440650000702465650001802472650001102490650002402501650001702525650001202542650004502554650001002599651001002609700001302619700001702632700001602649700005702665773011902722856007502841852000902916655001202925IND60786324420221122140518.0220803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078632442DNAL7 a10.1002/agj2.202492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jishi10aManaging soils and crops for sustainable agricultural intensification in coastal saline zones  ap. 3076-3088.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSustainable agricultural intensification to ensure global food security requires increases in both crop yields and nitrogen (N) productivity. Together, these requirements represent a considerable challenge, especially in saline regions where the high soil sodium (Na⁺) content limits crop growth. An integrated soil and crop management system (ISCM) may be more successful than procedures aimed at improving only soil quality (ISM) or crop management (ICM), or current local farmers’ practice for achieving sustainable intensification in coastal saline zones. In this study, we tested different management alternatives for their ability to improve soil quality, agronomic feasibility, and affordability over four harvests in a 2‐yr wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)–maize (Zea mays L.) rotation system in China. The ISM treatment with added cow manure and flue gas desulfurization gypsum reduced both Na⁺ content and pH in the subsoil, thereby improving grain yields and N productivity. The ICM treatment (i.e., optimized plant density and N fertilizer management) also increased crop yields and N productivity. The ISCM treatment integrated procedures of the ICM and ISM treatments to achieve the best agronomic benefit by increasing yields of wheat and maize by 25.3 and 30.8%, respectively, and N productivity by 109 and 97.6%, respectively, while simultaneously improving soil quality by increasing both calcium ion (Ca²⁺) and soil organic carbon content, and decreasing Na⁺ and pH in the subsoil. All three management alternatives increased economic benefits, and the ICM treatment was most valuable over the short term.  aPublisher supplied data  a(No. TS201712082)cTaishan Scholarship Project of Shandong Province  aKey ProgramcNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1706211cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a(2017CXGC0304)cthe Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aaffordability 3aagronomy 3acalcium 3acorn 3acow manure 3aflue gas desulfurization 3afood security 3agypsum 3amanagement systems 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apH 3aplant density 3asodium 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3asubsoil 3asustainable agricultural intensification 3awheat 3aChina1 aMiao, Qi1 aXue, Yanfang1 aLi, Zongxin1 aCui, Zhenling1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7834-89450 tAgronomy journal.g2020 July, v. 112, no. 4 p.3076-3088dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.202493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012300167300001400290520178200304592002802086650001902114650001802133650002402151650002002175650001502195650003002210650002602240650001902266650002402285650002902309650002102338650002102359650002202380650001902402650002102421650001502442650002302457650002102480650002702501651001002528653004002538653002002578653002602598653002102624653002902645700001802674700001802692700001702710773010302727856008502830852000902915655001202924IND60636394220221122035040.0200717e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063639422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lihua10aPlant, microbial community and soil property responses to an experimental precipitation gradient in a desert grassland  ap. 87-95.  aMajor changes in precipitation regimes can be predicted, but the effects of such changes on terrestrial ecosystem functioning are largely unknown. To investigate the effects of changes in precipitation regimes on the plant community, soil properties, soil respiration and bacteria community composition in an arid grassland, we conducted a three-year precipitation manipulation experiment (i.e., ambient precipitation as a control, ±20% and ±40% of ambient precipitation) in a desert grassland in the western Loess Plateau, China. The species richness, density, mean height, aboveground biomass and litter biomass were reduced in the −40% precipitation treatment. Soil water content at a depth of 0–20 cm peaked in the +40% precipitation treatment. The influences of precipitation treatment on dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil nutrients were small. Soil respiration varied along the experimental precipitation gradient and peaked in the +40% precipitation treatment. NO₃⁻-N was highest in the −40% precipitation treatment. Bacteroidetes had a higher relative abundance in the increased precipitation and control groups, while the abundance of Actinobacteria was higher in the decreased precipitation treatment in the wet year. The differences among precipitation treatments were not detected in the dry year. Thus, increased soil respiration along the precipitation gradient resulted from the positive responses of root growth, reflected in the plant community properties, and microbial respiration, reflected in the bacterial community composition. Different responses of ecosystem components to precipitation manipulation emphasize the necessity of studying the relationships between these components under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aaboveground biomass 3aarid grasslands 3aarid lands 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abacterial communities 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3adissolved organic carbon 3amicrobial carbon 3anitrate nitrogen 3aplant communities 3asoil nutrients 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspecies richness 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aChina 0aManipulated precipitation gradients 0aPlant community 0aLabile organic carbon 0aSoil respiration 0aSoil microbial community1 aXie, Zhongkui1 aZhao, Ruifeng1 aZhang, Yubao0 tApplied soil ecology.g2018 June, v. 127 p.87-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2018.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100003300169245007200202300001600274520141300290592002801703650001301731650001601744650001201760650001201772650001901784650001201803650001501815650002201830650001101852651001101863653002501874653001401899653000701913653002401920653001901944653002101963700002401984700002102008700002002029773010102049856011702150852000902267655001202276IND50065136320221116164559.0151127e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006513632DNAL7 a10.1658/1100-9233(2003)014[0711:FDPSRI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Welle, Marlies E. W.10aFactors determining plant species richness in Alaskan arctic tundra  ap. 711-720.  aWe studied the relationship between plant N:P ratio, soil characteristics and species richness in wet sedge and tussock tundra in northern Alaska at seven sites. We also collected data on soil characteristics, above-ground biomass, species richness and composition. The N:P ratio of the vegetation did not show any relationship with species richness. The N:P ratio of the soil was related with species richness for both vegetation types. Species richness in the tussock tundra was most strongly correlated with soil calcium content and soil pH, with a strong correlation between these two factors. N:P ratio of the soil was also correlated with soil pH. Other factors correlated with species richness were soil moisture and Sphagnum cover. Organic matter content was the factor most strongly correlated with species richness in the wet sedge vegetation. N:P ratio of the soil was strongly correlated with organic matter content. We conclude that N:P ratio in the vegetation is not an important factor determining species richness in arctic tundra and that species richness in arctic tundra is mainly determined by pH and flooding. In tussock tundra the pH, declining with soil age, in combination with Sphagnum growth strongly decreases species richness, while in wet sedge communities flooding over long periods of time creates less favourable conditions for species richness.Nomenclature: Hultéén (1968).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3aage of soil 3abiomass 3acalcium 3aorganic matter 3asoil pH 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3atundra 3aAlaska 0aAbove-ground biomass 0aN:P ratio 0apH 0aSpecies composition 0aTussock tundra 0aWet sedge tundra1 aVermeulen, Peter J.1 aShaver, Gaius R.1 aBerendse, Frank0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2003 Oct., v. 14, no. 5 p.711-720dOpulus Pressx1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1658%2F1100-9233%282003%29014%5B0711%3AFDPSRI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01405naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008900171300001400260520053700274592002800811650001600839650001900855650001800874650001000892700001700902773011700919856008201036852000901118655001201127IND60618863920221117224039.0181030e198102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061886392DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517581051002052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScardino, Frank L.10aTriaxial Woven FabricsbPart I: Behavior Under Tensile, Shear, and Burst Deformation  ap. 80-89.  aThis paper describes some of the unique properties and performance characteristics of triaxial woven fabrics.

Intensive investigation is now focusing on the potential function of HO-1 in inflammatory disorders, among which rheumatic diseases are one of the principal issues.“Heme oxygenase-1”, “rheumatic diseases”; “lupus”, “rheumatic arthritis”, “osteoarthritis” and “oxidative stress” were used as key words for searching in Pubmed and Google scholar database.Collected information from the related articles revealed the important role of pathogenesis and therapeutic potential of HO-1 in rheumatic diseases.Conclusions and discussionsHO-1 has potential as a target for the treatment of rheumatic diseases due to its characteristic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative role. However, it is essential to monitor the HO-1 expression during particular stage of the disorders, and levels of HO-1 in different tissues and organs should be further confirmed in order to correlate it with clinical symptoms and other hallmarks of rheumatic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal tissues 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon monoxide 3aheme 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3airon 3apathogenesis 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3atherapeutics 0aHeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 0aRheumatic diseases 0aLupus 0aRheumatic arthritis 0aOsteoarthritis 0aOxidative stress1 aLin, Ze-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3665-874X1 aHe, Shi-Jun1 aZuo, Jian-Ping0 tLife sciences.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 218 p.205-212dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.12.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011300172300001400285506002800299520196600327592002802293506003702321650001802358650001102376650002502387650001902412650001802431650001302449650001402462650002302476650001802499650001002517650002002527650004302547650001102590650003002601650001702631650001202648650001302660650001302673650001602686653002502702653002102727653002502748653001302773700001902786700002102805773013802826856008502964852000903049655001203058IND60739867520221207065254.0200625e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073986752DNAL7 a10.22103/jab.2020.14131.11372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 amohammadi, samira10aAssessment of hairy roots induction in Echium khuzistanicum by different strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes  ap. 63-80.  aResource is Open Access  aObjective In this study for the first time, different strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes, co-cultivation times, and concentrations of acetosyringon in leaf explants of Echium khuzistanicum were examined to produce hairy roots. Materials and methods The leaves of 21-day-old plant, different concentrations of acetosyringone (0,100,200 µM) and 3 strains of Agrobacterium (A4, ATCC15834 and 11325) were used for hairy root induction. In each explant, surficial wounds were created by a syringe contaminated with the bacterium and put for 10 minutes in bacterial suspension. After infection, the explants were transferred in the ½ MS solid medium supplemented with ascorbic acid (100 mg/L) to a light free growth chamber with 25 ° C temperature for 48 or 72 hours. PCR technique was used to confirm transformation by gene amplification with the rolBprimers. HPLC analysis was conducted on a high performance liquid chromatography system for shikonin measurement. Results The results of this study showed that, the first hairy roots emerged from wounded places after 14-21 days. The presence of A. rhizogenes T-DNA in the hairy root genome was confirmed by PCR using specific primers for rolB gene. Strain ATCC15834 had the highest rate of hairy root induction at 100 and 200 µM concentrations of acetosyringone indicating that the phenolic compound, acetosyringone, was effective in increasing hairy root induction. Generally, High concentrations of acetosyringone and more co-cultivation time together resulted in a significant increase in the hairy root induction in three strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenesis. Line 1 of hairy root produced 254.4±0.56 µg/g FW of shikonin. Conclusions For the first time the results of this research showed that transformation and hairy root induction in E.khuzistanicum is possible by Agrobacterium rhizogenes and it can be used in the gene transfer and hairy root culture in order to shikonin production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrobacterium 3aEchium 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aacetosyringone 3aascorbic acid 3abacteria 3acoculture 3agene amplification 3agene transfer 3agenes 3agrowth chambers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arhizogenesis 3arooting 3ashikonin 3asyringes 3atemperature 0aechium khuzistanicum 0amedicinal plants 0asecondary metabolite 0ashikonin1 aHaddad, Raheem1 aMohammadi, Vahid0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2020 Apr., v. 12, no. 1 p.63-80dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2020.14131.11373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002100146245010200167300001000269500000900279520086900288592002801157650001601185650001301201650002501214650001501239650002201254650001001276650001701286650002101303650002601324650002301350650002101373650001501394650002001409650001801429650001501447651001301462700002401475700002101499700001601520700001901536773010801555852000901663856008301672655001201755IND4380612520221118064801.0191122e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438061252DNAL7 a10.1094/CM-2003-1205-01-RS2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewell, Reece A.10aWeed Removal Timings in No-Till, Double-Crop, Glyphosate-Resistant Soybean Grown on Claypan Soils  ap. 0.  aepub  aField experiments were conducted in central and northern Missouri to evaluate the influence of glyphosate application timing on weed control, weed biomass production, and soybean (Glycine max (L.)

Glyphosate treatments included 0.75 lb ae/acre applied before planting, when weeds were 4-, 8-, or 12-inch tall, and 1.5 lb ae/acre applied when weeds were 24-inch tall. Removal of weeds with glyphosate at 0.75 lb ae/acre at the 8- and 12-inch timings resulted in weed biomasses and grain yields similar to the weed-free control at all six site-years.

E. Smith), was conducted using references describing parasitized FAW eggs, larvae, pupae and adults collected from different crops or habitats throughout the Americas and the Caribbean Basin. The crops and countries where these parasites were reported occurring in the Americas is also inventoried. Maize was the crop where the FAW was more frequently collected followed by rice. Overall, Chelonus insularis (Cresson) had the broadest natural distribution in the Americas. For the North American region C. insulares, Chelonus sp., and Euplectrus platyhypenae (Howard) were the most relevant parasitoids. In Central America, C. insularis was the most prevalent parasitoid, and in the South American region the most prevalent parasites were Archytas incertus (Macq.), A. marmoratus (Tns.), C. insularis, and Meteorus laphygmae (Viereck). Diapetimorpha introita (Cresson) is the most important pupal parasitoid of FAW occurring mainly in North America. An acugutturid, Noctuidonema guyanense (Remillet & Silvain), is the most important ectoparasitic nematode attacking adults of FAW and other noctuid moths in South and Southeastern US, and Mexico in North America, Caribbean Basin, Central America, and Northern South America. 3ageographical distribution 3aparasitoids 3aDiptera 3aHymenoptera 3ainsect pests 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3abiological control agents 3ahost-parasite relationships 3adevelopmental stages 3ahost plants 3ainsect surveys 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aNematoda 3anatural enemies 3acrops 3aSouth America 3aNorth America 3aCaribbean 3aCentral America 0aparasites 0aliterature reviews 0ahost stage1 aCarpenter, J.E.1 aHeinrichs, E.A.1 aFoster, J.E.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2003 Sept., v.  86, no.  3 p.254-289dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653/0015-4040(2003)086%5B0254:PAPOSF%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/98793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080212b20080301c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02120naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245008000162300001400242500001900256520102800275592002801303650001701331650000901348650002001357650001601377653001301393653002601406653002601432653002601458700002401484700001901508773015601527856007801683852000901761655001201770IND60716770620221118054203.0201107e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071677062DNAL7 a10.18805/ajdfr.DR-13372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Shalini10aQuality evaluation of biscuits supplemented with Rhododendron flower powder  ap. 65-68.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present study, Rhododendron flowers were used for the preparation of biscuits to enhance the utility of this valuable flower.DRied Rhododendron petals powder was incorporated at different levels (0%, 5%, 10% and 15%) in biscuits and their sensory and physico-chemical properties were evaluated.

M.10aChained Iron Microparticles for Directionally Controlled Actuation of Soft Robots  ap. 11895-11901.  aMagnetic field-directed self-assembly of magnetic particles in chains is useful for developing directionally responsive materials for applications in soft robotics. Using materials with greater complexity allows advanced functions, while still using simple device architectures. Elastomer films containing chained magnetic microparticles were prepared through solvent casting and formed into magnetically actuated lifters, accordions, valves, and pumps. Chaining both enhances actuation and imparts a directional response. Cantilevers used as lifters were able to lift up to 50 times the mass of the polymer film. We introduce the “specific torque”, the torque per field per mass of magnetic particles, as a figure of merit for assessing and comparing the performance of lifters and related devices. Devices in this work generated specific torques of 68 Nm/kgT, which is significantly higher than in previously reported actuators. Applying magnetic fields to folded accordion structures caused extension and compression, depending on the accordion’s orientation. In peristaltic pumps comprised of composite tubes containing embedded chains, magnetic fields caused a section of the tube to pinch closed where the field was applied. These results will facilitate both the further development of soft robots based on chained magnetic particles and efforts to engineer materials with higher specific torque.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3afilms (materials) 3amagnetic fields 3apolymers 3apumps 3arobots 3asolvents 3atorque 0amagnetic particles 0achains 0aelastomer 0aanisotropy 0aactuation 0alifter 0avalve 0apump1 aMishra, Sumeet R.1 aEvans, Benjamin A.1 aVelev, Orlin D.1 aTracy, Joseph B.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 9, no. 13 p.11895-11901dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b012093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012500170300001600295520231900311592002802630650001102658650001202669650002302681650001702704650002002721650001802741650004402759650001302803650001602816653002102832653003102853653001402884653003402898700002202932700002102954773012502975856008303100852000903183655001203192IND60693956920221119104815.0200804e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069395692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Gregory N.14aThe extent of counterion dissociation at the interface of cationic diblock copolymer nanoparticles in non-polar solvents  ap. 523-529.  aDiblock copolymer nanoparticles prepared in non-polar solvents that are sterically stabilized but possess ionic functionality from the inclusion of cationic comonomers in the stabilizer shell are known to exhibit complex electrokinetic behavior (Chem. Sci. 9 (2018) 922–934). For example, core-shell nanoparticles with cationic comonomers located solely within the shell layer have lower magnitude electrophoretic mobilities than nanoparticles containing the same cationic comonomers located within the core, whereas nanoparticles prepared using a minor fraction of steric stabilizer chains containing cationic comonomer repeat units have comparable electrophoretic mobilities to nanoparticles prepared with this cationic comonomer solely located within the core. We hypothesize that these observations can be explained in terms of the strength of the Coulombic interaction between counterions and the nanoparticle interface.The highly-fluorinated anionic counterion associated with these cationic nanoparticles is studied by 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in n-dodecane. This revealed only one type of 19F environment for a soluble macromolecular cation (the oil-soluble steric stabilizer chains used to prepare the nanoparticles), whereas two distinct environments were observed for the sterically-stabilized cationic nanoparticles. Both 19F diffusion NMR and 19F–13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) measurements support the existence of two environments for this counterion.The existence of two distinct 19F environments for the highly-fluorinated anion associated with the sterically-stabilized nanoparticles demonstrates the presence of spectroscopically distinguishable populations of ion pairs and of fully dissociated free anions. 19F NMR spectra recorded for sterically-stabilized nanoparticles with a fully ionic shell (all stabilizer chains containing the cationic comonomer) and those with a partly ionic shell (10% of stabilizer chains containing the cationic comonomer) reveal a higher proportion of dissociated anions in the partly ionic case. This suggests a stronger Coulombic interaction between counterions and the cationic interface when the shell is fully ionic, which accounts for the observed reduction in the magnitude of the electrophoretic mobility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acations 3acomposite polymers 3adissociation 3aelectrophoresis 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents 3astabilizers 0aCharged colloids 0aNuclear magnetic resonance 0aDiffusion 0aBlock copolymer self-assembly1 avan Meurs, Sandra1 aArmes, Steven P.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 577 p.523-529dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024003600127040001800163100002200181245009400203300001800297520189900315592002802214596008302242596007902325650001202404650001702416650000902433650001602442650001202458650001702470650001702487650001702504650001502521650001602536650002502552700002102577700001802598700002202616773012502638856008002763961001402843852000902857655001202866IND60535835420221120094200.0160805e20150707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053583542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b011922doi7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b011922chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanes, Rebecca
J.10aAllocation Games: Addressing the Ill-Posed Nature of Allocation in Life-Cycle Inventories  ap. 7996-8003.  aAllocation is required when a life cycle contains multi-functional processes. One approach to allocation is to partition the embodied resources in proportion to a criterion, such as product mass or cost. Many practitioners apply multiple partitioning criteria to avoid choosing one arbitrarily. However, life cycle results from different allocation methods frequently contradict each other, making it difficult or impossible for the practitioner to draw any meaningful conclusions from the study. Using the matrix notation for life-cycle inventory data, we show that an inventory that requires allocation leads to an ill-posed problem: an inventory based on allocation is one of an infinite number of inventories that are highly dependent upon allocation methods. This insight is applied to comparative life-cycle assessment (LCA), in which products with the same function but different life cycles are compared. Recently, there have been several studies that applied multiple allocation methods and found that different products were preferred under different methods. We develop the Comprehensive Allocation Investigation Strategy (CAIS) to examine any given inventory under all possible allocation decisions, enabling us to detect comparisons that are not robust to allocation, even when the comparison appears robust under conventional partitioning methods. While CAIS does not solve the ill-posed problem, it provides a systematic way to parametrize and examine the effects of partitioning allocation. The practical usefulness of this approach is demonstrated with two case studies. The first compares ethanol produced from corn stover hydrolysis, corn stover gasification, and corn grain fermentation. This comparison was not robust to allocation. The second case study compares 1,3-propanediol (PDO) produced from fossil fuels and from biomass, which was found to be a robust comparison.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cDivision of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems 3abiomass 3acase studies 3acorn 3acorn stover 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afossil fuels 3agasification 3ahydrolysis 3ainventories 3alife cycle inventory1 aCruze, Nathan B.1 aGoel, Prem K.1 aBakshi, Bhavik R.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 July 07, v. 49, no. 13 p.7996-8003dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5b011923Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/NASS  aDNAL 7aarticle03447naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245008000205300001600285520171500301592002802016650001602044650001402060650001902074650001902093650002102112650001502133650001802148650000902166650001302175650001302188650001102201650002002212653002502232653001802257653002302275653002102298653002202319653000802341653001302349653001302362653000902375653000902384653000902393700001902402700006002421700006602481700002602547700006102573700002902634773012602663856008302789852000902872655001202881IND60693957020221119104636.0201023e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069395702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamkar, Milad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6822-737010aPolymeric-nanofluids stabilized emulsions: Interfacial versus bulk rheology  ap. 252-263.  aThe properties of oil-in-water emulsions are influenced by the rheology of the aqueous phase (continuous phase) and the rheology of the oil-water interfaces. The bulk and interfacial rheological parameters can be tuned by incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) featuring different surface chemistries and polymers with different chemical or physical structures. Therefore, NPs and polymers can be used to formulate emulsions with different properties.The viscoelasticity at the oil-(aqueous phase) interface and the bulk viscoelasticity of aqueous phase were investigated in the presence of different fumed silica NPs (i.e., hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and slightly hydrophobic) and polymers with two different molecular weights. Bulk and interfacial viscoelastic properties were investigated, employing oscillatory rheological techniques. Furthermore, morphology and stability of the oil-in-(aqueous nanofluid) emulsions were explored utilizing bulk emulsification and single drop coalescence experiments.Introducing polymers into the aqueous nanofluids had opposite effects on bulk and interfacial viscoelasticity. Despite the significant increase in bulk viscoelasticity upon addition of polymers into the aqueous nanofluids, the interfacial viscoelasticity and emulsion stability considerably decreased. The slightly hydrophobic NP nanofluids without polymers showed no bulk viscoelasticity, but displayed the highest interfacial viscoelasticity and emulsion stability. This provided us a unique opportunity to unravel the importance of bulk and interfacial viscoelasticity on oil-in-water emulsification and proved the dominant role of interfacial viscoelasticity over bulk viscoelasticity on emulsion stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apolymers 3arheology 3asilica 3aviscoelasticity 0aInterfacial Rheology 0aBulk Rheology 0aEmulsion Stability 0aPolymer Solution 0aSilica Nanofluids 0aNPs 0aHPAM3330 0aHPAM3630 0aA202 0aA816 0aA3001 aBazazi, Parisa1 aKannan, Aadithya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5351-35931 aSuja, Vineeth Chandran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3406-76551 aHejazi, Seyed Hossein1 aFuller, Gerald G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2924-053X1 aSundararaj, Uttandaraman0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 576 p.252-263dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2020.04.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245017000167300001600337520091300353592002801266650001801294650001301312650001501325650001501340650001101355650000701366650001501373650001301388650002301401650001601424650002001440653002101460653003101481653005301512653002601565700001801591700001401609700001801623773010601641856008801747852000901835655001201844IND60626423220221117192652.0190318e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062642322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiuyu10aEffects and improvements of different reagents preservation methods on the determination of phosphate in seawater by phosphomolybdenum blue spectrophotometric method  ap. 136-140.  aThis work attempted to prolong the validity of the molybdate mixed solution and ascorbic acid solution used in the phosphomolybdenum blue spectrophotometric method by improving their preservation according to the influence factors. The results showed that the molybdate mixed solution can be directly preserved in darkness with validity over half a year. The ascorbic acid solution is influenced by light, temperature, pH, metal ions, oxygen, and bacteria. The validity of ascorbic acid is shortened as the temperature rises. Through keeping in darkness, adding complexing agents, adjusting pH, removing oxygen and sterilization, the validity of ascorbic acid solution was prolonged to over 2.7 times under 4 °C and over 5 times under 25 °C. At the same time, the hybrid solution of ascorbic acid solution and molybdate mixed solution should be preserved separately, otherwise the using effect is poor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abacteria 3ametal ions 3amolybdates 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphosphates 3aseawater 3aspectrophotometers 3atemperature 3awater pollution 0aMarine phosphate 0aMarine phosphate detection 0aPhosphomolybdenum blue spectrophotometric method 0aReagents preservation1 aZhao, Weihong1 aMiao, Hui1 aHan, Xiaotian0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Feb., v. 139 p.136-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012900164300001600293520134500309592002801654650003001682650001801712650001201730650001301742650001301755650001701768650002801785650002301813650002101836650001101857650000901868650001301877650001501890650001401905700002001919700002001939700002501959700002801984773009102012856008102103852000902184655001202193IND60519520620221123032922.0160503e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051952062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-016-1017-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakobyan, L.10aAdhesive Properties and Acid-Forming Activity of Lactobacilli and Streptococci Under Inhibitory Substances, Such as Nitrates  ap. 776-782.  aOne of the main requirements for probiotics is their ability to survive during passage through gastrointestinal tract and to maintain their activity at different adverse conditions. The aim of the study was to look for the strains of lactobacilli and streptococci with high adhesive properties even affected by inhibitory substances, such as nitrates (NO₃ ⁻). To study the adhesion properties hemagglutination reaction of bacterial cells with red blood cells of different animals and humans was used. The acid formation ability of bacteria was determined by the method of titration after 7 days of incubation in the sterile milk. These properties were investigated at different concentrations of NO₃ ⁻. The high concentration (mostly ≥2.0 %) NO₃ ⁻ inhibited the growth of both lactobacilli and streptococci, but compared with streptococcal cultures lactobacilli, especially Lactobacillus acidophilus Ep 317/402, have shown more stability and higher adhesive properties. In addition, the concentrations of NO₃ ⁻ of 0.5–2.0 % decreased the acid-forming activity of the strains, but even under these conditions they coagulated milk and, in comparison to control, formed low acidity in milk. Thus, the L. acidophilus Ep 317/402 with high adhesive properties has demonstrated a higher activity of NO₃ ⁻ transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aStreptococcus 3aacidity 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3aerythrocytes 3agastrointestinal system 3agrowth retardation 3ahemagglutination 3ahumans 3amilk 3anitrates 3aprobiotics 3atitration1 aHarutyunyan, K.1 aHarutyunyan, N.1 aMelik-Andreasyan, G.1 aTʻṛchʻunyan, A.

Such capabilities open the door to fabricating lipid membrane-coated nanoplasmonic sensors with varying degrees of membrane curvature in order to understand how biomacromolecular interaction processes are influenced by membrane curvature. Herein, we employed an indirect nanoplasmonic sensing approach to characterize the fabrication of supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) on silica-coated nanowell and nanodisk sensing platforms and to investigate how membrane curvature influences membrane–peptide interactions by evaluating the corresponding measurement responses from different spectral signatures that are sensitive to specific regions of the sensor geometries. SLBs were prepared by the vesicle fusion method, as monitored in real-time by nanoplasmonic sensing measurements and further characterized by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. By resolving different spectral signatures in the nanoplasmonic sensing measurements, it was determined that peptide binding induces membrane disruption at positively curved membrane regions, while peptide binding without subsequent disruption was observed at planar and negatively curved regions. These findings are consistent with the peptide’s known preference to selectively form pores in positively curved membranes, providing validation to the nanoplasmonic sensing approach and highlighting how the integration of nanoplasmonic sensors with different nanoscale architectures can be utilized to study the influence of membrane curvature on biomacromolecular interaction processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3alipid bilayers 3alipids1 aJackman, Joshua A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1800-81021 aMalekian, Bita1 aXiong, Kunli1 aEmilsson, Gustav1 aPark, Soohyun1 aDahlin, Andreas B.1 aCho, Nam-Joon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8692-89550 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 May 28, v. 90, no. 12 p.7458-7466dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b009743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014000164300001600304500001500320520117600335592002801511650001501539650002201554650001401576650000801590650001101598650001501609650001701624650002901641650001801670651001201688651001501700653001601715700001401731700001201745773010601757856008101863852000901944655001201953IND50089002020221119060209.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008900202DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-013-0274-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWysujack, K.14aThe infection of the European eel with the parasitic nematode Anguillicoloides crassus in inland and coastal waters of northern Germany  ap. 121-130.  a2019-12-05  aRecruitment of the European eel is in decline since three decades. So far, the reasons of the decline have not been fully understood. Beside other factors, infection with the exotic swimbladder parasite Anguillicoloides crassus has been discussed as a threat to the species. In the present study monitoring results for A. crassus in eels from North German waters are presented. Between 1996 and 2011, the swimbladders of 17,219 eels from eight freshwater and coastal water areas were analyzed. Prevalence, abundance of parasites, infection intensity and severity of the damage to the swimbladder were recorded by visual inspection. In the freshwaters the prevalence was in the range of 65–83 %, whereas significantly lower values were found in the brackish waters. The differences were less clear for infection intensity but significantly lower values were found in the outermost location in the Baltic Sea. Mean damage to the swimbladders was highest in eels from the Rivers Weser and Elbe and lowest in the Baltic coastal waters. Prevalence and damage degree were stable in all waters except for two rivers, where a decreasing trend in infection intensity was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreshwater 3aAnguilla anguilla 3aparasites 3aeel 3arivers 3amonitoring 3aswim bladder 3aAnguillicoloides crassus 3acoastal water 3aGermany 3aBaltic Sea 0arecruitment1 aDorow, M.1 aUbl, C.0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2014 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.121-130dSpringer-Verlagx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-013-0274-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014000166300001400306520056100320592002800881650001200909650001300921650001100934650001500945650001400960653003400974653000901008653002601017700003001043773010101073856008101174852000901255655001201264IND60604071620221117062923.0180716e20150210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060407162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2014.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolland, Diane13aAn assessment of the Thermodynamic Difference Rule for mixed inorganic oxides and comments on the enthalpies of formation of phosphates  ap. 63-67.  aThe applicability of the Thermodynamic Difference Rule to mixed inorganic oxides is assessed for a range of aluminates, borates, ferrites, phosphates, silicates and vanadates.

These data have important implications for developing best management practices for handling and waste disposal, or identifying the fluid in the event of accidental spill events. Here, we evaluated the elemental and isotope chemistry of UPP produced waters from 26 wells throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia to determine any unique fluid chemistries that could be used for forensic studies. Compared to the Marcellus, UPP produced waters contain higher activities of total radium (²²⁶Ra + ²²⁸Ra) and higher ²²⁸Ra/²²⁶Ra ratios. As with the Marcellus Shale, elemental ratios (Sr/Ca) and isotope ratios (⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr) can distinguish UPP produced waters from many conventional oil and gas formations. Sr/Ca and ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios can fingerprint small fractions (∼0.1%) of UPP produced water in freshwater. However, because Marcellus and UPP produced waters display similar major elemental chemistry (i.e., Na, Ca, and Cl) and overlapping ratios of Sr/Ca and ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr, ²²⁸Ra/²²⁶Ra ratios may be the best tracer to distinguish these waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abest management practices 3acalcium 3achemistry 3aforensic sciences 3afreshwater 3aisotope labeling 3aoils 3aradionuclides 3aradium 3ashale 3asodium 3astable isotopes 3astrontium 3awaste disposal 3awells 3aOhio 3aPennsylvania 3aWest Virginia1 aWarner, N.

It was reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 can grow on D-serine as the sole nitrogen source, and growth was severely reduced in the dadA mutant devoid of the D-alanine dehydrogenase with broad substrate specificity. In this study, the dsdA gene (PA3357) encoding a putative D-serine dehydratase was subjected to further characterization. Growth on D-serine as the sole source of nitrogen was retained in the ∆dsdA mutant and was abolished completely in the ∆dadA and ∆dadA-∆dsdA mutants. However, when complemented by dsdA on a plasmid, the double mutant was able to grow on D-serine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, supporting the proposed biochemical function of DsdA in the conversion of D-serine into pyruvate and ammonia. Among D- and L-amino acids tested, only D-serine and D-threonine could serve as the substrates of DsdA, and the Km of DsdA with D-serine was calculated to be 330 μM. Comparative genomics revealed that this cryptic dsdA gene was highly conserved in strains of P. aeruginosa, and that most strains of Pseudomonas putida possess putative dsdCAX genes encoding a transcriptional regulator DsdC and a D-serine transporter DsdX as in enteric bacteria. In conclusion, this study supports the presence of a cryptic dsdA gene encoding a functional D-serine dehydratase in P. aeruginosa, and the absence of dsdA expression in response to exogenous D-serine might be due to the loss of regulatory elements for gene activation during evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas putida 3aammonia 3acarbon 3aevolution 3agene activation 3agenes 3agenomics 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amutants 3aneurotransmitters 3anitrogen 3aplasmids 3apyruvic acid 3aregulatory sequences 3aserine 3aserine dehydratase 3asubstrate specificity 3atranscription factors 3avirulence1 aLu, Chung-Dar0 tCurrent microbiology.g2016 June, v. 72, no. 6 p.788-794dSpringer USx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-016-1021-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017000172300001400342520079800356592002801154650002301182650001201205650001001217650002301227650001401250650002101264650001301285650002001298650000901318650002001327650002001347650002701367650001101394650001001405650001601415651001501431653002201446653003101468653002801499653003501527700002001562700002301582773011901605856008401724852000901808655001201817IND60123552620221118133951.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012355262DNAL7 a10.1080/10496475.2013.8194772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLombard, Kevin A.10aRisk Management Education in Southwest Medicinal Herb Production and Marketing in New Mexico: Assessing Grower and Potential Grower Outcomes after a Two-Day Workshop  ap. 31-44.  aA risk management educational program to help small-scale farmers of native medicinal herbs of the U.S. Southwest (SWH) was conducted.

The feedstock molecule selection was based on typical arrangements of structural attributes in crude oil. Based on the fundamental hydroprocessing chemistry, a reaction network was developed for the feedstock molecules including 5747 reactions distributed among 12 core types of reactions. The final molecular model contained 1532 unique species up to 45 carbons encompassing molecules up to five aromatic rings with heteroatoms. To determine the initial condition of the feedstock, a statistical approach was applied by using probability density functions (PDFs) characterizing the molecules in terms of their structural attributes. Experimental feed measurements were used to determine the values of the PDF parameters. A library containing 21 sets of PDF parameters representing the range of the feed measurements was established and used to determine the starting point for optimization. Simulated feed properties showed excellent agreement with experimental values. For the kinetic model, the reactor system was divided into a series of 19 pseudo plug flow reactors (PFRs), one for each catalyst layer, interspersed with the appropriate quench streams. Each pseudo-PFR was modeled using a side-by-side reaction and vapor–liquid equilibrium approach. The activity of each type of catalyst and the deactivation due to coking and metal deposition were included in the simulation. Quantitative structure/reactivity correlations were used to greatly reduce the number of parameters in the model. The parameters were optimized using a simulated annealing algorithm so that the model results corresponded to the measured reactor effluent. The optimized model showed good agreement with the experimental measurements. To simplify the day-to-day running of the kinetic model while still allowing developers to change and study the model in more advanced applications, a user-friendly application was developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaromatic compounds 3acatalysts 3achemistry 3afeedstocks 3akinetics 3amolecular models 3apetroleum 3aprobability distribution1 aSahasrabudhe, Mayuresh1 aKhandalkar, Sumit1 aSaravanan, Chandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2219-55881 aKlein, Michael T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5444-15120 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Sept. 09, v. 33, no. 10 p.10143-10158dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b022283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010000171300001400271520205200285592002802337650002602365650001802391650001202409650001302421650002202434650001302456650001502469650003702484650001602521650002002537700002102557700002602578700002302604773010202627856008202729990002302811852000902834655001202843IND60097682420221119221630.0141104e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2011.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWegner, K. Mathias10aDiversity of immune genes and associated gill microbes of European plaice Pleuronectes platessa  ap. 87-96.  aGenetic variability of marine fish species is much higher than in most other vertebrates. Nevertheless, some species with large population sizes including flatfish such as European plaice Pleuronectes platessa show signs of population collapse and inbreeding. Taking plaice as a flagship example for fisheries-induced genetic changes also affecting the Wadden Sea, we determined the amount of genetic variability at antigen-presenting genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and its potential interaction with the microbiota associated to gill tissue using a next-generation parallel tag sequencing approach. Genetic variation at MHC class IIB genes was extremely large, with 97 alleles found in 40 fish from different age cohorts. Although a strong signal of positive selection was present (dN/dS = 4.01) and we found significantly higher allelic diversity in 0+ fish than in older age classes, the amount of genetic variation maintained within the population may not have exceeded neutral expectations derived from mitochondrial markers. Associated microbes revealed significant spatiotemporal structure with 0+ fish displaying the highest microbial diversity as well as the highest diversity of potentially pathogenic genera. Overall the correlation between MHC genotypes and bacterial abundance was weak, and only few alleles significantly correlated with certain bacterial genera. These associations all conferred susceptibility (i.e. presence of an allele correlated to higher number of bacteria), either suggesting age-dependent selection on common alleles or weak selection on resistance against these bacterial genera. Taken together, our data suggest that selection coefficients of balancing selection maintaining immunogenetic diversity may be relatively small in large marine populations. However, if population sizes are further reduced by overharvesting, the response to increasing balancing selection coefficients will be largely unpredictable and may also negatively influence the adaptive potential of populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleuronectes platessa 3aage structure 3aalleles 3abacteria 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainbreeding 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amarine fish 3apopulation size1 aShama, Lisa N.S.1 aKellnreitner, Florian1 aPockberger, Moritz0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Aug. 1, v. 108 p.87-96dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2011.09.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03924naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100007000144245012000214300002000334520193300354592002802287650002202315650002102337650002702358650002702385650002902412650003602441650002402477650001702501650003902518650001702557650001302574650002402587650002302611650001102634650001802645650000702663650001802670650001402688650001902702653001802721653002602739653002602765653001302791653001302804700005802817700002502875700006502900700006402965700003203029700002303061700002103084773014203105856007803247852000903325655001203334IND60639210620190806000000.0190501e20190405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063921062DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b035272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalekkhaiat Häffner, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4111-807510aInteraction of Laponite with Membrane Components—Consequences for Bacterial Aggregation and Infection Confinement  ap. 15389-15400.  aThe antimicrobial effects of Laponite nanoparticles with or without loading of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was investigated along with their membrane interactions. The study combines data from ellipsometry, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, particle size/ζ potential measurements, and confocal microscopy. As a result of the net negative charge of Laponite, loading of net positively charged LL-37 increases with increasing pH. The peptide was found to bind primarily to the outer surface of the Laponite nanoparticles in a predominantly helical conformation, leading to charge reversal. Despite their net positive charge, peptide-loaded Laponite nanoparticles did not kill Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria or disrupt anionic model liposomes. They did however cause bacteria flocculation, originating from the interaction of Laponite and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Free LL-37, in contrast, is potently antimicrobial through membrane disruption but does not induce bacterial aggregation in the concentration range investigated. Through LL-37 loading of Laponite nanoparticles, the combined effects of bacterial flocculation and membrane lysis are observed. However, bacteria aggregation seems to be limited to Gram-negative bacteria as Laponite did not cause flocculation of Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis bacteria nor did it bind to lipoteichoic acid from bacterial envelopes. Taken together, the present investigation reports several novel phenomena by demonstrating that nanoparticle charge does not invariably control membrane destabilization and by identifying the ability of anionic Laponite nanoparticles to effectively flocculate Gram-negative bacteria through LPS binding. As demonstrated in cell experiments, such aggregation results in diminished LPS-induced cell activation, thus outlining a promising approach for confinement of infection and inflammation caused by such pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aconfocal microscopy 3aflocculation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ainflammation 3alaponite 3alipopolysaccharides 3alipoteichoic acids 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3apathogens 3azeta potential 0aantimicrobial 0abacteria flocculation 0ainfection confinement 0aLaponite 0amembrane1 aNyström, Lina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5236-91071 aBrowning, Kathryn L.1 aMörck Nielsen, Hanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7285-91001 aStrömstedt, Adam A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9070-69441 avan der Plas, Mariena J.

The compatibility of nucleus and mitochondria is essential for interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) and xenomitochondrial cybrid. In order to test the compatibility of nucleus and mitochondria among human, mouse, and pig cells, we compared the performances of cybrids that fused inter- and intra-species. The ρ0 cells from human and pig cell lines were created as nucleus donors which were transfected with GFP-neo for cell selective system in advance, and mitochondria donor cells were labeled by Mitochondria-RFP. Human and mouse platelets were also used as a mitochondrial donor. Results indicated that all interspecies cybrids declined to die in 2–4 d after the cell fusion in the selection medium, while intraspecies cybrid cells survived and formed stable clones. As a conclusion, the incompatibility between nucleus and mitochondria is the critical factor for the formation of interspecies cybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell fusion 3aclones 3acybrids 3aenergy metabolism 3ahumans 3amice 3amitochondria 3asomatic cells 3aswine 3atransportation 0aCybrids 0aIncompatibility of nucleus and mitochondria 0aInter-species 0aIntra-species1 aTian, Jianhui1 aYin, Jingdong1 aLi, Qiuyan1 aZhao, Xingbo0 tAnimal biotechnology.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 25, no. 2 p.139-149dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2013.8417093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245013300208300001800341520172000359592002802079650001502107650000902122650001802131650002002149650001402169650001002183650001502193650001302208650001502221650001002236650002502246650001702271650002502288700001702313700006502330700001402395700002102409700001302430700001502443773012102458856008702579852000902666655001202675IND60673196720221121030141.0191018e20190917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067319672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b022322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Yujie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3931-207110aImpact of Composition on Pore Structure Properties in Shale: Implications for Micro-/Mesopore Volume and Surface Area Prediction  ap. 9619-9628.  aPore structure properties such as pore volume, surface area, and pore size distribution (PSD) are the key petrophysical parameters in shales that control storage capacity, hydraulic conductivity, and the gas adsorption in potential. The nature of pore volume, surface area, and PSD are largely dependent on shale composition, which is highly heterogeneous in different formations. However, the quantitative effects of the clay content and total organic carbon (TOC) content on micropore and mesopore structural properties have not been fully explored yet. Here, we quantified the impact of clay and TOC contents on micro-/mesopore volume, surface area, and PSD using three shale formations with large compositional variations. The results indicate that clay and TOC contents synchronically influence the shale micro-/mesopore structure properties, but they function in different pore size ranges. The micropores are predominantly contributed by organic matter pores. For the first time, we discover that the mesopores ranging between 2 and 17 nm are primarily controlled by clay mineral pores, and the pores larger than 17 nm contain both clay and organic matter pores. We further develop four new equations to predict micropore volume, mesopore volume, micropore surface area, and mesopore surface area as a function of clay and TOC contents on the basis of the data collected from the three different shale types. The statistical analysis shows that our developed correlations are capable of predicting the pore structure properties in our investigated formations with acceptable accuracy. The newly established equations provide insightful implications for the precise formation evaluation in downhole practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3adata collection 3aequations 3afuels 3amicropores 3aporosity 3aprediction 3ashale 3astatistical analysis 3asurface area 3atotal organic carbon1 aRezaee, Reza1 aAl-Khdheeawi, Emad A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1608-98691 aHu, Si-Yu1 aVerrall, Michael1 aZou, Jie1 aLiu, Kouqi0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Sept. 17, v. 33, no. 10 p.9619-9628dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b022323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245014300161300002000304500001900324520067800343592002801021650001801049650001201067650001501079650001001094650001901104650001101123653002101134653002801155653002901183700001301212700005701225700005601282773015001338856008001488852000901568655001201577IND60718041920221121144032.0201118e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071804192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c006442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Dawei10aDearomatization–Rearomatization Strategy for Synthesizing Carbazoles with 2,2′-Biphenols and Ammonia by Dual C(Ar)–OH Bond Cleavages  ap. 13200-13205.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbazole is an essential building block in various pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, and materials. For future sustainability, it is highly desirable to synthesize carbazole derivatives directly from renewable resources or cheap raw materials.

Therefore it is vulnerable for adulteration by means of the addition of cheaper vegetable oils. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been suggested as a fast technique for the detection of adulteration. However, measurements still take several hours. Fast DSC measurements take several minutes. Therefore this study investigates the applicability of fast DSC for the detection of sunflower oil (SFO) in EVOO. Nine EVOOs, five SFOs and three mixtures were analysed. Cooling curves of EVOO and SFO show one major exothermic peak. Because the cooling curves of EVOO and SFO are very similar they cannot be used for the detection of adulteration. Heating curves of EVOOs show two major endothermic peaks after slow cooling (−2°C/s), heating curves of SFOs only one. Addition of SFO to EVOO caused a rapid decrease in the coldest endothermic peak and can therefore be used in the detection of adulteration of EVOO by SFO. Depending on the type of olive oil, the presence of 2–10% SFO can already be detected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3acooling 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aendothermy 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3aheat production 3aprices 3asunflower oil 3avegetable oil 0aDSC 0aEVOO 0aSD 0aSFO 0aTAG 0aExtra virgin olive oil 0aSunflower oil 0aFast DSC 0aAdulteration1 avan Herwaarden, A.W.1 aSplinter, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8797-14101 aBoerrigter-Eenling, R.1 avan Ruth, S.M.0 tThermochimica acta.g2015 Mar. 10, v. 603 p.237-243dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2014.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013300173300001600306520076900322592002801091650000801119650001501127650001201142650001701154650002501171653002101196653001901217653003301236653002501269653002501294653003401319700002001353700001901373700002401392773013001416856008501546852000901631655001201640IND60559005320221120095259.0170111e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900532DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2016.11592702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumdar, Abhijit10aMulti-objective optimization of air permeability and thermal conductivity of knitted fabrics with desired ultraviolet protection  ap. 110-116.  aA simultaneous optimal solution of two objectives, namely air permeability and thermal conductivity has been derived for both single jersey and 1 × 1 rib knitted fabrics with desired ultraviolet (UV) protection. As these two objectives are conflicting with each other, a set of optimal solutions are possible which are non-dominating in nature. These set of optimal solutions are known as Pareto optimal solutions.

We wanted to determine whether root exudates could affect in vitro surface attachment in a confocal microscopy assay. Root exudate from pea, other legumes, wheat, and Arabidopsis induced R. leguminosarum bv. viciae to attach end-on (in a polar manner) to glass in hexagonal close-packed arrays, rather than attaching along their long axis. This did not involve a reorientation but was probably due to altered growth. The polar attachment involves a novel bacterial component because it occurred in mutants lacking a symbiosis plasmid (and hence nodulation genes) and polar glucomannan. The major surface (acidic) exopolysaccharide was required, and mutations affecting exported proteins and flagella delayed but did not block polar attachment. The polar attachment activity was purified as a high molecular weight fraction from pea root exudate and is an arabinogalactan protein (AGP) based on its carbohydrate content, reactivity with AGP-specific monoclonal antibodies and Yariv reagent, and sensitivity to enzymes that degrade proteins and carbohydrates. We propose that this novel mode of AGP-induced attachment may be important for growth of these bacteria on the roots of both legumes and non-legumes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aarabinogalactan proteins 3abacteria 3acarbohydrate content 3aconfocal microscopy 3aenzymes 3aexopolysaccharides 3aflagellum 3agenes 3aglucomannans 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutants 3amutation 3anodulation 3apeas 3aplasmids 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3asymbiosis 3awheat1 aWilliams, Alan1 aEdwards, Anne1 aDownie, J.

During winter, voles feed on bark, vascular tissues, and sometimes roots of trees. Rodenticides continue to be the major method used to reduce vole populations in orchards, but an alternative approach could be a living mulch along tree rows that would provide weed management, have a low growth habit, and be repellent to voles. We examined four living mulches installed in young apple orchards: hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum (L.) Scop.), and creeping thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.). Forage grasses were used as a “control” in two experiments. Efficacy of these mulches was evaluated by their growth and effects on (1) abundance of total orchard herbaceous plants, (2) abundance of montane voles (Microtus montanus Peale), and (3) feeding damage to apple trees in field trials at Summerland, British Columbia, Canada in 2007–2010. A sixth treatment, glyphosate herbicide, was added in Experiment 2. Hairy vetch and birdsfoot trefoil did not suppress herbaceous vegetation along tree rows, but birdsfoot trefoil had fewer voles than either hairy vetch or forage grasses. Sweet woodruff and creeping thyme both reduced abundance of orchard herbs compared with the control forage grasses and this effect was maintained for two of three growing seasons. Forage grasses and sweet woodruff had increasing proportions of mulch dominating the growing sites, whereas creeping thyme did not. Both sweet woodruff and creeping thyme seemed to repel voles with reduced damage to trees in two winters, but not summer 2010, compared with the forage grasses sites. Vole numbers were, on average, 1.4 to 4.9 times higher in the forage grasses than the other two sites. However, the relatively high degree of feeding damage (>45% mortality) to young apple trees (except for 16% mortality for creeping thyme in one winter) in all three seasons was a major limitation. These tree mortality levels are unacceptable economically and suggest strongly that living mulches may not be a practical solution for weed management in organic or conventional orchards. Orchard-scale experiments that emulate real-world farming practices might yield living mulch habitats that are not as desirable for voles as those examined in our study. Herbicide sites had the lowest abundance of herbaceous vegetation, voles, and provided complete protection of apple trees compared to than any of the other treatment sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalium odoratum 3aLotus corniculatus 3aMicrotus montanus 3aThymus serpyllum 3aVicia villosa 3aapples 3abark 3afarming systems 3afield experimentation 3aforage grasses 3afruit crops 3aglyphosate 3agrowing season 3agrowth habit 3ahabitats 3aherbaceous plants 3alive mulches 3amortality 3aorchards 3apests 3arodenticides 3aroots 3asummer 3athyme 3atree mortality 3atrees 3avascular tissues 3avegetation 3avoles 3aweed control 3awinter 3aBritish Columbia 3aEurope 0aFeeding damage 0aGalium odoratum 0aLiving mulches 0aMicrotus montanus 0aSweet woodruff 0aTree fruit orchards 0aVoles1 aSullivan, Druscilla S.1 aGranatstein, David M.0 tCrop protection.g2018 June, v. 108 p.78-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2018.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013000160300001800290520140300308592002801711650001301739650001801752650002401770650001701794650001401811650002001825650002201845650001401867650001501881650002101896650001501917700001501932700001701947700001301964773012101977856007402098852000902172655001202181IND60631259220221121064310.0190220e20190206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063125922DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra09615e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hongliang10aSimultaneous immobilization of NH₄⁺ and Mn²⁺ from electrolytic manganese residue using phosphate and magnesium sources  ap. 4583-4590.  aImmobilization of contaminants from electrolytic manganese residue (EMR) is essential for the safe stacking and reuse of EMR. This study provides experiment results for the simultaneous immobilization of NH₄⁺ and Mn²⁺ from EMR using Na₃PO₄·12H₂O and MgSO₄·7H₂O (PS) agents, as well as Na₃PO₄·12H₂O and MgO (PO) agents. The optimum reaction conditions, characteristics of immobilization, mechanism and the economy of alternative chemicals were determined and are discussed. The results indicated that the immobilization efficiencies of NH₄⁺ and Mn²⁺ were 92.4% and 99.9% respectively under the following conditions: a MgSO₄·7H₂O : Na₃PO₄·12H₂O : EMR mass ratio of 0.113 : 0.175 : 1, a CaO : EMR mass ratio of 0.03 : 1 and a reaction time of 1 h using PS agents. The concentration of NH₄⁺ in the leach liquor reduced from 1264 to 98 mg L⁻¹ after immobilization. The concentration of heavy metal ions decreased sharply in the leach liquor and met the Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard of China (GB8978-1996). The characteristics of immobilization indicated that NH₄⁺ was immobilized to form NH₄MgPO₄·6H₂O and that Mn²⁺ was immobilized to form Mn₅(PO₄)₂(OH)₄, Mn₃(PO₄)₂·3H₂O and Mn(OH)₂. An economic evaluation showed that using PS agents had lower associated cost than using PO agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acalcium oxide 3aeconomic evaluation 3aheavy metals 3amagnesium 3amagnesium oxide 3amagnesium sulfate 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3asodium phosphate 3awastewater1 aLong, Qian1 aZhang, Yutao1 aQin, Lan0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 06, v. 9, no. 8 p.4583-4590dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra09615e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245009700179300001400276520123800290592002801528650001101556650001601567650001501583650002201598650001001620650001101630650001501641650001401656650001501670650002001685650000901705650001201714650001001726650001201736700002301748700001901771700001701790700003301807700002301840773010001863856008801963852000902051655001202060IND50089006220221119103806.0150206e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008900622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2012.00888.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmsens, Willem‐Jan10aEffects of Food Availability on Space and Refuge Use by a Neotropical Scatterhoarding Rodent  ap. 88-93.  aAnimals that rely on refuges for safety can theoretically increase their foraging area without simultaneously increasing predation risk and travel costs by using more refuges. The key prediction of this theory, a negative correlation between food abundance, home range size and the number of refuges used, has never been empirically tested. We determined how home range size and refuge use by the Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) varied across a gradient of abundance of the agoutis' principal food source: seeds and fruits of the palm Astrocaryum standleyanum. We used both manual and automated radio telemetry to measure space use of 11 agoutis during 2 mo of the Astrocaryum fruiting season, and of another set of 10 agoutis during 6 mo in which the animals largely relied on cached Astrocaryum seeds. We found that agoutis living in areas of lower food density had larger home ranges, and that all individuals used multiple refuges. The number of refuges, however, was not correlated with home range size. Consequently, agoutis that had larger home ranges roamed farther from their refuges. These results suggest that agoutis increase their home range size in response to food scarcity at the cost of their safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgouti 3aAstrocaryum 3aDasyprocta 3afood availability 3afoods 3afruits 3ahome range 3apredation 3aprediction 3aradio telemetry 3arisk 3arodents 3aseeds 3atropics1 aSuselbeek, Lennart1 aHirsch, Ben T.1 aKays, Roland1 aWinkelhagen, Annemarie J.

HCPro is the RSS of Potyvirus spp., and its activity is enhanced by the upstream P1 protein. Distinctively, the ipomovirus Cucumber vein yellowing virus (CVYV) lacks HCPro but contains two P1 copies in tandem (P1aP1b), the second of which functions as RSS. Using chimeras based on the potyvirus Plum pox virus (PPV), we found that P1b can functionally replace HCPro in potyviral infections of Nicotiana plants. Interestingly, P1a, the CVYV protein homologous to potyviral P1, disrupted the silencing suppression activity of P1b and reduced the infection efficiency of PPV in Nicotiana benthamiana. Testing the influence of RSS in host specificity, we found that a P1b-expressing chimera poorly infected PPV's natural host, Prunus persica. Conversely, P1b conferred on PPV chimeras the ability to replicate locally in cucumber, CVYV's natural host. The deleterious effect of P1a on PPV infection is host dependent, because the P1aP1b-expressing PPV chimera accumulated in cucumber to higher levels than PPV expressing P1b alone. These results demonstrate that a potyvirus can use different RSS, and that particular RSS and upstream P1-like proteins contribute to defining the virus host range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumber vein yellowing virus 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPlum pox virus 3aPrunus persica 3aRNA interference 3achimerism 3acucumbers 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3ainfection 3aplant viruses 3aproteins 3aviruses1 aDujovny, Gabriela1 aGarcía, Juan Antonio,1 aValli, Adrian0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2012 Feb., v. 25, no. 2 p.151-164dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FMPMI-08-11-02163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009900164300001800263500001900281520134800300592002801648650001601676650001601692650000901708650001301717650002401730650001101754650000701765650001501772650001501787650001601802700006301818773013601881856008102017852000902098655001202107IND60731240120210819000000.0210410e20210303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073124012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c103392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrudar, Sandi10aEffect of Buffer on Protein Stability in Aqueous Solutions: A Simple Protein Aggregation Model  ap. 2504-2512.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLiquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins has recently been associated with the onset of numerous diseases. Despite several studies in this area of protein aggregation, buffer-specific effects always seem to be overlooked. In this study we investigated the influence of buffers on the phase stability of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) and its respective protein–protein interactions by measuring the cloud point temperature, second virial coefficient, and interaction diffusion coefficient of several HEWL–buffer solutions (MOPS, phosphate, HEPES, cacodylate) at pH 7.0. The results indicate that the buffer molecules, depending on their hydration, adsorb on the protein surface, and modulate their electrostatic stability. The obtained information was used to extend the recently developed coarse-grained protein model to incorporate buffer-specific effects. Treated by Wertheim’s perturbation theory the model qualitatively correctly predicted the experimentally observed phase separation of all investigated HEWL–buffer solutions, and further allowed us to predict the phase stability of protein formulations even in experimentally unattainable conditions. Since the theory can be straightforwardly extended to include multiple components it presents a useful tool to study protein aggregation in crowded cell-like systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3aegg albumen 3ahens 3alysozyme 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3apH 3aphosphates 3aseparation 3atemperature1 aHribar-Lee, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9029-588X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 03, v. 125, no. 10 p.2504-2512dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c103393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245011300201300001600314506007600330520143000406592002801836506003701864650001501901650001201916650001801928650001301946650002501959650001501984650001101999650001902010700002602029700002102055700002102076700002502097700003002122773012502152856007402277852000902351655001202360IND60639938720221207121359.0190503e20160808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063993872DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ib00030d2doi7 aPMC49801512pmcid7 a273844622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarey, Shawn P.10aLocal extracellular matrix alignment directs cellular protrusion dynamics and migration through Rac1 and FAK  ap. 821-835.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCell migration within 3D interstitial microenvironments is sensitive to extracellular matrix (ECM) properties, but the mechanisms that regulate migration guidance by 3D matrix features remain unclear. To examine the mechanisms underlying the cell migration response to aligned ECM, which is prevalent at the tumor–stroma interface, we utilized time-lapse microscopy to compare the behavior of MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells within randomly organized and well-aligned 3D collagen ECM. We developed a novel experimental system in which cellular morphodynamics during initial 3D cell spreading served as a reductionist model for the complex process of matrix-directed 3D cell migration. Using this approach, we found that ECM alignment induced spatial anisotropy of cells' matrix probing by promoting protrusion frequency, persistence, and lengthening along the alignment axis and suppressing protrusion dynamics orthogonal to alignment. Preference for on-axis behaviors was dependent upon FAK and Rac1 signaling and translated across length and time scales such that cells within aligned ECM exhibited accelerated elongation, front-rear polarization, and migration relative to cells in random ECM. Together, these findings indicate that adhesive and protrusive signaling allow cells to respond to coordinated physical cues in the ECM, promoting migration efficiency and cell migration guidance by 3D matrix structure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanisotropy 3abreasts 3acell movement 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells1 aGoldblatt, Zachary E.1 aMartin, Karen E.1 aRomero, Bethsabe1 aWilliams, Rebecca M.1 aReinhart-King, Cynthia A.0 tIntegrative biology.g2016 Aug. 8, v. 8, no. 8 p.821-835dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26905x1757-97087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ib00030d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006300144245012900207300002000336520157400356592002801930650002101958650002901979650002602008650001302034650002502047650001902072650001102091650001402102650002602116650001302142650001902155650001502174650000902189650001602198650001602214650004802230650001602278650001902294650002802313650001102341650000702352650002802359650001402387650001602401653003102417653001802448653002402466653002802490700001802518700003002536700001802566773014202584856007802726852000902804655001202813IND60707056320221119171458.0200812e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070705632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c057322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJannesari, Marziyeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7998-296110aGraphene/CuO₂ Nanoshuttles with Controllable Release of Oxygen Nanobubbles Promoting Interruption of Bacterial Respiration  ap. 35813-35825.  aAn oxygen nanoshuttle based on a reduced graphene oxide/copper peroxide (rGO/CuO₂) nanocomposite has been presented to deliver in situ oxygen nanobubbles (O₂ NBs) for combating bacterial infections. In the presence of rGO, the solid source of oxygen (i.e., CuO₂) was decomposed (in response to environmental conditions such as pH and temperature) into O₂ NBs in a more controllable and long-lasting trend (from 60 to 144 h). In a neutral buffer, the O₂ NBs experienced growth and collapse evolutions, creating a dynamic micro–nanoenvironment around the nanocomposite. In addition to effective battling against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, the O₂ NBs demonstrated superior antibacterial properties on Gram-positive S. aureus to those on Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria, especially in the presence of rGO. In fact, the rGO contents could provide synergistic effects through harvesting some respiratory electrons (leading to striking interruption of the bacterial respiratory pathway) in one side and transferring them into the O₂ NBs, resulting in nanoscale reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in another side. Moreover, near-infrared laser irradiation induced more damage to the cell membrane due to the synergistic effects of local heat elevation and catalyzing the release/collapse of NBs imposing mechanical disruptions. Our results show that the O₂-containing nanoshuttles can effectively be used as intelligent and controllable anti-infection nanorobots in upcoming graphene-based nanobiomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acell membranes 3acopper 3aelectrons 3aenvironmental factors 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aharvesting 3aheat 3airradiation 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3ananobubbles 3ananocomposites 3anear infrared radiation 3aoxygen 3apH 3areactive oxygen species 3asynergism 3atemperature 0ain situ oxygen nanobubbles 0aantibacterial 0aphotothermal effect 0adrug-resistant bacteria1 aAkhavan, Omid1 aMadaah Hosseini, Hamid R.1 aBakhshi, Bita0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 July 15, v. 12, no. 32 p.35813-35825dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c057323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245006200164300001800226500001900244520224400263592002802507650002202535650001502557650001602572650001502588650001302603650002302616650001602639650001502655650001602670700005902686773013602745856008002881852000902961655001202970IND60731240320221120102417.0210318e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073124032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c107402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDasetty, Siva10aAdvancing Rational Control of Peptide–Surface Complexes  ap. 2644-2657.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding peptide–surface interactions is crucial for programming self-assembly of peptides at surfaces and in realizing their applications, such as biosensors and biomimetic materials. In this study, we developed insights into the dependence of a residue’s interaction with a surface on its neighboring residue in a tripeptide using molecular dynamics simulations. This knowledge is integral for designing rational mutations to control peptide–surface complexes. Using graphene as our model surface, we estimated the free energy of adsorption (ΔAₐdₛ) and extracted predominant conformations of 26 tripeptides with the motif LNR–CR–Gly, where LNR and CR are variable left-neighboring and central residues, respectively. We considered a combination of strongly adsorbing (Phe, Trp, and Arg) and weakly adsorbing (Ala, Val, Leu, Ser, and Thr) amino acids on graphene identified in a prior study to form the tripeptides. Our results indicate that ΔAₐdₛ of a tripeptide cannot be estimated as the sum of ΔAₐdₛ of each residue indicating that the residues in a tripeptide do not behave as independent entities. We observed that the contributions from the strongly adsorbing amino acids were dominant, which suggests that such residues could be used for strengthening peptide–graphene interactions irrespective of their neighboring residues. In contrast, the adsorption of weakly adsorbing central residues is dependent on their neighboring residues. Our structural analysis revealed that the dihedral angles of LNR are more correlated with that of CR in the adsorbed state than in bulk state. Together with ΔAₐdₛ trends, this implies that different backbone structures of a given CR can be accessed for a similar ΔAₐdₛ by varying the LNR. Therefore, incorporation of context effects in designing mutations can lead to desired peptide structure at surfaces. Our results also emphasize that these cooperative effects in ΔAₐdₛ and structure are not easily predicted a priori. The collective results have applications in guiding rational mutagenesis techniques to control orientation of peptides at surfaces and in developing peptide structure prediction algorithms in adsorbed state from its sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3abiomimetics 3abiosensors 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3amutagenesis 3aprediction 3atripeptides1 aSarupria, Sapna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7692-83130 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 125, no. 10 p.2644-2657dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c107403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001600306520177900322592002802101650002102129650001602150650002002166650002302186650002602209650002302235650001802258650002402276650001402300650004302314650001802357650001202375650002002387651001202407653002002419653001302439653002302452653001402475653001102489700001802500700001902518700001302537700001602550700001702566700001502583700001802598700001802616700001502634700001702649773010402666856008402770852000902854655001202863IND60121783820221117200626.0150325e20141002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012178382DNAL7 a10.1080/10495398.2013.8656392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuang, Liangde10aExpression Profiles of Myostatin, Myogenin, and Myosin Heavy Chain in Skeletal Muscles of Two Rabbit Breeds Differing in Growth Rate  ap. 223-233.  aThe purpose of the present study was to compare mRNA levels of myostatin (MSTN), myogenin (MyoG), and fiber type compositions in terms of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in skeletal muscles of two rabbit breeds with different body sizes and growth rates. Longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles of 16 Californian rabbits (CW) and 16 Germany great line of ZIKA rabbits (GZ) were collected at the ages of 35d and 84d (slaughter age). The results showed that the live weights of GZ rabbits of 35d and 84d old were approximately 36% and 26% greater than those of CW rabbits, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that at the age of 84d GZ rabbits contained significantly lower MSTN mRNA level and higher MyoG mRNA level in both longissimus dorsi and biceps femoris muscles than CW rabbits, and mRNA levels of MSTN and MyoG exhibited opposite changes from the age of 35d to 84d, suggesting that GZ rabbits were subjected to less growth inhibition from MSTN at slaughter age, which occurred most possibly in skeletal muscles. Four types of fiber were identified by real-time PCR in rabbit muscles, with MyHC-1 and MyHC-2D, MyHC-2B were the major types in biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles, respectively. At the age of 84d, GZ rabbits contained greater proportion of MyHC-1 and decreased proportion of MyHC-2D and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity in biceps femoris than CW rabbits, and the results were exactly opposite in longissimus dorsi , suggesting that GZ rabbits show higher oxidative capacity in biceps femoris muscle than CW rabbits. In conclusion, the trends of mRNA levels of MSTN and fiber types in GZ rabbits' skeletal muscles might be consistent with the putative fast growth characteristic of GZ rabbits compared to CW rabbits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage at slaughter 3abody weight 3agene expression 3agrowth retardation 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alongissimus muscle 3amessenger RNA 3amyosin heavy chains 3amyostatin 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arabbit breeds 3arabbits 3askeletal muscle 3aGermany 0aGene expression 0aMyogenin 0aMyosin heavy chain 0aMyostatin 0aRabbit1 aXie, Xiaohong1 aZhang, Xiangyu1 aLei, Min1 aLi, Congyan1 aRen, Yongjun1 aZheng, Jie1 aGuo, Zhiqiang1 aZhang, Cuixia1 aYang, Chao1 aZheng, Yucai0 tAnimal biotechnology.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 25, no. 4 p.223-233dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-23787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10495398.2013.8656393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008300172300001400255520159200269592002801861650001401889650002001903650002101923650002801944650002601972650003001998650002402028650002002052650002202072650002202094700002102116773008702137856004802224852000902272655001202281IND4468190520221117231430.0120418e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446819052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-010-0585-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKülköylüoğlu, Okan10aEcological characteristics of the freshwater Ostracoda in Bolu Region (Turkey)  ap. 37-46.  aTotal of 40 ostracod taxa obtained from 141 different sampling locations in Bolu were examined to determine relationships between habitat preferences of species and their ecological characteristics from June to August 2006. According to the first axis of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), 52% of the relationships between species and five most influential environmental variables with 36.2% of variances were explained. Although the first four variables, air temperature, water temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity had significant influence (P < 0.05) on species composition, the effect of dissolved oxygen (P = 0.47) was relatively low. Spearman correlation analyses indicated that some species had weak to strong positive correlation with electrical conductivity, whereas some others had a significant negative correlation with pH and redox potential. Only two species (Herpetocypris chevreuxi and Ilyocypris inermis) had strong correlation to the habitat type (P < 0.05). Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustered species into four groups based on their occurrences. Species with cosmopolitan characteristics displayed higher tolerances to environmental variables than noncosmopolitans or rare species. Indeed, four cosmopolitan species (Heterocypris incongruens, I. bradyi, Candona neglecta, and C. candida) had high Environmental Tolerance Index (ETI) values for at least six different environmental variables. Thus, cosmopolitans are highly adaptable within a wide range of environmental conditions and geographical distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstracoda 3aair temperature 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat preferences 3aredox potential 3aspecies diversity 3awater temperature1 aSarı, Necmettin0 tHydrobiologia.g2012 June, v. 688, no. 1 p.37-46dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0585-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010400171300001400275520137200289592002801661650001801689650002201707650002301729650001601752650001201768650000901780650001401789650002701803650001501830650002601845650002301871650002601894650002801920650001101948650001601959651002901975700002002004700001702024700001702041773010302058856008202161990002302243852000902266655001202275IND60097683520221119221841.0141104e20120820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, A.M.M.10aFatty acid profiling reveals seasonal and spatial shifts in zooplankton diet in a temperate estuary  ap. 70-80.  aFatty acids composition of copepod and cladoceran species and their possible food sources was investigated in the Mondego estuary (southern Europe) in order to explain the seasonal variation of the small copepods Acartia clausi, Acartia tonsa, Copidodiaptomus numidicus, Temora longicornis and the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia longispina. A total of 12 zooplankton species (7 marine, 2 estuarine and 3 freshwater species) were studied. A multivariate analysis revealed a clear seasonal distribution of zooplankton species in terms of fatty acids composition and abundance, with winter and spring zooplankton species showing maximal concentrations and diversity of total fatty acids. These findings underline the role of lipids as storage during the colder seasons in a highly variable environment like an estuary. Estuarine and freshwater species showed a more diverse array of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids rather than marine species, except for Centropages typicus. Fatty acids markers of trophic position indicated the presence of two trophic levels: copepod species were primarily omnivorous, whereas cladocerans showed to be herbivorous. Our results suggest that feeding patterns of plankton change spatially and temporally, reflecting the shifts in dominance between diatoms and flagellates as well as between dinoflagellates/diatoms and small animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcartia tonsa 3aBacillariophyceae 3aDaphnia longispina 3aDinophyceae 3aanimals 3adiet 3aestuaries 3afatty acid composition 3afreshwater 3amultivariate analysis 3aseasonal variation 3atrophic relationships 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aSouthern European region1 aAzeiteiro, U.M.1 aPardal, M.A.1 aDe Troch, M.0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Aug. 20, v. 109 p.70-80dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014600165300001600311520113000327592002801457650001301485650001701498650001701515650001001532650003301542650001801575650001401593650001601607650001801623650001001641650002201651650000901673650001301682651001101695651001301706700001701719700002301736700002401759700001901783773010801802856004801910852000901958655001201967IND4468455220221119232640.0120510e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446845522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-012-0379-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahnazi, Sahar10aMorphological and molecular characterization of Fusarium spp. associated with yellowing disease of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) in Malaysia  ap. 160-169.  aYellowing disease is one of the most important diseases of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.). To characterize the pathogen(s) responsible for yellowing disease of black pepper in Malaysia, 53 isolates of Fusarium were collected from the roots of diseased black pepper plants and from rhizosphere soils from major growing areas in Sarawak and Johor. A total of 34 isolates of F. solani and 19 isolates of F. proliferatum were obtained and identified based on morphological characteristics and molecular techniques. DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and 5.8S ribosomal DNA regions was conducted to identify Fusarium species. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the ITS regions revealed that this molecular technique enabled identification of Fusarium at the species level as F. solani and F. proliferatum. In a pathogenicity test on 3-month-old black pepper plants, F. solani was pathogenic, but F. proliferatum was not. On the basis of morphology, DNA sequences and pathogenicity of the fungal isolates from the diseased plants, we showed that yellowing disease on black pepper is caused by F. solani  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aPiper nigrum 3ablack pepper 3afungi 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal DNA 3aroots 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3ataxonomy 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia1 aMeon, Sariah1 aVadamalai, Ganesan1 aAhmad, Khairulmazmi1 aNejat, Naghmeh0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2012 May, v. 78, no. 3 p.160-169dSpringer-Verlagx1345-26307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-012-0379-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245009600180300001400276520189600290592002802186650001202214650002002226650001802246650002102264650000902285650002402294650001902318650001702337650001102354650000902365700002302374700002302397700002102420700002102441773010302462856008202565990002302647852000902670655001202679IND60097683620221119222031.0141104e20120820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Dongen-Vogels, Virginie10aShifts in picophytoplankton community structure influenced by changing upwelling conditions  ap. 81-90.  aThe influence of upwelling events on the structure of picophytoplankton communities was assessed at the annual scale from a station within the South Australian shelf region. In this region, local (wind) and global (La Niña/El Niño–Southern Oscillation) hydroclimatic conditions affect the development of upwelling over the austral summer. Using flow cytometry, changes in picophytoplankton community structure were investigated in relation to the properties of the water column when the nature and strength of upwelling event differed for the upwelling seasons of 2008, 2009, and 2010. In 2008, strong upwelling favorable southeasterlies were responsible for extensive upwelling and the dominance of picoeukaryotes. Alternatively, in 2009, the observed dominance of Prochlorococcus reflected the presence of oligotrophic conditions whilst southeasterlies were replaced by downwelling favorable north-westerlies that likely prohibited the full development of upwelling. In 2010, whilst southeasterlies remained relatively weak, particularly cold and low saline upwelled waters indicated enhanced upwelling events. This weak local wind field together with the occurrence of El Niño explained the observation of shallow upwelled waters below the warm surface layer and subsequent enhanced stratification. These conditions led to the dominance of Synechococcus in surface and fluorescence maximum depths, but of Prochlorococcus in bottom upwelled waters. The tight association between upwelling and stratification, i.e. whether upwelled waters reach shallower depths and/or mix with those of the surface as a result of variable climatic conditions, was suggested as the process driving the vertical heterogeneity of picophytoplankton populations. This study brings valuable information for changing picophytoplankton community structure with potential future changing hydroclimatic forcing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aProchlorococcus 3aSynechococcus 3aclimatic factors 3acold 3acommunity structure 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3asummer 3awind1 aSeymour, Justin R.1 aMiddleton, John F.1 aMitchell, Jim G.1 aSeuront, Laurent0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Aug. 20, v. 109 p.81-90dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007400167300001600241520079400257592002801051650001001079650002401089650001001113650001901123650002401142650001301166650001101179650001001190650001401200650001601214650000901230650001001239651001601249653001501265653002801280653001701308653003601325653002101361653001301382653001601395700001701411773010701428856008501535852000901620655001201629IND60559006220221122191441.0161122e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900622DNAL7 a10.1080/0028825X.2016.11670922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorsen, MJ10aCarex applanata (Cyperaceae), a new species from southern New Zealand  ap. 335-343.  aA new species, Carex applanata , is described from the Old Woman, Old Man, Umbrella, Garvie, Pisa and The Remarkables Mountains in southern Central Otago and northern Southland.

IrCy complex nanoparticles (NPs) with high water solubility and photostability were prepared by a solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly strategy. Considering their effective photacoustic (PA) imaging and generation of ¹O₂ property with 808 nm laser irradiation in aqueous solution, PA imaging guided NIR-driven photodynamic therapy in vivo was effectively conducted in the 4T1 xenograft model. We developed a real-time PA imaging methodology to investigate the pharmacokinetics, tumor targeting, and biodistribution of IrCy NPs. Taking advantage of the analysis of the PA signal of the common iliac vein, the blood circulation half-life of IrCy NPs in mice was calculated to be ∼18 h, and the enhanced permeability and retention effect of IrCy NPs offered the maximum targeting property in the tumor at about 24 h. The obvious change of PA imaging signal in kidney and bladder confirmed IrCy NPs should be excreted partially from the urine system, and the PA signal decreased from 12.5× to 2.8× in the liver, and from 28.8× to 9.4× in the spleen also confirmed the hepatic metabolic pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochemical pathways 3abladder 3ablood circulation 3adyes 3ahalf life 3aimage analysis 3airidium 3airradiation 3akidneys 3aliver 3amice 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneoplasms 3apermeability 3apharmacokinetics 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotostability 3asinglet oxygen 3asolvents 3aspleen 3aurine 3awater solubility 0airidium-cyanine complex 0anear-infrared photodynamic therapy 0ananoparticles 0aphotoacoustic imaging 0ain vivo1 aJin, Hongyu1 aGao, Yucong1 aLin, Jiaomin1 aYang, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0307-34941 aYang, Shiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7527-45810 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 11, no. 17 p.15417-15425dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b040983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012500169300001500294520125200309592002801561650001501589650001101604650002001615650001101635650001401646650001301660650001101673650002301684650001501707650001101722650001101733650001101744650001001755650001301765650001501778700001801793773010401811856008201915990002301997852000902020655001202029IND60097683820221119221937.0141104e20120820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009768382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodgson, Alan N.10aActivity of the mangrove snail Cerithidea decollata (Gastropoda: Potamididae) in a warm temperate South African estuary  ap. 98-106.  aA population of Cerithidea decollata, an intertidal marine gastropod usually found within mangroves, was studied within an area of Juncus kraussii in the upper reaches of the warm temperate Knysna estuary, which is at the southern-most limit of the recorded distribution of this snail. Activity (migratory and homing behaviour, distances travelled during foraging) of the snails was monitored over spring and neap tides in four seasons. Migratory patterns of the snails were affected by season, time of low tide (day vs night), tidal magnitude (spring vs neap) and zonation. In the summer and spring, a greater proportion of snails migrated from J. kraussii leaves onto the mud during the day at spring low tide. During neap tides in these two seasons, most snails did not climb J. kraussii leaves and remained on the mud, which was nearly always exposed. In autumn a few snails only were active and in winter snails were almost completely inactive, probably due to low air temperatures. Snails travelled greater distances on the mud on spring tides, during the diurnal low tides, and in the summer. No snails were found to home to individual J. kraussii leaves; however, homing behaviour was recorded to wooden poles within the Juncus wetland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerithidea 3aJuncus 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3aestuaries 3aforaging 3aleaves 3amigratory behavior 3aphilopatry 3asnails 3aspring 3asummer 3atides 3awetlands 3awood poles1 aDickens, John0 tEstuarine, coastal and shelf science.g2012 Aug. 20, v. 109 p.98-106dElsevier Ltdx0272-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2012.05.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245007700166300001800243500001900261520154300280592002801823650001101851650001601862650001201878650001601890650001401906700001501920700005701935700005501992700001302047700005702060773011902117856008702236852000902323655001202332IND60731237720221120214022.0210318e20210302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073123772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c044092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yong10aInvestigation on Methane Hydrate Formation in Water-based Drilling Fluid  ap. 5264-5270.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo guarantee the flow assurance of drilling fluid in deep-water drilling, the inhibitory effect of PVP-K90 on methane hydrate formation was measured at 275.15 and 277.15 K with an initial pressure of 6, 8, and 10 MPa. The effect of PVP-K90 on the rheological properties of drilling fluid was also measured. Results showed that the apparent viscosity enhanced from 27 and 114 mPa·s as the concentration of PVP-K90 increased up to 2.0 wt %, which greatly weakened the fluidity of the drilling fluid. However, the addition of PVP-K90 showed a positive effect on prolonging the hydrate nucleation time and reducing the methane consumption in hydrate growth. The mean induction time of gas hydrate formation at 277.15K with the addition of 1.0 wt % PVP-K90 into the drilling fluid was at least 3 times higher than that without the addition of 1.0 wt % PVP-K90. The initial methane consumption rate and total methane consumption were reduced evidently with the increasing concentration of PVP-K90. In addition, increasing the temperature was also suggested to enhance the inhibitory effect on hydrate formation. Therefore, considering the influence of PVP-K90 on the fluidity of drilling fluid and the inhibitor effect of hydrate formation, 1.0 wt % PVP-K90 was thought to be a suitable concentration for the prevention of methane hydrate formation in drilling fluid at subcooling of less than 4.5 K. These observations have special significance for water-based drilling fluid with hydrate inhibition performance design in deep-water drilling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3agas hydrate 3amethane 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aLong, Zhen1 aLu, Jingsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3272-81701 aShi, Lingli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3374-64851 aYan, Wen1 aLiang, Deqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7534-45780 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Mar. 02, v. 35, no. 6 p.5264-5270dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c044093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012500164300001300289520169000302592002801992650001202020650001402032650001502046650001302061650002002074650002602094650002302120650001402143650001202157651001102169651001102180651001002191700002202201700002302223700002202246700002202268700002702290700001802317700002002335700002002355700002302375700002502398700001802423700002102441700002002462700001902482700002402501700002002525773010902545856004802654852000902702655001202711IND50069252920221121015735.0131018e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006925292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-013-1664-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorland, Edu10aDifferential Effects of Oxidised and Reduced Nitrogen on Vegetation and Soil Chemistry of Species-Rich Acidic Grasslands  ap. 1664.  aEmissions and deposition of ammonia and nitrogen oxides have strongly increased since the 1950s. This has led to significant changes in the nitrogen (N) cycle, vegetation composition and plant diversity in many ecosystems of high conservation value in Europe. As a consequence of different regional pollution levels and of the increased importance of reduced N in the near future, determining the effect of different forms of N is an important task for understanding the consequences of atmospheric N inputs. We have initiated three replicated N addition experiments in species-rich, acidic grasslands spanning a climatic gradient in the Atlantic biogeographic region of Europe in Norway, Wales and France at sites with low levels of pollution. N was added in two doses (0 and 70 kg N ha-1 year-1 above background) and in three forms (oxidised N, reduced N and a 50-50 combination). After 2.5 years of N additions, the effects of these treatments on plant biomass, plant nutritional status, soil pH and soil nutrient availability were determined. Impacts of the N additions were observed within the 2.5-year research period. In some cases, the first signs of differential effects of N form could also be demonstrated. In the French site, for example, grass biomass was significantly increased by the oxidised N treatments but decreased by the reduced N treatments. In the Norwegian site, the reduced N treatments significantly reduced soil pH, whereas oxidised N did not. Effects on nutrient availability were also observed. These experiments will be continued to elucidate the longer term impacts of N deposition on these grasslands. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aemissions 3agrasslands 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3anutrient availability 3anutritional status 3apollution 3asoil pH 3aFrance 3aNorway 3aWales1 aStevens, Carly J.1 aGaudnik, Cassandre1 aCorcket, Emmanuel1 aRotthier, Suzanne1 aWotherspoon, Katherine1 aJokerud, Mari1 aVandvik, Vigdis1 aSoons, Merel B.1 aHefting, Mariet M.1 aAarrestad, Per Arild1 aAlard, Didier1 aDiekmann, Martin1 aDuprè, Cecilia1 aDise, Nancy B.1 aGowing, David J.

The heteromyid rodents of North America and the gerbils of the Middle East and their predators provide such an example. Both sets of rodents face predation from owls and vipers, but the North American species possess unique traits that may represent macroevolutionary breakthroughs: rattlesnakes have infra-red sensitive sensory pits, and heteromyids have cheek pouches. To test their significance, we brought together two gerbils (Middle East), two heteromyid rodents (a kangaroo rat and a pocket mouse; North America) in a common setting (a vivarium in the Negev Desert), and quantified the “opinions” of the rodents towards the North American sidewinder rattlesnake and the Middle Eastern Saharan horned viper and the foraging behavior of each in the face of these snake predators plus owl predators. Gerbils are fairly evenly matched in their anti-predator abilities, while the heteromyids differ widely, and these seem to match well with and may determine the types of mechanisms of species coexistence that operate in the communities of each continent. Evolutionary history, macroevolutionary traits, and risk management therefore combine to determine the characteristics of the organisms and the organization of their communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipodomys 3aStrigiformes 3aViperidae 3aattitudes and opinions 3aforaging 3agerbils 3amice 3amouth 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk management 3asnakes 3aMiddle East 3aNorth America 0aintercontinental community convergence 0adesert rodents 0arisk management and tradeoffs of food and safety 0aPredator–prey foraging games 0acompromise-breaking adaptations 0amacroevolution and microecology1 aBrown, Joel S.1 aBleicher, Sonny S.1 aEmbar, Keren0 tIsrael journal of ecology & evolution.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 62, no. 3-4 p.186-195dTaylor & Francisx2224-46627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15659801.2015.11258323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245012900207300001800336500001900354520209600373592002802469650001902497650001202516650001802528650001902546650002502565650001102590650001102601650000902612650002202621650001402643650001302657650001702670650001602687650001302703650001602716650002202732650001402754700001702768700001602785700001802801700001602819773011902835856008702954852000903041655001203050IND60731237820221120214232.0210318e20210226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073123782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c044162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Daoyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6041-203710aComprehensive Review of Sealant Materials for Leakage Remediation Technology in Geological CO₂ Capture and Storage Process  ap. 4711-4742.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been widely investigated to decrease the greenhouse effect. Geological CO₂ storage sites are targeted mainly on depleted petroleum reservoirs or deep saline aquifers. However, CO₂ leakage might take place through wellbores, cap rocks, reservoir fractures, or faults during or after the process of CO₂ storage leading to environmental problems. To minimize these hazards, different kinds of sealants have been developed and applied. This review aims to summarize those materials applicable to CO₂ leakage remediation. On the basis of the sealing mechanisms and compositions of different sealant materials, they were divided into seven major types: Portland cement, geopolymer cement, resins, biofilms barriers, gel systems, foams, and nanoparticles. For different types of sealants, their application background, chemical and physical properties, CO₂ leakage remediation mechanism, impact factors of sealing performance, advantages, and limitations were summarized. Future development directions for these sealant materials are also recommended. To solve the problem caused by the weak acid-resistant performance of Portland cement, anti-CO₂ materials should be developed and added to the formulation. Environmentally friendly materials need to be designed to replace some current user-hostile compositions in the geopolymer cement. Moreover, chemicals that can control the geopolymerization process are also required because of the high curing temperature requirement for the recent geopolymer productions. The injectivity of Portland cement and resin limits its application for in-depth CO₂ leakage control; however, gels with relatively low viscosity during the injection can be a good alternative, although their thermal stability and strength need to be further enhanced. Biotechnology and nanotechnology are perspectives to be applied in the CO₂ leakage control process. Foams with good stability might be used for CO₂ leakage remediation in the porous medium without fractures, but their life cycle should be prolonged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid tolerance 3abiofilm 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acement 3aenergy 3agels 3agreenhouse effect 3apetroleum 3apolymers 3aporous media 3aremediation 3asealants 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aviscosity1 aPeng, Shudai1 aZhao, Shuda1 aWei, Mingzhen1 aBai, Baojun0 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Feb. 26, v. 35, no. 6 p.4711-4742dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c044163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245013000181300001800311500001900329520138100348592002801729650004401757650001901801650002301820650002101843650003601864650001901900650001301919650001901932650000701951650001501958650001101973650001601984653002702000653005302027653002802080653002102108653002602129653002402155700002302179700002302202700002002225773013702245856008702382852000902469655001202478IND60710716020221120135126.0201111e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071071602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVineh, Monireh Besharati10aBiodegradation of phenol and dyes with horseradish peroxidase covalently immobilized on functionalized RGO-SiO2 nanocomposite  ap. 4403-4414.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHorseradish peroxidase (HRP) was immobilized onto a functionalized reduced graphene oxide-SiO₂ through the covalent bonding process. By using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), the formed nanocomposites were characterized. The kinetic parameters including the catalytic constant, kcₐₜ, and the catalytic efficiency, kcₐₜ/Kₘ, increased 5.5 and 6 times, respectively, after immobilization. The circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that the α-helical content increased from 39% to 46% after immobilization. The immobilization improved the reusability of HRP as 70% of initial activity retained after 10 cycles. Due to the buffering effect, the immobilized HRP was less sensitive to pH changes as compared to the free HRP. At temperature 40 °C and during 90 min, the immobilized HRP retained 90% of the initial activity while 70% of initial activity remained for the free HRP. After 35-day storage, no reduction in the activity was observed for the immobilized HRP. The removal efficiency for phenol concentration (2500 mg/L) obtained 100% and 50% for the immobilized and free HRP, respectively. The results showed that the immobilized HRP promoted the dyes decolorization from 2-fold until 26-fold as compared to the free HRP. The decolorization efficiencies reached 100% for most dyes in the case of immobilized HRP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodegradation 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adecolorization 3agraphene 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3atemperature 0aHorseradish peroxidase 0aFunctionalized graphene oxide-SiO2 nanocomposite 0aCovalent immobilization 0aEnzyme stability 0aPhenol biodegradation 0aDyes decolorization1 aSaboury, Ali Akbar1 aPoostchi, Amir Ali1 aGhasemi, Atiyeh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 164 p.4403-4414dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245011800206300002000324500001900344520143000363592002801793650001501821650001501836650002401851650002201875650001401897650001901911650001301930700001601943700002301959773017301982856008102155852000902236655001202245IND60718040020221120081558.0201119e20201109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071804002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c041622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroom, Darren P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1328-737610aIntegral Mass Balance (IMB) Method for Measuring Multicomponent Gas Adsorption Equilibria in Nanoporous Materials  ap. 20478-20491.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo assess the performance of an adsorbent for a particular gas separation, and for process design, it is necessary to determine multicomponent gas adsorption equilibria, either experimentally or from predictions based on models or theory. The experimental techniques commonly used for this purpose, however, are time-consuming and typically require large samples. In this article, we describe a new approach, called the Integral Mass Balance (IMB) method, which combines the controlled flow of a gas mixture with in situ gravimetric measurement and gas composition analysis using quadrupole mass spectrometry. The IMB method allows very rapid equilibrium multicomponent gas adsorption measurements to be performed on samples weighing only a few grams. The method is demonstrated and validated by performing binary O₂/N₂ adsorption measurements on a commercial 5A zeolite, at ambient temperature and a total pressure of 0.915 MPa. Excellent agreement with previously published data was found, using a 3.5 g sample, with a measurement time of only 4 h for a 20 point isotherm. In contrast, other techniques of equivalent accuracy would require around 20 days of experimental effort to collect a comparable amount of data. Selectivities were also calculated and shown to agree with previously published results. In principle, the technique could readily be extended to measure gas adsorption from ternary or higher mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3amass spectrometry 3ananopores 3aprocess design 3azeolites1 aTalu, Orhan1 aBenham, Michael J.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 Nov. 09, v. 59, no. 46 p.20478-20491dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c041623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015400174300001600328520145200344592002801796650001301824650002301837650001401860650001801874650001001892650001201902650001801914650001701932650001401949650001401963650000901977650001101986651001101997651001802008653002502026653003002051653003602081653001802117653003502135653001102170700001902181700001702200700002002217773011702237856008502354852000902439655001202448IND60559003620221120135943.0161122e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055900362DNAL7 a10.1080/15659801.2016.11766142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBleicher, Sonny S.10aNovel predator recognition by Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi): do gerbils learn to respond to a snake that can “see” in the dark?  ap. 178-185.  aUnlike desert rodents from North America, Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) from the Negev Desert, Israel has evolved with snakes that do not have heat-sensitive sensory pits that enhance night vision. Does this history affect their ability to assess and respond to a snake that has this ability? As a test, we exposed gerbils to risk of predation from various predators, including snakes, owls, and foxes. The snakes included the Saharan horned viper (Cerastes cerastes) and the sidewinder rattlesnake (Crotalus cerastes). The former snake lacks sensory pits and shares a common evolutionary history with the gerbil. The latter snake, while convergent evolutionarily on the horned viper, has sensory pits and no prior history with the gerbil. The gerbils exploited depletable resource patches similarly, regardless of snake species and moon phase. While the gerbils did not respond to the novel snake as a greater threat than their familiar horned viper, the gerbils were cognizant that the novel predator was a threat. In response to both snakes, giving-up densities (GUDs; the amount of food left in a resource patch following exploitation) of the gerbils were higher in the bush than open microhabitat. In response to moonlight, GUDs were higher on full than on the new moon. Based on GUDs, the gerbils responded most to the risk of predation from the red fox, least from the two snake species, and intermediate for the barn owl.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus 3aGerbillus allenbyi 3aTyto alba 3aVulpes vulpes 3afoxes 3agerbils 3amicrohabitats 3anight vision 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3asnakes 3aIsrael 3aNorth America 0abiological invasions 0acommon-garden experiments 0aconstraint-breaking adaptations 0aprey naiveté 0apredator–prey foraging games 0avipers1 aBrown, Joel S.1 aEmbar, Keren1 aKotler, Burt P.0 tIsrael journal of ecology & evolution.g2016 Oct. 1, v. 62, no. 3-4 p.178-185dTaylor & Francisx2224-46627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15659801.2016.11766143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245018200216506011100398506007600509520151100585592002802096506003702124650001302161650001402174650001602188650001602204650000902220650001702229650001302246650002902259650002402288650001902312700006102331700003002392700002302422773009002445856008502535852000902620655001202629IND60770806220221207112911.0220426e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077080622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniilidis, Alexandros1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9063-471410aTechno-economic assessment and operational CO2 emissions of High-Temperature Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (HT-ATES) using demand-driven and subsurface-constrained dimensioning  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh-Temperature – Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (HT-ATES) can significantly increase Renewable Energy Sources (RES) capacity and storage temperature levels compared to traditional ATES, while improving efficiency. Combined assessment of subsurface performance and surface District Heating Networks (DHN) is key, but poses challenges for dimensioning, energy flow matching, and techno-economic performance of the joint system. We present a novel methodology for dimensioning and techno-economic assessment of an HT-ATES system combining subsurface, DHN, operational CO ₂ emissions, and economics. Subsurface thermo-hydraulic simulations consider aquifer properties (thickness, permeability, porosity, depth, dip, artesian conditions and groundwater hydraulic gradient) and operational parameters (well pattern and cut-off temperature). Subject to subsurface constraints, aquifer permeability and thickness are major control variables. Transmissivity ≥2.5 × 10 ⁻¹² m³ is required to keep the Levelised Cost Of Heat (LCOH) below 200 CHF/MWh and capacity ≥25 MW is needed for the HT-ATES system to compete with other large-scale DHN heat sources. Addition of Heat Pumps (HP) increases the LCOH, but also the nominal capacity of the system and yields higher cumulative avoided CO ₂ emissions. The methodology presented exemplifies HT-ATES dimensioning and connection to DHN for planning purposes and opens-up the possibility for their fully-coupled assessment in site-specific assessments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaquifers 3aeconomics 3aenergy flow 3agroundwater 3aheat 3apermeability 3aporosity 3arenewable energy sources 3astorage temperature 3athermal energy1 aMindel, Julian E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6518-67481 aDe Oliveira Filho, Fleury1 aGuglielmetti, Luca0 tEnergy.g2022 June 15, v. 249 p.123682-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1236823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011900165520199100284592002802275650001002303650001202313650001102325650001702336650001702353650001702370651001002387651001402397651001602411651001302427653002102440653001902461653001902480653002002499653001802519653001902537700001902556773011002575856008702685852000902772655001202781IND60737516620221118062923.0210624e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073751662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1042932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng10aFlavor principle as an implicit frame: Its effect on the acceptance of instant noodles in a cross-cultural context  aThis study investigated how the stability of liking ratings for instant noodles can be affected by implicit frames of reference constructed by flavor principles, unique combinations of flavor ingredients that can be identified as characterizing a particular ethnic/cultural cuisine, in a cross-cultural context. The influence of consumers’ food neophobia on the liking of noodles was studied as well. Koreans (n = 263) and Chinese (n = 258) residing in South Korea participated. Products with the highest market share in China (T_CHN) and Korea (T_KOR) were chosen as the targets. The implicit frame of reference applied during the sample evaluation was manipulated by exposing consumers to instant noodles composed of a particular “ethnic flavor principle” before tasting the two target samples. Consumers were split into five groups and were allocated to one of the three flavor principle frame conditions or one of the two controlled conditions. Consumers in the Asian frame were exposed to three noodles popular in Indonesia, Thailand, and Japan. Three Chinese and three Korean noodles were served in the Chinese and Korean frames, respectively. Two groups of consumers within each country served as controls and tasted a single sample of either T_CHN or T_KOR. Consumers rated how much they liked the samples. Consumer’s food neophobia was measured. Consumers searched for a contextual flavor consistent with the conditioned frame of reference when they were evaluating the target samples under their own country's flavor principle and tended to give lower liking scores for foreign target samples than for other samples. However, when the frame of reference was constructed with a foreign flavor principle, the degree of familiarity with the target sample positively influenced its liking score. Food neophobic attitudes influenced the liking of unfamiliar samples. Moreover, consumers’ food neophobia scores were affected by type of implicit flavor principle frame.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3acuisine 3aflavor 3afood choices 3afood quality 3amarket share 3aChina 3aIndonesia 3aSouth Korea 3aThailand 0aFlavor principle 0aInstant noodle 0aImplicit frame 0aFood acceptance 0aCross-culture 0aFood neophobia1 aChung, Seo-Jin0 tFood quality and preference.g2021 Oct., v. 93 p.104293-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1042933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010900173300001600282520165300298592002801951650001601979650002401995650001502019650001702034650001602051650002102067651001002088653002702098653001702125653001302142653001502155653001002170700001702180700001302197700001502210700001702225700001902242700005202261773010902313856009002422852000902512655001202521IND60541348020221117064001.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054134802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qingxu10aDetecting the 20 year city-size dynamics in China with a rank clock approach and DMSP/OLS nighttime data  ap. 138-148.  aStudies have shown that, city size and rank follow a Pareto distribution across countries and over time. However, inconsistent definitions and measurements of city size (e.g., urban population and urban area) in census data in China have hindered the retrieval of comparable Pareto coefficients over time. Additionally, abrupt changes in size and rank at the city level are neglected in many studies. In this study, we extracted an alternative and consistently comparable measurement of city size from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Line-scan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light images. Besides the traditional regression analysis at the national level, we also adopted the rank clock method to analyze city-size evolution at the city level. We found that: (1) the distribution of urban areas became more even in China, with an increase of the Pareto's coefficient from 0.79 in 1992 to 0.90 in 2008; (2) the most obvious change in urban-area distribution at the national level occurred during the period from 2000 to 2003, which is consistent with turbulent rank changes at the city level; and (3) our combined method revealed another period from 1992 to 1995 with large rank fluctuations, which was masked by the relatively stable Pareto's coefficients extracted at the national level. The results demonstrate that the new DMSP/OLS nighttime light images and the combined method are useful for revealing city-size dynamics in a more consistent way from both national and city perspectives. The results enrich our understanding of city-size evolution and have valuable implications for relevant decision makers and stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3acensus data 3aregression analysis 3asatellites 3astakeholders 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aChina 0aCity size distribution 0aUrbanization 0aDMSP/OLS 0aRank clock 0aChina1 aHe, Chunyang1 aGao, Bin1 aYang, Yang1 aLiu, Zhifeng1 aZhao, Yuanyuan1 aDou, Yue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6320-54820 tLandscape and urban planning.g2015 May, v. 137 p.138-148dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245009000206520165700296592002801953650002901981650002602010650001802036650001102054650001402065650001702079650002802096650002202124653001802146653001002164653001602174653002002190653001702210653001402227653002202241700006002263700002102323700005802344773010202402856008202504852000902586655001202595IND60716467920221118044951.0210506e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071646792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gfs.2020.1004502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizikova, Livia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0475-245610aHow can agricultural interventions enhance contribution to food security and SDG 2.1?  aThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and specifically SDG 2, commit the international community to achieve zero hunger by 2030 through a renewed focus on agricultural development for food security and nutrition. This paper presents a systematic review of published evidence of contributions by agricultural sector interventions to food security, including indicators and success factors.Our literature screening yielded a sample of 66 publications with 73 single or multiple intervention evaluations. Of these, 38 (52%) used a direct food security indicator to measure food security impacts, and the rest used a proxy indicator. Of the 73 evaluations, 49 (67%) resulted in positive impacts on food security, 17 (23%) produced no measurable impacts and 7 (10%) led to negative impacts. Interventions studied included input subsidies, extension services and value chain enhancements, delivered either alone or together, and sometimes with specific complementary pro-poor features. Studies showed positive, neutral or even negative food security outcomes across all intervention types, suggesting that program design features may be more important than the type of intervention in determining impact on food security. Positive food security outcomes were shown to be linked to multiple complementary interventions, targeted pro-poor support features, responsiveness to local food security issues, community engagement and collaboration with local and regional institutions. We suggest methods for improving monitoring, evaluation and learning related to the food security impacts of agriculture sector interventions in order to contribute to SDG 2.1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural industry 3afood security 3ahunger 3anutrition 3asupply chain 3asustainable development 3asystematic review 0aFood security 0aSDG 2 0aAgriculture 0aInput subsidies 0aValue chains 0aExtension 0aSystematic review1 aJungcurt, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9520-613X1 aMcDougal, Kieran1 aTyler, Stephen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0114-35590 tGlobal food security.g2020 Sept., v. 26 p.100450-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21608x2211-91247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2020.1004503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010900159300002000268500001900288520126100307592002801568650003001596650001701626650001401643650001601657700001901673700001701692700001801709700001901727700001801746773012401764856007401888852000901962655001201971IND60677986720221122023305.0191213e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067798672DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05929f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Seunghun10aNew red-emitting phosphor RbₓK₃₋ₓSiF₇:Mn⁴⁺ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3): DFT predictions and synthesis  ap. 39589-39594.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFinding new phosphors through an efficient method is important in terms of saving time and cost related to the development of phosphor materials. The ability to identify new phosphors through preliminary simulations by calculations prior to the actual synthesis of the materials can maximize the efficiency of novel phosphor development. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to guide the development of a new red phosphor. We performed first-principles calculations based on DFT for pristine and Mn-doped RbₓK₃₋ₓSiF₇ (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) and predicted their stability, electronic structure, and luminescence properties. On the basis of the results, we then synthesized the stable Rb₂KSiF₇:Mn⁴⁺ red conversion phosphor and investigated its luminescence, structure, and stability. As a result, we confirmed that Rb₂KSiF₇:Mn⁴⁺ emitted red light with a longer wavelength than that emitted by K₃SiF₇:Mn⁴⁺ and a wavelength similar to that of K₂SiF₆:Mn⁴⁺. These results show that DFT calculations can provide rational insights into the design of a phosphor material before it is synthesized, thereby reducing the time and cost required to develop new red conversion phosphors.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aluminescence 3ared light 3awavelengths1 aPark, June Kyu1 aKim, Minseuk1 aSohn, Kee-Sun1 aKim, Chang Hae1 aChang, Hyunju0 tRSC advances.g2019 Dec. 02, v. 9, no. 68 p.39589-39594dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05929f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245008900215300001600304506007600320520137200396592002801768506003701796650002301833650001801856650002501874650002401899650001701923650001401940650000901954650001001963650002201973650001701995650001702012650002202029650001002051650001002061650001002071650001902081700002202100700002402122773009102146856008102237852000902318655001202327IND60569701920221207090733.0170608e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056970192DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-016-9660-92doi7 aPMC51121252pmcid7 a275107102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedenberg, Steven G.10aEvaluation of artificial selection in Standard Poodles using whole-genome sequencing  ap. 599-609.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdentifying regions of artificial selection within dog breeds may provide insights into genetic variation that underlies breed-specific traits or diseases—particularly if these traits or disease predispositions are fixed within a breed. In this study, we searched for runs of homozygosity (ROH) and calculated the d ᵢ statistic (which is based upon F ST) to identify regions of artificial selection in Standard Poodles using high-coverage, whole-genome sequencing data of 15 Standard Poodles and 49 dogs across seven other breeds. We identified consensus ROH regions ≥1 Mb in length and common to at least ten Standard Poodles covering 0.6 % of the genome, and d ᵢ regions that most distinguish Standard Poodles from other breeds covering 3.7 % of the genome. Within these regions, we identified enriched gene pathways related to olfaction, digestion, and taste, as well as pathways related to adrenal hormone biosynthesis, T cell function, and protein ubiquitination that could contribute to the pathogenesis of some Poodle-prevalent autoimmune diseases. We also validated variants related to hair coat and skull morphology that have previously been identified as being under selective pressure in Poodles, and flagged additional polymorphisms in genes such as ITGA2B, CBX4, and TNXB that may represent strong candidates for other common Poodle disorders.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPoodle (dog breed) 3aT-lymphocytes 3aartificial selection 3aautoimmune diseases 3abiosynthesis 3adigestion 3adogs 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahomozygosity 3apathogenesis 3asequence analysis 3askull 3asmell 3ataste 3aubiquitination1 aMeurs, Kathryn M.1 aMackay, Trudy F.

TFs recognize DNA in a specific manner; the mechanisms underlying this specificity have been identified for many TFs based on 3D structures of protein–DNA complexes. More recently, structural views have been complemented with data from high-throughput in vitro and in vivo explorations of the DNA-binding preferences of many TFs. Together, these approaches have greatly expanded our understanding of TF–DNA interactions. However, the mechanisms by which TFs select in vivo binding sites and alter gene expression remain unclear. Recent work has highlighted the many variables that influence TF–DNA binding, while demonstrating that a biophysical understanding of these many factors will be central to understanding TF function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3abinding sites 3agene expression 3agenome 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aprotein-DNA recognition 0aDNA binding specificity models 0ahigh-throughput binding assays 0acofactor 0acooperativity 0achromatin1 aZhou, Tianyin1 aYang, Lin1 aDantas Machado, Ana Carolina1 aGordân, Raluca1 aRohs, Remo0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2014 Sept., v. 39 p.381-399dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011000171300001400281520133800295592002801633596004201661650000801703650001401711650002401725650002501749650001301774650001801787650002701805650001001832650003501842650002201877650002001899650001701919650000901936650001801945650002501963650002501988650001402013650001302027700001802040700002002058700001802078700002202096700001802118700002102136700006202157773011002219856008102329852000902410655001202419IND60629888420221120055901.0190202e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062988842DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-018-0137-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamoylov, Alexandre10aDNA Vaccine Targeting Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor and Its Application in Animal Contraception  ap. 73-83.  aOverpopulation of free-roaming and wildlife animals negatively affects economy and public health in many parts of the world. Contraceptive vaccines are viewed as a valuable option for reducing numbers of unwanted animals. This study develops vaccines for potential use in animal contraception exploiting a DNA platform. Objectives of the study were to generate DNA constructs directed against gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), a crucial molecular player in animal reproduction, and characterize them for ability to promote immune responses and suppression of reproductive parameters in vivo. DNA constructs were created to encode for a recombinant protein composed of two domains: GnRHR, the target antigen, and ubiquitin (Ub), a support protein. Ub-GnRHR constructs administered intramuscularly or intradermally or containing different promoters were compared. CMV and EF1α promoters were shown to be superior to CAG. In fertility trials, mice immunized intradermally with Ub-GnRHR construct driven by EF1α had a significantly lower number of fetuses. Importantly, the impaired fertility was achieved with a single DNA immunization and without the use of adjuvants. The study demonstrated for the first time that targeting the GnRH receptor with DNA-based vaccines could be a viable option for animal contraception.  aPublisher supplied data  aD1213-F13cMichelson Prize and Grants 3aDNA 3aadjuvants 3aanimal reproduction 3aanimal use reduction 3aantigens 3acontraception 3acontraceptive vaccines 3afetus 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahormone receptors 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3amice 3apublic health 3arecombinant proteins 3arecombinant vaccines 3aubiquitin 3awildlife1 aNapier, India1 aMorrison, Nancy1 aCochran, Anna1 aSchemera, Bettina1 aWright, James1 aCattley, Russell1 aSamoylova, Tatiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7630-33720 tMolecular biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 61, no. 2 p.73-83dSpringer USwJournal:jnl52132x1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-018-0137-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008000163300002000243520119600263592002801459650001501487650001801502650001001520650001401530650001901544650001601563650002001579650001801599650001301617650002301630650001601653653001301669653001901682653002101701653002301722653002501745700002001770700002101790700006501811773014101876856007802017961001202095852000902107655001202116IND60646501520190806000000.0190612e20190529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064650152DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b031462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManjua, Ana C.10aMagnetic Responsive PVA Hydrogels for Remote Modulation of Protein Sorption  ap. 21239-21249.  aThis work shows the ability to reversibly modulate the hydrophilicity of the hydrogels doped with iron oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) in a noninvasive way when exposed to a cyclic variation of the intensity (ON/OFF) of an external magnetic field. A reversible switching of surface contact angles was observed for magnetic PVA hydrogels when exposed to consecutive variation of the magnetic field intensity between 0 and 0.08 T. Motivated by the magnetic dependence of the hydrophilicity of these hybrid hydrogels, the impact of the magnetic field on protein sorption was also evaluated. The noninvasive regulation of protein sorption-released mechanisms was achieved by ON/OFF magnetic field switches, suggesting the possible influence of magnetic-induced hydrogel shrinking effect and changes of surface wettability on protein sorption. The capacity to magnetically modulate surface wettability and protein sorption make these magnetic hydrogels promising candidates for development of functional devices for tissue engineering, drug release applications, or biosensor systems, where the control of protein sorption and mobility are essential steps to improve the efficiency of these processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acontact angle 3adrugs 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3ananoparticles 3asorption 3atissue engineering 3awettability 0aferrogel 0amagnetic field 0aprotein sorption 0asurface topography 0amembrane wettability1 aAlves, Vitor D.1 aCrespo, João G.1 aPortugal, Carla A.

In the present work, a series of in vitro studies was carried out to determine how CA supplementation affects rumen fermentation and microbiota. Batch culture studies were conducted to select the type of CA suitable for feed use and to define the optimal supplementation level. Rumen fluid from 2 Holstein cows was mixed with McDougall's buffer in test tubes into which grass hay and concentrate containing a fiber source [cellulose (control), water-soluble CA (WSCA), or insoluble CA] had been placed. Each fiber source was supplemented at 10% of total substrate. Tubes were incubated for 24 h to determine fermentation and microbial parameters. Then, the dose response of these parameters to different supplementation levels of WSCA (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30%) was tested in the same manner. We also operated a continuous culture system with WSCA supplementation and evaluated the effects on digestibility, fermentation, and microbial parameters. The supplementation level of WSCA was set at 15% of total feed. In batch culture studies, WSCA, but not insoluble CA, yielded dose-dependent increases in ruminal acetate levels. In the continuous culture system study, WSCA yielded increases in ruminal acetate levels and in the abundance of bacteria of the genus Prevotella, including Prevotella ruminicola. Dry matter digestibility and total gas production were not affected. These results suggest that WSCA supplementation at 15% of total feed yielded increased acetate levels without negatively affecting feed digestion; these effects may reflect activation of Prevotella species. As ruminal acetate is involved in milk fat synthesis, WSCA can be considered as a candidate feed additive suitable for dairy cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aPrevotella ruminicola 3abacteria 3acellulose 3acellulose acetate 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adose response 3adry matter digestibility 3afeed additives 3afermentation 3agrass hay 3ain vitro studies 3amilk fat 3amoieties 3arumen fermentation 3awater solubility 0acellulose acetate 0aPrevotella 0arumen fermentation 0arumen microbiota1 aSuzuki, Y.1 aKoike, S.1 aShimamoto, S.1 aKobayashi, Y.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Dec., v. 101, no. 12 p.10929-10938dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-149693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011800169520137600287592002801663650002701691650001201718650002801730650002201758650000901780650000901789650001301798650001101811650001001822653000701832653000901839653000801848653000801856653001001864653001001874653000701884653000801891653000701899653001201906653001201918653000901930653001001939653002001949653002101969700001501990700001702005700001502022700001402037700001302051700001902064700001502083700001602098773011402114856008602228852000902314655001202323IND60717352420221118065923.0211123e20210405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071735242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1243972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongjie10aBiochar-impacted sulfur cycling affects methylmercury phytoavailability in soils under different redox conditions  aRecently, there has been increasing interest in reducing methylmercury (MeHg) phytoavailability using biochar, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. By combining lab-scale batch incubation with pot and field validations, we demonstrate that biochar-impacted sulfur cycling in soils and MeHg-soil binding play key roles in controlling MeHg phytoavailability. (1) Under anoxic conditions, biochar-associated sulfate and biochar-facilitated microbial sulfate reduction enhanced the production of reduced inorganic sulfur species as acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) in soils by 122%, facilitating MeHg binding with soils and thus reducing MeHg phytoavailability. (2) In contrast, under oxic conditions, the reduced inorganic sulfur was oxidized (resulting in a 68–91% decrease in AVS), which released soil-bound MeHg and increased MeHg phytoavailability. The proposed mechanisms could explain the distinct effects of biochar amendment on MeHg bioaccumulation observed under anoxic (10–88% lower in rice grains) and oxic conditions (48–84% higher in wheat grains). Our results dispute the commonly held assumption that reduced MeHg phytoavailability under biochar amendment can be primarily attributed to MeHg-biochar binding. Therefore, the potential increased risk of MeHg in oxic soils following biochar amendment should be evaluated in more detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid volatile sulfides 3abiochar 3amethylmercury compounds 3aphytoaccumulation 3arice 3arisk 3asulfates 3asulfur 3awheat 0aHg 0aMeHg 0aSRB 0aAVS 0aXANES 0aEMeHg 0aBC 0aFeS 0aEh 0aTEM-EDX 0aMercury 0aRice 0aWheat 0aBioavailability 0aSoil remediation1 aZhang, Yue1 aOk, Yong Sik1 aJiang, Tao1 aLiu, Peng1 aShu, Rui1 aWang, Dingyong1 aCao, Xinde1 aZhong, Huan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Apr. 05, v. 407 p.124397-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1243973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013800162300002000300520135400320592002801674650001101702650001601713650001901729650001301748650001101761653002001772653004901792653002401841653002001865653003101885700001601916700002001932700001501952700005501967700005302022700005902075700005402134700001502188700005602203700005702259700005802316700001702374700001902391700001802410700001902428773014102447856007802588852000902666655001202675IND60646501720221120172903.0190612e20190523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064650172DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b036082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ruilong10aOne-Step Growth of Spatially Graded Mo₁–ₓWₓS₂ Monolayers with a Wide Span in Composition (from x = 0 to 1) at a Large Scale  ap. 20979-20986.  aAlloying is an effective way to modulate material’s properties. In particular, graded alloying within a single domain of two-dimensional transition-metal chalcogenide (2D-TMC) is of great technological importance, for example, for achieving band gap modulations. Here, we report a facile method to grow gradient alloying of Mo₁–ₓWₓS₂ monolayers with large domain sizes and high crystal qualities via the chemical vapor deposition technique. The as-grown Mo₁–ₓWₓS₂ monolayers have a gradient composition of W from x = ∼0 to ∼1 in a single domain with a lateral dimension up to 300 μm, and the span in band gap can be readily tuned. Owing to the grading in band offsets, the compositionally graded Mo₁–ₓWₓS₂ alloy monolayer demonstrates an excellent rectifying effect with the ratio of forward to reverse current up to ∼10⁴. Moreover, phototransistors based on the compositionally graded Mo₁–ₓWₓS₂ monolayers exhibit a high responsivity up to 298.4 A/W in the visible light regime, and particularly a decent responsivity of 28.7 A/W in the near-infrared regime. The control of band gap offset gradient and span in alloyed 2D-TMC semiconductors provides an additional degree of freedom in designing fascinating applications in achieving multifunctional optoelectronic devices on individual substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aphotoperiod 3asemiconductors 3asulfides 3avapors 0abandgap grading 0acompositionally graded Mo1−xWxS2 monolayer 0acarrier confinement 0aphototransistor 0achemical vapour deposition1 aLiu, Lixuan1 aFeng, Shanghuai1 aLiu, Yujie1 aLi, Songlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3995-95801 aZhai, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1465-67781 aXiang, Jianyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9374-71271 aMu, Congpu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1656-716X1 aNie, Anmin1 aWen, Fusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6827-53481 aWang, Bochong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5801-53691 aZhang, Guangyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1833-75981 aGong, Yongji1 aZhao, Zhisheng1 aTian, Yongjun1 aLiu, Zhongyuan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 23, v. 11, no. 23 p.20979-20986dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b036083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004400168300001600212520093900228592002801167650001601195650002701211650001701238650001701255650001701272650002701289653003101316653001601347653003001363653001401393700001801407773009601425856008201521852000901603655001201612IND60553697620221119101823.0170105e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055369762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2014.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassioura, Toby10aReprogramming the genetic code in vitro  ap. 400-408.  aThe site-specific introduction of non-canonical amino acids into polypeptides through genetic code reprogramming has become a powerful tool for biochemical studies and bioorganic synthesis. Although a variety of such techniques have been developed, all are based on the ‘mis-acylation’ of tRNA molecules with non-canonical amino acids. Multiple strategies have been devised to synthesize such non-canonical aminoacyl-tRNAs; for example, those based on protein or ribozyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes are particularly useful. Such techniques have enabled the incorporation of hundreds of different non-canonical amino acids into polypeptides in vitro. This review discusses the development and application of in vitro genetic code reprogramming techniques, especially enzymatic mis-acylation, and examines recent efforts to engineer the translational machinery to increase the range of translatable non-canonical amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aaminoacyl tRNA ligases 3agenetic code 3apolypeptides 3atransfer RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 0agenetic code reprogramming 0atranslation 0aaminoacyl-tRNA synthetase 0aflexizyme1 aSuga, Hiroaki0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2014 Sept., v. 39 p.400-408dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2014.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04129naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245015400169500001400323520209300337592002802430650001702458650002102475650000802496650001502504650002102519650002702540650002702567650002602594650002102620650002602641650002402667650001202691650001902703650001102722650001002733650001502743650001602758650002402774650002402798650002102822650001502843650002202858650001302880650002302893650001902916650001302935650001302948653002302961653002002984653002803004653002503032653003203057700002203089700001903111700001703130700001703147700001903164700001903183700002403202700001703226773009503243856008403338852000903422655001203431IND60716468220221118044949.0201202e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071646822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinteus, Susete10aMarine invasive species for high-value products' exploration – Unveiling the antimicrobial potential of Asparagopsis armata against human pathogens  aNAL-light  aInfectious diseases remain one of the leading global causes of death, mainly due to the increasing number of multi-resistant microorganisms. Therefore, novel antimicrobials are continuously needed. Marine organisms have already proven to be a rich source of bioactive compounds which can be used for the development of novel pharmacological drugs. Within these, seaweeds are an important resource still underexplored. Asparagopsis armata is a marine invasive seaweed that has spread along several coastlines of the world, inducing negative pressures in marine ecosystems. Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies to counteract their impacts. In this work, A. armata was extracted with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) and fractionated by column chromatography with different polarity solvents, providing 8 fractions (F1-F8). All the fractions were evaluated for their antimicrobial potential against important human pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, and Candida albicans. Additionally, their capacity to inhibit biofilms formation and the effects on cytoplasmatic membrane and DNA integrity were also assessed. The most active fractions were further purified and submitted to GC–MS analysis. The results showed that A. armata produces compounds with a high inhibitory activity against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans growth, possibly mediated by cytoplasmatic membrane disruption and DNA damage. GC–MS analysis suggested that the most active fractions were mainly composed of bromoditerpenes and fatty acids. The attained results point to the relevance of the invasive A. armata as a source of antimicrobial substances with broad-spectrum activity.The use of invasive species to obtain natural bioactive compounds presents a two-folded opportunity - high availability of the biological material for the extraction of bioactive compounds and, through specimen collection, the mitigation of the negative effects caused by invasive species, contributing to ecosystem integrity and sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsparagopsis 3aCandida albicans 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanimal pathogens 3aanti-infective agents 3abioactive compounds 3abiofilm 3achromatography 3acoasts 3adeath 3aextraction 3afatty acids 3ahigh-value products 3ainfectious diseases 3ainvasive species 3amacroalgae 3amarine ecosystems 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3amicroorganisms 3aresearch 3asolvents 0aBacterial biofilms 0aMarine invaders 0aMarine natural products 0aMicrobial resistance 0aSeaweed bioactive compounds1 aLemos, Marco F.L.1 aSimões, Marco1 aAlves, Celso1 aSilva, Joana1 aGaspar, Helena1 aMartins, Alice1 aRodrigues, Américo1 aPedrosa, Rui0 tAlgal research.g2020 Dec., v. 52 p.102091-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2020.1020913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014900171300001600320520155500336592002801891650001301919650003101932650001401963650001601977650002201993650001102015650002702026650000902053650001602062650003202078653001602110653003302126653001102159653000902170653001002179653001102189653001102200700001702211700001702228700002102245773008802266856008502354852000902439655001202448IND60551230520221119112938.0161018e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055123052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazir, Yusufhan10aResveratrol exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects to prevent memory deficits in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress  ap. 297-304.  aA number of studies have recently focused on the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of resveratrol. In prior studies, we described its beneficial effects on scopolamine-induced learning deficits in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on emotional and spatial cognitive functions, neurotropic factor expression, and plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines in rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), which is known to induce cognitive deficits. Resveratrol (5 or 20mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally for 35days. Rats in the CUMS group and in the 5mg/kg resveratrol+CUMS group performed poorly in tasks designed to assess emotional and spatial learning and memory. The 20mg/kg resveratrol+CUMS group showed improved performance compared to the CUMS group. In addition, the CUMS procedure induced lower expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and c-Fos in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 and in the amygdala of stressed rats. These effects were reversed by chronic administration of resveratrol (20mg/kg). In addition, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta were increased by CUMS, but were restored to normal by resveratrol. These results indicate that resveratrol significantly attenuates the deficits in emotional learning and spatial memory seen in chronically stressed rats. These effects may be related to resveratrol-mediated changes in neurotrophin factor expression in hippocampus and in levels of proinflammatory cytokines in circulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamygdala 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acognition 3ahippocampus 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amemory 3aneuroprotective effect 3arats 3aresveratrol 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aResveratrol 0aChronic mild stress learning 0aMemory 0aBDNF 0ac-Fos 0aTNF-α 0aIL-1β1 aUtkan, Tijen1 aGacar, Nejat1 aAricioglu, Feyza0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2015 Jan., v. 138 p.297-304dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245006000214300001600274506007600290520081500366592002801181506003701209650001501246650002401261650002901285653002301314653002301337653001401360700002201374773009501396856008201491852000901573655001201582IND60553697720221207073600.0161023e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055369772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2014.07.0082doi7 aPMC44775392pmcid7 a251557492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHousden, Benjamin E.10aSpatial and temporal organization of signaling pathways  ap. 457-464.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development and maintenance of the many different cell types in metazoan organisms requires robust and diverse intercellular communication mechanisms. Relatively few such signaling pathways have been identified, leading to the question of how such a broad diversity of output is generated from relatively simple signals. Recent studies have revealed complex mechanisms integrating temporal and spatial information to generate diversity in signaling pathway output. We review some general principles of signaling pathways, focusing on transcriptional outputs in Drosophila. We consider the role of spatial and temporal aspects of different transduction pathways and then discuss how recently developed tools and approaches are helping to dissect the complex mechanisms linking pathway stimulation to output.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 0asignaling pathways 0asignaling dynamics 0acrosstalk1 aPerrimon, Norbert0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2014 Oct., v. 39 p.457-464dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2014.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245013500206506010400341506007600445520208500521592002802606506003702634650001502671650001102686650001802697650001102715650001302726650001502739650001002754653002602764653003402790653001002824653002202834653001702856700002202873700002102895773009002916856008503006852000903091655001203100IND60770806920221207111252.0220824e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077080692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Eng Jet1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3690-862X10aTidal current turbine blade optimisation with improved blade element momentum theory and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTidal current energy has the advantage of predictability over most of the other renewable energy resources. However, due to the harsh operating environment and complicated site conditions, developments in this domain have been gradual. Paramount to these points is device design and optimisation of hydrodynamic performance. Recent developments in the correction models of BEM theory have further improved the accuracy of the prediction model. Using an improved blade element momentum theory model that is capable of accurately capturing the downwash angle and combining it with a well-developed and reliable non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm model, an effective and efficient tidal current turbine blade optimisation tool has been developed and is presented in this paper. This novel work incorporated a NACA generator that is capable of reproducing any NACA profile, such a tool allows the solver to analyse each and every profile used in each spanwise blade element. As a result, the model is very effective at producing tidal current turbine blades that have been optimised not only for local twist angle and chord length, but also for the suitable NACA profiles to be used at a particular spanwise blade element. The use of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm in this work allows the model to efficiently explore a wide range of solutions, outputting a number of tidal current turbine blades suitable for a specified operating condition. The accuracy of the performance prediction of the improved BEM model is validated against an experimentally validated tidal current turbine blade. The coefficient of determination (R²) values for power and thrust coefficient are 0.99828 and 0.99488 respectively when comparing this work with experimental measurements found in the literature. Furthermore this proves that the improved BEM model is capable of efficiently predicting hydrodynamic performance of a tidal current turbine blade to a high degree of accuracy. Further work includes implementing computational fluid dynamics for further validation and evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3amomentum 3aprediction 3atides 0aTidal current turbine 0aBlade element momentum theory 0aXFoil 0aGenetic algorithm 0aOptimisation1 aKennedy, David M.1 aO'Rourke, Fergal0 tEnergy.g2022 July 01, v. 250 p.123720-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1237203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014100168300001600309520126000325592002801585650003001613650002601643650001301669650001701682650002001699650003801719650001801757650001101775650002401786650001201810650001401822650001401836650001301850650001301863650001901876650001601895700002001911773011201931856008102043852000902124655001202133IND60629888820221120050431.0190202e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062988882DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-018-0140-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamriz, Shabnam10aExpression of Recombinant PfCelTOS Antigen in the Chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its Potential Use in Detection of Malaria  ap. 102-110.  aMalaria is a serious but preventable and treatable infectious disease that is found in over 100 countries around the world. Correct and rapid diagnosis of malaria infection can rescue the patient of getting sicker and reduces the risk of disease spreading among humans. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast is an attractive platform for expressing malaria antigens because it is capable of folding complex proteins, including those requiring disulfide bond formation, while lack the ability to glycosylate proteins; a valuable quality of any malaria protein expression system, since the Plasmodium parasite lacks N-linked glycosylation machinery. In this study, Cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (CelTOS) antigen from Plasmodium falciparum was expressed in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii and a highly sensitive and specific indirect ELISA test was developed using C. reinhardtii expressed PfCelTOS to detect malaria. Results obtained demonstrated that expressed recombinant PfCelTOS accumulates as a soluble, properly folded and functional protein within C. reinhardtii chloroplast and indirect ELISA using sera from malaria-positive donors suggested the potential use of expressed PfCelTOS as a malaria antigen for diagnosis tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantigens 3achloroplasts 3adisulfide bonds 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3ainfectious diseases 3amalaria 3aookinetes 3aparasites 3apatients 3aproteins 3arisk reduction 3asporozoites1 aOfoghi, Hamideh0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 61, no. 2 p.102-110dSpringer USwJournal:jnl52132x1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-018-0140-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009800207300001600305520132100321592002801642650002601670650002201696650001501718650001801733650001501751650001101766650001901777650002801796650003101824650002201855650001501877650000701892650002701899700001801926773012801944856008202072852000902154655001202163IND60591340220221120060823.0181018e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059134022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1226-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKishi, Masatoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0424-670510aCarbon fixation properties of three alkalihalophilic microalgal strains under high alkalinity  ap. 401-410.  aCarbon dioxide (CO₂) recovery with high alkalinity microalgal culture is expected to be an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process. To increase the CO₂ recovery efficiency, selection of rapidly growing alkalihalophilic microalgae is necessary. This study optimized the culture conditions of three species of alkalihalophilic microalgae, Arthrospira platensis, Dunaliella salina, and Euhalothece sp., and compared their CO₂ fixation potential. Although D. salina tolerated relatively high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC; 0.50 mol L⁻¹), its carbon fixation rate was found to be slower than the other two species. The two cyanobacteria, A. platensis and Euhalothece sp., favored high pH (9.8–10) and high DIC (0.23–1.1 mol L⁻¹). Euhalothece sp. grew in the highest alkalinity, resulting in the strongest pH buffer against acidification during CO₂ absorption. However, the carbon fixation properties of A. platensis and Euhalothece sp. under the same light condition were found to be similar (33 and 35 mmol L⁻¹ day⁻¹). These results indicate that the carbon fixation potential per medium inorganic carbon was higher in A. platensis than in the others. Arthrospira platensis was found to be favorable in a CO₂ recovery process unless extremely high pH stability is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aDunaliella salina 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3aalkalinity 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3aenergy efficiency 3amicroalgae 3apH 3asustainable technology1 aToda, Tatsuki0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.401-410dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1226-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009300169300001800262520131700280592002801597650001101625650002501636650001401661650001101675650001701686650001101703650002401714650002201738651001301760700002001773773008701793856008301880852000901963655001201972IND60096750320221118235819.0141104e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009675032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasir, Muhammad10aEnvironmental Kuznets Curve for carbon emissions in Pakistan: An empirical investigation  ap. 1857-1864.  aThis study investigates the relationship between carbon emissions, income, energy consumption, and foreign trade in Pakistan for the period 1972–2008.

Moreover, both energy consumption and foreign trade are found to have positive effects on emissions. The short-run results have, however, denied the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve. The short-run results are unique to the existing literature in the sense that none of the long-run determinants of emissions is significant. The contradictory results of short- and long-run give policy makers the opportunity to formulate different types of growth policies for the two terms taking environmental issues into consideration. In addition, the uni-directional causality from growth to energy consumption suggests that the policy makers should not only focus on forecasting future demand for energy with different growth scenarios but also on obtaining the least cost energy. Furthermore, the absence of causality from emissions to growth suggests that Pakistan can curb its carbon emissions without disturbing its economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aeconomic development 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aincome 3ainternational trade 3aissues and policy 3aPakistan1 aUr Rehman, Faiz0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 3 p.1857-1864dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011300173300002000286500001900306520117000325592002801495650001501523650001101538650001901549650003101568650002101599650001701620650001901637650001101656650001901667650001601686650001601702650001001718700005501728700002001783700001701803700001801820700001801838700001601856773012201872856008701994852000902081655001202090IND60718094920221119093714.0201119e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071809492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c025082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chengxiang10aLow-Cost MnO₂ Nanoflowers and La₂O₃ Nanospheres as Efficient Electrodes for Asymmetric Supercapacitors  ap. 14882-14892.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhile supercapacitors can deliver high electrical power, their low energy density limits their application. Here, we designed and fabricated a facile asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with excellent electrochemical performance, where MnO₂ nanoflowers (NFs) and La₂O₃ nanospheres (NSs) were successfully electrodeposited onto carbon paper as work electrodes in an aqueous 0.5 M Na₂SO₄ electrolyte. Such nanostructures endow the electrodes with short electrons, ion diffusion paths, and abundant charge adsorption sites. The assembled MnO₂ NF//La₂O₃ NS asymmetric cell presents a gravimetric energy density of 80.56 Wh kg–¹, a volumetric energy density of 0.74 mWh cm–³ at 35.71 mA cm–³, and excellent cycle performance. Moreover, a packaged device displays a superior energy density of 0.49 mWh cm–³ with a power density of 94.29 mW cm–³. The satisfactory improvement in performance mainly stems from the homogeneous nanostructured architecture and an extended workable potential region of 0–2.0 V. The resulting supercapacitors could have great potential for designing high energy and power density devices as effective power sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3aelectric power 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ananoflowers 3ananospheres 3apaper1 aPan, Wenxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3723-24301 aZheng, Dianyuan1 aYao, Rongbin1 aZheng, Yuhang1 aZhu, Jianhong1 aJia, Daiwen0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 34, no. 11 p.14882-14892dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c025083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04012naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245010600217300001600323506007600339520196100415592002802376506003702404650001502441650001802456650001202474650001502486650001402501650002502515650002802540650001202568650002202580650003102602650002402633650001102657650002802668650000902696650002602705650001802731650001202749650001602761650001902777650002002796650002002816650002002836650002002856650001902876650001602895653002602911653001602937653002202953653002602975653003203001653001703033700002603050700002503076700002403101773011903125856008503244852000903329655001203338IND60623429720221207141115.0190130e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062342972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.11.0022doi7 aPMC64485912pmcid7 a304723252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Shrawan Kumar10aUpregulation of human glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) induces necroptosis in colon carcinoma cells  ap. 158-167.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman GLTP on chromosome 12 (locus 12q24.11) encodes a 24 kD amphitropic lipid transfer protein (GLTP) that mediates glycosphingolipid (GSL) intermembrane trafficking and regulates GSL homeostatic levels within cells. Herein, we provide evidence that GLTP overexpression inhibits the growth of human colon carcinoma cells (HT-29; HCT-116), but spares normal colonic cells (CCD-18Co). Mechanistic studies reveal that GLTP overexpression arrested the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint via upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1B (Kip1/p27) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (Cip1/p21) at the protein and mRNA levels, and downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4), cyclin E and cyclin D1 protein levels. Assessment of the biological fate of HCT-116 cells overexpressing GLTP indicated no increase in cell death suggesting induction of quiescence. However, HT-29 cells overexpressing GLTP underwent cell death by necroptosis as revealed by phosphorylation of human mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL) via receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK-3), elevated cytosolic calcium, and plasma membrane permeabilization by pMLKL oligomerization. Overexpression of W96A-GLTP, an ablated GSL binding site mutant, failed to arrest the cell cycle or induce necroptosis. Sphingolipid assessment (ceramide, monohexosylceramide, sphingomyelin, ceramide-1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate) of HT-29 cells overexpressing GLTP revealed large decreases (>5-fold) in sphingosine-1-phosphate with minimal change in 16:0-ceramide, tipping the ‘sphingolipid rheostat’ (S1P/16:0-Cer ratio) towards cell death. Depletion of RIPK-3 or MLKL abrogated necroptosis induced by GLTP overexpression. Our findings establish GLTP upregulation as a previously unknown suppressor of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells via interference with cell cycle progression and induction of necroptosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aD1 protein 3abinding sites 3acalcium 3acell cycle 3aceramides 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3alipid transfer proteins 3aloci 3amembrane permeability 3amessenger RNA 3amutants 3anecroptosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligomerization 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein content 3asphingomyelins 3asphingosine 0aProgrammed cell death 0aNecroptosis 0aSphingolipidomics 0aSphingolipid rheostat 0aGlycolipid transfer protein 0aColon cancer1 aStephenson, Daniel J.1 aChalfant, Charles E.1 aBrown, Rhoderick E.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Feb., v. 1864, no. 2 p.158-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245019500194300001800389520175800407592002802165650001502193650001702208650002902225650002602254650001502280650001402295650001302309650001102322650000702333650001502340650001302355650002002368650001102388650001802399650001302417650002802430650002102458650002102479653002302500653002802523653002802551653001902579653003302598653002402631653005502655700001902710700002102729700002402750700002002774700002002794700002302814700001802837773008402855856008402939852000903023655001203032IND60088400320221117100253.0160901e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008840032DNAL7 a239530892pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Laurentiis, Elisa10aPhotochemical processes involving the UV absorber benzophenone-4 (2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulphonic acid) in aqueous solution: Reaction pathways and implications for surface waters  ap. 5943-5953.  aThe sunlight filter benzophenone-4 (BP-4) is present in surface waters as two prevailing forms, the singly deprotonated (HA−) and the doubly deprotonated one (A2−), with pKa2 = 7.30 ± 0.14 (μ ± σ, by dissociation of the phenolic group). In freshwater environments, BP-4 would mainly undergo degradation by reaction with OH and direct photolysis. The form HA− has a second-order reaction rate constant with OH (kOH) of (1.87 ± 0.31)·1010 M−1 s−1 and direct photolysis quantum yield Φ equal to (3.2 ± 0.6)·10−5. The form A2− has (8.46 ± 0.24)·109 M−1 s−1 as the reaction rate constant with OH and (7.0 ± 1.3)·10−5 as the photolysis quantum yield. The direct photolysis of HA− likely proceeds via homolytic breaking of the O–H bond of the phenolic group to give the corresponding phenoxy radical, as suggested by laser flash photolysis experiments. Photochemical modelling shows that because of more efficient direct photolysis (due to both higher sunlight absorption and higher photolysis quantum yield), the A2− form can be degraded up to 3 times faster than HA− in surface waters. An exception is represented by low-DOC (dissolved organic carbon) conditions, where the OH reaction dominates degradation and the transformation kinetics of HA− is faster compared to A2−. The half-life time of BP-4 in mid-latitude summertime would be in the range of days to weeks, depending on the environmental conditions. BP-4 also reacts with Br2−, and a rate constant kBr2−,BP−4=(8.05±1.33)·108M−1s−1 was measured at pH 7.5. Model results show that reaction with Br2− could be a potentially important transformation pathway of BP-4 in bromide-rich (e.g. seawater) and DOM-rich environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adissociation 3adissolved organic carbon 3aenvironmental factors 3afreshwater 3ahalf life 3alatitude 3amodels 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aseawater 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3asurface water 2aKinetics 2aPhotochemistryxmethods 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aWaterxchemistry 0aEnvironmental fate 0aPhotogenerated radicals 0aEnvironmental modelling 0aBenzophenone-4 0aEnvironmental photochemistry 0aEmerging pollutants 0aPharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)1 aMinella, Marco1 aSarakha, Mohamed1 aMarrese, Alessandro1 aMinero, Claudio1 aMailhot, Gilles1 aBrigante, Marcello1 aVione, Davide0 tWater research.g2013 Oct. 01, v. 47 p.5943-5953dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009300169300001800262520086800280592002801148650001901176650001501195650001701210650002901227650002201256651001601278700002301294773008701317856008301404852000901487655001201496IND60096750520221118235547.0141104e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009675052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholtens, Bert10aIncentives for subcontractors to adopt CO₂ emission reporting and reduction techniques  ap. 1877-1883.  aWe investigate the incentives for subcontractors (couriers) of a transport and logistics company to report about their CO₂ emissions and to implement CO₂ reducing technologies. Furthermore, we try to find out whether these incentives differ between British and Dutch couriers. We find that several incentives play a significant role. Subcontractors in the Netherlands predominantly are extrinsically motivated to engage in CO₂ reporting and reduction techniques. This is because they are mainly driven by regulatory compliance, energy costs and implementation costs. In contrast, British subcontractors are much more intrinsically motivated to comply. They are predominantly driven by energy costs, environmental awareness, relationship building and reputation building. The contractor will have to account for these differences in making its policies work.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acompliance 3aenergy costs 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aNetherlands1 aKleinsmann, Renske0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Mar., v. 39, no. 3 p.1877-1883dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04900naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100005400187245009400241300001400335506007600349506003100425520244000456592002802896596008302924596007903007506003703086650001203123650002303135650002503158650000903183650002303192650002503215650001203240650002303252650002703275650001903302650002603321650001603347650002903363650001903392650002103411650001303432650001803445650002003463650002103483650001903504650001803523650001503541650002303556650001903579650001803598650001703616650002503633651001303658653001203671653002303683653001403706653001803720653001903738653002003757653002403777700005603801700002103857700001803878773013703896856008304033961001704116852000904133655001204142IND60616020520221215142819.0201230e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061602052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0172chorus7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamlow, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5035-619010aBroadcast woody biochar provides limited benefits to deficit irrigation maize in Colorado  ap. 71-81.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aBiochar soil amendments have been widely promoted for their ability to improve soil fertility in degraded tropical soils, and irrigation and fertilizer use efficiency in fertile temperate agricultural systems. Here, we evaluate if a woody biochar can produce both agronomic and environmental benefits in deficit irrigation systems by ameliorating water stress, improving crop N uptake and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. To evaluate these responses, we established a maize field trial in northern Colorado under deficit irrigation treatments with a woody biochar amendment. Irrigation treatments included recommended irrigation (Full), recommended irrigation except during non-essential growth phases (Limited) and 50% of recommended irrigation (Drought). We measured crop biomass, grain yield, grain N uptake, mineral N availability, soil water content, soil field capacity, soil C sequestration and N₂O emissions. Drought treatments reduced both grain and biomass yield while Limited irrigation showed no significant yield reduction relative to Full irrigation. Biochar amendments did not provide any yield improvements. Biochar also did not alter mineral N availability within the soil profile or grain N uptake. Biochar amendments increased gravimetric soil water content by 9.7% over the field season and increased water retention by 7.4%. However, these increases failed to alleviate the water stress coefficient, an index of how much the water content has dropped below the maximum soil water depletion acceptable between irrigation applications, which was correlated with yield. Biochar sequestered C primarily as coarse biochar particles with significant losses, likely a result of erosion. Across irrigation treatments biochar treatments trended towards a lower mean cumulative N₂O emissions over the growing season, but such effect was not significant due to high spatial variability in N₂O fluxes. Both biochar amendments and Limited irrigation treatments did not significantly impact yield-scaled cumulative N₂O emissions or irrigation water-use efficiency. This research highlights the importance of targeting the deficit irrigation treatment timing and amount to maximize biochar’s improved water retention in order to reduce crop water stress. It also confirms the diminished biochar N₂O emission reductions in the field relative to most lab incubations due to drier field conditions and crop N uptake.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNatural Resources Conservation Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000091710 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochar 3abiomass production 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn 3adeficit irrigation 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3aecosystem services 3afertilizer application 3afield capacity 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowing season 3airrigation rates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3asoil amendments 3asoil degradation 3asoil fertility 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atropical soils 3awater content 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3aColorado 0aBiochar 0aDeficit irrigation 0aMineral N 0aNitrous oxide 0aGreenhouse gas 0aC sequestration 0aSoil organic matter1 aFoster, E.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8704-66311 aDel Grosso, S.J.1 aCotrufo, M.F.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Jan. 1, v. 269 p.71-81dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011300170300001600283520141500299592002801714650001501742650001301757650001601770650001801786650001201804650002301816650002101839650002101860650001901881650003101900650002001931650002301951650002101974650002101995650003702016650001902053653003502072653001602107653001802123653001402141653001802155700001102173700001602184700001602200700001402216773010602230856008602336852000902422655001202431IND60597455520221116160601.0180624e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059745552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.04.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMou, Jiaojiao10aPolyanionic holothurian glycosaminoglycans-doxorubicin nanocomplex as a delivery system for anticancer drugs  ap. 364-369.  aA nanoscale delivery system for the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) by complexation with depolymerized polyanionic holothurian glycosaminoglycans (DHG) was designed in the present studies. The physicochemical properties of the nanocomplexes were investigated by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and zeta potential determination. DHG-DOX interaction was investigated in the presence of ethanol as a hydrogen-bond disrupting agent and NaCl as an electrostatic shielding agent. The thermal properties of nanocomplexes were ascertained by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The in vitro release profile was studied as well. Complexation of DHG and DOX formed spherical and smooth nanocomplexes with negative zeta potential (−46.3 mV) at a DHG/DOX (w/w) ratio of 1.0, where drug encapsulation efficiency was over 60%. The results indicated that the electrostatic and hydrogen bonds played an important role in DHG-DOX complexation. TGA confirmed that the nanocomplexes involved in the DHG as the as the coat and DOX as the content. The release profile of the nanocomplexes exhibited an initial fast release and an subsequent slow and sustained release. Furthermore, the in vitro cell cytotoxicity assays exhibited that the DOX loaded nanocomplexes could improve the cell killing ability of DOX for HepG-2, MCF-7 and A549 tumor cells and exert a sustained-release efforts in the cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuria 3acolloids 3adoxorubicin 3aencapsulation 3aethanol 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahydrogen bonding 3alight scattering 3aneoplasm cells 3aphysicochemical properties 3asodium chloride 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3atoxicity testing 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aHolothurian glycosaminoglycans 0aDoxorubicin 0aNanocomplexes 0aAntitumor 0aDrug delivery1 aWu, Yu1 aBi, Meijing1 aQi, Xiaohui1 aYang, Jie0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 July 01, v. 167 p.364-369dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.04.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245012500210300001600335520158800351592002801939650002501967650001301992650002902005650001902034650001002053650001602063650001502079650001502094650001202109650002302121650001702144650001502161650001202176650002202188650001202210650002002222650002102242650001802263650001102281700001802292700001902310773012802329856008202457852000902539655001202548IND60591340520221120070724.0181018e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059134052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1224-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonprab, Kangsadan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9103-907110aPreliminary study on bioethanol from fresh water algae, Cladophora glomerata (Sarai Kai) by the fungus, Monascus sp.

NP1. in glucose liquid medium, a saccharification method using algae and bioethanol production from Cladophora glomerata by the fungus. The results showed that when the fungus was grown in glucose (2, 20, 40 and 50%) medium under 110 rpm rotary culture at 30 °C, the ethanol concentration at 120 h increased from 2 to 20% glucose, where it peaked. It then decreased gradually to 40%, with production stopping at 50% glucose. This result indicated the glucose regulation of ethanol production by the fungus. Ethanol present in 20% glucose medium was identified by retention time and co-injection with a standard to demonstrate that the product was ethanol. Its yield was 285 mM [13 g L⁻¹ or 65 mg (g of glucose substrate)⁻¹] with a low interference of by-products. Three-millimetre-long pieces of dried algae were cut and exposed to concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 g in 65 mL of 0.3 N hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid before autoclaving (121 °C, 15 psi, 15 min). The amount of reducing sugar was greater than that of the control (without acid treatment) and varied with the increasing quantity of algae. The best condition was sulfuric acid and 6 g dried algae. The type of acid appeared to affect saccharification. During 12 days of fermentation in algal extraction (2 g reducing sugar per millilitre algal extraction), the mould could produce twofold more ethanol yield [34–55 mg (100 g dried weight algae)⁻¹] than the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TISTR 5049.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladophora glomerata 3aMonascus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacid treatment 3aalgae 3aautoclaving 3abioethanol 3abyproducts 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afreshwater 3aglucose 3ahydrochloric acid 3aliquids 3areducing sugars 3asaccharification 3asulfuric acid 3ayeasts1 aMatsui, Kenji1 aKataoka, Naoya0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.137-141dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1224-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04033naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245019100174300001800365520177200383592002802155596003902183650001602222650001702238650002002255650001302275650002602288650002502314650001002339650001202349650001702361650001302378650001802391650001402409650001802423650004102441650002002482650003102502650001202533650001402545650001902559650002002578650001202598650003302610650002202643650001002665650001002675650001802685650000902703650002102712650001302733650002202746650000902768650001902777650002502796650002902821650001902850700002302869700002202892700002502914700002702939700002102966700006702987773016603054856008203220852000903302655001203311IND60683326920221118141850.0200207e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068332692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07164-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammed, Kamal A.

COE was analyzed using GC-MS, and the emulsion was prepared and characterized. In the in vivo study, six groups of male rats were treated orally for 4 weeks, including the control group, the group treated with STZ (D-rats), the groups received a low or high dose of COE (200 or 400 mg/kg B.w.), and the D-rats groups received COE at the low or high dose. Blood and tissue samples were collected after the end of the treatment period for biochemical, genetical, and histological analyses. The GC-MS results revealed that the major components of the oil were cinnamaldehyde, 1,8 cineole, acetic acid, 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]hept2yl ester, α-Pinene, and α-Terpineol. The size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) of COE were 240 ± 1.03 nm, − 7.09 ± 0.42, and 0.36, respectively. The in vivo results revealed that COE at the two tested doses improved the levels of glucose, insulin, amylase, lipid profile, hepatic MDA, SOD, and GSH. COE also downregulated hepatic GLU2, FAS, SREBP-1c, and PEPCK gene expression and upregulated IGF-1 mRNA expression in diabetic rats in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, COE improved and the histological picture of the liver and pancreas. It could be concluded that COE overcomes the disturbances in biochemical, cytological, and histopathological changes in D-rats via the enhancement of antioxidant capacity; reduces the oxidative stress; modulates the concerned gene expression; and may be promising to develop new drugs for diabetic treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  a11090341cNational Research Centre 3aacetic acid 3aalpha-pinene 3aalpha-terpineol 3aamylases 3aanimal disease models 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood 3acineole 3acinnamon oil 3adiabetes 3adose response 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ain vivo studies 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3alipid composition 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aoils 3aoxidative stress 3apancreas 3aprotective effect 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awhey protein concentrate 3azeta potential1 aAhmed, Helmy M.

The GCP-zwitterion acts as a cross-linker to facilitate self-assembly of the polymeric chain into nanoparticles (NPs) at neutral pH in an aqueous medium. The formation of polymeric NPs can be controlled by addition of external stimuli (acid or base), which disfavors self-assembly of the GCP-zwitterion because of protonation or deprotonation of the GCP units in the polymer chain. The small-sized (<40 nm) NPs have a hydrophobic cavity and accessible lactose units on the outer shell for multivalent lectin binding. The multivalent interaction between NPs and the lectin peanut agglutinin was confirmed by agglutination experiments. In addition, the stimuli-responsive property of NPs was exploited for the uptake and release of a hydrophobic guest Nile red. Furthermore, the selectivity toward different cell lines (HEK 296T, HeLa, and Hep2G) was tested, and a cellular uptake of cargo-loaded NPs was found for Hep2G cells bearing the lactose-specific asialogylcoprotein receptor, whereas all other cells showed no NP interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagglutination 3aagglutinins 3adeprotonation 3ahydrophobicity 3alactose 3alectins 3apH 3apeanuts 3apolymers 3aprotonation 3apyrroles 3azwitterions1 aKlein-Hitpaß, Marcel1 aVallet, Cecilia1 aKnauer, Shirley K.1 aSchmuck, Carsten1 aVoskuhl, Jens1 aGiese, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6355-536X0 tBiomacromolecules.g2020 Apr. 10, v. 21, no. 6 p.2356-2364dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c002923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01438naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245002900166300001800195520047300213592002800686650001600714650001500730650001500745650000900760650001900769650001300788651001400801651001700815651001000832651001000842651002100852773012700873856007901000852000901079655001201088IND60302105920221119091027.0150704e20130906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030210592DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12392362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Brian E.10aReducing Earthquake Risk  ap. 1070-1072.  aThe preceding Perspectives in this series (1 – 4) provide snapshots of the earthquake and tsunami risks, hazard monitoring and risk mitigation activities, and current research questions concerning some of the world's seismic hot spots—South Central Asia, the Caribbean, Turkey, Tokyo, and Santiago.

The carbon material was coated on stainless‐steel wires by using the sol–gel technique. The prepared solid‐phase microextraction fiber was used for the extraction of five volatile aromatic compounds (chlorobenzene, ethylbenzene, o‐xylene, bromobenzene, and 4‐chlorotoluene) from tea beverage samples (red tea and green tea) prior to gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The main experimental parameters affecting the extraction of the volatile aromatic compounds by the fiber, including the extraction time, sample volume, extraction temperature, salt addition, and desorption conditions, were investigated. The linearity was observed in the range from 0.1 to 10.0 μg/L with the correlation coefficients (r) ranging from 0.9923 to 0.9982 and the limits of detection were less than 10.0 ng/L. The recoveries of the volatile aromatic compounds by the method from tea beverage samples at spiking levels of 1.0 and 10.0 μg/L ranged from 73.1 to 99.1%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acorrelation 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aethylbenzene 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agreen tea 3asolid phase microextraction 3astainless steel 3asucrose 3atea (beverage) 3atemperature 3axylene1 aZang, Xiaohuan1 aZhang, Guijiang1 aWang, Chun1 aWang, Zhi0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Aug., v. 38, no. 16 p.2880-2886dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2015003043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245004600174300001400220520054000234592002800774650002300802650002300825650001600848650002300864650002000887650001400907650000900921650000900930650001400939650001400953650002500967650001600992650000901008653002301017653001701040653002001057653002201077653001401099700001901113773015601132856008601288852000901374655001201383IND60721391720221119083350.0201224e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072139172DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-9149.2016.00015.02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakchaure, Rajesh10aDisease Resistance in Livestock: A Review  ap. 94-99.  aThe different diseases in animals cause mortality as well as morbidity and reduce production.

S. alveolata reefs perform several ecosystem services, such as hosting a rich fauna and producing structures able to provide coastal protection. Despite their ecological role, these bioconstructions have been poorly investigated in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, the largest Mediterranean S. alveolata reef, located along the Latium coast, was recorded and an habitat mapping duly carried out. During a one-year study, the balance between reef status and associated fauna was investigated using a multidisciplinary approach, the different phases in the annual cycle of S. alveolata were detected and the reef's influence on the diversity of associated macrofauna was assessed. The retrograding phase was detected in September, due to the damages by trampling disturbance, while the growing phase began in March. The comparison with the fauna of the adjacent substrates was also performed, demonstrating that the reef supported a high diversity of associated fauna and qualifying the reef as a biodiversity hotspot.Aimed at improving knowledge of Mediterranean reefs, our study lays the basis for more effective management plans and protection strategies for the threatened biogenic habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSabellaria alveolata 3abiodiversity 3acoastal ecosystems 3acoasts 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystem services 3afauna 3ahabitats 3areefs 3atrampling damage 3aItaly 3aMediterranean Sea 0aSabellaria alveolata 0aReef 0aMediterranean sea 0aBiodiversity hotspot 0aBioengineer species 0aReef phases 0aThreatened habitats1 aLezzi, Marco1 aVentura, Daniele1 aLisco, Stefania1 aCardone, Frine1 aGravina, Maria Flavia0 tMarine environmental research.g2019 Mar., v. 145 p.97-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245005500167300001800222520134200240592002801582650002601610650002301636650002001659650001601679700002901695773010101724856007801825852000901903655001201912IND60375102120221120104530.0150820e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6037510212DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2014014712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZenkevich, Igor G.10aOverloading control of gas chromatographic systems  ap. 2848-2856.  aIncreasing the interlaboratory reproducibility of gas chromatographic retention indices requires avoiding measurements distorted by overloading effects. Several criteria of evaluating the limits of the mass overloading of gas chromatographic systems are compared and reconsidered. The criteria mostly appropriate for practical purposes are based on (i) the dependences of factors of peak broadening (ratio of peak height and its width) vs. amount of analyte injected into the chromatographic column and (ii) the dependence of parameters characterizing the peak distortion (asymmetry factor) vs. the amount of analyte. Both these criteria provide mutually comparable evaluations of the overloading limits for analytes of different polarity. At the same time, the dependence of retention indices vs. amounts of analyte injected in the chromatographic column cannot be recommended for overloading control, because the parameters of the corresponding linear regressions indicate temperature dependence. The interpretation of certain gas chromatographic anomalies requires the correct evaluation of overloading limits. For example, the unusual temperature dependence of retention indices of polar analytes on non‐polar stationary phases and the dependence of retention indices on ratio of amounts of target analytes and reference compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment performance 3agas chromatography 3areproducibility 3atemperature1 aPavlovskii, Alexander A.0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Aug., v. 38, no. 16 p.2848-2856dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014014713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245017800168300001600346520148900362592002801851596018701879650002202066650001502088650001802103650001302121650002302134650001802157650001902175650001802194650001602212650001402228650001502242650001302257650002102270700006602291700001902357700001802376700002002394773012802414856008202542852000902624655001202633IND60591340820221120070722.0181018e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059134082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1221-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotte, Pierpaolo10aCombined exploitation of CO2 and nutrient replenishment for increasing biomass and lipid productivity of the marine diatoms Thalassiosira weissflogii and Cyclotella cryptica  ap. 243-251.  aDiatoms are promising candidates for sustainable production of biofuels but their use is restricted due to the difficulties of combining high-biomass productivity and lipid accumulation. Here, we report the effect of high levels of nutrients and supplementation of 10% CO₂ on biomass and lipid productivity of the marine diatoms Thalassiosira weissflogii and Cyclotella cryptica. Daily nutrient replenishment stimulated growth and increased the biomass but reduced lipid synthesis and dropped the level of triglycerides (TAG) close to zero. On the contrary, addition of 10% CO₂ (v/v) doubled or tripled lipid content in comparison with air-sparged cultures, but induced only a modest increase of biomass. Assessment of the content in carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins suggested that CO₂ stimulated lipogenesis from carbohydrates in both diatoms. In order to combine these effects, we also tested a two-stage cultivation that alternated nutrient replenishment together with addition of CO₂ during nutrient shortage. T. weissflogii and C. cryptica responded to these conditions by increasing dry biomass to 1.25 g L⁻¹ without reduction of total lipid percentage. In both species, TAG became the main lipid component and accounted for more than 60% of total glycerolipids in C. cryptica. These results underline the metabolic plasticity of diatom cells and indicate a possible way to maximize the production of biomass and functional products by tuning culture conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject PON01_02740 “Sfruttamento Integrato di Biomasse Algali in Filiera Energetica di Qualità” (SIBAFEQ)cProgramma Operativo Nazionale - Ricerca e Competitività 2007 - 2013. 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCyclotella 3aThalassiosira 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acarbohydrates 3acarbon dioxide 3alipid content 3alipogenesis 3anutrients 3aplasticity 3aproteins 3atriacylglycerols1 ad’Ippolito, Giuliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6821-69621 aGallo, Carmela1 aSardo, Angela1 aFontana, Angelo0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.243-251dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1221-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010300164300001400267520195300281592002802234650001102262650000902273650001102282650001502293650001102308650001802319650001802337650002402355650001902379650000902398650001702407650002402424650002302448650002502471650001502496651001002511653001702521653001002538653001202548653001502560653002802575653001702603700001502620700001802635700001602653700001502669773012302684856008302807852000902890655001202899IND60616020820221119171148.0201230e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061602082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenwei10aReconstructing recent changes in sediment yields from a typical karst watershed in southwest China  ap. 62-70.  aSouthwest China is characterized by shallow soils with low soil loss tolerance (30–68 t km⁻² yr⁻¹), and this region is one of the largest contiguous karst areas in the world, notorious for its highly eroded landscapes. However, reliable information on soil erosion rates in these karst watersheds is limited due to the highly heterogonous landscape. Karst depressions are a unique geomorphologic pattern in southwest China which can trap eroded sediment similar to a reservoir or dam, and may provide a great opportunity for sediment yield estimation if the sediment chronology can be properly determined. This study used karst depression sediment deposits to reconstruct the changes in sediment yields over the past 60 years from a typical karst watershed in southwest China. Three sediment cores were collected from the depression to measure the changes in ¹³⁷Cs and ²¹⁰Pbₑₓ, clay, silt, and sand contents, and soil organic carbon at different depths. The results indicated that the three common ²¹⁰Pbₑₓ dating models - Constant Sedimentation (CFCS), Constant Initial Concentration (CIC), and Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) - were not applicable to karst depressions, while a modified CRS model that used ¹³⁷Cs age marker as reference improved determination of the sediment chronology. From 1949 to 2015, the sediment yields initially increased and then sharply decreased to a low value, which might represent a general trend of soil erosion dynamics in karst watershed of southwest China. It was noteworthy that the mean soil erosion rate after the “Grain for Green” project of 1999 was only 80 t km⁻² yr⁻¹, which also is greater than the soil loss tolerance in karst regions. This study demonstrates the potential for use of ¹³⁷Cs and ²¹⁰Pbₑₓ to evaluate the temporal variation in sediment yield in a typical karst watershed of southwest China and may improve karst watershed management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acesium 3aclay 3akarsts 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aradionuclides 3asand fraction 3asediment deposition 3asediment yield 3asilt 3asoil erosion 3asoil organic carbon 3atemporal variation 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aSoil erosion 0a137Cs 0a210Pbex 0aDeposition 0aEarth’s critical zone 0aEcohydrology1 aXu, Xianli1 aZhang, Yaohua1 aWang, Kelin1 aZeng, Peng0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 269 p.62-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011600164300001600280520134800296592002801644596006601672650002301738650004401761650001001805650002101815650001801836650001801854650001901872650003301891650001301924650002101937650001601958700001301974700001701987773012802004856008202132852000902214655001202223IND60591340920221120070558.0181018e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059134092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1223-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Junying10aBrassinosteroid improves lipid productivity and stress tolerance of Chlorella cells induced by high temperature  ap. 253-260.  aThe application of exogenous brassinosteroids (BRs) against high-temperature stress in algae is poorly studied. The present work aims to assess the function of 2,4-epibrassinolide (EBL) on lipid production during the stress phase of Chlorella vulgaris cultivation induced by high temperature. The maximum growth rate was reached by the treatment with EBL at the optimum temperature of 25 °C, while the highest lipid content was obtained by the treatment with EBL at 30 °C, indicating that EBL significantly increases the lipid content of algae subjected to the stress induced by high temperature. Therefore, the maximum lipid productivity was obtained by cells in the media with EBL under optimum temperature (25 °C). The application of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in this work demonstrated that this technique can effectively and rapidly determine the changes in lipid and carbohydrate. Principal component analysis (PCA) can provide a full view of multivariate shift of cell compositions (i.e., lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins), which is much faster than individual band comparison. Based on FTIR data and PCA analysis, we successfully demonstrated that overall composition changes in algal cell, including lipid, protein, and carbohydrate, in response to the assimilation of high temperature and plant hormones.  aPublisher supplied data  a20151BDH80007cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalgae 3abrassinosteroids 3acarbohydrates 3alipid content 3aplant hormones 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproteins 3astress tolerance 3atemperature1 aQiu, Wen1 aXia, Donghua0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.253-260dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1223-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007600167300001800243520144800261592002801709650002601737650002701763650002301790650001601813650001101829650002401840650001701864650001401881650001201895773008701907856008301994852000902077655001202086IND60096751020221118235723.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009675102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadhi, Hassan10aOn the value of decentralised PV systems for the GCC residential sector  ap. 2020-2027.  aBased on the rich natural potential of the Gulf region, solar energy is expected to play a greater role in the future of the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries. This study examines whether the integration of the photovoltaic (PV) into individual residential buildings in the GCC countries is worth the investment. A prototype residential building is developed and a building integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) system is then designed. The system performance is simulated, and through economic analysis, it is shown that the current BiPV technology is not a cost-effective option for the GCC countries based on the present electricity tariff, PV system cost and system efficiency. The only way such a system would be viable with current technology is if the electricity tariff were to increase substantially. However, if the tariff remains constant for the foreseeable future, BiPV solar energy technology will only be feasible if the total system cost drops drastically. This study shows that BiPV systems offer cost reductions in both energy and economic terms over centralised PV plants, especially if the costs of avoided building construction materials are taken into account. To bring about the benefits of BiPV technology for the GCC residential sector, therefore, the first logical and most practical step is the implementation of a continuous promotion strategy that consists of both subsidies for investments and reasonable tariffs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuilding construction 3aconstruction materials 3acost effectiveness 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aresidential housing 3asolar energy 3asubsidies 3atariffs0 tEnergy policy.g2011 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.2020-2027dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245015100167300001600318520160800334592002801942650001801970650002101988650002602009650001602035650001902051650001002070650001402080650001402094650001502108650002002123650001402143650001402157650001402171650001002185653001802195653003002213653001902243653001902262653001402281653003102295700001902326700002302345700001602368700001902384773015802403856008602561852000902647655001202656IND60721392120221119083326.0201224e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072139212DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-9149.2016.00019.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoni, Rama10aEfficacy of Modified Hodge Test for Phenotypic Confirmation of Carbapenemase Producing Gram-Negative Bacteria from ICU in a Tertiary Care Hospital  ap. 113-116.  aResistance among bacteria isolates in the leading cause of increased mortality and morbidity worldwide. Carbapenems once thought to be effective are becoming ineffective mostly due to the emergence of carbapenemase. The present study was performed in the Department of Microbiology Bombay Hospital, Indore (MP) from January 2015 to may 2015 to determine the most prevalent organism to show carbapenem resistant along with the efficacy of modified Hodge test (MHT) for detection of carbapenemase production in Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). A total of 160 GNB from different clinical samples namely urine, pus, sputum, endo trachea and blood were isolated. By disc diffussion method, the isolates which showed intermediate or susceptible zones that is 16 mm-21 mm were subjected to MHT. Out of 160 isolates, 100 (62.5%) isolates were positive for carbapenemase production by MHT. Organism-wise distribution of organism was Klebsiella pneumoniae 107 (66.8%), Escherichia coli 15 (9.3%), Pseudomonas spp 28 (17.5%) and Acinetobacter spp 10 (6.25%). The sensitivity of various carbapenam was namely Ertapenem 10 (6.25%), Tmepenem 100 (62.5%) and Merupenam 50 (31.2%). Most of the weak positive results were shown by K. pneumoniae 6 (5.6%) out of 107 samples. There was a very high percentage of carbapenemases producing Gram-negative rods. It is imperative that all isolates showing intermediate or sensitive zone diameter on disc diffusion be further tested for production of carbapenemases by MHT to avoid treatment failures and development of resistance due to unnecessary use of this class of antibiotic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aPseudomonas 3abeta-lactamase 3ablood 3aertapenem 3ahospitals 3aimmunology 3aimmunopathology 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aphenotype 3aurine 0aCarbapenemase 0aModified hodge test (MHT) 0aCarbapenemases 0aBetalactamases 0aMerupenam 0aMetallo-β-lactamase (MBL)1 aBansal, Shikha1 aSubhedar, Vaibhavi1 aNayak, Anju1 aSharma, Varsha0 tJournal of immunology and immunopathology.g2016 July, v. 18, no. 2 p.113-116dSociety for Immunology and ImmunopathologywJournal:27363x0973-91497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-9149.2016.00019.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245023400218300001800452520135800470592002801828650003001856650002301886650002101909650000901930650002901939650002401968650001201992650001702004650001802021650002402039650002202063650002902085650001502114650001102129650001302140650001802153650001902171650002402190650001802214650001902232650002902251650001802280650002102298700002802319700002402347700002002371700002202391700002502413700003002438773016602468856008202634852000902716655001202725IND60683327620221118142343.0200207e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068332762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07169-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalakrishnan, Senthilkumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4117-969510aAntiquorum sensing and antibiofilm potential of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles of Myristica fragrans seed extract against MDR Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolates from asymptomatic typhoid carriers and typhoid patients  ap. 2844-2856.  aGlobally, Salmonella infection poses a major public health problem. Here, we report antibiofilm activity and quorum sensing inhibition of aqueous seeds extract of Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) and biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against multidrug resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) isolated from typhoid patients and asymptomatic carriers. S. Typhi isolates revealed higher percentage (46%) of biofilm production identified by tissue culture plate (TCP) than Congo red agar (CRA) and tube adherence (TA) methods. The inhibition of biofilm-producing MDR S. Typhi isolates and pigment production of Chromobacterium violaceum (indicator bacteria) demonstrated the quorum sensing potential of nutmeg. The aqueous seed extract of nutmeg exhibited 87% of antibiofilm activity, while the biosynthesized AgNPs showed 99.1% of antibiofilm activity. Molecular docking studies of bioactive compounds of nutmeg against transcriptional regulatory protein RcsB and sensor kinase protein RcsC revealed interaction with the target proteins. It is proposed that biosynthesized AgNPs could be used as one of the effective candidates in treating asymptomatic typhoid carriers or typhoid patients and to control the subsistence of biofilm-producing S. Typhi strains or other pathogenic bacteria in the environment or industrial settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3aMyristica fragrans 3aSalmonella Typhi 3aagar 3aantimicrobial properties 3abioactive compounds 3abiofilm 3abiosynthesis 3acarrier state 3acomputer simulation 3aindicator species 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananosilver 3anutmeg 3apatients 3apublic health 3aquorum sensing 3aregulatory proteins 3aseed extracts 3atissue culture 3atranscription (genetics) 3atyphoid fever 3avirulent strains1 aIbrahim, Kalibulla Syed1 aDuraisamy, Senbagam1 aSivaji, Ilakkia1 aKandasamy, Selvam1 aKumarasamy, Anbarasu1 aKumar, Nachimuthu Senthil0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Jan., v. 27, no. 3 p.2844-2856dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07169-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245008300175300001600258520060600274592002800880650002100908650001200929650001200941650001100953653001500964653001200979653001200991653001901003653001501022700001701037773011701054856008501171852000901256655001201265IND60536993720221117050537.0160807e20160703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053699372DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2016.11789822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGokarakonda, Sriraj10aPassive Architectural Design Index applied to vernacular and passive buildings  ap. 563-572.  aVernacular architecture’s use of passive building techniques has been developed in response to the prevailing climatic conditions of the past. Today, buildings are designed with complete indifference to the climate and materials. Energy consumption in buildings is mainly connected to space cooling, supply of hot water, lighting, cooking and, use of appliances. Space cooling and lighting are directly influenced by the design of the building. Energy codes should be concerned with ‘sufficiency’ as well as ‘efficiency’.

The number of the lumpsucker has declined since the mid 1980s, probably as a result of overexploitation. The lumpsucker is the preferred host of the sea louse Caligus elongates, which is a problem for marine aquaculture. However, little is known about the biology of the lumpsucker. The aims of the study were to 1) examine the movements of female lumpsucker during the spawning migration, and 2) assess the potential for lumpsucker to act as a vector for transmission of parasites and diseases between aquaculture farms and wild fish. Twenty female lumpsuckers tagged with acoustic transmitters were released during the spawning season in the inner part of Øksfjord, northern Norway and their distribution was recorded by 22 automatic acoustic receivers. The average time until departure from the fjord was 3 days, and within 1 week all fish had left the fjord. Timing of departure from the fjord was unrelated with either tidal current patterns or the time of the day. A high proportion of the fish (75%) were recorded within 200 m of fish farms, but they did not stay for extended periods at these farms. Our results suggest that mature female lumpsucker exhibit a movement pattern characterized by rapid fjord-scale migrations during the spawning season, and that they are not attracted to salmon farms in the same way as a range of other fish species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaligus 3aCyclopterus 3adisease transmission 3afarmed fish 3afemales 3afish farms 3ahosts 3amariculture 3aspawning 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aNorway1 aThorstad, Eva B.1 aUglem, Ingebrigt1 aBjørn, Pål Arne1 aØkland, Finn1 aNæsje, Tor F.1 aDempster, Tim1 aArai, Nobuaki0 tEnvironmental biology of fishes.g2012 Apr., v. 93, no. 4 p.475-481dSpringer-Verlagx0378-19097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-011-9942-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009600175300001800271520175600289592002802045650001902073650001302092650001102105650001202116650001402128650001702142650001702159650001302176650001602189650002002205650001902225650001902244650002002263650002302283650001202306651001302318700002602331700001802357700001902375700002302394700005902417700002002476700002002496773016602516856008202682852000902764655001202773IND60683328120221120105311.0200207e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068332812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-07105-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarooqi, Zia Ur Rahman10aAssessment of noise pollution and its effects on human health in industrial hub of Pakistan  ap. 2819-2828.  aFaisalabad is one of the major industrial cities of Pakistan, which may cause noise pollution to the local residents due to the development of robust industrial and transport systems. This study aimed at (i) mapping the noise pollution levels at various locations of Faisalabad city; (ii) comparing noise pollution levels in the morning, the afternoon, and the evening for each source; and (iii) assessing nonauditory effects of noise on human health. Two industries and 43 famous/busy locations of Faisalabad Sadar were selected to study noise pollution by using the sound level meter for the period of 24 h. A questionnaire-based survey was carried out near the sampling points to get a public perception about the health impacts of noise pollution. The measured equivalent sound pressure levels (SPLeq) were higher than the permissible limits at all the sampling locations during morning, afternoon, and evening hours. The maximum sound pressure level (SPLₘₐₓ) was 102 dB inside the production unit in the afternoon at Mian Muhammad Siddiq Textile Loom industry. The average SPL was found at State Bank road (102 dB), Children’s Hospital (101 dB), Jhang Bazar (100 dB) in the afternoon and at Punjab Medical College in the evening (97 dB). Based on the survey, 94% of respondents reported headache, 76% sleeplessness, 74% hypertension, 74% physiological stress, 64% elevated blood pressure levels, and 60% dizziness due to noise. Noise pollution is higher than the standard limits and causes auditory as well as nonauditory effects on humans. The vehicles and industrial machinery should be maintained, and sound proofing and protection equipment should be provided to the workforce in order to protect them from extreme noise levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3achildren 3acities 3afabrics 3ahospitals 3ahuman health 3ahypertension 3aindustry 3alabor force 3anoise pollution 3apublic opinion 3aquestionnaires 3asleep disorders 3asound level meters 3asurveys 3aPakistan1 aṢābir, Muḥammad,1 aLatif, Junaid1 aZubair, Aslam,1 aAhmad, Hamaad Raza1 aAhmad, Iftikhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8811-12471 aImran, Muhammad1 aIlić, Predrag,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Jan., v. 27, no. 3 p.2819-2828dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07105-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245015800175300001600333520117800349592002801527650001801555650001601573650001701589650001901606650001301625650001701638650001501655650002001670650000901690650001701699650002201716653001401738700002101752700002401773700001901797700001901816773015801835856008601993852000902079655001202088IND60721392520221119083406.0201224e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072139252DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-9149.2016.00023.X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNisar, Nisar Ahmad10aExperimental Studies on Effect of Chlorpyrifos and Lead Acetate on the Activity of Cholinesterase in Wistar Rats: Possible Protective Effect of Vitamin C  ap. 131-137.  aThe present study was designed to evaluate the effects of chlorpyrifos (CPF), lead acetate, vitamin C alone and in combination on the activity of cholinesterase in Wistar rats. Rats of 150–200 g body weight were divided into eight groups of six animals each and were subjected to various treatment regimes for 98 days. Group I served as control receiving corn oil, group II received CPF at 5.5 mg/kg in corn oil, group III received lead acetate at 100 ppm in water, whereas animals in group IV received a combination of CPF at 5.5 mg/kg in corn oil and lead acetate at 100 ppm in water. Group V received vitamin C at 100 mg/kg b.wt in water, group VI received a combination of CPF at 5.5 mg/kg and vitamin C at 100 mg/kg, group VII received lead acetate at 100 ppm in water and vitamin C at 100 mg/kg and group VIII received CPF at 5.5 mg/kg, lead acetate at 100 ppm in water and vitamin C at 100 mg/kg. From the results, it was observed that activities of erythrocyte, plasma and tissue cholinesterase decreased significantly in both CPF and lead-treated rats. Activities of cholinesterases induced by exposure to CPF and lead were mitigated by treatment with vitamin C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abody weight 3achlorpyrifos 3acholinesterase 3acorn oil 3aerythrocytes 3aimmunology 3aimmunopathology 3alead 3alead acetate 3aprotective effect 0aVitamin C1 aSultana, Mudasir1 aPara, Parveez Ahmad1 aGanguly, Subha1 aShowkat, Shabu0 tJournal of immunology and immunopathology.g2016 July, v. 18, no. 2 p.131-137dSociety for Immunology and ImmunopathologywJournal:27363x0973-91497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-9149.2016.00023.X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009300164300001800257500001900275520078100294592002801075650002101103650001101124650001701135650001701152650002101169650000901190650001001199650001901209650002201228650001601250700005801266700006201324700001501386700002401401700006001425700005501485773012101540856008201661852000901743655001201752IND60698055420221117193108.0200608e20200522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069805542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c003622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Soumen10aStabilization of Near-Infrared Fluorescent Proteins by Packaging in Virus-like Particles  ap. 2432-2439.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNear-IR fluorescent Qβ virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced in a high yield by packaging highly red-shifted monomeric and dimeric versions of biliverdin-dependent fluorescent proteins within the capsid shell.

The River Chief System attempts to match water environment management to the performance of the main leaders of the local party and government and represents an institutional innovation to solve the problem of river and lake management in China. However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the performance of the River Chief System and how to promote its overall effectiveness. This paper took Chaohu Lake Basin, with a concentrated and complicated water environment, as the research object and divided it into eastern and western halves. The water ecological security before and after the implementation of the River Chief System was comprehensively evaluated, and the obstacles to ecological security were diagnosed. The implementation effect of the River Chief System and the weak links of the corresponding river chiefs’ work performance were analyzed. The results show the following: (1) Since the implementation of the River Chief System in 2013, the overall water ecological security of Chaohu Lake Basin has been raised from the lower limit to the upper limit of the generally healthy category, initially reflecting the effect of the River Chief System. (2) For the eastern half of the lake, the threat to water ecological security mainly comes from the development of industry. Industrial water use intensity is the primary obstacle to the ecological security of the eastern half of the lake in recent years. (3) For the western half of the lake, the threat to water ecological security mainly comes from the process of urbanization. The wetland area, urban domestic water use intensity, and artificial afforestation area are the main factors hindering the ecological security of the western half of the lake. The above analysis results can be used as the basis for future work to improve the performance of the relevant river chiefs in Chaohu Lake Basin.  aPublisher supplied data  a71871082cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aafforestation 3aindustry 3alakes 3arivers 3aurbanization 3awater management 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aChina1 aZhao, Xiaoyu1 aJiao, Jianling0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2020 Jan., v. 27, no. 3 p.2773-2785dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07241-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245014300215300001600358520101500374592002801389650002601417650002301443650002201466650002601488650002701514650002001541650002201561650002901583650001001612650002301622650002801645650001301673650002301686650003001709650001901739650001501758650001401773650002101787650001501808650001201823650001101835650001401846650000701860650001601867650002301883653001501906653001501921653002201936653002001958653002301978700002302001700002102024700001702045700001902062773017202081856008502253852000902338655001202347IND60623430720221118193102.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062343072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2018.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkongo, Ruth Nyanduko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5557-354110aComparative biocontrol ability of chitinases from bacteria and recombinant chitinases from the thermophilic fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus  ap. 663-671.  aMicrobial chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are known to hydrolyse the chitinous gut epithelium of insects and cell walls of many fungi. In this study, seven chitinases from different bacteria and fungi were produced, characterized and their biocontrol abilities against graminaceous stem borers Eldana saccharina, Chilo partellus and Sesamia calamistis were assessed. All chitinases were stable over broad ranges of pH and temperature, however, recombinant fungal chitinases were more acid-stable than the bacterial counterparts. Chitinases from the thermophilic filamentous fungi Thermomyces lanuginosus SSBP (Chit1) and from Bacillus licheniformis (Chit lic) caused 70% and 80% mortality, respectively, in second instar larvae of E. saccharina. Six of the seven partially-purified microbial chitinases inhibited Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. alliaceus, A. ochraceus, Fusarium verticillioides and Mucor sp. Overall, microbial chitinases show promise as biocontrol agents of fungi and stalk–boring lepidopterans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus alliaceus 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus niger 3aAspergillus ochraceus 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aChilo partellus 3aEldana saccharina 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aMucor 3aSesamia calamistis 3aThermomyces lanuginosus 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aboring insects 3acell walls 3achitinase 3adigestive system 3aepithelium 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amortality 3apH 3atemperature 3athermophilic fungi 0aChitinases 0aBiocontrol 0aEldana saccharina 0aChilo partellus 0aSesamia calamistis1 aPuri, Adarsh Kumar1 aWang, Zhengxiang1 aSingh, Suren1 aPermaul, Kugen0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2019 June, v. 127, no. 6 p.663-671dElsevier B.V.aThe Society for Biotechnology, JapanwJournal:jnl3929975x1389-17237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2018.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005200153245011700205300002000322500001900342520146700361592002801828650001501856650002301871650001101894650001301905650001901918650001601937650001601953650002501969700001601994700001602010700001602026700001302042700001602055773012202071856008702193852000902280655001202289IND60718095920221119093805.0201119e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071809592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c025812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFei, Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1800-890014aThe Phase Change Characteristics of Capric Acid-based Binary Low Eutectic Mixtures Adsorbed in Expanded Graphite  ap. 14893-14901.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCapric acid-hexadecanol (CA-H) and capric acid-paraffin section (CA-PS) composite phase change materials were prepared by a melting–blending method, and two new composite phase change energy storage materials based on expanded graphite were obtained by the physical adsorption method. The results showed that the optimum mass ratio of CA-H and CA-PS were 74:26 and 81:19, respectively. It was found via FT-IR that CA, H, and PS acted together by molecular force without chemical reaction. The phase transition temperature of CA-H and CA-PS was 24.22 and 26.99 °C, respectively, and the latent heat of phase transition was 190.5 and 153.7 J/g, respectively. On the other hand, the best mass ratio of CA-H/EG and CA-PS/EG was 11:1 and 7:1, respectively. On the basis of SEM and FT-IR results, it was found that CA-H and CA-PS were uniformly distributed in the pores of EG by physical action; the melting and freezing temperatures are in the range of 21∼28 °C, and the latent heat was in the range of 133∼178 J/g by DSC. CA-H/EG and CA-PS/EG had good thermal and chemical stability after 1000 accelerated melting–freezing cycling tests. According to the TG and thermal storage experiments, CA-H/EG and CA-PS/EG had excellent heat resistance, and the high thermal conductivity of EG promoted the thermal storage and release rate of CA-H and CA-PS. Therefore, CA-H/EG and CA-PS/EG can be used as candidate materials in the fields of building energy savings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical reactions 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat tolerance 3alatent heat 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity1 aDu, Wenqing1 aGu, Qingjun1 aWang, Linya1 aHe, Qian1 aPan, Yuchen0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 34, no. 11 p.14893-14901dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c025813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245009100179300001600270520143600286592002801722650001801750650001101768650001401779650001901793650001001812650001201822650003101834650001101865650001401876650001401890650000901904773009601913856007702009852000902086655001202095IND50073466820221121170422.0170718e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007346682DNAL7 a245776532pmid7 a10.1007/s0044200005952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoks, Robby10aFood stress and predator-induced stress shape developmental performance in a damselfly  ap. 222-229.  aI studied effects of stress factors like food shortage, non-lethal predator presence and autotomy on survival and larval performance (growth rate, development rate and developmental stability) of larvae of the damselfly Lestes sponsa. In a laboratory experiment, larvae were raised during their last two instars at two food levels (high or low) crossed with two levels of autotomy (caudal lamellae present or absent). These treatments were nested within three levels of predation risk (Aeshna cyanea absent, Chironomus-fed caged Aeshna or Lestes-fed caged Aeshna). The diet of the predator had no effects. The low food level and the presence of Aeshna independently increased mortality rates of L. sponsa larvae. The low food level, presence of a caged Aeshna and autotomy all independently reduced growth rate (mass and body size at day 40) and wing size at emergence, and the first two stress factors also reduced development rate. Regardless of predator presence and autotomy, all damselfly larvae consumed the food available. This indicated that the predator-induced stress effects were not due to reduced food uptake, but probably reflected lowered assimilation efficiency and/or a higher metabolic rate. Besides a low food level, the presence of caged Aeshna predator larvae and autotomy also increased hind wing asymmetry. This result demonstrated that predator-induced stress may reduce developmental stability in the prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeshna cyanea 3aLestes 3abody size 3afood shortages 3afoods 3ainstars 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3amortality 3apredation 3arisk0 tOecologia.g2001 Apr., v. 127, no. 2 p.222-229dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0044200005953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013600163300001600299520142300315592002801738650001801766650001201784650001801796650002201814650002201836650001701858650001101875650001701886650003101903650002401934650001001958650003501968650002202003650001802025650001302043650001902056650001702075650001302092650001602105650002202121650001902143650002102162650001002183650001202193650002902205650001802234650001702252700002002269700001502289700001902304700002002323700001902343700002102362700002002383773012802403856008202531852000902613655001202622IND60591341420221120101534.0181018e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059134142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-017-1241-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWi, Jiwoong12aA nuclear fucosyltransferase-like protein, PtFUT, from marine red alga Pyropia tenera (Rhodophyta) confers osmotic stress tolerance  ap. 717-727.  aPyropia tenera is a marine red alga that grows in the intertidal zone and may lose more than 90% of its water during twice-daily low tides. Based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified from the desiccation transcriptome of P. tenera gametophyte, a complementary DNA was isolated that upregulated strongly under desiccation stress and encoded a polypeptide of 591-amino acid residues showing a sequence homology with α-1,2-fucosyltransferase, named PtFUT. Fucosyltransferases transfer an L-fucose residue to various acceptor molecules, but information of their activity in the red algae is limited. PtFUT showed upregulation in transcription in gametophytes of P. tenera under desiccation and osmotic stress conditions induced by mannitol. Transcription of the PtFUT gene was also increased by abscisic acid as well as H₂O₂ treatment. The presence of a signal peptide for nucleus localization and fluorescence of the PtFUT-GFP fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts indicated that PtFUT is located in the nucleus. When PtFUT was overexpressed in Chlamydomonas, the PtFUT improved the growth of transgenic cells under osmotic stress. These results suggest that PtFUT may play a role in tolerance to desiccation stress and provide insights into the molecular functions of the fucosyltransferases and understanding the desiccation tolerance mechanisms in marine red algae growing in intertidal zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas 3aPyropia 3aabscisic acid 3acomplementary DNA 3adrought tolerance 3afluorescence 3afucose 3agametophytes 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alittoral zone 3amannitol 3aosmotic stress 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3aprotoplasts 3asequence homology 3asignal peptide 3astress tolerance 3atides 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atransferases1 aJung, Hyun Shin1 aIm, Sungoh1 aYang, Sungwhan1 aPark, Eun-Jeong1 aHwang, Mi Sook1 aJeong, Won-Joong1 aChoi, Dong-Woog0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2018 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.717-727dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-017-1241-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005300172300001600225520060100241592002800842650001600870650001300886650001500899650002200914650002800936650000900964651001000973653001500983653002800998653000901026653001101035653002301046773011701069856008501186852000901271655001201280IND60536994220221117050718.0160807e20160703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053699422DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2016.11790112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikary, Nripal10aVernacular architecture in post-earthquake Nepal  ap. 533-540.  aThe paper considers the problem of maintaining structural integrity of buildings in an earthquake-prone region, Nepal, when the use of seismic bands made from hard wood has been abandoned because of government policy on forestry and a preference for modern materials in construction.

Biochar was produced under a standard set of conditions; including 550 °C higher heating temperature (HHT), 7 °C/min heating rate, atmospheric pressure, and 40 min residence time. Analysis of the experimental results complimented with literature data showed that calculating biochar yields based on a conservation of the ash method was a valid approach to estimating solid yields in cases where gravimetry is difficult or inconvenient. Increasing the proportion of feedstock ash is observed to increase the biochar yield semilinearly, with the greatest deviation from this observation in low-ash feedstocks. The developed empirical correlation is provided here. When considering highly diverse feedstocks of varying origins, including extensive literature data, the dominating influence of feedstock ash content on the biochar produced is clearly observed in this work. A second-order polynomial relationship between the starting feedstock ash and final biochar ash content was observed, even when including literature results for biochar obtained under widely varied experimental programs. This result suggests a dependency between the amount of the organic material removed from a feedstock and the amount of feedstock ash initially present. This dependency appears to overshadow expected reliance on the heating rate or HHT (within the range of 1–15 °C/min and 450–800 °C respectively). Empirical correlations have been developed and verified and will be of use to the ones doing greenhouse gas, mass and energy balances, or business case modeling for slow-pyrolysis processes utilizing a range of feedstocks, particularly in the case of high-ash and waste-derived sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3aatmospheric pressure 3abiochar 3abiomass 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3agravimetry 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aDownie, Adriana.

In chickens, UVA light is visible and may facilitate flock interactions. UVB wavelengths promote endogenous vitamin D synthesis, which could support the rapid skeletal development of broiler chickens. The aim of the study was to investigate the impacts of Ultraviolet wavelengths (UV) on welfare indicators in broiler chickens.Day-old Ross 308 birds reared under commercially representative conditions were randomly assigned to one of three lighting treatments: A) White Light Emitting Diode (LED) and supplementary UVA LED lighting (18-hour photoperiod); B) White LED with supplementary UVA and UVB fluorescent lighting providing 30 micro watts/cm2 UVB at bird level (on for 8 h of the total photoperiod to avoid over-exposure of UVB); C) White LED control group, representative of farm conditions (18-hour photoperiod).Welfare indicators measured were; feather condition (day 24, n = 546), tonic immobility duration (day 29, n = 302), and gait quality, using the Bristol Gait Score (day 31, n = 293). Feather condition was improved in male broilers in the UVA treatment (A), compared to the control treatment (C). Birds in the UVA treatment had shorter tonic immobility durations compared to the control treatment (C), suggesting lower fearfulness. Broilers reared in UVA (A) and UVA + UVB (B) had better Bristol Gait Scores compared to the control (C).Together these results suggest UV may be beneficial for broiler chicken welfare. While treatment A and B both provided UVA, the improvements in welfare indicators were not consistent, which may be due to exposure time-dependent beneficial effects of UVA.The modification of commercial lighting regimes to incorporate UVA wavelengths for indoor-reared broiler chickens would be an achievable change with significant positive impacts on bird welfare.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal welfare 3abroiler chickens 3afarms 3afearfulness 3aflocks 3afluorescent lighting 3agait 3alight emitting diodes 3amales 3aparalysis 3aphotoperiod 3arearing 3askeletal development 3aultraviolet radiation 3avitamin D 3awavelengths 3awhite light 0aBroiler chicken 0aPoultry welfare 0aHusbandry 0aLighting 0aUltraviolet light1 aAsher, Lucy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9729-78561 aHerborn, Katherine1 aWiseman, J.q(Julian),0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2018 Dec., v. 209 p.55-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2018.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03925naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245014900211300001600360520264800376592002803024650001803052650001203070650001703082650001103099650001903110650001603129650002503145650001703170650001403187650001903201650001603220700002103236700001803257700002103275773015103296856008303447852000903530655001203539IND60740149920221119020628.0220105e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074014992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-021-01878-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattinzioli, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4679-745X12aA parametric study on the impact of open-source inventory variability and uncertainty for the life cycle assessment of road bituminous pavements  ap. 916-935.  aPURPOSE: Current asphalt pavement life cycle assessment implementation limitations are in part linked to data availability. On top of this, there is currently a trend towards the creation of open-source accessible data for pavement LCA. Therefore, the objective of this study is to undertake a comprehensive assessment of open-source data for the “cradle-to-laid” LCA of asphalt pavements to better understand its potential risks. METHODS: This study assesses the variability and uncertainty associated with open-access life cycle inventory data, collated from multiple open-source case study scenario results, project reports and inventories in order to assess its reliability. Six impact categories were considered. The collected data was applied to three different case study scenarios for a pavement surface course, which include a conventional hot-mix, a half-warm mixture and a half-warm mixture with 50% reclaimed asphalt pavement. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results of this study indicated the variabilities and uncertainties found at both the process level and those propagated to the final LCA results. The results found that fine aggregate production, truck transportation and construction machinery were the most troublesome processes for LCA uncertainty, given their large variability and low impact on the final LCA results. Meanwhile, the binders and cement production and plant operations, being the largest contributors to the environmental impacts (33, 23, 32% average, respectively), also provided large result uncertainties (12, 31, 21% average, respectively) across all impact categories for the cradle-to-laid assessment. Overall, total acidification potential and particulate matter formation potential were the two impact categories most likely to increase due to source variabilities (483.0 and 335.3%, respectively), whilst eutrophication potential was the most likely to decrease (61.7%) for the case studies assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work show that open source data could be used for the LCA of asphalt mixtures and pavements. Nonetheless, justified data sources should be used and users must be aware of the potential uncertainty areas within the system, where this paper has aimed to contribute to the identification and understanding of these uncertainties in order for users minimise them in their work and help identify targets for LCI development. Future work should address the variabilities between open-source and commercial tools, the exploration of the use, maintenance and end-of-life stages and the better quantification of binder, RAP and low-temperature manufacturing processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abitumen 3acase studies 3acement 3aeutrophication 3ainventories 3alife cycle inventory 3aparticulates 3apavements 3atransportation 3auncertainty1 aSol-Sánchez, M.1 aMartinez, G.,1 aRubio-Gámez, M.0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2021 May, v. 26, no. 5 p.916-935dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000330x0948-33497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-021-01878-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100005100159245008700210300001400297520122300311592002801534650001701562650001101579650001501590650002301605650003801628650002101666650004101687650001901728650001101747650003301758650002201791653002001813653002101833653002001854653002101874653001301895700005501908700001101963773011101974856009402085852000902179655001202188IND60633311620221121222452.0190606e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063331162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0553-861110aPreparation and properties of benzoxazine blends with intumescent flame retardancy  ap. 15-24.  aA benzoxazine containing both alkynyl and aldehyde groups (PHB-apa) was used to modify typical diamine type benzoxazine (PH-ddm) with different ratios to get good flame retardancy. The effects of PHB-apa on curing reaction behavior, heat resistance and thermal stability of the copolymers of PHB-apa and PH-ddm, poly(PH/PHB)s, were analyzed by DSC, DMA and TGA, respectively. The flame retardancy of poly(PH/PHB)s was investigated by vertical combustion test, limiting oxygen index (LOI) and cone calorimeter. The results suggested that the flame retardancy of PH-ddm was greatly improved by adding a small amount of PHB-apa. When the addition amount of PHB-apa was only 1:12 (the molar ratio of PHB-apa to PH-ddm), the LOI value of poly(PH/PHB-12) was as high as 33.8 and UL-94 test was improved from V-1 to V-0 rating. Moreover, the structures and morphologies of the residual carbons of poly(PH-ddm) and poly(PH/PHB) after combustion were studied by SEM. It was found that the pores in carbon layer of poly(PH/PHB) were dense and homogeneous. Furthermore, the pyrolytic volatile products of poly(PH-ddm) and poly(PH/PHB) were analyzed by TGA-IR and Py-GC/MS to discuss the degradation and flame retardant mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimeters 3acarbon 3acombustion 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aflame retardants 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheat tolerance 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermal stability 0aPolybenzoxazine 0aFlame retardancy 0aHeat resistance 0aCone calorimeter 0aPy-GC/MS1 aRan, Qichao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3897-53781 aGu, Yi0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2019 May, v. 163 p.15-24dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245014000179300001600319520129000335592002801625650003701653650001801690650001701708650001901725650001101744650001901755650002201774650001901796650001801815650002501833650001401858650002101872650001601893653001501909653001401924653002201938653001801960653002101978700003501999700005602034773010602090856008602196852000902282655001202291IND60597456820221119071603.0180624e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059745682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.04.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Seyedeh Zahra10aEmphasizing the role of surface chemistry on hydrophobicity and cell adhesion behavior of polydimethylsiloxane/TiO2 nanocomposite films  ap. 492-498.  aImproving the bioinertness of materials is of great importance for developing biomedical devices that contact human tissues. The main goal of this study was to establish correlations among surface morphology, roughness and chemistry with hydrophobicity and cell adhesion in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanocomposites loaded with titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles. Firstly, wettability results showed that the nanocomposite loaded with 30 wt.% of TiO2 exhibited a superhydrophobic behavior; however, the morphology and roughness analysis proved that there was no discernible difference between the surface structures of samples loaded with 20 and 30 wt.% of nanoparticles. Both cell culture and MTT assay experiments showed that, despite the similarity between the surface structures, the sample loaded with 30 wt.% nanoparticles exhibits the greatest reduction in the cell viability (80%) as compared with the pure PDMS film. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, the remarkable reduction in cell viability of the superhydrophobic sample could be majorly attributed to the role of surface chemistry. The obtained results emphasize the importance of adjusting the surface properties especially surface chemistry to gain the optimum cell adhesion behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acell adhesion 3acell culture 3acell viability 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amedical equipment 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3aroughness 3atitanium dioxide 3awettability 0aMorphology 0aRoughness 0aSurface chemistry 0aCell adhesion 0aSuperhydrophobic1 aTabatabaei-Panah, Pardis-Sadat1 aSeyfi, Javad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1783-50740 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 July 01, v. 167 p.492-498dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.04.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245010900185300001800294520117400312592002801486650002501514650002801539650001301567650001201580650001201592650001401604650001901618650001701637650001701654650001001671650001701681650001801698650001301716650002901729650002601758650001801784650001101802650001301813650003001826650003101856650003001887650002501917653002401942653003301966653001601999653001802015653004202033700001502075700001502090700001402105700001902119700003002138700002102168773008402189856008402273852000902357655001202366IND60088401620221117100106.0160901e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008840162DNAL7 a239419822pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fang10aFatty acids production from hydrogen and carbon dioxide by mixed culture in the membrane biofilm reactor  ap. 6122-6129.  aGasification of waste to syngas (H2/CO2) is seen as a promising route to a circular economy. Biological conversion of the gaseous compounds into a liquid fuel or chemical, preferably medium chain fatty acids (caproate and caprylate) is an attractive concept. This study for the first time demonstrated in-situ production of medium chain fatty acids from H2 and CO2 in a hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor by mixed microbial culture. The hydrogen was for 100% utilized within the biofilms attached on the outer surface of the hollow-fiber membrane. The obtained concentrations of acetate, butyrate, caproate and caprylate were 7.4, 1.8, 0.98 and 0.42 g/L, respectively. The biomass specific production rate of caproate (31.4 mmol-C/(L day g-biomass)) was similar to literature reports for suspended cell cultures while for caprylate the rate (19.1 mmol-C/(L day g-biomass)) was more than 6 times higher. Microbial community analysis showed the biofilms were dominated by Clostridium spp., such as Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium kluyveri. This study demonstrates a potential technology for syngas fermentation in the hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium kluyveri 3aClostridium ljungdahlii 3aacetates 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3abutyrates 3acarbon dioxide 3acell culture 3afermentation 3afuels 3agasification 3ahexanoic acid 3ahydrogen 3amedium chain fatty acids 3amicrobial communities 3amixed culture 3awastes 2aBiofilms 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 0aSyngas fermentation 0aIn-situ hydrogen utilization 0aFatty acids 0aMixed culture 0aHollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor1 aDing, Jing1 aZhang, Yan1 aChen, Man1 aDing, Zhao-Wei1 avan Loosdrecht, Mark C.M.1 aZeng, Raymond J.0 tWater research.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 47 p.6122-6129dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007900166300001800245500001900263520113400282592002801416650002001444650001501464650001701479650001601496650001701512650002401529650001801553650002301571650002201594650001301616650001901629650001301648700002001661700002301681700002901704700001801733700002001751700002401771700006001795773012101855856008201976852000902058655001202067IND60698055820221117193748.0200608e20200508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069805582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c004422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanakci, Mine10aTargeting CD4⁺ Cells with Anti-CD4 Conjugated Mertansine-Loaded Nanogels  ap. 2473-2481.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCD4⁺ T lymphocytes play an important role in controlling many malignancies. The modulation of CD4⁺ T cells through immunomodulatory or cytotoxic drugs could change the course of disease progression for disorders such as autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and cancer. Here, we demonstrate that anti-CD4 conjugated polymeric nanogels can deliver a small molecule cargo to primary CD4⁺ T cells and a CD4ʰⁱᵍʰ T cell lymphoma. The antibody conjugation not only increased the uptake efficiency of the nanogel (NG) by CD4⁺ T cells but also decreased the non-specific uptake of the NG by CD4– lymphocytes. For T lymphoma cell lines, the mertansine-loaded conjugate displayed a dose-dependent cell growth inhibition at 17 ng/mL antibody concentration. On the other hand, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-type formulation of the anti-CD4 reached similar levels of cell growth inhibition only at the significantly higher concentration of 1.8 μg/mL. NG and antibody conjugates have the advantage of carrying a large payload to a defined target in a more efficient manner as it needs far less antibody to achieve a similar outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-cell lymphoma 3aantibodies 3aautoimmunity 3acell growth 3acytotoxicity 3adisease progression 3adose response 3agrowth retardation 3aimmunosuppression 3ananogels 3aneoplasm cells 3apolymers1 aSingh, Khushboo1 aMunkhbat, Oyuntuya1 aShanthalingam, Sudarvili1 aMitra, Ankita1 aGordon, Mallory1 aOsborne, Barbara A.1 aThayumanavan, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6475-67260 tBiomacromolecules.g2020 May 08, v. 21, no. 6 p.2473-2481dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c004423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010900165300001600274520088800290592002801178650001201206650001001218650001501228653003701243653002001280653001701300653001501317653001501332700001701347700001701364700001901381700001701400700001601417773011401433856008401547852000901631655001201640IND60623606220221122034202.0181207e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062360622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Minkai10aChanges in visual interaction: Viewing a Japanese garden directly, through glass or as a projected image  ap. 116-121.  aThis is a pilot study that examines how a person's gaze responds during the observation of a Japanese garden. Thirty-four participants were asked to viewed the same garden in three different ways: directly, through a pane of glass, or as a projected slide. We tracked their eye-movement during the first minutes of observation to observe different gaze strategies used in the different modalities of viewing. Our measurements show that when viewing the garden directly, participants focused on particular elements in their visual field. By contrast, when they viewed a slide they tended to scan the scene more and focus on all elements of the garden evenly. When viewing the real garden through a glass door, the responses were intermediate. Our results demonstrate that the visual evaluation of a space is different depending on the way in which the visual information is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3agardens 3aglass 3apsychology 0aVisual cognitive characteristics 0aJapanese garden 0aEye-movement 0aPhotograph 0aAssessment1 aHerrup, Karl1 aShi, Bertram1 aHamano, Yutaka1 aLiu, Concong1 aGoto, Seiko0 tJournal of environmental psychology.g2018 Dec., v. 60 p.116-121dElsevier LtdwJournal:3314x0272-49447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2018.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03963naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245023000195300001400425520194900439592002802388650001802416650001202434650001202446650001002458650001302468650002302481650002502504650001302529650002802542650000902570650002402579650001802603650001902621650000902640650002702649650003002676650001202706650001602718650002302734650002802757650003002785650003602815650003002851650003602881650002402917650002402941700002002965700002102985700001703006700002603023700002303049700002303072700002303095700002903118773008503147856008403232852000903316655001203325IND60087022220221119043432.0141102e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008702222DNAL7 a216203292pmid7 a10.1016/j.margen.2011.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogiatzi, Emmanouella10aIn silico mining and characterization of simple sequence repeats from gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) expressed sequence tags (EST-SSRs); PCR amplification, polymorphism evaluation and multiplexing and cross-species assays  ap. 83-91.  aWe screened for simple sequence repeats (SSRs) found in ESTs derived from an EST-database development project (‘Marine Genomics Europe’ Network of Excellence). Different motifs of di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide SSRs were evaluated for variation in length and position in the expressed sequences, relative abundance and distribution in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). We found 899 ESTs that harbor 997 SSRs (4.94%). On average, one SSR was found per 2.95kb of EST sequence and the dinucleotide SSRs are the most abundant accounting for 47.6% of the total number. EST-SSRs were used as template for primer design. 664 primer pairs could be successfully identified and a subset of 206 pairs of primers was synthesized, PCR-tested and visualized on ethidium bromide stained agarose gels. The main objective was to further assess the potential of EST-SSRs as informative markers and investigate their cross-species amplification in sixteen teleost fish species: seven sparid species and nine other species from different families. Approximately 78% of the primer pairs gave PCR products of expected size in gilthead sea bream, and as expected, the rate of successful amplification of sea bream EST-SSRs was higher in sparids, lower in other perciforms and even lower in species of the Clupeiform and Gadiform orders. We finally determined the polymorphism and the heterozygosity of 63 markers in a wild gilthead sea bream population; fifty-eight loci were found to be polymorphic with the expected heterozygosity and the number of alleles ranging from 0.089 to 0.946 and from 2 to 27, respectively. These tools and markers are expected to enhance the available genetic linkage map in gilthead sea bream, to assist comparative mapping and genome analyses for this species and further with other model fish species and finally to help advance genetic analysis for cultivated and wild populations and accelerate breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparus aurata 3aagarose 3aalleles 3abream 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3adevelopment projects 3aethidium 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agels 3agenetic improvement 3agenome mining 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aDNA Primers 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aMinisatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aSea Breamxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity1 aLagnel, Jacques1 aPakaki, Victoria1 aLouro, Bruno1 aV.M.

The Melamchi area is in the northeastern part of Kathmandu from where the Melamchi River is considered as a major source of drinking water for the people of Kathmandu city. This paper examines the characteristics of natural springs in terms of their distribution, discharge, water utilization and conservation in the context of climate change. Out of the total surveyed springs of the Melamchi area, 93% are permanent and two-thirds of the total springs are located in mid-elevation (1500–2500 m). One-fourth of the total springs are small in terms of discharge and are used for multiple purposes such as drinking, livestock, irrigation and household cleaning. Around 45% of the springs provide a source of drinking water for up to five households. Our work has shown that the water volume in about 30% of the springs has decreased over the last decade. The springs located in mid-elevation with discharge less than 5 liters per minute are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities. The 2015 Nepal earthquake had a huge and immediate impact on the water volume of the springs in our study with an immediate drying effect in about 18% of the springs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3adrying 3aearthquakes 3ahousehold cleaning 3ahouseholds 3airrigation 3alivestock 3alivestock feeding 3arivers 3awater utilization 3aHimalayan region 3aNepal1 aGhimire, Motilal1 aShrestha, Shova0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2019 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.263-280dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-017-0036-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017500165300001600340520169600356592002802052650001602080650001802096650001902114650001202133650002102145650003002166650001202196650002302208650001202231650001102243650001002254650001702264650004402281650001802325650001502343653002802358653001902386653001202405653001202417653001702429700001902446700002102465773008802486856008502574852000902659655001202668IND60551227620221119105553.0161018e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055122762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yong10aModified sham feeding of foods with different macronutrient compositions differentially influences cephalic change of insulin, ghrelin, and NMR-based metabolomic profiles  ap. 135-142.  aLittle is known about the effect of the macronutrient composition of foods on cephalic phase response of gastrointestinal hormones. In addition, the metabolomics of cephalic phase response has not been studied before. The objective of the present study was to assess cephalic phase endocrinological and metabolomic responses following modified sham feeding (MSF) of foods with different macronutrient compositions. Ten healthy males attended four separate test sessions after overnight fasting, for a 3-min MSF of water, high-fat, high-carbohydrate or high-protein food, respectively, in a randomized order. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at regular time points for 10min following the completion of MSF and assayed for plasma glucose, insulin, ghrelin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance was used to acquire metabolomic profiles of the plasma samples. Plasma glucose increased after MSF of all test foods, but there were no differences due to the macronutrient composition of the test foods. MSF of the high-carbohydrate food elicited significantly higher insulin, and the high-protein food resulted in higher ghrelin compared to other test sessions. No significant change in glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide was found. Analysis of plasma metabolomic profiles revealed concentrations of lipids were lower after MSF while plasma glucose increased after MSF. There was also a macronutrient-dependent change in certain amino acids. In conclusion, short-term oral exposure to foods with different macronutrient compositions can induce a macronutrient-specific cephalic change in insulin and ghrelin, as well as metabolomic profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3ablood glucose 3ablood sampling 3afasting 3afood composition 3agastrointestinal hormones 3aghrelin 3ahigh protein foods 3ainsulin 3alipids 3amales 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoral exposure 3atest meals 0aCephalic phase response 0aMacronutrients 0aInsulin 0aGhrelin 0aMetabolomics1 aHsu, Walter H.1 aHollis, James H.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Aug., v. 135 p.135-142dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03738naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013200172300001600304520202700320592002802347650001702375650002202392650003102414650001902445650003002464650002802494650001702522650001002539650002002549650001702569650002402586650001602610650001302626650002102639650001302660650001502673650001502688650001602703650001302719650002002732651001202752653001602764653001302780653001502793700002302808700002002831700002402851700002102875700001902896773016402915856008403079852000903163655001203172IND60594437920221118081006.0180514e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059443792DNAL7 a10.25225/fozo.v62.i4.a4.20132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadović, Andreja14aThe influence of land abandonment on farmland bird communities: a case study from a floodplain landscape in Continental Croatia  ap. 269-281.  aThe abandonment of less productive agricultural land and the intensification of agricultural land use are the main features of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that Croatia will enforce now as new member of the EU. Due to demographic changes and the economic transition in Croatia resulting from war in the 1990s, substantial tracts of agricultural land were abandoned. We investigated two habitat types in the protected floodplain landscape of Lonjsko polje in the continental part of the country: arable land and pastures. Both habitats were maintained by agricultural management and suffered from partial abandonment. Land abandonment increased the susceptibility to encroachment by the invasive plant species Amorpha fruticosa. Data on bird communities were obtained during the breeding season in 2010 while there were high water levels in the floodplain. Data were collected from 63 points, and a total of 1447 individuals from 70 species were recorded during the study. We found that the bird community structure was primarily related to the presence/abandonment of agricultural land use and the habitat type. Further, we detected that the bird community structure in the same habitat type differed by management intensity. Open habitat specialists were most influenced by land abandonment. However, the conservation value (according to the Species of European Conservation Concern value, SPEC) of grazed pastures and abandoned pastures did not differ significantly, in part because the overgrown pastures with high water levels were found to be suitable for Acrocephalus species. The shift in bird community structure between abandoned and managed arable lands were smaller than those detected in the pastoral communities. Because land abandonment is a widespread phenomenon in Croatia, we emphasize the urgent need for a nationwide monitoring program for farmland birds to register the resulting changes in farmland bird communities and to develop appropriate agri-environment measures to mitigate the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocephalus 3aAmorpha fruticosa 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aabandoned land 3aagri-environmental policy 3aagricultural management 3aarable soils 3abirds 3abreeding season 3acase studies 3acommunity structure 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3apastoralism 3apastures 3aplants (botany) 3aCroatia 0aagriculture 0ainvasion 0amanagement1 aNikolov, Stoyan C.1 aTepić, Nataša1 aMikulić, Krešimir1 aJelaska, Sven D.1 aBudinski, Ivan0 tFolia zoologica.g2013 Dec., v. 62, no. 4 p.269-281dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.v62.i4.a4.20133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02026naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245009700213300001800310500001500328520062700343592002800970650002500998650001901023650001801042650001301060650002401073650002801097653002401125700001901149700001601168700002301184700002001207700002301227700001901250700001901269700002501288700002401313773011701337856008201454990002301536852000901559655001201568IND60090914820221120203902.0141102e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009091482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.04.1262doi7 aPMC31155182pmcid7 a216412182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, Larryn W.10aSynthesis, transport and antiviral activity of Ala–Ser and Val–Ser prodrugs of cidofovir  ap. 4045-4049.  a2019-12-06  aWe report the synthesis and biological evaluation of Ala–(Val–)l-Ser–CO₂R prodrugs of 1, where a dipeptide promoiety is conjugated to the P(OH)₂ group of cidofovir (1) via esterification by the Ser side chain hydroxyl group and an ethyl group (4 and 5) or alone (6 and 7).

Here we employ a comparative evolutionary analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from two closely related species of marine fishes (genus Sebastes — rockfish). Sebastes is a highly diverse group of marine fishes that inhabit a wide array of marine habitats and the study of this group can provide insights into speciation in the marine environment. ESTs were developed for S. caurinus (23,668 from brain, kidney, and spleen tissues) and S. rastrelliger (11,207 from brain and pituitary tissues). Following assembly we were able to identify, with high confidence, 257 orthologous sequence pairs between the two species through a reciprocal best hit blast search. An analysis of functional divergence between orthologs revealed that 19.46% had Ka/Ks values greater than 0.5 and 8.17% had Ka/Ks values greater than one, identifying a large pool of candidate genes to further study adaptive divergence in the group. Genes with elevated Ka/Ks values belonged to the following functional categories: immune function, metabolism, longevity, and reproductive behavior, indicating that adaptive divergence in these functional groups may be important in the diversification of this group of fishes. This study provides the ground work to better understand the molecular evolution of genes involved in a radiation of marine fishes.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarine fish 3ametabolism 3atranscriptomics 3alongevity 3aadaptive radiation 3aSebastes caurinus 3amarine environment 3abrain 3areproductive behavior 3aexpressed sequence tags 3adivergent evolution 3arockfish 3aspleen 3akidneys 3ahabitats 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aComputational Biology 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aFishesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenesxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment 2aSpecies Specificity 0agenes1 aKoop, Benjamin F.,1 aAguilar, Andres0 tMarine genomics.g2011 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.93-98dElsevier B.V.x1874-77877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010900159300002000268520141200288592002801700650001101728650001101739650002101750650001701771650000901788650001201797700001601809700001301825700001401838700001401852700001901866700001901885700001601904700001601920773014401936856007402080852000902154655001202163IND60655187920221120025545.0190731e20190730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065518792DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta05503g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Rensheng12aA new reflowing strategy based on lithiophilic substrates towards smooth and stable lithium metal anodes  ap. 18126-18134.  aIn this work, we propose a facile, efficient and novel reflowing strategy to smooth the surface and decrease the interfacial resistance of lithium metal pre-deposited on a lithiophilic substrate, leading to a stable lithium metal anode with high electrochemical performance. First, on the basis of lithiophilic modification of a Cu substrate with a Au sputtering layer, the Li metal nucleation overpotential on the substrate is decreased, thus favoring uniform Li nucleation and growth. Second, owing to morphology reshaping by the reflowing treatment, the surface of the lithium metal anode could be further smoothed, and the interfacial resistance could also be reduced due to the modified solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film after the reflowing treatment. Therefore, a novel reflowing-treated Li/Au/Cu (RF-Li/Au/Cu) anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Through galvanostatic measurements, stable cycling of the symmetric cells with the RF-Li/Au/Cu electrode for more than 1600 h and nearly 900 h is achieved at 0.5 mA cm⁻² and 1 mA cm⁻² with a capacity of 1 mA h cm⁻², respectively. In addition, LiFePO₄ cells with the RF-Li/Au/Cu anode show better rate performance and longer cycling life compared with those with an untreated Li/Au/Cu anode. This work provides a new concept and facile approach for developing stable Li metal anodes with high electrochemical performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3agold 3alithium1 aGe, Yuqiang1 aWang, Bo1 aLv, Qiang1 aWang, Fei1 aRuan, Tingting1 aWang, Dianlong1 aDou, Shixue1 aLiu, Huakun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 July 30, v. 7, no. 30 p.18126-18134dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta05503g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014500167520230300312592002802615650002302643650002002666650001202686650001402698650001602712650000702728650002102735650001402756650001102770650000902781650001302790650001502803650001002818653002602828653002202854653003002876653002702906653002902933700001202962700001602974700001702990700001703007700001403024700001703038700001703055700001503072700001603087700001903103773008703122856008503209852000903294655001203303IND60770803620221119042335.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077080362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1061832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Lezhang10aRiver morphology redistributes potentially toxic elements in acid mine drainage-impacted river sediments: Evidence, causes, and implications  aRiver morphology plays a vital role in the transport of substance within them. However, our understanding of how natural and artificial morphologies redistribute different potentially toxic elements in acid mine drainage (AMD)-contaminated rivers remains poor. In this study, we linked morphological river features and physicochemical sediment characteristics to trace the redistribution of various potentially toxic elements and elucidate their implications for remediating rivers prone to AMD pollution. A dense network of sediment/soil samples was collected from different river morphological units, such as channels, dam reservoirs, pools, floodplain sandbars and wetlands in an AMD-impacted river. The analyses showed that the contaminant levels in channel generally decreased downstream from the headwater mine site, however, local fluctuations in certain areas were observed due to the trapping effect of various dams along the river. The As and Pb concentrations were higher at floodplain sandbars, while river channels exhibited higher Cd and Zn contamination. The concentrations and geochemical fractions of As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in sediment/soil cores from sandbar and river channel also varied. Additionally, structural equation modeling analysis indicated that spatial variations in contaminant distributions were directly affected by physicochemical properties (such as the soil/sediment Fe, Zn, and S concentrations, and pH), which are indirectly affected by river morphology. The diverse morphology of the river redistributed AMD-derived contaminants and could be used to identify contamination hotspots. Our analyses suggested that the feasibility and efficiency of previously proposed countermeasures varied for contaminants in different geomorphological units. In river channels, As uptake from sediments by aquatic plants may be less efficient than Cd, Cu, and Zn uptake due to its lower bioavailability. Moreover, vegetation prevented contaminant enriched soil particle erosion more than it aided in the phytoremediation of As- and Pb-contaminated sandbars. Thus the finding of this study provide a theoretical foundation for further studies on the transport and storage of AMD-derived contaminants in similar rivers, along with the development of targeted remediation methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3abioavailability 3acatenas 3aequations 3afloodplains 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3apollution 3arivers 3asoil 3atoxicity 3avegetation 3awater 0aHeavy metal/metalloid 0aRiver remediation 0aStructural equation model 0aContamination hotspots 0aEnvironmental management1 aLiu, Yu1 aCai, Dafeng1 aLi, Fangqing1 aLuo, Dinggui1 aLi, Cheng1 aXu, Guoliang1 aXiao, Tangfu1 aWu, Qihang1 aHe, Huixian1 aRouth, Joyanto0 tCatena.g2022 July, v. 214 p.106183-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1061833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245011500211300001800326506007600344520107800420592002801498506003701526650003601563650001401599650002501613650001301638650002001651650002101671650001001692650001801702650001401720650003001734650001101764650002201775650001601797650002001813653001501833653002201848653002901870653002601899653004401925700002601969700006201995700002302057773014702080856008002227852000902307655001202316IND60646498920221207133904.0190612e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064649892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b022082doi7 aPMC65664992pmcid7 a310910912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBui, Thi Phuong Nam10aAnaerobic Degradation of N-ε-Carboxymethyllysine, a Major Glycation End-Product, by Human Intestinal Bacteria  ap. 6594-6602.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aModifications of lysine contribute to the amount of dietary advanced glycation end-products reaching the colon. However, little is known about the ability of intestinal bacteria to metabolize dietary N-ε-carboxymethyllysine (CML). Successive transfers of fecal microbiota in growth media containing CML were used to identify and isolate species able to metabolize CML under anaerobic conditions. From our study, only donors exposed to processed foods degraded CML, and anaerobic bacteria enrichments from two of them used 77 and 100% of CML. Oscillibacter and Cloacibacillus evryensis increased in the two donors after the second transfer, highlighting that the bacteria from these taxa could be candidates for anaerobic CML degradation. A tentative identification of CML metabolites produced by a pure culture of Cloacibacillus evryensis was performed by mass spectrometry: carboxymethylated biogenic amines and carboxylic acids were identified as CML degradation products. The study confirmed the ability of intestinal bacteria to metabolize CML under anoxic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aanaerobes 3aanaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3abiogenic amines 3acarboxylic acids 3acolon 3aculture media 3aglycation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aprocessed foods 0amicrobiota 0aMaillard reaction 0aN-ε-carboxymethyllysine 0aintestinal metabolism 0adietary advanced glycation end-products1 aTroise, Antonio Dario1 aFogliano, Vincenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8786-93551 aVos, Willem M. de,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 May 15, v. 67, no. 23 p.6594-6602dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b022083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012100164300001800285520114800303592002801451650002501479650002201504650001301526650001601539650001501555650001601570650001001586650001301596650001001609650001501619650001901634650001501653650001201668650001001680650002901690650001301719650001301732650001401745650002201759650001101781650001101792650001201803650001401815651001001829700001501839700001501854700001801869700001901887773013801906856008302044852000902127655001202136IND60714545920221120045819.0210716e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071454592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-020-01469-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Minghao10aIsolation and genomic characterization of a pathogenic Providencia rettgeri strain G0519 in turtle Trachemys scripta  ap. 1633-1662.  aProvidencia rettgeri infection has occurred occasionally in aquaculture, but is rare in turtles. Here, a pathogenic P. rettgeri strain G0519 was isolated from a diseased slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) in China, and qPCR assay was established for the RTX toxin (rtxD) gene. Histopathological examination showed that many inflammatory cells were infiltrated into heart, liver and intestine, as well as the necrosis of liver, kidney and spleen. The genome consisted of one circular chromosome (4.493 Mb) and one plasmid (18.8 kb), and predicted to contain 4170 and 19 protein-coding genes, respectively. Multiple pathogenic and virulence factors (e.g., fimbria, adhesion, invasion, toxin, hemolysin, chemotaxis, secretion system), multidrug-resistant genes (e.g., ampC, per-1, oxa-1, sul1, tetR) and a novel genomic resistance island PRI519 were identified. Comparative genome analysis revealed the closest relationship was with P. rettgeri, and with P. heimbachae closer than with other Providencia spp. To our knowledge, this was first report on genomic characterization of multidrug-resistant pathogenic P. rettgeri in cultured turtles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProvidencia rettgeri 3aTrachemys scripta 3aadhesion 3aaquaculture 3achemotaxis 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheart 3ahemolysins 3ahistopathology 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aliver 3amultiple drug resistance 3anecrosis 3aplasmids 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3aspleen 3atoxins 3aturtles 3avirulence 3aChina1 aHu, Xiucai1 aLü, Aijun1 aSun, Jingfeng1 aChen, Chengxun0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2020 Nov., v. 113, no. 11 p.1633-1662dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-020-01469-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002000188245011900208300001200327506007600339520119700415592002801612506003701640650002201677650002101699650002701720650002701747650002701774650002901801650002701830650002501857650002901882650002501911650001901936650003801955650002101993650001402014650003102028651001002059700002002069700002502089700002002114700002002134700002202154773013102176856008202307852000902389655001202398IND60569699620221207090510.0220927e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056969962DNAL7 aPMC51096432pmcid7 a278425382pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-016-1431-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, Tetsuya14aThe modified Gingyo-san, a Chinese herbal medicine, has direct antibacterial effects against respiratory pathogens  ap. 463.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Modified Gingyo-san (MGS) is empirically used to treat various respiratory infections. MGS has been reported to have antiinflammatory and antiviral activities; however, it is not known if it has an antibacterial activity. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of MGS against respiratory pathogens. METHODS: MGS, which is sold as an over-the-counter drug in Japan, was used for the study. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the disk diffusion method. Growth inhibitory activity was evaluated by measuring colony-forming units of the pathogens in the presence of MGS. RESULTS: MGS inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, which are gram-positive bacteria. Although the growth of most gram-negative bacteria was not inhibited by MGS, interestingly, the growth of Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited. MGS did not show any activity against Candida albicans or bacteriophage φX174. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the antiinflammatory and antiviral activities of MGS, which have already been reported, the data obtained from this study indicates that MGS has an antibacterial activity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCandida albicans 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aalternative medicine 3aantibacterial properties 3aantiviral properties 3abacteriophages 3adisk diffusion antimicrobial test 3aherbal medicines 3apathogens 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aJapan1 aWajima, Takeaki1 aNakaminami, Hidemasa1 aKobayashi, Kaho1 aIkoshi, Hideaki1 aNoguchi, Norihisa0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2016 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.463-463dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-016-1431-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016600157300001800323520162300341592002801964650001201992650001402004650002302018650001302041650002102054650001202075650002002087650001802107650002202125650001902147650001902166650001302185650001102198700001302209700001702222700001302239700002002252700001602272700001502288700001302303700001402316700001202330773012602342856007402468852000902542655001202551IND60677984020221122040603.0191213e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067798402DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc03056e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Yuewen10aBalanced distribution of Brønsted acidic sites and Lewis acidic sites for highly selective conversion of xylose into levulinic acid/ester over Zr-beta catalysts  ap. 6634-6645.  aLevulinic acid (LA), a platform chemical, can be produced from acid-catalyzed conversion of C6 sugars such as glucose. Production of LA from C5 sugars such as xylose is also of importance, as this could increase the overall yield of LA from biomass. In this study, selective conversion of xylose into levulinic acid/ester via a one-pot reaction was achieved with Zr-beta as the catalyst and isopropanol as the reaction solvent. The yield of levulinic acid/ester reached 92.1% under optimized conditions. The Brønsted acidic sites in the Zr-beta catalysts catalyzed the dehydration of xylose to furfural, while the Lewis acidic sites as well as basic sites catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol (FA). The Zr-beta catalyst with the most abundant Lewis acidic sites, the lowest ratio of Brønsted acidic sites to Lewis acidic sites and the suitable amount of basic sites was the most active and selective one for catalyzing conversion of xylose into LA. The conversion of furfural into FA was a rate-determining step, the occurrence of which over the Zr-beta catalyst minimized the chance for the polymerisation of furfural. Water formed from the dehydration of sugars played important roles in enhancing the yields of levulinic acid/ester by affecting the formation/distribution of Brønsted acidic sites. In addition, the low ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acidic sites in the catalyst also alleviated polymerisation reactions. The balanced distribution of the Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites and basic sites is essential for achieving the selective conversion of xylose into levulinic acid/ester.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afurfural 3afurfuryl alcohol 3aglucose 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogenation 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alevulinic acid 3apolymerization 3asolvents 3axylose1 aSun, Kai1 aZhang, Lijun1 aXu, Qing1 aZhang, Zhanming1 aLi, Qingyin1 aZhang, Shu1 aWang, Yi1 aLiu, Qing1 aHu, Xun0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 21, no. 24 p.6634-6645dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9gc03056e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245010200204300001800306520122200324592002801546650002301574650001301597650002001610650001601630650001801646650001301664650002101677650001601698650001301714650001701727650001501744650001101759650002601770650001801796650001401814650002901828650002901857650001001886653001601896653001701912653002301929653002701952653001701979700005601996700007602052700007502128700002602203700006902229773014702298856008002445852000902525655001202534IND60646499120190725000000.0190612e20190516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064649912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b023132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScavo, Aurelio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9762-914110aInfluence of Genotype and Harvest Time on the Cynara cardunculus L. Sesquiterpene Lactone Profile  ap. 6487-6496.  aThe excessive and inappropriate application of herbicides has caused environmental pollution. The use of allelochemicals as bioherbicides could provide a solution to this problem. The allelopathic activity of Cynara cardunculus L. has been studied previously, and sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) were identified as the most relevant allelochemicals. The goal of the study reported here was to investigate the effect of six genotypes and three harvest times on the qualitative and quantitative composition of STLs in C. cardunculus leaves through a new ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis method and, thus, the effect on phytotoxicity. Overall, wild cardoon contained the highest levels of STLs of the three botanical varieties studied. Nevertheless, climatic conditions had a marked influence on the presence of STLs among the six genotypes, which was higher in the April harvest. Cynaropicrin was the most abundant STL detected. A close relationship was found between the STL profiles and the allelopathic activity, expressed as inhibition of wheat coleoptile elongation. The data provide a new and important contribution to our understanding of C. cardunculus allelopathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynara cardunculus 3aTriticum 3aallelochemicals 3aallelopathy 3abiopesticides 3acardoons 3aclimatic factors 3acoleoptiles 3agenotype 3aharvest date 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3aliquid chromatography 3aphytotoxicity 3apollution 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awheat 0aallelopathy 0aweed control 0aCynara cardunculus 0asesquiterpene lactones 0acynaropicrin1 aRial, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0265-95841 aVarela, Rosa Ma.q(Rosa María),1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3616-91341 aMolinillo, José Maria Gonzalez1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7844-94011 aMauromicale, Giovanni1 aMacias, Francisco Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8862-28640 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 May 16, v. 67, no. 23 p.6487-6496dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b023133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245009800193300001600291500001500307520179000322592002802112650001802140650002402158650001302182650001202195650001002207650002002217650001302237650002202250650004402272650005002316650001802366650002202384650002302406650002502429650004102454650004202495651001802537653001002555700001902565700001802584773008802602856008402690852000902774655001202783IND60087022620221119043313.0141102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008702262DNAL7 a218679732pmid7 a10.1016/j.margen.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhadury, Punyasloke10aIntron features of key functional genes mediating nitrogen metabolism in marine phytoplankton  ap. 207-213.  a2019-12-06  aIntrons are widespread and variable in eukaryotic genomes. Although their histories and functions, or even whether all of them have any function, remain largely unknown, analysis of intron sequences and genomic contexts may shed light on the evolutionary history of genes and organisms. The number and frequency of introns vary widely in the small number of published genomes of protists and algae suggesting that the same is true of the vast diversity of protists and algae that remain uncultivated. The objective of this study were to investigate introns in sequences of functional genes of phytoplankton, both in published genomes and in sequences obtained from environmental clone libraries. We examined the introns of the genes involved in nitrogen uptake and assimilation pathways in the genome sequences of cultivated phytoplankton as well as in environmental clone libraries of nitrate reductases (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), nitrate transporter (Nrt2) and ammonium transporter (AMT) genes constructed from pelagic phytoplankton communities in Monterey Bay (CA, USA) and Onslow Bay (NC, USA). Here we describe the most extensive set to date of intron sequences from uncultivated marine algae and report important differences for diatom vs. non-diatom sequences. The majority of the introns in NR, NiR, Nrt2 and AMT from cultured phytoplankton and environmental libraries showed canonical splice patterns. Introns found in diatom-like NR environmental libraries had lower GC content than the respective exons. The green algal-like NR and Nrt2 environmental sequences had introns and exons of much more similar GC content, and both higher than in diatoms. These patterns suggest a different evolutionary history and recent acquisition of diatom introns compared to other algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aphytoplankton 3anitrogen metabolism 3anitrogen 3aintrons 3aexons 3aBacillariophyta 3anitrates 3anitrite reductase 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aGenome, Plant 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aNitrite Reductases 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhytoplanktonxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 3aUnited States 0agenes1 aSong, Bongkeun1 aWard, Bess B.0 tMarine genomics.g2011 Sept., v. 4, no. 3 p.207-213dElsevier B.V.x1874-77877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009400173300001800267520154700285592002801832650001801860650001601878650002001894650003101914650001001945650001101955650001801966650001601984650001802000650001002018650001002028700001902038700003202057700003502089700002802124700003502152773010902187856004802296852000902344655001202353IND50070552320221119230536.0131111e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007055232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-013-0604-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera-Madrid, Renata10aControl of Carotenoid Gene Expression in Bixa orellana L. Leaves Treated with Norflurazon  ap. 1422-1432.  aBixa orellana (annatto or lipstick tree) is a perennial tropical plant that stores and produces considerable quantities of the apocarotenoid bixin, a culturally and economically important pigment used worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying the gene regulation and pigment accumulation of bixin and carotenoids in annatto remain unknown. Bixin is present in the different tissues of the plant, although this pigment is primarily accumulated in the seed coat. Thus, the leaves are useful organs for understanding carotenoid and bixin production, thereby facilitating the study of this pigment, which would otherwise be difficult in ligneous adult plants. To study the regulation of bixin synthesis and to determine which genes are important regulatory molecules at the transcription level, the herbicide norflurazon (NF) was used to block carotenoid synthesis and bixin concentrations in B. orellana leaves. The genes activated in the early stages of the carotenoid pathway are involved in lycopene production (dxs, psy and pds), and those induced in the later stages of the carotenoid pathway, such as β and ε-lycopene cyclases and boccd1, were differentially expressed compared with the control. The expression of some genes was more susceptible to certain concentrations of NF, potentially reflecting the roles of these genes in carotenoid synthesis in B. orellana. These results suggest that apocarotenoids, such as bixin, are synthesized using alternative precursors through the actions of genes that have not yet been identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBixa orellana 3acarotenoids 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aleaves 3amature plants 3anorflurazon 3aplant tissues 3atesta 3atrees1 aBurnell, James1 aAguilar-Espinosa, Margarita1 aRodríguez-Ávila, Norma Laura1 aLugo-Cervantes, Eugenia1 aSáenz-Carbonell, Luis Alfonso0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.1422-1432dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-013-0604-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245014400201300001800345520094100363592002801304650002101332650001601353650001201369650001501381650003201396650003001428650001201458650001101470650003001481653001201511653002101523653002401544653002001568700005201588700005601640700005301696700005601749700005301805773014701858856008002005852000902085655001202094IND60646499220221120145418.0190612e20190517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064649922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b026462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7922-674410aModular Engineering of the Flavin Pathway in Escherichia coli for Improved Flavin Mononucleotide and Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide Production  ap. 6532-6540.  aIn this work, modular engineering of Escherichia coli was peformed to improve flavin production and the conversion ratio of riboflavin (RF) to FMN/FAD. The RF operon and the bifunctional RF kinase/FAD synthetase were divided into two separate modules. The two modules were expressed at different levels to produce RF:ribF ratios ranging from 2:20 to 7:5. The best strain respectively produced 324.1 and 171.6 mg/L of FAD and FMN in shake flask fermentation, and the titers reached 1899.3 and 872.7 mg/L in a fed-batch process. Furthermore, error-prone PCR (epPCR) of the E. coli ribF gene was performed. The highest FMN production of the best mutant reached 586.1 mg/L in shake flask cultivation. Moreover, this mutant produced 1017.5 mg/L FMN with a greatly reduced proportion of FAD in fermenter culture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest production of FAD and FMN in a microbial fermentation process reported to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3afermenters 3aflavin-adenine dinucleotide 3aliquid state fermentation 3amutants 3aoperon 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aflavins 0aEscherichia coli 0amodular engineering 0aerror-prone PCR1 aDiao, Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4324-98371 aWang, Zhiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8938-36311 aLu, Wenyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5098-66971 aTang, Ya-Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4032-29151 aChen, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9588-18210 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 May 17, v. 67, no. 23 p.6532-6540dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b026463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015000168520176300318592002802081650001902109650002802128650001202156650001202168650002702180650001502207650002302222650003102245650002202276650001502298650001602313650001802329650002502347650001502372651001002387653000802397653000802405653002502413653001902438653002002457700001302477700001602490700002002506700002102526700001402547700001902561773008702580856008502667852000902752655001202761IND60770803920221119042422.0220411e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077080392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2022.1062202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Linshan10aContributions of climate, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and land surface changes to variation in water use efficiency in Northwest China  aBesides contributing to a broader understanding of ecosystem-hydrology interactions, ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is a key factor operating in an ecosystem’s balance between carbon assimilation and water transpiration. However, the effects of climate, elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentration and land surface changes on variation in regional WUE are sparsely documented. To elucidate the driving mechanisms of spatiotemporal variation in WUE in northwest China (NWC) between 1982 and 2015, the contribution of a changing environment — represented by the WUE’s sensitivity to Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ETₐ) — was examined under different landscape types. Annual WUE series for NWC showed a significant increasing trend and a break point in 2002 with an increasing rate (7.40 mg C kg⁻¹ H₂O yr⁻¹) prior to the break, and a slightly increasing rate (1.1 mg C kg⁻¹ H₂O yr⁻¹) thereafter in NWC. A robust (Bias = 2.6%) attribution analysis revealed that GPP was the dominant factor contributing 88% variation in WUE, while ETₐ contributed 12%. Precipitation was the principal indirect driving factor that affected WUE variation in NWC, while the secondary factor was different among different landscapes. Regionally, precipitation drove 66% of the increase in WUE, wind speed contributed −15% of variation in WUE, and temperature contributed 12% of increase in WUE, while the remaining four factors contributed <3%. Compared to energy-related factors, water-related factors were the more sensitive drivers to WUE variation. The results can guide agricultural irrigation, integrated water resources management and ecological restoration under the changes in climate coming to Northwest China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acatenas 3aclimate 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aevapotranspiration 3agross primary productivity 3airrigated farming 3alandscapes 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3awater use efficiency 3awind speed 3aChina 0aWUE 0aGPP 0aAttribution analysis 0aClimate change 0aNorthwest China1 aFeng, Qi1 aWen, Xiaohu1 aBarzegar, Rahim1 aAdamowski, Jan F1 aZhu, Meng1 aYin, Zhenliang0 tCatena.g2022 June, v. 213 p.106220-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.1062203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007000172300001600242520085700258592002801115650001501143650002501158650002001183650001401203650002001217650002101237650002101258650001901279653002001298653002801318653002801346653002801374700002201402700003301424773009401457856008201551852000901633655001201642IND60553695420221121064855.0161023e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055369542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibs.2014.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitrov, Jordan D.10aThermodynamic stability contributes to immunoglobulin specificity  ap. 221-226.  aAntigen-binding specificity of immunoglobulins is important for their function in immune defense. However, immune repertoires contain a considerable fraction of immunoglobulins with promiscuous binding behavior, the physicochemical basis of which is not well understood. Evolution of immunoglobulin specificity occurs through iterative processes of mutation and selection, referred to as affinity maturation. Recent studies reveal that some somatic mutations could compromise the thermodynamic stability of the variable regions of immunoglobulins. By integrating this observation with the wealth of data on the evolution of novel enzyme activities, we propose that antibody specificity is linked to the thermodynamic stability of the antigen-binding regions, which provides a quantitative distinction between highly specific and promiscuous antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantibody specificity 3aenzyme activity 3aevolution 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin A 3asomatic mutation 3athermodynamics 0aimmunoglobulins 0ainteraction promiscuity 0athermodynamic stability 0aconformational dynamism1 aKaveri, Srini V.,1 aLacroix-Desmazes, Sébastien0 tTrends in biochemical sciences.g2014 May, v. 39 p.221-226dElsevier Ltdx0968-00047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2014.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245014100212300001800353520187500371592002802246650003002274650001202304650002302316650001402339650001802353650001602371650001902387650004302406650002602449650001402475700006802489700006902557773013802626856008302764852000902847655001202856IND60714546520221120045957.0210716e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071454652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-020-01467-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Yasser Musa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8469-487610aEffect of kitasamycin and nitrofurantoin at subinhibitory concentrations on quorum sensing regulated traits of Chromobacterium violaceum  ap. 1601-1615.  aQuorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of intercellular communication in bacteria that received substantial attention as alternate strategy for combating bacterial resistance and the development of new anti-infective agents. The present investigation reports on the assessment of using subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics for the inhibition of QS-regulated phenotypes in Chromobacterium violaceum. Primarily, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of a series of antibiotics were determined by a microdilution method. Subsequently, the inhibitory effects of selected antibiotics on QS-regulated traits, namely violacein and chitinase production, biofilm formation and motility were evaluated using C. violaceum CV026 and C. violaceum ATCC 12472. Results revealed that kitasamycin and nitrofurantoin exhibited the highest quorum sensing inhibitory (QSI) activity. The amount of violacein produced by C. violaceum was significantly reduced in the presence of either kitasamycin or nitrofurantoin. Moreover, the chitinolytic activity, biofilm formation, and motility were also impaired in kitasamycin or nitrofurantoin-treated cultures. We further confirmed QSI effects at the molecular level using molecular docking and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results of molecular docking suggested that both antibiotics can interact with CviR transcriptional regulator of C. violaceum. Furthermore, RT-qPCR revealed the suppressive effect of kitasamycin and nitrofurantoin on five genes under the control of the CviI/CviR system: cviI, cviR, vioB, vioC, and vioD. Giving that kitasamycin and nitrofurantoin are being safely used for decades, this study emphasizes their potential application as antivirulence agents to disarm resistant bacterial strains, making their removal an easier task for the immune system or for another antibacterial agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3abiofilm 3acell communication 3achitinase 3aimmune system 3akitasamycin 3anitrofurantoin 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factors 3aviolacein1 aAbouwarda, Ahmed Megahed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8745-86281 aOmar, Farghaly Abdelhamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5325-80110 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2020 Nov., v. 113, no. 11 p.1601-1615dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-020-01467-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245008000213300001200293506007600305520176100381592002802142506003702170650001102207650001402218650002302232650001802255650001902273650001802292650001402310650001302324650001502337650001802352650002902370650001902399650001202418653000702430653000702437653000702444653000702451653001402458653001102472653001202483653001702495653001102512653001702523700002302540773008402563856008502647852000902732655001202741IND60551228320221207105655.0161018e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055122832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0162doi7 aPMC41849952pmcid7 a249554952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Joshua B.10aEffects of learning and food form on energy intake and appetitive responses  ap. 1-8.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnergy-yielding beverages reportedly contribute to positive energy balance uniquely. They are highly consumed and evoke weaker satiety signaling and dietary energy compensation than solid foods of the same energy content. This study measured the contribution of learning to appetitive sensations and adjustments of energy intake for preloads varying in energy content and food form in lean and obese adults. One-hundred seven participants received four preload trials before and after a dietary intervention in this randomized cross-over trial with the stipulation that lean and obese individuals were evenly assigned to each intervention. The study entailed monitoring appetitive sensations and daily energy intake after consumption of low and high energy beverage and solid food loads on weekly visit days. Preload testing was conducted at baseline, followed by daily ingestion of one load for 14days and then retesting responses to the four treatments. Lean individuals compensated precisely for the high energy beverage and solid loads from the onset of the study, whereas the obese did not alter eating patterns after consuming the higher energy beverage load. The learning intervention did not have an effect on the responses to the preloads, as responses in both lean and obese participants did not differ from baseline values. Responses to personality and eating behavior questionnaires revealed differences between the lean and obese groups and weakly, but significantly, predicted challenge meal and total daily energy intake. These data suggest that lean and obese individuals respond to energy in beverage form differently, and this is not altered by purposeful daily exposure to loads varying in physical form and energy content for two weeks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abeverages 3across-over studies 3aeating habits 3aenergy content 3aenergy intake 3aingestion 3alearning 3amonitoring 3anormal values 3anutritional intervention 3aquestionnaires 3asatiety 0aHB 0aHS 0aLS 0aLB 0aBeverages 0aEnergy 0aObesity 0aIntervention 0aIntake 0aConditioning1 aMattes, Richard D.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Oct., v. 137 p.1-8dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04003naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245007100207300001200278506007600290520234000366592002802706506003702734650001102771650002502782650002702807650001302834650001302847650001202860650002802872650001402900650001602914650001302930650001202943650002502955650001202980650001202992651001903004700002103023700002203044700001903066700001903085700002003104700001903124700002003143700001903163700001603182773016103198856008103359852000903440655001203449IND60569700020221207082903.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056970002DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-016-0446-y2doi7 aPMC51097772pmcid7 a278425562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavelle, Fiona10aLearning cooking skills at different ages: a cross-sectional study  ap. 119.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cooking skills are increasingly included in strategies to prevent and reduce chronic diet-related diseases and obesity. While cooking interventions target all age groups (Child, Teen and Adult), the optimal age for learning these skills on: 1) skills retention, 2) cooking practices, 3) cooking attitudes, 4) diet quality and 5) health is unknown. Similarly, although the source of learning cooking skills has been previously studied, the differences in learning from these different sources has not been considered. This research investigated the associations of the age and source of learning with the aforementioned five factors. METHODS: A nationally representative (Northern/Republic of Ireland) cross-sectional survey was undertaken with 1049 adults aged between 20–60 years. The survey included both measures developed and tested by the researchers as well as validated measures of cooking (e.g. chopping) and food skills (e.g. budgeting), cooking practices (e.g. food safety), cooking attitudes, diet quality and health. Respondents also stated when they learnt the majority of their skills and their sources of learning. The data was analysed using ANOVAs with post-hoc analysis and Chi² crosstabs with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Results showed that child (<12 years) and/or teen (13–18 years) learners had significantly greater numbers of, and confidence in, their cooking and food skills, cooking practices, cooking attitudes, diet quality (with the exception of fibre intake where adult learners were higher) and health. Mother was the primary source of learning and those who learnt only from this source had significantly better outcomes on 12 of the 23 measures. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights the importance of learning cooking skills at an early age for skill retention, confidence, cooking practices, cooking attitude and diet quality. Mother remained the primary source of learning, however, as there is a reported deskilling of domestic cooks, mothers may no longer have the ability to teach cooking skills to the next generation. A focus on alternative sources including practical cooking skills education starting at an early age is required. This study also highlights the need for further longitudinal research on the impact of age and source of learning on cooking skills.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanalysis of variance 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildren 3achopping 3acooking 3across-sectional studies 3aeducation 3afood safety 3alearning 3amothers 3anutritional adequacy 3aobesity 3asurveys 3aIrish Republic1 aSpence, Michelle1 aHollywood, Lynsey1 aMcGowan, Laura1 aSurgenor, Dawn1 aMcCloat, Amanda1 aMooney, Elaine1 aCaraher, Martin1 aRaats, Monique1 aDean, Moira0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.119-119dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-016-0446-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010100166300001600267520145900283592002801742650001501770650001601785650001401801650003201815650001301847650001801860650001101878650001401889650001801903650001801921700002301939700002101962700002201983773010702005856008302112852000902195655001202204IND60084751320221119212453.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008475132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2011.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrekov, Igor10aPreparation of highly infective Leishmania promastigotes by cultivation on SNB-9 biphasic medium  ap. 273-277.  aProtozoan hemoflagellates Leishmania are causative agents of leishmaniases and an important biological model for study of host–pathogen interaction. A wide range of methods of Leishmania cultivation on both biphasic and liquid media is available. Biphasic media are considered to be superior for initial isolation of the parasites and obtaining high promastigote infectivity; however, liquid media are more suitable for large-scale experiments. The aim of the present study was the adaptation and optimization of the cultivation of Leishmania promastigotes on a biphasic SNB-9 (saline–neopeptone–blood 9) medium that was originally developed for Trypanosoma cultivation and combines the advantages of biphasic and liquid media. SNB-9 medium is characterized with a large volume of the liquid phase, which facilitates the manipulation with the culture and provides parasite yields comparable to parasite yields on such liquid medium as Schneider's Insect Medium. We demonstrate that SNB-9 very considerably surpasses Schneider's Insect Medium in in vitro infectivity of the parasites. Additionally, we show that the ratio of apoptotic parasites, which are important for the infectivity of the inoculum, in Leishmania culture in SNB-9 is higher than in Leishmania culture in Schneider's Insect Medium. Thus, we demonstrate that the cultivation of Leishmania on SNB-9 reliably yields highly infective promastigotes suitable for experimental infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania 3aTrypanosoma 3aapoptosis 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainoculum 3aleishmaniasis 3amodels 3aparasites 3apathogenicity 3apromastigotes1 aSvobodová, Milena1 aNohýnková, Eva1 aLipoldová, Marie0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2011 Dec., v. 87, no. 3 p.273-277dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2011.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010700204500001900311520152000330592002801850650001401878650002501892650001701917650001701934650001501951650001901966650002401985650001502009650002002024650001202044650001302056650001302069650000902082650001802091650001902109650002102128650001002149653002702159653003102186653001502217653000702232653000802239653000902247653000702256653000802263653000702271653000902278653000802287653000802295653000802303700005802311700002302369700005502392700001802447773012102465856008302586852000902669655001202678IND60716465820221118044928.0210223e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071646582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcam.2020.1004912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrake, Corie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1517-710310aRisk of Development of Chronic Kidney Disease After Exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLyme disease is a multi-faceted illness caused by infection due to Borrelia burgdorferi. Acute kidney damage secondary to Lyme disease is well described but less so as a chronic event. The role of Anaplasma spp. and secondary kidney dysfunction is not known. A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine if dogs within a defined Lyme disease and anaplasmosis region with B. burgdorferi or Anaplasma spp. antibodies had an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient exposure was defined as having a B. burgdorferi or Anaplasma spp. antibody positive result recorded at any point in the available patient history. CKD was defined as concurrent increased symmetric dimethylarginine and creatinine (Cr) for a minimum of 25 days with inappropriate urine specific gravity (USG). Patients were matched using propensity scoring to control for age, region, and breed. Contingency tables were used to compare dogs seropositive and not seropositive to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. and CKD outcome. For each comparison that was performed, statistical significance was defined by a P-value of <.025. The risk ratio of CKD for patients exposed to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. were found to be 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI, 1.27, 1.61], P < .0001) and 1.04, (95% CI [0.87, 1.24], P = .6485), respectively. Results suggest in this cohort no increased risk for developing CKD when exposed to Anaplasma spp. but a significant increase in risk for developing CKD with exposure to B. burgdorferi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aLyme disease 3aanaplasmosis 3aantibodies 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3acreatinine 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3amedicine 3apatients 3apets 3arelative risk 3aseroprevalence 3aspecific gravity 3aurine 0aChronic Kidney Disease 0asymmetric dimethylarginine 0arisk ratio 0aBb 0aBUN 0aCAPC 0aCI 0aCKD 0aCr 0aIRIS 0aK-S 0aUSG 0aVBD1 aCoyne, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4107-23531 aMcCrann, Donald J.1 aBuch, Jesse1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8733-60141 aMack, Rebekah0 tTopics in companion animal medicine.g2021 Mar., v. 42 p.100491-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000157x1938-97367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcam.2020.1004913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007600169300001400245520165200259592002801911650001101939650001301950650001801963650001601981650003101997650002002028650001002048650001102058650000902069650002202078650000902100650002002109650001802129650001202147653002602159653002202185653002202207700002002229700001702249700002102266700002102287773008602308856008502394852000902479655001202488IND60551228520221119105418.0161018e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055122852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenner, Seico10aEarly deprivation induces competitive subordinance in C57BL/6 male mice  ap. 42-52.  aRodent models have been widely used to investigate the impact of early life stress on adult health and behavior. However, the social dimension has rarely been incorporated into the analysis due to methodological limitations. This study characterized the effects of neonatal social isolation (early deprivation, ED) on adult C57BL/6 mouse behavior in a social context using our recently developed behavioral test protocols for group-housed mice. During the first two postnatal weeks, half of the pups per dam were separated from their dam and littermates for 3h per day (ED group). Post weaning, ED and control pups were electronically tagged and co-housed. At 12weeks, the mixed cohorts were transferred to IntelliCages, equipped with computer-controlled operant chambers. Access to the chambers was used as an index to analyze novel object response, behavioral flexibility, and competitive dominance with minimal experimenter intervention. In general, ED had greater effects on males; ED males exhibited reduced body weight, increased novelty response, and were subordinate to control littermates when competing for reward access. Male ED mice also demonstrated mildly impaired reversal learning. Analyzing gene expression changes in brain regions controlling emotion, stress, spatial memory, and executive function revealed reduced BDNF and c-Fos in hippocampal CA1, enhanced c-Fos in the basolateral amygdala, reduced Map2 while enhanced HSD11β2 in prefrontal cortex of ED males. In male mice, it was suggested that neonatal social isolation results in sustained changes in social behavior with altered function of limbic and frontal cortices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aamygdala 3aanimal models 3abody weight 3agene expression regulation 3ahealth behavior 3amales 3amemory 3amice 3aprefrontal cortex 3apups 3asocial behavior 3asocial change 3aweaning 0aCompetitive dominance 0aEarly life stress 0aEarly deprivation1 aEndo, Toshihiro1 aEndo, Nozomi1 aKakeyama, Masaki1 aTohyama, Chiharu0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Oct., v. 137 p.42-52dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04211naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245010800180520269000288592002802978650001803006650001503024650001503039650001403054650002403068650002803092650002903120650000903149650002903158650001503187650001403202650001103216650000703227650002303234650001703257650001303274650002003287653000903307653001503316653001603331653003803347653003403385700002203419700002303441700002803464773011803492856008603610852000903696655001203705IND60717350420221118065925.0220421e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071735042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlu-Owolabi, Bamidele I.10aUtilizing eco-friendly kaolinite-biochar composite adsorbent for removal of ivermectin in aqueous media  aSeveral emerging contaminants are currently used in an unregulated manner worldwide, resulting in their increasing stringent limits in water by regulatory bodies. Thus, more viable and cheap treatment technologies are required. Recently, synergistic combinations of low-cost adsorbents have shown huge potential for aqueous toxic metals adsorption in water treatment processes. However, there is dearth of data on their potential for emerging contaminant removal. Here, low-cost kaolinite (KAC) clay was synergistically combined with blended Carica papaya or pine cone seeds, and calcined to obtain composites of KAC-Carica papaya seeds (KPA) and KAC-pine cone seeds (KPC). These adsorbents were characterized and evaluated for ivermectin adsorption at varying operating times (15–1440 min), pH (3–11), concentration (100–600 μg/L), and temperature (19.5–39.5 °C), as well as testing adsorbents’ reusability. The composites exhibited marked property differences including over 250% cation exchange capacity increases and ≥50% surface area decreases, but unchanged KAC clay primary lattice structure. Ivermectin adsorption data were explained using kinetics and adsorption isotherm models. The rate of adsorption on KAC decreased over time, while rates for KPA and KPC increased until equilibrium at 180 min; the presence of biomaterials in the composites conferred better ivermectin adsorption and retention under continuous agitation. The adsorbents exhibited dual adsorption peaks one each at the acidic and alkaline pH regions as solution pH changed from 3 to 11. The rate data fitted (≥0.9232) the homogeneous fractal Pseudo-Second Order (FPSO) better than any other kinetics model, as well as the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model (≥0.9887); these indicate complex interactions between ivermectin and the adsorption sites of both composites. Ambient temperature increase up to ≈30 °C caused higher ivermectin adsorption but beyond this temperature there was drastic drop in adsorption. The KPA and KPC adsorption capacities are 105.3 and 115.8 μg/g, respectively. The KPC was better at reducing ivermecitn in low-concentration solution (≈75 μg/L) to less than 5.0 μg/L compared with KPA with ≈20.0 μg/L. Though KPC showed better efficiency in adsorption capacity and lowering concentration in low-concentration solutions, KPA exhibited better reusability with 83.5 and 67.5% initial adsorption strengths remaining in the second and third adsorption cycles, respectively, compared to the 73.8 and 58.8% for the KPC. These results indicate that KPA and KPC composites have the economic potential for application in water treatment processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarica papaya 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagitation 3aambient temperature 3abiocompatible materials 3acation exchange capacity 3aclay 3aenvironmental management 3aivermectin 3akaolinite 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 0aClay 0aAvermectin 0aSolution pH 0aKaolinite-Carica papaya composite 0aKaolinite-pine cone composite1 aDiagboya, Paul N.1 aMtunzi, Fanyana M.1 aDüring, Rolf-Alexander0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 279 p.111619-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1116193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010700171300001600278520172400294592002802018650002502046650001102071650001402082650000902096650002102105650001102126650001102137650002802148650001202176650001402188650001502202650001602217650001002233650001102243650002102254650001602275650001502291650001302306650001202319653001202331653001002343653001102353653001202364653001502376653001902391653001202410700002102422700001802443700002002461700002202481773008802503856008502591852000902676655001202685IND60551228620221119105510.0161018e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055122862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgea, A. Vanina10aReduced neophobia: A potential mechanism explaining the emergence of self-medicative behavior in sheep  ap. 189-197.  aGastrointestinal helminths challenge ruminants in ways that reduce their fitness. In turn, ruminants have evolved physiological and behavioral adaptations that counteract this challenge. For instance, emerging behavioral evidence suggests that ruminants self-select medicinal compounds and foods that reduce parasitic burdens. However, the mechanism/s leading to self-medicative behaviors in sick animals is still unknown. We hypothesized that when homeostasis is disturbed by a parasitic infection, consumers should respond by increasing the acceptability of novel foods relative to healthy individuals. Three groups of lambs (N=10) were dosed with 0 (Control—C), 5000 (Medium—M) and 15000 (High—H) L3 stage larvae of Haemonchus contortus. When parasites had reached the adult stage, all animals were offered novel foods and flavors in pens and then novel forages at pasture. Ingestive responses by parasitized lambs were different from non-parasitized Control animals and they varied with the type of food and flavor on offer. Parasitized lambs consumed initially more novel beet pulp and less novel beet pulp mixed with tannins than Control lambs, but the pattern reversed after 9d of exposure to these foods. Parasitized lambs ingested more novel umami-flavored food and less novel bitter-flavored food than Control lambs. When offered choices of novel unflavored and bitter-flavored foods or different forage species to graze, parasitized lambs selected a more diverse array of foods than Control lambs. Reductions in food neophobia or selection of a more diverse diet may enhance the likelihood of sick herbivores encountering novel medicinal plants and nutritious forages that contribute to restore health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aadults 3abeet pulp 3adiet 3aeating disorders 3aflavor 3aforage 3agastrointestinal system 3agrazing 3ahelminths 3aherbivores 3ahomeostasis 3alambs 3alarvae 3amedicinal plants 3anovel foods 3aparasitism 3apastures 3atannins 0aTannins 0aUmami 0aBitter 0aGrazing 0aOvis aries 0aFood selection 0aFeeding1 aHall, Jeffery O.1 aMiller, James1 aSpackman, Casey1 aVillalba, Juan J.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2014 Aug., v. 135 p.189-197dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008100172300001400253520128600267592002801553650002201581650001901603650000901622650001301631650001001644650001201654650001401666650001401680650001101694651001901705653002101724653002501745653001801770653001701788653002401805700002501829773016201854856008402016852000902100655001202109IND60594438920221118080952.0180514e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059443892DNAL7 a10.25225/fozo.v63.i2.a3.20142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠálek, Miroslav10aDelayed nest predation: a possible tactic toward nests of open-nesting birds  ap. 67-72.  aPredators use various tactics to find and depredate bird nests. This study examines a possible tactic of visually orientated predators termed “delayed nest-visit”. This consists in remembering the positions of incubating parents and subsequent easy depredation of eggs when the parents are away from their nests. Conditions for use of this tactic were experimentally simulated by installing artificial nests with quail eggs and plastic dummies of northern lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) at 11 actual breeding grounds with various habitat conditions in southern and eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic. Habitat, presence of the dummy, and their interaction significantly affected nest survival. While 17.2 % of the nests baited with the dummy were depredated, this occurred in only 6.9 % of the nests without the dummy. This depredation rate was affected by the visibility of the dummies in particular habitats. The results suggest that predators may remember the nest position to delay their first visit to a previously located bird nest from a remote place and may use this tactic to easily capture the clutches. The use of this tactic showed that at least some predator species are able to apply much more sophisticated approaches in search of birds' nests than previously assumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVanellus vanellus 3abreeding sites 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3anests 3aparents 3apredation 3apredators 3aquails 3aCzech Republic 0aartificial nests 0aground-nesting birds 0aegg predation 0anest crypsis 0asearch image tactic1 aZámečník, Václav0 tFolia zoologica.g2014 July, v. 63, no. 2 p.67-72dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.v63.i2.a3.20143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015100163300002000314520185400334592002802188650001102216650002602227650001302253650001902266650002002285653002102305653003202326653001002358653002402368653001702392700001702409700006102426700006502487773014102552856007802693852000902771655001202780IND60646499920221121235247.0190612e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064649992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b020332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaoping10aRectification Ratio and Tunneling Decay Coefficient Depend on the Contact Geometry Revealed by in Situ Imaging of the Formation of EGaIn Junctions  ap. 21018-21029.  aThis paper describes how the intensive (tunneling decay coefficient β and rectification ratio R) and extensive (current density J) properties of Ag–S(CH₂)ₙ₋₁CH₃//GaOₓ/EGaIn junctions (n = 10, 14, 18) and molecular diodes of the form of Ag–S(CH₂)₁₁Fc//GaOₓ/EGaIn depend on Agₑₒ, the contact area between the self-assembled monolayer and the cone-shaped EGaIn tip. Large junctions with Agₑₒ ≥ 1000 μm² are unreliable and defects, such as pinholes, dominate the charge transport characteristics. For S(CH₂)₁₁Fc SAMs, R decreases from 130 to unity with increasing Agₑₒ due to an increase in the leakage current (the current flowing across the junction at reverse bias when the diodes block current flow). The value of β decreases from 1.00 ± 0.06 n–¹ to 0.70 ± 0.03 n–¹ with increasing Agₑₒ which also indicates that large junctions suffer from defects. Small junctions with Agₑₒ ≤ 300 μm² are not stable due to the high surface tension of the bulk EGaIn resulting in unstable EGaIn tips. In addition, the contact area for such small junctions is dominated by the rough tip apex reducing the effective contact area and reproducibility significantly. The contact area of very large junctions is dominated by the relatively smooth side walls of the tips. Our findings show that there is an optimum range for the value of Agₑₒ between 300–500 μm² where the electrical properties of the junctions are dominated by molecular effects. In this range of Agₑₒ, the value of J (defined by I/Agₑₒ where I is the measured current) increases with Agₑₒ until it plateaus for junctions with Agₑₒ > 1000 μm² in agreement with recently reported findings by the Whitesides group. In this regime reproducible measurements of J can be obtained provided Agₑₒ is kept constant.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiodes 3aelectrical properties 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3asurface tension 0amolecular diodes 0atunneling decay coefficient 0aEGaIn 0amolecular junctions 0acontact area1 aHu, Hongting1 aTrasobares, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8711-16641 aNijhuis, Christian A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3435-46000 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 May 22, v. 11, no. 23 p.21018-21029dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b020333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002800169245009600197300001600293520096000309592002801269650002001297650002601317650001501343650001001358650001401368650000901382650001101391650001501402650001201417650001301429650003301442650001201475650003101487650002101518650004301539650002101582650002401603700001901627700002001646700002001666700002001686700001801706700002601724700001701750700002001767773008801787856008401875852000901959655001201968IND60087023320221119043033.0141102e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008702332DNAL7 a218679682pmid7 a10.1016/j.margen.2011.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakapedua, Daisy Monica10aGenome size, GC percentage and 5mC level in the Indonesian coelacanth Latimeria menadoensis  ap. 167-172.  aThe living fossil Latimeria menadoensis is important to understand sarcopterygian evolution. To gain further insights into this fish species we studied its genome size, GC% and 5mC level. The genome size and the GC% of the Indonesian coelacanth seem to be very similar to those of the African coelacanth. Moreover the GC%, the CpG frequency and the 5mC level of L. menadoensis are more similar to those of fish and amphibians than to those of mammals, birds and reptiles and this is in line with the hypothesis that two different DNA methylation and CpG shortage equilibria arose during vertebrate evolution. Our results suggest that the genome of L. menadoensis has remained unchanged for several million years, maybe since the origin of the lineage which from lobe-finned fish led to tetrapods. These data fit a conservative evolutionary landscape and suggest that the genome of the extant crossopterygians may be a sort of evolutionarily frozen genome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aLatimeria menadoensis 3aamphibians 3abirds 3aevolution 3afish 3agenome 3alandscapes 3amammals 3areptiles 2a5-Methylcytosinexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBase Compositionxgenetics 2aFishesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulationxphysiology 2aGenomexgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBarucca, Marco1 aForconi, Mariko1 aAntonucci, Niki1 aBizzaro, Davide1 aAmici, Adolfo1 aCarradori, Maria Rita1 aOlmo, Ettore1 aCanapa, Adriana0 tMarine genomics.g2011 Sept., v. 4, no. 3 p.167-172dElsevier B.V.x1874-77877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2011.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245019800168300001600366520126200382592002801644650002701672650001401699650001701713650001601730650001901746650002401765650002001789650002001809650001501829650001401844700003001858773010701888856008301995852000902078655001202087IND60084751620221119212302.0141101e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008475162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mimet.2011.08.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupont, Claire10aRelationship between the culturability of stressed Listeria monocytogenes cells in non-selective and selective culture media and the cellular esterase activity measured by solid phase cytometry  ap. 295-301.  aSolid phase cytometry in conjunction with fluorescent probe was applied to rapidly quantify cellular esterase activity of Listeria monocytogenes cells. Viability of cells stressed by several treatments (starvation, NaCl, lactic acid and peracetic acid) was assessed simultaneously by their esterase activity estimated by fluorescence intensity and by their ability to multiply in liquid and solid, non-selective and selective, culture media. It was determined that cell physiological state has a significant impact on the cellular fluorescence intensity which was very dependent on the stress suffered by cells. No general relationship was observed between the bacterial populations observed by cytometry and the populations able to grow on culture media. The link between the cell culturability in non-selective and selective media and the esterase activity was always dependent on the stress suffered. Nevertheless, it was also established that solid phase cytometry is an efficient, sensitive and accurate tool to characterize the ability of non-selective and selective enrichment broths to allow the repair of stressed L. monocytogenes cells by examining the increase in the fraction of the most esterase active cells during the course of resuscitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aesterases 3afluorescence 3alactic acid 3aperacetic acid 3aphysiological state 3aselective media 3asodium chloride 3astarvation 3aviability1 aAugustin, Jean-Christophe0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2011 Dec., v. 87, no. 3 p.295-301dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2011.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245015100164300001800315520039300333592002800726650001600754650001200770650001900782650002000801650002400821700001600845700001800861773012600879856007401005852000901079655001201088IND60677984920221122003442.0191213e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067798492DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc03410b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDao, Pham Duy Quang10aTransition metal-free construction of trinuclear N-fused hybrid scaffolds by double nucleophilic aromatic substitution under microwave irradiation  ap. 6590-6593.  aTreatment of 2-(2-bromoaryl)- and 2-(2-bromovinyl)benzimidazoles with 2-aminoazoles in the presence of a base under microwave irradiation triggers double C(sp²)–N coupling to form trinuclear N-fused hybrid scaffolds.

Our objective was to evaluate the cooling effectiveness of 4 spray strategies, using 2 water volumes (approximately 74 or 44 L/nozzle) over 45 min. Strategies varied based on spray frequency (using the same water volume) and the time that water was on and off (using different water volumes). In a crossover design, 20 Holstein cows (milk yield: 38.9 ± 4.2 kg/d) were restrained in shaded head gates and tested twice for each control (shade only) and 4 spray treatments (minutes water on | off, frequency: number of cycles/45 min): 1.5 on | 3 off, 10 cycles; 1.5 on | 6 off, 6 cycles; 3 on | 6 off, 5 cycles; and 3 on | 12 off, 3 cycles (water temperature average ± standard deviation: 26 ± 2°C). Air temperature and humidity averaged 29 ± 5°C and 26 ± 13%, respectively, during testing periods. Body temperature (BT), respiration rate (RR), skin temperature of the leg and shoulder, and air temperature surrounding the cow were measured. Compared with shade alone, all water treatments reduced heat load in cattle. Body temperature, for example, was at least 0.3°C lower (maximum reduction: 0.5°C) for sprayed cows after 45 min (39.0 vs. ≤38.7°C). The only change associated with spraying cows more often using the same water volume (thus manipulating both times on and off) was that applying water more frequently tended to reduce RR by 7 breaths/min. On the other hand, manipulating either time on or off (thus, water volume) affected most responses. Increasing the time on from 1.5 to 3 min (time off: 6 min) or shortening the time off from 12 to 6 min (time on: 3 min) or from 6 to 3 min (time on: 1.5 min) reduced BT by at least 0.1°C (maximum reduction: 0.2°C) and leg temperature by ≥0.2°C after 45 min. Shortening the time off also tended to reduce RR (7 breaths/min). Similarly, shoulder and surrounding air temperatures were, respectively, 0.5 and 0.4°C lower when reducing the time off from 6 to 3 min. In conclusion, applying the same water volume more often had minimal effects on responses to heat load on restrained cattle over a 45-min period. In contrast, spraying cows for longer or reducing the time off (thus, using more water) improved cow cooling compared with strategies that used less water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aair temperature 3abody temperature 3acell respiration 3acooling 3acows 3across-over studies 3adairy farming 3agates 3aheat 3ahumidity 3amilk yield 3aphysiological response 3askin temperature 3aspraying 3asprinklers 3astandard deviation 3awater temperature 3awater use efficiency 3aWestern United States 0asoakers 0aspray duration 0atime on and off 0aheat stress1 aSchütz, Karin E.1 aTucker, Cassandra B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Dec., v. 101, no. 12 p.11237-11246dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-149173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008800166300001800254520114900272592002801421650001401449650001101463650001601474650000901490650002001499650001401519650002301533650001301556700001601569700002301585700002201608700001501630700002001645700001901665700001901684700002001703700001701723700002101740773011701761856008201878990002301960852000901983655001201992IND60090916020221120060439.0141102e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009091602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.04.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBryk, Ruslana10aIdentification of new inhibitors of protein kinase R guided by statistical modeling  ap. 4108-4114.  aWe report the identification of new, structurally diverse inhibitors of interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) using a combined experimental and computational approach. A training set with which to build a predictive statistical model was generated by screening a set of 80 known Ser/Thr kinase inhibitors against recombinant human PKR, resulting in the identification of 28 compounds from 18 chemical classes with <0.1μM⩽IC₅₀⩽20μM. The model built with this data was used to screen a database of 5 million commercially available compounds in silico to identify candidate inhibitors. Testing of 128 structurally diverse candidates resulted in the confirmation of 20 new inhibitors from 11 chemical classes with 2μM⩽IC₅₀⩽20μM. Testing of 34 analogs in the newly identified pyrimidin-2-amine active series provided initial SAR. One newly identified inhibitor, N-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]-4-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (compound 51), inhibited intracellular PKR activation in a dose-dependent manner in primary mouse macrophages without evident toxicity at effective concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3ahumans 3amacrophages 3amice 3aprotein kinases 3ascreening 3astatistical models 3atoxicity1 aWu, Kangyun1 aRaimundo, Brian C.1 aBoardman, Paul E.1 aChao, Ping1 aConn, Graeme L.1 aAnderson, Eric1 aCole, James L.1 aDuffy, Nigel P.1 aNathan, Carl1 aGriffin, John H.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 July 1, v. 21, no. 13 p.4108-4114dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.04.1493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005200148245009600200300001800296520162100314592002801935650000801963650001501971650001801986650001502004650000902019650002202028653001402050653000902064653002002073653001602093653002602109653000902135700001302144700005402157700001402211773012802225856008302353852000902436655001202445IND60716466120221118044903.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071646612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0643-506X10aFeatures of sRNA biogenesis in rice revealed by genetic dissection of sRNA expression level  ap. 3207-3216.  aWe previously conducted a QTL analysis of small RNA (sRNA) abundance in flag leaves of an immortalized rice F₂ (IMF2) population by aligning sRNA reads to the reference genome to quantify the expression levels of sRNAs. However, this approach missed about half of the sRNAs as only 50% of all sRNA reads could be uniquely aligned to the reference genome. Here, we quantified the expression levels of sRNAs and sRNA clusters without the use of a reference genome. QTL analysis of the expression levels of sRNAs and sRNA clusters confirmed the feasibility of this approach. sRNAs and sRNA clusters with identified QTLs were then aligned to the high-quality parental genomes of the IMF2 population to resolve the identified QTLs into local vs. distant regulation mode. We were able to detect new QTL hotspots by considering sRNAs aligned to multiple positions of the parental genomes and sRNAs unaligned to the parental genomes. We found that several local-QTL hotspots were caused by sequence variations in long inverted repeats, which probably function as precursors of sRNAs, between the two parental genomes. The expression levels of these sRNAs were significantly associated with the presence/absence of the long inverted repeats in the IMF2 population. Moreover, we found that the variations in whole-genome sRNA species composition among different IMF2s were attributed to sRNA biogenesis genes including OsDCL2b and OsRDR2. Our results highlight that genetic dissection of sRNA expression is a promising approach to disclose new components functioning in sRNA biogenesis and new mechanisms of sRNA biogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3abiogenesis 3abiotechnology 3adissection 3arice 3aspecies diversity 0aSmall RNA 0asRNA 0asRNA biogenesis 0aQTL mapping 0asRNA expression level 0aRice1 aLi, Yang1 aXie, Weibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2768-35721 aWang, Lei0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.3207-3216dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015700168300001400325520153100339592002801870650002501898650001301923650001801936650001901954650001901973650001901992650001802011650001902029650002002048650001002068650002002078650001602098650002202114650002402136700007102160700002202231773013002253856008102383852000902464655001202473IND60629886720221120203610.0190202e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062988672DNAL7 a10.1007/s11259-018-9743-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSokół, Rajmund14aThe influence of Dermanyssus gallinae and different lighting regimens on selected blood proteins, corticosterone levels and egg production in layer hens  ap. 31-36.  aEgg production in battery cage systems in commercial poultry farms promotes uncontrolled growth of poultry ectoparasite Dermanyssus gallinae. Intermittent lighting regimens provided a promising alternative for controlling D. gallinae invasions. The study analysed the influence of D. gallinae invasions on selected blood protein fractions (albumin, α-, β-, γ-globulin), corticosterone levels and egg production in Hy-Line Brown layer hens exposed to two lighting regimens: A (16 L:8D) and B (intermittent (4 L:2D); L-light, D-dark). Blood samples were collected from a total of 48 hens (divided into uninfested - UF, and infested - IF groups for each lighting regimen). The concentrations of protein fractions were analysed by electrophoresis on Cormay Gel Protein 100, and corticosterone levels were determined in a radioimmunoassay. The results of the study revealed concentrations of β-globulin and corticosterone levels were significantly higher in IF than UF groups in both lighting regimens. However, both parameters were higher in hens exposed to lighting regimen B than lightening regimen A. Gamma-globulin concentrations were significantly lower in IF than UF groups in both lighting regimens. Egg production was significantly lower in all groups than commercial standard. D. gallinae and intermittent lightening regimen had interaction effect on the corticosterone level in hens. Strong decreasing (negative) linear relationship between corticosterone levels and egg production (r = −0.911) was reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermanyssus gallinae 3aalbumins 3abattery cages 3abeta-globulins 3ablood sampling 3acorticosterone 3aectoparasites 3aegg production 3aelectrophoresis 3afarms 3agamma-globulins 3alaying hens 3aradioimmunoassays 3aveterinary medicine1 aKoziatek-Sadłowska, Sylwia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4655-88541 aMichalczyk, Maria0 tVeterinary research communications.g2019 Feb., v. 43, no. 1 p.31-36dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32719x0165-73807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-018-9743-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013600162300002000298520174600318592002802064650003402092650002802126650001702154650002002171650002802191650001802219650002702237650002602264650001102290650002202301650002202323650001302345650002002358650001102378650001102389650003902400650001502439650002502454653001802479653002502497653003202522653003202554700001402586700001702600700001502617700001802632700001502650700001902665773015702684856007902841852000902920655001202929IND60615374120221119045436.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061537412DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2018-149892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Guangqing10aAssessing and comparing antioxidant activities of lactobacilli strains by using different chemical and cellular antioxidant methods  ap. 10792-10806.  aSome lactobacilli strains had beneficial effects on human beings due to their antioxidant activities. In this study lactobacilli strains stored in our laboratory were screened for potential antioxidant activities by investigating their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, resistance to H2O2, and hydroxyl free radical scavenging activity; then the antioxidant activities of the screened strains were evaluated by cellular antioxidant assay and protection for HT-29 cells against H2O2 injury assay. The results showed that Lactobacillus plantarum Y44 could scavenge oxygen free radicals, inhibit the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species without creating obvious cytotoxic effects, and protect HT-29 cells against H2O2 injury evidenced by the significant decrease of the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) ratio and heat shock protein 70 expression, increase of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and decrease of malondialdehyde level of HT-29 cells damaged by H2O2. It was speculated that L. plantarum Y44 protect HT-29 cells against oxygen radical injury through scavenging reactive oxygen species and activating intracellular antioxidant enzymes. A significant correlation was observed among the results of the hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, protection assay for HT-29 cells against H2O2 injury, and the cellular antioxidant assay. The findings indicated that L. plantarum Y44 could be a probiotic candidate with antioxidant properties and combining several chemical antioxidant methods and antioxidant cellular models could be an effective procedure to screen lactobacilli strains with antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3acytotoxicity 3aenzyme activity 3afree radical scavengers 3afree radicals 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alymphoma 3amalondialdehyde 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aoxygen radical absorbance capacity 3aprobiotics 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aLactobacillus 0aantioxidant activity 0achemical antioxidant method 0acellular antioxidant method1 aGao, Yuan1 aTuo, Yanfeng1 aLi, Huanyu1 aZhang, Yuqing1 aQian, Fang1 aJiang, Shujuan0 tJournal of dairy science.g2018 Dec., v. 101, no. 12 p.10792-10806dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-149893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009700162300001800259520172600277592002802003650002902031650001602060650001702076650001702093650002202110650001302132650002302145650001602168650002002184650001202204650001802216650001202234650003902246650002802285700002202313700002702335700002602362773012602388856007402514852000902588655001202597IND60677985120221122023121.0191213e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067798512DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc03722e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenard, Calvin A.10aMuconic acid production from methane using rationally-engineered methanotrophic biocatalysts  ap. 6731-6737.  aHere, we demonstrate bioconversion of methane to muconic acid, a dicarboxylic acid that can be upgraded to an array of platform chemicals, by three gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs. All engineered methanotrophs expressing a heterologous dihydroxyshikimate dehydratase, protocatechuate decarboxylase, and catechol dioxygenase produced muconic acid from methane, with the highest titer (12.4 mg MA per L), yield (2.8 mg MA per g CH₄), and specific productivity (1.2 mg MA per g dcw, 48 hr) synthesized by Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense, Methylococcus capsulatus, and Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilium, respectively. Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum genome-scale model-guided strain engineering predicted that disruption of the pyruvate dehydrogenase or shikimate dehydrogenase would significantly enhance flux to the heterologous muconic acid pathway in this organism. However, knock-out of these targets caused a growth defect, and coupled with similar muconic acid titers (∼1 mg L⁻¹), resulted in minimal flux enhancement to muconic acid in these genetically-modified strains. The shikimate dehydrogenase mutant's ability to grow without aromatic amino acid supplementation revealed that M. alcaliphilum likely encodes an unidentified enzyme or pathway with shikimate biosynthetic capacity, which prevents maximal flux through the synthetic muconic acid pathway. This study expands the suite of products that can be generated from methane using methanotrophic biocatalysts, lays the foundation for green production of muconic acid-derived polymers from methane, and highlights the need for further analysis of methanotroph biosynthetic potential to guide refinement of metabolic models and strain engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethylococcus capsulatus 3aamino acids 3abiocatalysts 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3acatechol 3adicarboxylic acids 3aengineering 3agreen chemistry 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3amutants 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3ashikimate dehydrogenase1 aAkberdin, Ilya R.1 aKalyuzhnaya, Marina G.1 aGuarnieri, Michael T.0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 21, no. 24 p.6731-6737dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9gc03722e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002000188245013800208300001200346506007600358520159600434592002802030596004402058596007602102596012902178596008402307596004402391506003702435650002402472650001102496650001102507650001902518650001902537650001502556650002002571650002002591650001002611650003102621650002002652650001802672650002302690650002002713650001302733650001402746650001802760650002402778650002002802700002202822700002502844700002102869773010302890856008202993852000903075655001203084IND60569700720221207081903.0210217e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056970072DNAL7 aPMC51080862pmcid7 a278425962pmid7 a10.1186/s13059-016-1084-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazeen, Sumaiya10aIntegrative analysis of genetic data sets reveals a shared innate immune component in autism spectrum disorder and its co-morbidities  ap. 228.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that tends to co-occur with other diseases, including asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, infections, cerebral palsy, dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, and schizophrenia. However, the molecular basis of this co-occurrence, and whether it is due to a shared component that influences both pathophysiology and environmental triggering of illness, has not been elucidated. To address this, we deploy a three-tiered transcriptomic meta-analysis that functions at the gene, pathway, and disease levels across ASD and its co-morbidities. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a novel shared innate immune component between ASD and all but three of its co-morbidities that were examined. In particular, we find that the Toll-like receptor signaling and the chemokine signaling pathways, which are key pathways in the innate immune response, have the highest shared statistical significance. Moreover, the disease genes that overlap these two innate immunity pathways can be used to classify the cases of ASD and its co-morbidities vs. controls with at least 70 % accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggests that a neuropsychiatric condition and the majority of its non-brain-related co-morbidities share a dysregulated signal that serves as not only a common genetic basis for the diseases but also as a link to environmental triggers. It also raises the possibility that treatment and/or prophylaxis used for disorders of innate immunity may be successfully used for ASD patients with immune-related phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data  aGM081871cNational Institutes of Health  aP50MH106933, P50MH94267, and U54LM008748cNational Institutes of Health  aInternational Fulbright Science & Technology FellowshipcU.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs  aLudwig Center for Molecular Oncology Graduate FellowshipcMIT School of Science  aGM081871cNational Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToll-like receptors 3aasthma 3aautism 3acardiomyopathy 3acerebral palsy 3achemokines 3adata collection 3adisease control 3agenes 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3ainnate immunity 3ameta-analysis 3amuscular dystrophy 3apathophysiology 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aschizophrenia 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptomics1 aPalmer, Nathan P.1 aBerger, Bonnie Anne,1 aKohane, Isaac S.0 tGenome biology.g2016 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.228-228dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1084-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245008400209300001600293520110400309592002801413650001601441650001401457650002301471650001301494650001101507650001401518650001201532650002001544650001201564650001301576650001301589650001101602651002301613653003701636653002701673653001301700653002701713653001801740653002801758653002101786700002701807700002101834700002001855700002401875773010001899856008701999852000902086655001202095IND60613253520221122065019.0200503e20190130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061325352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Seng Joe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9460-513610aStructural elucidation of fucoidan from Cladosiphon okamuranus (Okinawa mozuku)  ap. 222-226.  aFucoidan is a sulphated polysaccharide, made up mainly of l-fucose, which is found in brown seaweeds. Its chemical structure is diverse and depends on maturity, species and geographical location. The objective of this study was to elucidate the chemical structure of fucoidan from Cladosiphon okamuranus harvested in Japan. The fucoidan was subject to purification prior to monosaccharide profiling, sulphate content determination, and linkage analysis. Our results showed that Japanese Cladosiphon okamuranus fucoidan contained 70.13 ± 0.22 wt% fucose and 15.16 ± 1.17 wt% sulphate. Other minor monosaccharides found were d-xylose, d-galactose, d-mannose, d-glucose, d-arabinose, d-rhamnose and d-glucuronic acid. Linkage analysis revealed that fucopyranoside units along the backbone are linked, through α-1,3-glycosidic bonds, with fucose branching at C-2, and one sulphate group at C-4 per every three fucose units, i.e. the structure of fucoidan from Japanese Cladosiphon okamuranus is [→3)-α-fuc(1→]₀.₅₂[→3)-α-fuc-4-OSO₃-(1→]₀.₃₃[→2)-α-fuc]₀.₁₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosiphon 3aarabinose 3achemical structure 3afucoidan 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aglucuronic acid 3amannose 3arhamnose 3asulfates 3axylose 3aRyukyu Archipelago 0aFucoidan (PubChem CID: 92023653) 0aCladosiphon okamuranus 0aFucoidan 0aStructural elucidation 0aBrown seaweed 0aMonosaccharide analysis 0aLinkage analysis1 aWan Aida, Wan Mustapha1 aSchiehser, Sonja1 aRosenau, Thomas1 aBöhmdorfer, Stefan0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Jan. 30, v. 272 p.222-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002700169245008000196300001400276520054200290592002800832653001500860653002500875653001500900773011200915856011701027852000901144655001201153IND60124956520221116233653.0151101e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495652DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0021:RNDLED]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaliano, María Elena,10aRevisión de las especies de freya del grupo decorata (araneae, salticidae)  ap. 21-41.  aEight species of the genus Freya Koch 1846, closely related with the type species Freya decorata (Koch 1846), are revised and redescribed: F. decorata, F. regia (G. & E.

However, there is still much more to learn about microbial communities, including billions of novel species and genes, as well as countless spatiotemporal dynamic patterns within the microbial communities, which together form the microbial dark matter. In this work, we summarized the dark matter in microbiome research and reviewed current data mining methods, especially artificial intelligence (AI) methods, for different types of knowledge discovery from microbial dark matter. We also provided case studies on using AI methods for microbiome data mining and knowledge discovery. In summary, we view microbial dark matter not as a problem to be solved but as an opportunity for AI methods to explore, with the goal of advancing our understanding of microbial communities, as well as developing better solutions to global concerns about human health and the environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aartificial intelligence 3abioinformatics 3agenomics 3ahuman health 3amicrobiome 3aproteomics 0aMicrobiome 0aDark matter 0aArtificial intelligence 0aKnowledge discovery 0aApplications1 aChong, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7676-79751 aYang, Pengshuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2757-35841 aNing, Kang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3325-53870 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2022 Mar. 22, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12107x1672-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2022.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245009100150300001600241520140200257592002801659650001901687650001101706650001801717650001801735650001401753650001401767650002101781650002601802650002101828650002901849650001801878650001301896650001101909650001101920650001901931651001601950700001201966700001201978700001601990700001902006700001602025700001802041773016902059856007302228852000902301655001202310IND60163093520221121055150.0150530e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016309352DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.121872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, J.10aNitrous oxide emissions from dairy farm effluent applied to a New Zealand pasture soil  ap. 279-289.  aA field experiment on permanent ryegrass–white clover pasture at AgResearch's Ruakura dairy farm near Hamilton, New Zealand quantified nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions from different types of dairy effluent applied to soil at three seasons and evaluated the potential of dicyandiamide (DCD) (a nitrification inhibitor) to decrease gaseous N₂O emissions. Fresh or stored manure and farm dairy effluent (FDE; from dairy shed washings), with or without DCD (10 kg/ha), were applied at approximately 100 kg N/ha to plots on a well‐drained soil on volcanic parent material. A field chamber technique was used to measure N₂O emissions. Application of manure or FDE, both in fresh and stored forms, to pasture generally increased N₂O emissions. Overall N₂O emission factors (EF) varied between 0.01% and 1.87%, depending on application season and effluent type. EFs in spring and autumn were greater than those in summer (P < 0.05). Among the effluents, N₂O EFs were largest from fresh FDE (1.65%) during the spring measurement period, stored manure (1.87%) during the autumn and stored FDE (0.25%) during the summer. DCD was effective in decreasing N₂O EFs from fresh FDE, fresh manure, stored FDE and stored manure by 40–80%, 69–76%, 24–84% and 60–70%, respectively. DCD reduced N₂O emissions during the spring and autumn seasons more effectively than in the summer season.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3aautumn 3adairy farming 3adicyandiamide 3aeffluents 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3afield experimentation 3amanure spreading 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrous oxide 3apastures 3aspring 3asummer 3avolcanic soils 3aNew Zealand1 aLuo, J.1 aShi, Y.1 aLindsey, S.1 aHoulbrooke, D.1 aLedgard, S.1 aGoss, Michael0 tSoil use and management.g2015 June, v. 31, no. 2 p.279-289dPublished for the British Society of Soil Science by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0266-00327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.121873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245007500215300001600290500001500306520187800321592002802199650000902227650001502236650002502251650000802276650001202284650001302296650002102309650002102330650004102351650001102392650000902403650002002412650001102432650002002443650001802463650002402481650002002505650001402525650002502539650002202564650001302586650001702599650002002616650001702636650001302653651001802666651001102684651001102695653001702706653002202723653003602745653002602781653003402807653002402841653001902865653003202884773008402916856008603000852000903086655001203095IND60566346820221122091427.0170711e20160104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056634682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhimain, Elijah Ige1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5491-627110aRecent advances in the development of vaccines for Ebola virus disease  ap. 174-185.  a2019-12-06  aEbola virus is one of the most dangerous microorganisms in the world causing hemorrhagic fevers in humans and non-human primates. Ebola virus (EBOV) is a zoonotic infection, which emerges and re-emerges in human populations. The 2014 outbreak was caused by the Zaire strain, which has a kill rate of up to 90%, though 40% was recorded in the current outbreak. The 2014 outbreak is larger than all 20 outbreaks that have occurred since 1976, when the virus was first discovered. It is the first time that the virus was sustained in urban centers and spread beyond Africa into Europe and USA. Thus far, over 22,000 cases have been reported with about 50% mortality in one year. There are currently no approved therapeutics and preventive vaccines against Ebola virus disease (EVD). Responding to the devastating effe1cts of the 2014 outbreak and the potential risk of global spread, has spurred research for the development of therapeutics and vaccines. This review is therefore aimed at presenting the progress of vaccine development. Results showed that conventional inactivated vaccines produced from EBOV by heat, formalin or gamma irradiation appear to be ineffective. However, novel vaccines production techniques have emerged leading to the production of candidate vaccines that have been demonstrated to be effective in preclinical trials using small animal and non-human primates (NHP) models. Some of the promising vaccines have undergone phase 1 clinical trials, which demonstrated their safety and immunogenicity. Many of the candidate vaccines are vector based such as Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Rabies Virus (RABV), Adenovirus (Ad), Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV). Other platforms include virus like particle (VLP), DNA and subunit vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3aEbolavirus 3ainactivated vaccines 3aDNA 3aviruses 3aformalin 3ahuman population 3asubunit vaccines 3aVenezuelan equine encephalitis virus 3ahumans 3aheat 3aCytomegalovirus 3amodels 3aimmune response 3aVesiculovirus 3avaccine development 3aclinical trials 3amortality 3aHuman respirovirus 3 3aRabies lyssavirus 3azoonoses 3atherapeutics 3agamma radiation 3aAdenoviridae 3aPrimates 3aUnited States 3aEurope 3aAfrica 0aRabies virus 0aHemorrhagic fever 0aReplication incompetent Vaccine 0aPre-existing immunity 0aReplication competent vaccine 0aZoonotic infections 0amicroorganisms 0aHuman parainfluenza virus 30 tVirus research.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 211 p.174-185dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010100163300001600264520114100280592002801421650002501449650001501474650001701489650001301506650001701519650001801536650001701554650001901571650001901590650002401609650001301633653001401646653001701660653001401677653001401691653001801705653001601723653002001739700001801759773022701777856008202004852000902086655001202095IND60775594920221122064347.0221004e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077559492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2022.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Shiwei10aRegulation and integration of plant jasmonate signaling: a comparative view of monocot and dicot  ap. 704-714.  aThe phytohormone jasmonate plays a pivotal role in various aspects of plant life, including developmental programs and defense against pests and pathogens. A large body of knowledge on jasmonate biosynthesis, signal transduction as well as its functions in diverse plant processes has been gained in the past two decades. In addition, there exists extensive crosstalk between jasmonate pathway and other phytohormone pathways, such as salicylic acid (SA) and gibberellin (GA), in co-regulation of plant immune status, fine-tuning the balance of plant growth and defense, and so on, which were mostly learned from studies in the dicotyledonous model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato but much less in monocot. Interestingly, existing evidence suggests both conservation and functional divergence in terms of core components of jasmonate pathway, its biological functions and signal integration with other phytohormones, between monocot and dicot. In this review, we summarize the current understanding on JA signal initiation, perception and regulation, and highlight the distinctive characteristics in different lineages of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aLiliopsida 3abiosynthesis 3agenomics 3agibberellins 3ajasmonic acid 3aplant growth 3aplant hormones 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atomatoes 0aJasmonate 0aPhytohormone 0aSignaling 0aCrosstalk 0aPlant defense 0aDevelopment 0aStress response1 aXin, Xiu-Fang0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2022 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.704-714dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2022.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011300166300001600279500001400295520130100309592002801610650002501638650002101663650002501684650002201709650002101731650001601752650001101768650001101779650001101790650001401801650002201815650001101837650001301848650002401861650001301885650004301898650001201941650001201953650001801965650001401983650001501997650002202012650001702034651001002051653000902061653001902070653003602089700001802125700001502143700001502158700001702173700001402190700001702204700001702221773012202238856008302360852000902443655001202452IND60696985320221122202934.0200804e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2020.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lingxia10aOverexpression of cphA gene from Nostoc flagelliforme improves the drought tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 127-131.  aNAL-light  aNostoc flagelliforme is a terrestrial cyanobacterium distributed in arid or semiarid steppes in western and northwestern China. Cyanophycin is synthesized by cyanophycin synthetase (CphA), which serves as a storage polymer for nitrogen, carbon, and energy in N. flagelliforme. In the present study, cphA (GenBank Accession No.: KX469292), an open reading frame (ORF) of 2706 bp encoding a protein of 901 amino acid residues, was cloned. We found that cyanophycin synthesis was promoted by the expression of cphA in E. coli. The function of the cphA gene in Arabidopsis thaliana under drought stress was investigated, and stable integration and expression of transgenes in transgenic lines were confirmed by PCR, Western blot, Southern blot, and real-time PCR analyses. The transcript abundance of cphA was markedly increased in transgenic A. thaliana compared with that in the untransformed plants. A subcellular localization assay confirmed that cphA protein was targeted to the cytoplasm. The survival rate was also significantly higher in cphA overexpression lines than that in untransformed plants under drought stress, which verified by drought tolerance assay of the transgenic plants. These findings highlight the potential importance of cphA in the drought tolerance of N. flagelliforme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aEscherichia coli 3aNostoc flagelliforme 3aSouthern blotting 3aWestern blotting 3aamino acids 3aassays 3abotany 3acarbon 3acytoplasm 3adrought tolerance 3aenergy 3anitrogen 3aopen reading frames 3apolymers 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asteppes 3astorage 3asurvival rate 3asynthesis 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 3aChina 0acphA 0aOverexpression 0aTransgenic Arabidopsis thaliana1 aWang, Shuping1 aLi, Xiaoxu1 aWang, Meng1 aZhang, Zheng1 aShi, Jing1 aXu, Tingting1 aLiang, Wenyu0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2020 Aug., v. 132 p.127-131dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2020.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245010800191300001400299520091400313592002801227653001501255653002701270653001401297653001901311653002601330700001601356700001801372773011201390856011701502852000901619655001201628IND60124956820221116234021.0151101e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495682DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0056:TIOGSO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBodasing, Marilyn14aTHE influence of group size on dispersal in the social spider stegodyphus mimosarum (araneae, eresidae)  ap. 56-63.  aThe costs and benefits of group living vary with group size, and competition for resources increases with increasing group size. In the social spider, Stegodyphus mimosarum, individuals attain smaller sizes, and survival is lower in larger colonies. In this study we assess whether group size influences the decision to leave a colony——or disperse. Four colony sizes (8, 16, 32 and 64) of S. mimosarum were set up under a proportional feeding regime in a laboratory experiment. We expected more spiders to leave large colonies due to intra-group competition. However, there was no significant increase in the number of spiders leaving with increasing group size. Significantly more spiders left a colony during spring and when spiders were larger (at a more advanced stage of development). Variability in access to resources does not promote dispersal, but season and spider size does influence dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGroup size 0aintragroup competition 0adispersal 0asocial spiders 0aStegodyphus mimosarum1 aSlotow, Rob1 aCrouch, Tanza0 tJournal of arachnology.g2001 Apr., v. 29, no. 1 p.56-63dAmerican Arachnological Society.x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636%2F0161-8202%282001%29029%5B0056%3ATIOGSO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245015400160300001600314520180500330592002802135596007402163596008002237596008402317596006302401650001802464650001002482650004302492650002702535700001402562700001602576700001602592700001602608773013402624856007902758852000902837655001202846IND60673269320221120051327.0191018e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067326932DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmz0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Yulei10aPurification of Flavonolignan Diastereoisomers from Arenaria kansuensis by Two-Dimensional Liquid Chromatography Combined with Solid-Phase Extraction  ap. 418-425.  aHerbal plants are significant for the reason that they have a great potential in discovering drug precursors. However, how to purify compounds with higher purity from them is a question which needs to be discussed. In present study, an offline 2D reversed-phase (RP) preparative liquid chromatography coupled with solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was successfully developed for the separation of flavonolignan diastereoisomers from Arenaria kansuensis. Based on the analysis of results, the major conclusion that we have drawn from it is a RP-SPE was selected for enriching target flavonolignan sample from A. kansuensis. After that, an ODS preparative column was used for 1D preparation, and the target sample (4.6 g) was divided into five fractions with a recovery of 83.9%. Then, a C18HCE preparative column, a polar-modified RP (polar-copolymerized) type, was used for isolating flavonolignan diastereoisomers in the 2D preparation. By establishing optimal 2D chromatography, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) columns and normal-phase (NP) columns were tested simultaneously, and the result showed that diastereoisomers are not suitable for HILIC and NP chromatography mode. Our study resulted in a tricin and five analogous derivative flavonolignans with purity >98% were successfully purified from A. kansuensis. This is the initial report of Salcolin C, Salcolin B, Tricin 4′-O-(C-veratroylglycol) ether and 5′-methoxyhydnocarpin D from A. kansuensis. In addition, it tended to be the first time that Tricin 4′-O-(C-veratroylglycol) ether is isolated from natural resource. This method has great potential for efficiently isolating flavonolignan diastereoisomers from A. kansuensis, and it shows a great prospect for the separation of flavonolignans from complex samples.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014-GX-A3AcScience and Technology Major Project of Qinghai Province  aZSTH-027cChinese academy of sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  a2014-GX-A3A-01cSignificant Science & Technological Project of Qinghai Province  a2017-ZJ-Y11cTibetan Medicine Research of Qinghai Province 3adiastereomers 3adrugs 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3asolid phase extraction1 aShao, Yun1 aWang, Qilan1 aMei, Lijuan1 aTao, Yanduo0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2019 May 01, v. 57, no. 5 p.418-425dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmz0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01703naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009800166300001600264520071900280592002800999650001501027650001501042650001101057650001301068650002001081650002301101700002001124700001301144700001501157700001801172773008101190856008501271852000901356655001201365IND60082850420221120215604.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008285042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plasmid.2012.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jing10aCharacterization of the replication origin of the myxobacterial self-replicative plasmid pMF1  ap. 105-112.  aThus far, pMF1 is the only endogenous myxobacterial plasmid whose replication mechanism is unclear. In this study, we determined that the plasmid replicates via the theta-mode. The pMF1.14 gene, located in the pMF1.13–pMF1.15 operon (repABC), encodes an essential replication initiation protein that was predicted to have no typical DNA/protein binding motifs but contains rich disordered regions. The pMF1 replication-related essential cis-acting DNA region, approximate 370bp, was located within pMF1.14, and was found to contain several directly and inverted atypical repeats. The unique characteristics of the pMF1 replicon are suggested to be the reason for its strict narrow host range in Myxococcus cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxococcus 3ahost range 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3aprotein binding 3areplication origin1 aChen, Xiao-jing1 aSun, Xia1 aWang, Ning1 aLi, Yue-zhong0 tPlasmid.g2012 Sept., v. 68, no. 2 p.105-112dElsevier Inc.x0147-619X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plasmid.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01287naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245007500206300001400281520018900295592002800484653001600512653002300528653001900551653003400570653001300604700001800617700001600635700001500651700001500666700005900681773009400740856008200834852000900916655001200925IND60557699620221122043933.0161103e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055769962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nmni.2016.07.0052doi7 aPMC50353402pmcid7 a276990502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTraore, S.I.10a“Lagierella massiliensis,” a new bacterium detected in human feces  ap. 53-55.  aWe report here the main characteristics of “Lagierella massiliensis” strain SIT14 (CSUR P2012), which was isolated from a stool specimen from a healthy 28-month-old Senegalese boy.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCulturomics 0aemerging bacterium 0agut microbiota 0a“Lagierella massiliensis” 0ataxonomy1 aKhelaifia, S.1 aDubourg, G.1 aSokhna, C.1 aRaoult, D.1 aFournier, P.-E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8463-88850 tNew Microbes and New Infections.g2016 Nov., v. 14 p.53-55dElsevier Ltdx2052-29757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011100172300001800283500001500301520127000316592002801586650001701614650001601631650002601647650001601673650001501689650002301704653002401727653001601751653001601767700002001783773010301803856004801906852000901954655001201963IND50063916320221120190051.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006391632DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-012-0163-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYannopoulos, Stavros10aWater Distribution System Reliability Based on Minimum Cut – Set Approach and the Hydraulic Availability  ap. 1821-1836.  a2019-12-06  aReliability analysis of water distribution systems is a complex task, as it requires both definition and calculation of several reliability measures. In this paper, a methodology for evaluating water distribution system reliability is developed and demonstrated on a simple water distribution network based on the minimum cut-set approach. In general, the definition of the minimum cut-set can arise either from the mechanical reliability or from the concept of hydraulic reliability. In the case of mechanical reliability, a new method based on graph theory is developed, in order to determine the minimum cut-set. This method is based on the counting of paths between nodes. Furthermore, the general concept of reliability is proposed, to include apart from the mechanical reliability, more generally, the pressure availability at nodes as a main hydraulic property. Based on the pressure availability, the sense of hydraulic availability can be expressed as a fuzzy set, while the combination of the water unavailability of the nodes can be achieved by using fuzzy averaging aggregator. Finally, an overall reliability index is proposed based on both the hydraulic and the mechanical reliability. An illustrative example is developed to indicate the methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater supply 3afuzzy logic 3amechanical properties 3areliability 3aalgorithms 3awater distribution 0amathematical models 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aSpiliotis, Mike0 tWater resources management.g2013 Apr., v. 27, no. 6 p.1821-1836dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-012-0163-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009700154300001600251520111700267592002801384650001401412650001301426650002001439650001101459650001101470650001101481650001501492650003001507650001601537650001001553650002001563650001701583650002101600650001501621650001201636650001701648700001701665700001901682700002201701700002401723700001701747700001801764700001801782773016901800856007301969852000902042655001202051IND60163101420221119122405.0150530e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6016310142DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.121752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeller, T.10aSoilFlex‐LLWR: linking a soil compaction model with the least limiting water range concept  ap. 321-329.  aSoil compaction impacts growing conditions for plants: it increases the mechanical resistance to root growth and modifies the soil pore system and consequently the supply of water and oxygen to the roots. The least limiting water range (LLWR) defines a range of soil water contents within which root growth is minimally limited with regard to water supply, aeration and penetration resistance. The LLWR is a function of soil bulk density (BD), and hence directly affected by soil compaction. In this paper, we present a new model, ‘SoilFlex‐LLWR’, which combines a soil compaction model with the LLWR concept. We simulated the changes in LLWR due to wheeling with a self‐propelled forage harvester on a Swiss clay loam soil (Gleyic Cambisol) using the new SoilFlex‐LLWR model, and compared measurements of the LLWR components as a function of BD with model estimations. SoilFlex‐LLWR allows for predictions of changes in LLWR due to compaction caused by agricultural field traffic and therefore provides a quantitative link between impact of soil loading and soil physical conditions for root growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aaeration 3aclay loam soils 3aforage 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3aresistance to penetration 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asoil compaction 3asoil density 3asoil pore system 3asoil water 3atraffic 3awater supply1 aSilva, A.

It is necessary to establish strategy for RNase H detection. In this work, we are enlightened by mimosa, a natural plant which can fold in response to stimuli, to construct a DNA tetrahedron-based nanoprobe, termed DNA nanomimosa, to sensing RNase H activity based on fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET). The DNA nanomimosa was self-assembled from four DNA chains and one RNA chain. One of the four DNA chains contains a FRET-paired fluorophores-labeled hairpin DNA structures which is unfolded by the RNA chain through hybridization. Without RNase H, the RNA chain separate the two FRET-paired fluorophores in hairpin DNA structure, giving a feeble FRET signal. However, the presence of RNase H can selectively digest the RNA strand in RNA/unfolded-hairpin DNA section, resulting in the hairpin DNA configuration changed from “unfolded” state to “folded” state and further turn on the FRET signal. The DNA nanomimosa can be applied to achieve the determination of RNase H activity by recording the emission intensity of donor and acceptor fluorophores. This strategy shows a low detection limit by 0.017 U/mL, good specificity, and distinct advantages like the self-delivery ability, good biocompatibility, and the capacity to minimize the effects of fluctuations. This design provides a potential application in ribonuclease research and could be expanded for other biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3abiocompatibility 3abiomedical research 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3aemissions factor 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahybridization 3aribonucleases 0aRibonuclease H 0aFluorescence resonance energy transfer 0aDNA tetrahedron 0aRatiometric1 aLiu, Yazhou1 aCui, Jie1 aYang, ChunLei,1 aGao, Na1 aJing, Jing1 aZhang, Xiaoling0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122547-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245012300174300001600297520125400313592002801567650001801595650001401613650001001627650002401637650001901661650001901680650002001699650001701719650001601736650001501752653000701767653000801774653000801782653000901790653000801799653000801807653002701815653002301842653001701865653002301882653002701905653001401932700002501946700002301971700002301994773009202017856008302109852000902192655001202201IND60611816820221117232532.0180904e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.06.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMore Bayona, Juan A.10aApplication of imaging flow cytometry for characterization of acute inflammation in non-classical animal model systems  ap. 167-174.  aPhagocytes display marked heterogeneity in their capacity to induce and control acute inflammation. This has a significant impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial immune responses at different tissue sites as well as their predisposition for inflammation-associated pathology. Imaging flow cytometry provides novel opportunities for characterization of these phagocyte populations through high spatial resolution, statistical robustness, and a broad range of quantitative morphometric cell analysis tools. This study highlights an integrative approach that brings together new tools in imaging flow cytometry with conventional methodologies for characterization of phagocyte responses during acute inflammation. We focus on a comparative avian in vivo challenge model to showcase the added depth gained through these novel quantitative multiparametric approaches even in the absence of antibody-based cellular markers. Our characterization of acute inflammation in this model shows significant conservation of phagocytic capacity among avian phagocytes compared to other animal models. However, it also highlights evolutionary divergence with regards to phagocyte inflammation control mechanisms based on the internalization of apoptotic cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3abirds 3adivergent evolution 3aflow cytometry 3aimage analysis 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amorphometry 3aphagocytes 0aAC 0aROS 0aDHR 0aFITC 0aPMA 0aWGA 0aImaging flow cytometry 0aAcute inflammation 0aPhagocytosis 0aChicken leukocytes 0aComparative immunology 0aEvolution1 aKaruppannan, Anbu K.1 aTrites, Michael J.1 aBarreda, Daniel R.0 tMethods.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 112 p.167-174dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.06.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245013900165520111800304592002801422650001301450650001501463650001601478650001301494650001501507650001101522650001301533650001101546650001001557650002301567650001801590700002301608700001901631700003201650700003201682700002101714773011901735856007301854852000901927655001201936IND60653552820221122031309.0190714e20190406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065355282DNAL7 a10.3390/w110407192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Natale, Aline 10aSpectrophotometric Detection of Glyphosate in Water by Complex Formation between Bis 5-Phenyldipyrrinate of Nickel (II) and Glyphosate  aA spectrophotometric method for the determination of glyphosate based on the monitoring of a complex formation between bis 5-phenyldipyrrinate of nickel (II) and the herbicide was developed. The method showed a short response time (10 s), high selectivity (very low interference from other pesticides and salts), and high sensitivity (LOD 2.07 &times; 10&minus;7 mol/L, LOQ 9.87 &times; 10&minus;7 mol/L, and a K<inf>d</inf> from 1.75 &times; 10&minus;6 to 6.95 &times; 10&minus;6 mol/L). The Job plot showed that complex formation occurs with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The method was successfully applied in potable, urban, groundwater, and residual-treated water samples, showing high precision (0.34&ndash;2.9%) and accuracy (87.20&ndash;119.04%). The structure of the complex was elucidated through theoretical studies demonstrating that the nickel in the bis 5-phenyldipyrrinate forms a distorted octahedral molecular geometry by expanding its coordination number through one bond with the nitrogen and another with the oxygen of the glyphosate&rsquo; carboxyl group, at distances between 1.89&ndash;2.08 &Aring;.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3aglyphosate 3agroundwater 3amoieties 3amonitoring 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3asalts 3aspectrophotometers 3astoichiometry1 aPalchetti, Ilaria 1 aAvelar, Mayra 1 aGonzález-Vergara, Enrique 1 aGarate-Morales, José  Luis1 aTorres, Eduardo 0 tWater.g2019 Apr. 06, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w110407193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245009500181300001400276500001500290520115100305592002801456650001501484650001901499650002801518650002401546650001001570650001001580650002201590650001301612651001301625653002401638700002201662773010801684856005501792852000901847655001201856IND4476018620221120021654.0120313e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447601862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00611.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoelchau, Monica Frances10aForb diversity and community similarity of kopjes in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania  ap. 38-46.  a2019-12-05  aThe forb communities of kopjes (rock outcrops) in the Simba, Maasai and Loliondo areas of the Serengeti National Park were examined to determine differences in species composition from surrounding grassland communities, and among sites within kopje and grassland communities. Species diversity measures and multivariate ordination techniques were used to examine the community similarity and species turnover between sites. All measures of forb species diversity were higher on the kopje sites with the exception of one grassland site, and the community composition significantly differed between these two habitat types, with more species and families exclusive to the kopje habitat. Species turnover was very high in grassland habitats, with two of the three areas (Simba and Loliondo) exhibiting a complete change in species composition. Kopjes, on the other hand, had remarkably similar forb communities, suggesting that the populations of the species present on these rock outcrops form patch structures. The distinct flora and higher diversity of kopje forbs raise interesting questions regarding distribution, dispersal and patch dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3anational parks 3ainterspecific variation 3acommunity structure 3aforbs 3aflora 3aspecies diversity 3ahabitats 3aTanzania 0aspecies differences1 aMistry, Shahroukh0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2006 Mar., v. 44, no. 1 p.38-46dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2006.00611.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01486naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245008500182300001600267500000900283520045400292592002800746650001500774650001200789650001900801650001400820650001400834651001900848700001900867700002100886773014800907856009601055852000901151655001201160IND60668145220221118065208.0191125e196807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066814522DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1968.03615995003200040043x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNettleton, W.

Given the expectation that males should compete vigorously for access to females, it may at first seem paradoxical that males in some species cooperate to reproduce, often resulting in the apparent sacrifice of direct fitness by some members of these cooperative partnerships. Because this form of cooperation lies at the interface between natural, sexual and kin selection, studies of the adaptive consequences of male reproductive cooperation may yield important insights into how complex and sometimes conflicting selective pressures shape individual behaviour. Here, we define and review examples of reproductive cooperation among male animals. We take an integrative approach to reviewing the potential causes of male–male cooperation, including potential adaptive hypotheses, ecological correlates, phylogenetic patterns and physiological mechanisms. The impact of male reproductive cooperation on sexual selection theory is also discussed. We conclude by outlining several important directions for future research, including efforts to improve understanding of the ecological and demographic contexts in which male reproductive cooperation occurs. Collectively, such analyses promise to improve our understanding of multiple fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltruism 3aanimal behavior 3afemales 3akin selection 3amales 3amating systems 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3asexual selection 0acooperation 0acooperative breeding 0acooperative display 0acooperative polyandry 0akin selection 0amale parental care 0amutual tolerance 0areproductive skew 0asexual selection1 aDuVal, Emily H.1 aKrakauer, Alan H.1 aLacey, Eileen A.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2014 Feb., v. 88 p.67-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01653naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001800169245012700187300001600314520066400330592002800994653002301022653001601045653001501061653001301076653001201089700002201101773011401123856011701237852000901354655001201363IND60124957320221116233900.0151101e200104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495732DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0104:OCICAW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraf, Barbara10aOntogenetic change in coloration and web-building behavior in the tropical spider eriophora fuliginea (araneae, araneidae)  ap. 104-110.  aEriophora fuliginea (Araneae, Araneidae), a tropical orb-weaving spider from Panama, undergoes a dramatic color change in the course of its ontogenesis.

Parallel to this color modification the spider's behavior changes as well.

An understanding of their role in plant-herbivore-carnivore interactions can be used in the development of tools for the enhancement of environmentally benign alternatives to synthetic pesticides. This review discusses how chemical information mediates ecological interactions between organisms and the role of infochemicals in integrated pest management. Infochemicals can be used in pest monitoring and in pest control, through mating disruption, mass trapping and to aggregate herbivores at delivery sites for biological control agents. Particular emphasis is placed on the potential of using pheromones and kairomones in the management of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a pest in plantations of East African highland banana and plantain in most banana-growing regions of the world. Cosmopolites sordidus produces an aggregation pheromone that attracts both males and females. This pheromone has been identified and synthesised and is being recommended as an effective agent in the trapping and control of the weevil. The synergism between banana plant extracts (kairomones) and the synthetic pheromone in attracting C. sordidus should be better exploited. Future research areas that can provide information for the development of an infochemical-based trapping system for the management of C. sordidus are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCosmopolites sordidus 3aMusa 3aaggregation pheromones 3abananas 3abiological control agents 3aecological competition 3afemales 3afruit growing 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3aintegrated pest management 3akairomones 3amales 3amating disruption 3apest monitoring 3apests 3aplant extracts 3aplantains (fruit) 3aplantations 3asynergism 3asynthetic pheromones1 aDicke, Marcel1 aHuis, Arnold van,1 aGold, Clifford S.0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2002 Dec., v. 22, no. 4 p.241-261dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000208773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245012200206520109200328592002801420650001501448650001601463650002001479650002401499650001001523650001301533650001401546650002101560653001901581653003201600653001201632653003001644700001901674700001601693700001601709700001501725700001601740773009201756856008601848852000901934655001201943IND60739134020221121011637.0211219e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Lifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3996-497X12aA highly sensitive photoelectrochemical aptasensor based on BiVO4 nanoparticles-TiO2 nanotubes for detection of PCB72  aIn this work, a simple and highly sensitive photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor has been developed for detecting PCB72 based on TiO₂ nanotubes (NTs) decorated with BiVO₄ nanoparticles (NPs). The BiVO₄ NPs-TiO₂ NTs composites prepared through a simple hydrothermal method exhibit good visible-light adsorption ability, high PEC response and perfect photo-excited stability. The synthesized composites were explored as the photoactive sensing materials for development of a PEC sensing platform for the first time. Here, Au nanoparticles (NPs) were first deposited the composites, and the anti-PCB72 aptamer molecules were immobilized on the Au NPs-deposited BiVO₄ NPs-TiO₂ NTs. The developed PEC aptasensor exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for PCB72 with a wide linear range from 1 ng/L to 500 ng/L and a low detection limit of 0.23 ng/L. The application of the aptasensor was evaluated by determining PCB 72 in the environment water samples. Thus, a simple and efficient PEC sensing platform was established for detecting the content of PCBs in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaptasensors 3adetection limit 3ahot water treatment 3alight 3ananogold 3ananotubes 3aoligonucleotides 0aTiO2 nanotubes 0aPhotoelectrochemical sensor 0aAptamer 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls1 aLiang, Guifang1 aYan, Wenjun1 aGuo, Yujing1 aBi, Yingpu1 aDong, Chuan0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122551-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03623naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245014200181300001600323520172800339592002802067650000802095650001702103650003102120650002402151650002202175650001202197650002102209650002502230650001902255650000902274650003502283650002302318650001502341650002502356650001802381650001302399650004202412650002702454650001902481650003402500650002102534650001402555650003302569650002602602700001602628700001402644700001502658700001602673700001502689700001902704700001502723700001302738700001902751700001802770773010702788856008102895852000902976655001202985IND50089965720221122172912.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008996572DNAL7 a244141282pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-013-0807-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yuanyi10aDeep re-sequencing of a widely used maintainer line of hybrid rice for discovery of DNA polymorphisms and evaluation of genetic diversity  ap. 303-315.  aGenetic diversity within parental lines of hybrid rice is the foundation of heterosis utilization and yield improvement. Previous studies have suggested that genetic diversity was narrow in cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS/A line) and restorer lines (R line) for Three-line hybrid rice. However, the genetic diversity within maintainer lines (B line), especially at a genome-wide scale, remains largely unknown. In the present study, we performed deep re-sequencing of the elite maintainer line V20B (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica). We then compared the V20B sequence with the 93-11 (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica) genome sequence. 112.1 × 106 paired-end reads (PE reads) were generated with approximately 30-fold sequencing depth. The V20B PE reads uniquely covered 87.6 % of the 93-11 genome sequence. Overall, a total of 660,778 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 266,301 insertions and deletions (InDels) were identified, yielding an average of 2.1 SNPs/kb and 0.8 InDels/kb. Genome-wide distribution of the SNPs and InDels was non-random, and variation-rich and variation-poor regions were identified in all chromosomes. A total of 20,562 non-synonymous SNPs spanning 8,854 genes were annotated. Our results identified DNA polymorphisms at the genome-wide scale and uncovered the high level of genetic diversity between V20B and 93-11. Our results proved that next-generation sequencing technologies can be powerful tools to study genome-wide DNA polymorphisms, to query genetic diversity, and to enable molecular improvement efforts with Three-line hybrid rice. Further, our results also indicated that 93-11 could be used as core germplasm for the improvement of wild-abortive CMS lines and the maintainer lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3amaintainer lines 3anucleotide sequences 3arestorer lines 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNA, Plant 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenotype 2aHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aINDEL Mutation 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhenotype 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolymorphism, Genetic1 aMao, Bigang1 aPeng, Yan1 aSun, Yidan1 aPan, Yinlin1 aXia, Yumei1 aSheng, Xiabing1 aLi, Yaokui1 aTang, Li1 aYuan, Longping1 aZhao, Bingran0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2014 June, v. 289, no. 3 p.303-315dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-013-0807-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011200174300001400286520141400300592002801714650002001742650001101762650002301773650002101796650003001817650001901847650001101866650001801877650002001895650002201915650001601937650001401953650002501967650002801992651001002020700002402030700002802054700002302082700002002105773012202125856005502247852000902302655001202311IND6016310920221118013323.0190806e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601631092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2012.01232.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarman, Apurba K.10aGeographic pattern of host‐associated differentiation in the cotton fleahopper, Pseudatomoscelis seriatus  ap. 31-41.  aHost‐associated differentiation (HAD) is the occurrence of genetically distinct, host‐associated lineages. Most of the cases of HAD in phytophagous insects have been documented in specialist insects inhabiting feral ecosystems or in generalist parthenogens in agroecosystems. Herein we report HAD in the cotton fleahopper, Pseudatomoscelis seriatus (Reuter) (Hemiptera: Miridae), a native, generalist, non‐parthenogenetic insect feeding on native wild hosts [horsemint, Monarda punctata L. (Lamiaceae) and woolly croton, Croton capitatus Michx. (Euphorbiaceae)] and on cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae)] in the USA. Examination of genome‐wide genetic variation with AFLP markers and Bayesian analyses of P. seriatus associated with three different host plant species at five locations in Texas revealed a geographic pattern of HAD. The geographic pattern of HAD corresponded with differences in precipitation among the locations studied. In three locations, two distinct lineages of P. seriatus were found in association with horsemint and cotton/woolly croton, whereas in two other locations, populations associated with the different host plants studied were panmictic. We suggest that precipitation differences among locations translate into heterogeneity in vegetation distribution, composition, and phenology, which altogether may contribute to the observed geographic pattern of HAD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCroton 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aMonarda punctata 3aPseudatomoscelis seriatus 3aagroecosystems 3acotton 3aferal animals 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahost plants 3aphenology 3aphytophagous insects 3apopulation distribution 3aTexas1 aParajulee, Megha N.1 aSansone, Christopher G.1 aSuh, Charles P.

The experimental results indicated that not only the fibrillation of HEWL at high temperature (65°C) and low pH (pH=2.0) could be inhibited effectively by N-GQDs, but the inhibition of HEWL by N-GQDs followed a dose-dependent manner. The results of this work suggested that the N-GQDs had a great potential for designing new therapeutic agents and were promising for future treatment of amyloid-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adose response 3aegg albumen 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3ahens 3alysozyme 3apH 3aquantum dots 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aHen egg-white lysozyme 0aNitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots 0aAmyloid fibril 0aInhibition1 aMiao, Min1 aLiu, Zhe1 aYang, Ran1 aQu, Ling-bo0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Feb., v. 95 p.856-861dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015500174520175300329592002802082650001602110650001002126650001702136650001302153650002002166650002302186650002902209650004402238653001602282653001102298653003002309653000902339653001502348653001202363700002302375700001802398700001702416700002302433700002302456700001302479700005902492700005802551700002202609773009202631856008602723852000902809655001202818IND60739134120221120233018.0211219e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsposito, Cloé L.12aA quantitative UHPLC-MS/MS method for the growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 determination in complex biological matrices and transdermal formulations  aGrowth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) is part of a group of small synthetic peptides with potent GH-releasing activity that have gained attention in the last two decades by virtue of their cyto- and cardioprotective effects. Despite numerous preclinical studies highlighting the potential cardiovascular benefits of GHRP-6, confirmation of clinical efficacy is still awaited. Recent advances in transdermal drug delivery systems have been made to address challenges related to the poor skin permeation rate of peptides by using pain-free microneedle (MN) devices. Accordingly, highly sensitive and validated analytical methods are required for the potential clinical translation of MN-based peptides. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) methods developed in this study aimed to quantify GHRP-6 in biological matrices (plasma, skin) and dissolving polymeric MNs. UHPLC/MS-MS method detection limits of 0.1, 1.1, 0.9 and 1.5 ng/mL were achieved in neat solution, plasma, MN polymer solution, and skin matrices, respectively. Method validation also involved assessment of precision, accuracy, limits of quantification, linearity of matched calibration curves (R² > 0.990), extraction recovery, matrix effect, stability studies, selectivity, and carry-over effect. Additionally, quality control samples were analyzed at three concentration levels to determine recovery (85–109%) and accuracy/bias (3.2–14.7%). Intra- and inter-day precision were within the range of acceptance (RSDs of 3.0–13.9% and 0.4–14.5%, respectively). The validity and applicability of such methods were successfully demonstrated for transdermal GHRP-6 delivery using GHRP-6-loaded MN patches applied to pig skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3adrugs 3apermeability 3apolymers 3aquality control 3asynthetic peptides 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aUHPLC-MS/MS 0aPlasma 0aTransdermal drug delivery 0aSkin 0aExtraction 0aPeptide1 aAc, Araceli Garcia1 aLaszlo, Elise1 aDuy, Sung Vo1 aMichaud, Catherine1 aSauvé, Sébastien1 aOng, Huy1 aMarleau, Sylvie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9392-19891 aBanquy, Xavier1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3342-31791 aBrambilla, Davide0 tTalanta.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 233 p.122555-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1225553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245018300164300001600347520184000363592002802203650003002231650002502261650002002286650001702306650001602323650001002339650002802349650001502377650001502392650001502407650001102422650002602433650002202459650002102481650002102502650002602523650001502549700001902564700002402583700001902607700002002626700002002646700002102666773013402687856007902821852000902900655001202909IND60673269820221123043545.0191018e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067326982DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmz0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Pallab10aSimultaneous Determination and Quantitation of Diosmetin and Hesperetin in Human Plasma by Liquid Chromatographic Mass Spectrometry With an Application to Pharmacokinetic Studies  ap. 451-461.  aAmong the secondary metabolites which are widely distributed in plants and foods in plant origin flavonoids is important one. Flavonoids have antioxidant activities as free radical scavenging action. They also have anti-inflammatory, antiulcer and anti-carcinogenic activities. Diosmin and hesperidin, the metabolites of which are diosmetin and hesperitin respectively are considered in the present study. Diosmetin has anticancer, antioxidant and blood lipid lowering activities. It also enhances venous tone and microcirculation and by reducing systemic oxidative stress it protects capillaries. Hesperitin also has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, blood lipid and cholesterol lowering, anti-carcinogenic activities. In the present study efforts were given to develop and validate a bioanalytical method for simultaneous estimation of diosmetin and hesperitin in human plasma by liquid chromatography electron spray ionization mass spectrometry with an application to the analysis of plasma samples obtained from the comparative pharmacokinetic studies on healthy human volunteers under the framework of bioequivalence study. The developed method for simultaneous determination and quantification of diosmetin and hesperitin in human plasma was validated as per the US-FDA guidelines. The validation parameters found within the specified regulatory limit, hence acceptable. The present method also has a short run time (6.0 min) and easy extraction process. The developed method was found to be simple, specific, highly selective, sensitive and reproducible. This was applied for the analysis of the volunteer plasma samples. On the basis of comparison of the AUC₀₋ₜ, the relative bioavailability of the test preparation was found 100.94 and 95.09% for diosmetin and hesperitin respectively of that of the reference preparation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3abioavailability 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3afoods 3afree radical scavengers 3aguidelines 3ahesperetin 3ahesperidin 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidative stress 3apharmacokinetics 3asecondary metabolites 3avolunteers1 aDan, Shubhasis1 aChakraborty, Soumya1 aGhosh, Balaram1 aSaha, Chiranjit1 aKhanam, Jasmina1 aPal, Tapan Kumar0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2019 May 01, v. 57, no. 5 p.451-461dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmz0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245017700174300001600351500001500367520143600382592002801818650002201846650001201868650001501880650000901895650001801904650001301922650002901935650001601964650001201980650001001992650002502002650003002027650001002057650001602067650001002083650002802093653001402121653001002135653002202145653002402167653000902191653002402200700001902224700001602243700002102259700001502280700001502295773009102310856008502401852000902486655001202495IND50063378320221118013429.0161020e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006337832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Lopez, A.10aReplacement of the human cytomegalovirus promoter with fish enhancer and core elements to control the expression of the G gene of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)  ap. 171-178.  a2019-12-04  aThis work explores some of the possibilities to replace human cytomegalovirus (CMV) core and/or enhancer promoter control elements to create new expression vectors for use with fish. The work is relevant to fish vaccination, since DNA vaccines use eukaryotic expression plasmids controlled by the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to be effective against novirhabdoviruses, such as viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), one of the most devastating fish viral European diseases. To reduce possible homologous recombination with fish genome, core and enhancer sequences from fish origin, such as trout interferon-inducible myxovirus protein (Mx), zebrafish retrovirus long terminal repeat (LTR) and carp β-actin (AE6), were combined with those of CMV to design alternative hybrid promoters. The substitution of CMV core and/or enhancer with the corresponding elements of Mx or the LTR core maintained a similar in vitro protein G expression level than that obtained by using the CMV promoter. Vectors using the dsRNA-inducible Mx enhancer followed either by the LTR or the AE6 cores showed the highest in vitro protein G expression levels. Furthermore, synthetic constructs using the Mx enhancer maintained their polyI:C induction capabilities despite the core used. Some of these hybrid promoters might contribute to the development of all-fish-vectors for DNA vaccines while others might be useful for more basic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenhancer elements 3ahybrids 3asepticemia 3acarp 3abiotechnology 3aplasmids 3ahomologous recombination 3avaccination 3aviruses 3agenes 3arecombinant vaccines 3aterminal repeat sequences 3aactin 3aDanio rerio 3atrout 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 0aEnhancers 0aCores 0aFish DNA vaccines 0aHuman herpesvirus 5 0aVHSV 0aSynthetic promoters1 aChinchilla, B.1 aEncinas, P.1 aGomez-Casado, E.1 aEstepa, A.1 aColl, J.M.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2013 Mar., v. 164 p.171-178dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013800209300001800347520142600365592002801791650001701819650002501836650001901861650002901880650001101909650001701920650000901937650001401946653002801960653003401988653003302022653003502055653001702090653002902107773014002136856008302276852000902359655001202368IND60542669820221122122336.0190405e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054266982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMay-Davis, Sharon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2474-702414aThe Occurrence of a Congenital Malformation in the Sixth and Seventh Cervical Vertebrae Predominantly Observed in Thoroughbred Horses  ap. 1313-1317.  aDuring the dissection and skeletal examination of 123 horses, it was observed that a significant number had a gross skeletal congenital malformation of the sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae. In the sixth cervical vertebra (C6), either a unilateral or bilateral absence of the caudal ventral tubercle (CVT) was noted. In the presence of the C6 malformation, the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) presented either as normal or with a unilateral or bilateral transposition of the CVT from C6 onto the ventral surface of C7 with an arterial foramen. This transposition onto C7 was noted to be present on the corresponding side as the absent CVT on C6. Of the 123 horses examined, the congenital malformation of C6 was noted in 19 of 50 Thoroughbred horses; three of three Thoroughbred derivative horses; one of 15 nondescript bred horses; and none of 55 purpose bred horses of mixed breeds. In total, 23 horses expressed a C6 congenital malformation of which 22 were Thoroughbreds or Thoroughbred derivatives. Of these 22 Thoroughbred and Thoroughbred derivative horses, 11 of 22 expressed either a unilateral or bilateral transposition of the CVT from C6 onto the ventral surface of C7 with an arterial foramen on the corresponding side. This malformation could have functional and clinical ramifications in the postural and locomotive properties of the equine neck and cervicothoracic junction as reported in other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3aabnormal development 3acervical spine 3acongenital abnormalities 3ahorses 3amixed breeds 3aneck 3avertebrae 0aCongenital malformation 0aCaudal ventral tubercle (CVT) 0aSixth cervical vertebra (C6) 0aSeventh cervical vertebra (C7) 0aThoroughbred 0aCervicothoracic junction0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 34, no. 11-12 p.1313-1317dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04517naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245013700177300001800314520270800332592002803040650001103068650002803079650002103107650002403128650001403152650001203166650001003178650001403188650001203202650002603214650001303240650002003253653001603273653001503289653001903304653003703323653001603360653001103376653000803387653000803395653000703403653000703410653000803417653000803425653000703433653000703440653000803447653000703455653000803462653000803470700002203478700002403500700002003524700002403544700002403568700002203592700003803614773011203652856008203764852000903846655001203855IND60696985920221122202945.0200601e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069698592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2019.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLooijaard, Willem G.P.M.10aIdentifying critically ill patients with low muscle mass: Agreement between bioelectrical impedance analysis and computed tomography  ap. 1809-1817.  aLow muscle mass and -quality on ICU admission, as assessed by muscle area and -density on CT-scanning at lumbar level 3 (L3), are associated with increased mortality. However, CT-scan analysis is not feasible for standard care. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) assesses body composition by incorporating the raw measurements resistance, reactance, and phase angle in equations. Our purpose was to compare BIA- and CT-derived muscle mass, to determine whether BIA identified the patients with low skeletal muscle area on CT-scan, and to determine the relation between raw BIA and raw CT measurements.This prospective observational study included adult intensive care patients with an abdominal CT-scan. CT-scans were analysed at L3 level for skeletal muscle area (cm²) and skeletal muscle density (Hounsfield Units). Muscle area was converted to muscle mass (kg) using the Shen equation (MMCT). BIA was performed within 72 h of the CT-scan. BIA-derived muscle mass was calculated by three equations: Talluri (MMTₐₗₗᵤᵣᵢ), Janssen (MMJₐₙₛₛₑₙ), and Kyle (MMKyₗₑ). To compare BIA- and CT-derived muscle mass correlations, bias, and limits of agreement were calculated. To test whether BIA identifies low skeletal muscle area on CT-scan, ROC-curves were constructed. Furthermore, raw BIA and CT measurements, were correlated and raw CT-measurements were compared between groups with normal and low phase angle.110 patients were included. Mean age 59 ± 17 years, mean APACHE II score 17 (11–25); 68% male. MMTₐₗₗᵤᵣᵢ and MMJₐₙₛₛₑₙ were significantly higher (36.0 ± 9.9 kg and 31.5 ± 7.8 kg, respectively) and MMKyₗₑ significantly lower (25.2 ± 5.6 kg) than MMCT (29.2 ± 6.7 kg). For all BIA-derived muscle mass equations, a proportional bias was apparent with increasing disagreement at higher muscle mass. MMTₐₗₗᵤᵣᵢ correlated strongest with CT-derived muscle mass (r = 0.834, p < 0.001) and had good discriminative capacity to identify patients with low skeletal muscle area on CT-scan (AUC: 0.919 for males; 0.912 for females). Of the raw measurements, phase angle and skeletal muscle density correlated best (r = 0.701, p < 0.001). CT-derived skeletal muscle area and -density were significantly lower in patients with low compared to normal phase angle.Although correlated, absolute values of BIA- and CT-derived muscle mass disagree, especially in the high muscle mass range. However, BIA and CT identified the same critically ill population with low skeletal muscle area on CT-scan. Furthermore, low phase angle corresponded to low skeletal muscle area and -density.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02555670).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody composition 3acomputed tomography 3aequations 3afemales 3amales 3amortality 3amuscles 3aobservational studies 3apatients 3askeletal muscle 0aMuscle mass 0aSarcopenia 0aIntensive care 0aBioelectrical impedance analysis 0aPhase angle 0aAPACHE 0aAUC 0aBIA 0aCI 0aCT 0aFFM 0aICU 0aL3 0aMM 0aROC 0aSD 0aSMA 0aSMD1 aStapel, Sandra N.1 aDekker, Ingeborg M.1 aRusticus, Hanna1 aRemmelzwaal, Sharon1 aGirbes, Armand R.J.1 aWeijs, Peter J.M.1 aStraaten, Heleen M.

Among these, HPV-transgenic mice are some of the most frequently employed. After some initial unsuccessful attempts, researchers have succeeded in targeting the expression of one or more HPV-16 oncogenes to squamous epithelia, closely mimicking the lesions observed in cancer patients. The present review describes the relevance and usefulness of these animal models in understanding the tumour-associated immune response and developing new preventive and therapeutic strategies for HPV-associated cancers. In particular, this review details the importance of transgenic mice for dissecting and modulating relevant aspects of the tumour-associated immune response. Other animal models for studying papillomaviral diseases are briefly mentioned, along with their respective advantages and limitations. HPV-transgenic mouse strains remain reliable, versatile and commodious, even if perhaps underestimated, animal models for studying HPV-induced multi-step carcinogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenesis 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3apatients 3atransgenic animals 0aAP-1 0aBPV 0aCCL 0aCD 0aCIN 0aCOX 0aCpG 0aCPV 0aCRPV 0aCXCL 0aDC 0aDFMO 0aFASL 0aFcγR 0aHIF 0aHNSCC 0aHPV 0aIBD 0aK14 0aMC 0amiR 0aMMP 0aMmuPV1 0aNF-κB 0aNK 0apRb 0aSCC 0aSTAT 0aTAM 0aTAM67 0aTh 0aTIMP 0aTLR 0aTRAIL 0aTreg 0aVEGF 0ahuman papillomavirus 0acarcinogenesis 0aimmune response 0atransgenic mouse models1 aVilanova, Manuel1 aMedeiros, Rui1 aGil da Costa, Rui M.0 tVirus research.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009300171300001600264520111800280592002801398653001201426653001301438653002201451653001501473653003201488700001601520773014601536856008201682852000901764655001201773IND60554818820221121235128.0161025e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055481882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jshs.2013.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheehan, Dwayne P.14aThe effects of a daily, 6-week exergaming curriculum on balance in fourth grade children  ap. 131-137.  aBalance is an essential component of movement and is critical in the ability to participate in physical activity. Developing an exergaming curriculum for schools has the potential to improve balance or postural stability in children. In this study, a purposely-built exergaming center in an elementary school was used to test fourth grade students with a specially designed exergaming curriculum oriented toward improving postural stability. The program was implemented over a 6-week period, 34 min per day, 4–5 days per week. Two control groups were used: (1) a physical education (PE) class geared toward agility, balance, and coordination (ABC) improvement, and (2) a typical PE curriculum class. Exergaming students improved their postural stability significantly over a 6-week period compared to those in the typical PE class. Improvements in postural stability were also evident in the ABC class. Postural stability in the girls was better than the boys in all pre- and post-intervention tests. This study demonstrates that exergaming is a practical resource in the PE class to improve postural stability.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBalance 0aChildren 0aElementary school 0aExergaming 0aFundamental movement skills1 aKatz, Larry0 tJournal of Sport and Health Science.g2013 Sept., v. 2 p.131-137dElsevier B.V.aShanghai University of SportwJournal:23381x2095-25467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2013.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245012100172300001600293520114900309592002801458596005701486596006501543596009201608596009901700650001601799650002001815650002001835650001101855650003301866650003301899650005801932650001301990650002302003700002302026700002502049773013502074856007902209852000902288655001202297IND60673269920221123043612.0191018e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067326992DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmz0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMollahosseini, Afsaneh10aCentral Composite Design for Dispersive Liquid–liquid Microextraction of 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol in Human Serum  ap. 575-581.  aThe human body’s vitamin D levels are determined by measuring the level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D₃ (25-OH-vitamin D₃) in human serum. In this research, a fast, simple, efficient and highly sensitive low-density solvent based on dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) was employed for the successful determination of 25-OH-vitamin D₃ from complex human serum matrices. Reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography was used as a powerful technique. The important parameters in the low-density solvent–DLLME method were optimized using response surface methodology based on central composite design. The calibration curves displayed a high level of linearity (R² > 0.997) for 25-OH-vitamin D₃ in the range of 2–500 ng mL⁻¹. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 0.6 ng mL⁻¹ and 1.9 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. The relative standard deviation for the seven analyses was 7.1%. The relative recoveries of vitamin D₃ in spiked human serum samples were between 85% and 97%. The amount of 25-OH-vitamin D₃ in samples was determined using the proposed method and acceptable results were reported.  aPublisher supplied data  a958913cElite Researcher Grant Committee under award  cNational Institutes for Medical Research Development (NIMAD)  cIran University of Science and Technology (IUST)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006766  cNational Nutrition & Food Technology Research Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100008036 3ablood serum 3acholecalciferol 3adetection limit 3ahumans 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3aresponse surface methodology 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asolvents 3astandard deviation1 aKamankesh, Marzieh1 aMohammadi, Abdorreza0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2019 July 01, v. 57, no. 6 p.575-581dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmz0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013700163500001900300520097300319592002801292650001401320650001901334650001901353650001301372650001301385650001501398653003201413653002601445653001401471653002401485700001701509700001601526700005601542773009401598856008201692852000901774655001201783IND60739134320221120222721.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1322032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Shihao10aSelective and mild sulfoxidation of 2-sulfylbenzothiazole using hydroperoxides derived from cyclohexanone in the absence of catalyst  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlkyl hydroperoxides derived from cyclohexanone are attractive oxidants because they are easily available, more reactive than TBHP but much less acidic than m-CPBA. Wherein 1,1′-peroxybis(1-hydroperoxycyclohexane) (C) can be generated by the current simply method and displays the excellent reactivity and selectivity based on oxidative reactions of various benzothiazolyl sulfides substituted by different function groups. The research found that the reactions can be performed in the absence of catalyst and under very mild conditions optimized. Yields of sulfoxides is higher than 90%, no or a little reaction happened at the proximal double bond、 N and S atoms in the benzothiazolyl moiety. Phenyl sulfide as the substrates was also examined for the reaction scope test. The results show that they were uniquely and completely oxidized to sulfoxides in 1 h.

(Synurophyceae) reveals that the complex cell architecture observed on modern synurophytes was well established by the middle Eocene  ap. 273-279.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMallomonas, the largest genus within the class Synurophyceae, consists of unicellular, flagellated, heterokont organisms each with an external cell covering comprised of species-specific overlapping siliceous scales. Most species also possess bristles, which are elongated needle-like siliceous structures that radiate out from the scale coat. A new fossil species, Mallomonas aperturae, is described from the middle Eocene Giraffe Pipe locality situated near the Arctic Circle in northern Canada. The new species possesses uniquely sculptured tripartite scales, each possessing a well-developed V-rib, dome and anterior wing-like extensions. The most unique feature is a large and elongated opening along the posterior side of the dome, a structure known only on scales of the modern species, Mallomonas paludosa (Synurophyceae). It is proposed that the opening on the dome may provide a means for securing bristles to the scales and aiding in bristle rotation. Remarkably, remains of cells with scales still in position were recovered from Giraffe Pipe mudstones, allowing for examination of the alignment and overlapping nature of scales making up the cell covering. The V-rib and anterior wing structures on the scale surface were used to precisely space and orient the scales, indicating that the ability to produce a highly structured cell covering, a hallmark of synurophyte algae, was well established by the middle Eocene. This evidence further supports the hypothesis that fossil species bearing scales with well-developed V-ribs can be used as a marker for the ability of the organism to build a highly organised cell covering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aMallomonas 3afossils 3anew species 3aArctic region 3aCanada 0aEocene 0aExtinct 0aFossil 0aGiraffe Pipe 0aSynurophyceae 0aSynurophytes 0aV-rib0 tPhycologia.g2018 May 1, v. 57, no. 3 p.273-279dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/17-112.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01277naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002500169245014300194300001600337520029300353592002800646653002100674653001600695653001900711653001600730653001300746773011400759856011700873852000900990655001200999IND60124957920221116233801.0151101e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495792DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0135:AUNSOM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuchmore, William B.13aAN unusual new species of mundochthonius from a cave in colorado, with comments on mundochthonius montanus (pseudoscorpiones, chthoniidae)  ap. 135-140.  aMundochthonius singularis, a troglomorphic species from Fly Cave in Fremont County, Colorado, is described.

RS3 was prepared using a method combined with debranching modification and physical modification; native and modifies starches were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rapid visco analyzer (RVA). Use of the enzymatic and physical modification methodology, improved the yield of RS (26.62%) from Musa AAB. A reduced viscosity and swelling power; increased transition temperatures, water absorption capacity and solubility index with B-type crystalline pattern and loss of granular appearance were observed during the debranching modification and physical modification. The modified starches exhibited beneficial health effects in diabetic and HFD rats who consumed it. These results recommend that dietary feeding of RS3 was effective in the regulation of glucose and lipid profile in serum and suppressing the oxidative stress in rats under diabetic and HFD condition. This current study provides new bioactive starches, with potential applications in the food and non-food industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanimal disease models 3abananas 3abioactive properties 3ablood serum 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3afunctional foods 3aglucose 3alipid composition 3amodified starch 3anonfood industry 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aresistant starch 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater binding capacity 0aAmylose 0aBanana 0aDiabetes 0aModification 0aPullulanase 0aResistant starch1 aSuriya, M.1 aVidya, P.V.1 aHaripriya, Sundaramoorthy0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Jan., v. 94 p.500-507dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245015700164300001600321520136900337592002801706596002201734650001301756650003201769650001601801650004301817650001301860650001101873650002401884650001801908650001501926700001501941700006701956700001902023700005702042773013502099856007902234852000902313655001202322IND60673270120221119225336.0191018e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067327012DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmz0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorge, Nadine10aSurface Design of Enantiomeric HPLC Separation on Vancomycin and Teicoplanin-Based Stationary Phases, a Tool for Chiral Recognition of Model β-Blockers  ap. 485-494.  aA quality-by-design approach was adopted for enantioseparation of atenolol on Vancomycin and Teicoplanin-based chiral stationary phases using reversed phase (RP) mode and polar ionic mode (PIM), respectively to account for major forces involved in enantiorecognition of β-blockers on macrocyclics. A fractional factorial screening design for the two modes; followed by a central composite optimization design and regression analysis were able to point out critical factors and chromatographic responses and robust surface of the design. Within the studied range of flow the optimal was 0.3 mL/min for Chirobiotic T and 1 mL/min for Chirobiotic V. In PIM, a composition of 100% methanol was mandatory to compromise between best separation and least retention with equal amounts of the acid and base modifiers for enantiomers of atenolol, as model drug in addition to metoprolol and pindolol as structurally related compounds for possible extrapolation of results on members of the same class. However, in RP mode, only triethylamine acetate was needed as buffer for atenolol enantiomers. Chiral recognition of atenolol in both elution modes, further confirmed via extrapolation of the models on the two other β-blockers showed that ionic interactions rather than any other forces governed chiral recognition on the two macrocyclic stationary phases in both modes.  aPublisher supplied data  cGerman University 3aacetates 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3aenantiomers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3atriethylamine 3avancomycin1 aHerz, Magy1 aAboul-Enein, Hassan Y.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0249-70091 aShihata, Lamia1 aHanafi, Rasha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8196-51080 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2019 July 01, v. 57, no. 6 p.485-494dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmz0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01325naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245010200192300001600294520044700310592002800757653001900785653001300804653001400817773011400831856011700945852000901062655001201071IND60124958020221116234101.0151101e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495802DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0141:SOCCWA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJudson, Mark L.

Cats feel confident in their familiar surroundings and daily routine. A visit, and transport, to the veterinarian is a stressful experience for cats and their owners. Stress can mask clinical signs and has physiological impacts. Alpha-s1 casozepin (Zylkène; Vétoquinol) could potentially minimize stress in cats with its calming and anxiolytic characteristics. A randomized, partial double-blind and placebo-controlled study was carried out with 60 adult cats. The trial was designed for three groups: low dose (15 mg/kg q24 h α-s1 casozepin for six days), high dose (75 mg/kg q24 h α-s1 casozepin for three days), and a placebo (one fructose capsule per day for three days). For the study, cats had a checkup at their trusted veterinarian without the dietary supplement, followed by a second one four weeks later. Alpha-s1 casozepin or a placebo was administered three to six days before the checkup. Fecal cortisol metabolites (FCMs) were measured to non-invasively evaluate the impact of α-s1 casozepin on adrenocortical activity. The cat owners and veterinarians also assessed the physiological reactions (respiratory rate, sweaty paws, pupils, panting, and vocalization) of the cats at home, in the waiting area, and in the examination room. The only significant effect (kappa coefficient κ = 0.007 and κ = 0.003) found in this study was the absence of sweaty paws in cats who were treated with the high dose of α-s1 casozepin over three days, observed in the waiting area and examination room of the veterinarian’s practice, respectively. Alpha-s1 casozepin also showed a small but insignificant reduction in FCM levels. Alpha-s1 casozepin influences the autonomic nervous system, and can inhibit sweaty paws during stressful situations for cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aautonomic nervous system 3acortisol 3adietary supplements 3afructose 3ametabolites 3aplacebos 3arespiratory rate 3atranquilizers 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary clinics 3avocalization1 aIben, Christine 1 aPalme, Rupert 0 tAnimals.g2020 Nov. 05, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101120473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01303naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245011200210300001200322520022100334592002800555653001300583653001600596653001900612653004200631653002000673700001800693700001700711700005400728773009200782856008200874852000900956655001200965IND60557700420221121194356.0161103e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055770042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nmni.2016.07.0142doi7 aPMC49953822pmcid7 a275950042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTidjani Alou, M.10a‘Lachnoclostridium massiliosenegalense’, a new bacterial species isolated from the human gut microbiota  ap. 4-5.  aWe report the main characteristics of ‘Lachnoclostridium massiliosenegalense’ strain mt23T (=CSUR P299 =DSM 102084), a new bacterial species isolated from the gut microbiota of a healthy young girl from Senegal.  aPublisher supplied data 0aanaerobe 0aculturomics 0agut microbiota 0aLachnoclostridium massiliosenegalense 0ataxono-genomics1 aLagier, J.-C.1 aLa Scola, B.1 aCassir, N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5276-69860 tNew Microbes and New Infections.g2016 Nov., v. 14 p.4-5dElsevier Ltdx2052-29757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2016.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012800165300001600293520121700309592002801526653000801554653001301562653001201575653001201587653001801599653002401617700001501641700002101656700001701677700001401694700001301708700001701721773014501738856008201883852000901965655001201974IND60554819020221121210820.0161025e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055481902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jshs.2013.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, BeiBei,12aA 6-week diet and exercise intervention alters metabolic syndrome risk factors in obese Chinese children aged 11–13 years  ap. 236-241.  aA randomized, controlled trial was conducted to determine whether a 6-week low calorie diet and aerobic exercise intervention could alter metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors in pre-pubescent obese Chinese children.The subjects were randomized into diet and exercise (DE) and control (C) groups. The DE group ingested 1600–2000 kcal/day adjusted to each participant's basal metabolic rate, and engaged in high-volume aerobic exercise (6 days/week, twice daily, for 3 h per session) for 6 weeks. A total of 215 obese children between the ages of 11 and 13 years were recruited into the study, with 167 subjects (DE, n = 95; C, n = 72) completing all phases. Pre- and post-study measures included body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure and other MetS-related markers from fasting blood samples (serum cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and glucose).Compared to controls, the DE subjects experienced significantly reduced levels for all outcome markers (p < 0.05), except for fasting blood glucose in boys (p = 0.09).An intensive, 6-week diet and exercise intervention had favorable effects in altering MetS risk factors in obese Chinese children aged 11 to 13.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBMI 0aChildren 0aInsulin 0aObesity 0aTriglycerides 0aWaist circumference1 aYang, Yang1 aNieman, David C.1 aZhang, Yajun1 aWang, Jie1 aWang, Ru1 aChen, Peijie0 tJournal of Sport and Health Science.g2013 Dec., v. 2 p.236-241dElsevier B.V.aShanghai University of SportwJournal:23381x2095-25467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2013.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03822naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012500179300001600304520173300320592002802053650001802081650002802099650001702127650001602144650002302160650001902183650001402202650001502216650001602231650000902247650002302256650001202279650004202291650003902333650004702372650003602419650005802455650003502513650003102548650000902579650004302588650003502631650003702666650000902703650002102712650003202733650001102765650002602776700002002802700001802822700001402840700001202854700001702866700001902883700001602902700002002918700002102938700002002959773010002979856004803079852000903127655001203136IND4484444120221118013357.0120317e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448444412DNAL7 a222779922pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-011-1298-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerner, A.10aBiomimetic tubular nanofiber mesh and platelet rich plasma-mediated delivery of BMP-7 for large bone defect regeneration  ap. 603-612.  aThere is a growing need for successful bone tissue engineering strategies and advanced biomaterials that mimic the structure and function of native tissues carry great promise. Successful bone repair approaches may include an osteoconductive scaffold, osteoinductive growth factors, cells with an osteogenic potential and capacity for graft vascularisation. To increase osteoinductivity of biomaterials, the local combination and delivery of growth factors has been developed. In the present study we investigated the osteogenic effects of calcium phosphate (CaP)-coated nanofiber mesh tube-mediated delivery of BMP-7 from a PRP matrix for the regeneration of critical sized segmental bone defects in a small animal model. Bilateral full-thickness diaphyseal segmental defects were created in twelve male Lewis rats and nanofiber mesh tubes were placed around the defect. Defects received either treatment with a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube (n = 6), an un-coated nanofiber mesh tube (n=6) a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube with PRP (n=6) or a CaP-coated nanofiber mesh tube in combination with 5 μg BMP-7 and PRP (n = 6). After 12 weeks, bone volume and biomechanical properties were evaluated using radiography, microCT, biomechanical testing and histology. The results demonstrated significantly higher biomechanical properties and bone volume for the BMP group compared to the control groups. These results were supported by the histological evaluations, where BMP group showed the highest rate of bone regeneration within the defect. In conclusion, BMP-7 delivery via PRP enhanced functional bone defect regeneration, and together these data support the use of BMP-7 in the treatment of critical sized defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomechanics 3abiomimetics 3acalcium phosphates 3agrowth factors 3ahistology 3ananofibers 3aradiography 3arats 3atissue engineering 2aAnimals 2aBiomechanical Phenomenaxdrug effects 2aBiomimetic Materialsxpharmacology 2aBone Morphogenetic Protein 7xpharmacology 2aBone Regenerationxdrug effects 2aBone and Bonesxdrug effectsxpathologyxradiography. 2aDrug Delivery Systemsxmethods 2aImaging, Three-Dimensional 2aMale 2aNanofibersxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aOsseointegrationxdrug effects 2aPlatelet-Rich Plasmaxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Lew 2aTissue Scaffoldsxchemistry 2aTorque 2aX-Ray Microtomography1 aBoerckel, J.

Early spring phenological phenomena are particularly important because the end of diapause or dormancy is related not only to heat accumulation in the early spring but also probably to winter low temperatures. Although a warmer winter can reduce overwintering mortality in many insects and plants, it also reduces the accumulation of chilling time that often triggers the end of diapause or dormancy. We examined a continuous 67-year time series of the first flowering date of cherry trees and compared three phenological models based on the temperature-dependent developmental rate: (i) the accumulated degree days (ADD) method, (ii) the number of days transferred to a standardized temperature (DTS) method, and (iii) the accumulated developmental progress (ADP) method. The ADP method performed the best but only slightly better than the DTS method. We further explained the residuals from the ADP method by an additive model using the mean winter minimum daily temperatures, the number of days with low temperatures (represented by daily minimum temperature) below a critical low temperature, and the minimum annual extreme temperature. These three temperature variables explained more than 57.5% deviance of the ADP model residuals. Increased mean winter low temperatures can delay the blooming of cherry trees by reducing the accumulation of chilling time, whereas reduced numbers of cold days can shift the blooming to become earlier. Overall, rising winter low temperatures will delay the flowering time, while rising early spring temperatures directly shift earlier the flowering time. The flowering time has been shifted to earlier, and the balance from the opposing effects of rising winter low temperatures and early spring temperatures explains this shift.  aPublisher supplied data  cChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  cNational Research Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000115120 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadenosine diphosphate 3abiological development 3acherries 3aclimate 3acold treatment 3adiapause 3adormancy 3aflowering date 3aheat 3aheat sums 3ainsects 3amodels 3amortality 3aoverwintering 3aphenology 3aspring 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3awinter 0aCherry trees 0aDegree days 0aDevelopmental progress 0aDevelopmental rate 0aRoot mean squared error1 aChen, Zhenghong1 aReddy, Gadi V.P.1 aHui, Cang1 aHuang, Jianguo1 aXiao, Mei0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 June 15, v. 240-241 p.78-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5663479  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013700167300001800304520174700322592002802069650001702097650002102114650002302135650002002158650001402178650002002192650001502212650001002227650001902237650001602256650001402272650001702286653001302303653001202316653001202328653001602340700001802356700001902374700005002393700002002443773014002463856008302603852000902686655001202695IND60542670220221121025324.0190405e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054267022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhadimi, Vahid10aPositive Effect of Manganese (III) Meso-Tetrakis (4-Benzoic Acid) Porphyrin on Stallion Spermatozoa During Storage in Cool Condition  ap. 1329-1332.  aThe aim of the present study was to assess the effect of manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (Mn-TBAP) on stallion sperm quality during storage at 5°C. In the present study, 18 ejaculates from three stallions were collected and diluted by INRA82 extender containing 0 (Mn-0), 100 (Mn-100), 200 (Mn-200), and 300 (Mn-300) μM of Mn-TBAP. Sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity and functionality, and lipid peroxidation as indicated by malondialdehyde (MDA) in the spermatozoa of diluted semen were evaluated in vitro at 2, 24, and 48 hours after storage at 5°C. The results showed that all evaluated sperm parameters, except MDA concentration, decreased significantly during the storage period. Total and progressive motility of spermatozoa were higher in Mn-200 extender (46.75 ± 0.58 and 27.62 ± 0.6, respectively) compared with Mn-0 (44.43 ± 0.58 and 25.13 ± 0.6, respectively) and Mn-300 (43.95 ± 0.58 and 25.28 ± 0.6, respectively) after 48 hours of storage at 5°C (P < .05). In addition, sperm plasma integrity and functionality were higher in Mn-200 extender (53.12 ± 0.6 and 46.63 ± 0.78, respectively) compared with Mn-0 (47.74 ± 0.6 and 40.96 ± 0.78, respectively), Mn-100 (48.63 ± 0.6 and 41.99 ± 078, respectively), and Mn-300 (46.11 ± 0.6 and 3.75 ± 0.78, respectively) after 48 hours of storage at 5°C (P < .05). The result showed also that MDA level was lower in Mn-100 extender (3.91 ± 0.06) compared with Mn-0 (4.51 ± 0.06), Mn-200 (4.25 ± 0.06), and Mn-300 (4.75 ± 0.06) after 48 hours of storage at 5°C (P < .05). In conclusion, INRA82 extender supplemented with 200-μM Mn-TBAP could efficiently preserve Caspian stallion spermatozoa after 48 hours of storage at 5°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold storage 3ain vitro studies 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amanganese 3aplasma membrane 3aporphyrins 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3astallions 3astorage time 0aStallion 0aCooling 0aMn-TBAP 0aSpermatozoa1 aZhandi, Mahdi1 aTowhidi, Armin1 aShehab-El-Deen, Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed Mahmoud1 aNouri, Houshang0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 34, no. 11-12 p.1329-1332dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245011100166300001400277520120400291592002801495650002501523650001501548650002201563650000901585651001201594700002201606700002401628773009501652856008301747852000901830655001201839IND4475291720221120021456.0150812e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447529172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDam, Tuyet Thi10aAdequacy of policy and practices for small agricultural dam safety accountability and assurance in Vietnam  ap. 63-74.  aWe examine safety data pertaining to ten dams in Vietnam and we conduct interviews with stakeholders to determine their perceptions of the adequacy of dam safety policy. All ten dams in our study were rated as âhighâ hazard and face a high risk of failure due to both physical and management inadequacies. The responsibility and accountability for dam safety has been poorly implemented, leading to low levels of assurance for the communities affected. The evidence suggests that policies pertaining to dam safety accountability and assurance in Vietnam do not yet satisfy international benchmarks. The established policy benchmarks and their key elements provide guidance on both aspirational and essential policy reform in Vietnam; the minimum practice benchmark representing a baseline expectation for developing countries. The original contribution of the paper is two-fold: (i) we assess for the first time the adequacy of dam safety policy and practices in Vietnam and (ii) our process of assessment can be replicated in other similar developing countries for testing the adequacy of dam safety policy against international standards and for identifying any necessary policy reforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3aVietnam1 aBurritt, Roger L.1 aPisaniello, John D.0 tAgricultural water management.g2012 Sept., v. 112 p.63-74dElsevier B.V.x0378-37747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245019400170300001600364520162700380592002802007596004902035650000802084650001702092650003802109650001402147650002002161650002102181650002102202650001602223650002302239650001802262650001002280650001802290650001202308650001502320650004302335650002102378650001302399650001202412700002102424700001902445773013402464856007902598852000902677655001202686IND60673270420221119225623.0191018e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067327042DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmz0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeheshti, Abolghasem10aDetermination of Cholesterol and its Derivatives in Nanoliposomes as Drug Delivery Conveyances by HPLC–UV: A Simple, Accurate and Cost-Effective Method Development and Validation Approach  ap. 469-475.  aNanoliposomes are extensively used as ideal vehicles in drug delivery systems due to their unique biocompatibility and biodegradability properties. They can be used as sustained release and target selective conveyances to deliver the encapsulated drugs at specific cells or tissues by improving their efficacy along with reducing the side effects. As an analytical perspective, the determination of various lipid components in the final formulation is one of the practical issues while the agents are applied in an industrial-scale. Herein, the maximum ultra violet (UV) absorbances for the most of the lipids are within 200–210 nm that cause significant cut-off conflicts with the general solvents or additives of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) during its method development procedure. In this study, a simple, accurate and cost-effective isocratic HPLC–UV method has been successfully developed for the simultaneous determination of α-(3-O-cholesteryloxy)-δ-(N-ethylmorpholine)-succineamide (MoChol), cholesteryl-hemisuccinate (Chems) and Cholesterol in nanoliposomes drug carriers containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient (anti-BCL-2 DNA oligonucleotide). The isocratic mobile phase consisted of ethanol/acetonitrile/water including trifluoroacetic acid (60/30/10 with 0.1% v/v, respectively) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min⁻¹ was run through a commercial reverse-phase C₁₈ analytical column while UV detector was set at 202 nm. To confirm the applicability, a full validation of the proposed method was performed according to the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data  cTofigh Daru Research and Engineering Company 3aDNA 3aacetonitrile 3aactive pharmaceutical ingredients 3aadditives 3aadverse effects 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acholesterol 3acost effectiveness 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aethanol 3aguidelines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoligonucleotides 3asolvents 3atissues1 aGhaffari, Solmaz1 aFarahani, Hadi0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2019 May 01, v. 57, no. 5 p.469-475dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmz0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01446naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245010400189300001600293520049100309592002800800653001000828653001300838653001400851653001100865653001500876700002500891773011400916856011701030852000901147655001201156IND60124958420221116234147.0151101e200108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012495842DNAL7 a10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0201:DOHANG]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, James W.10aDescription of hakka, a new genus of jumping spider (araneae, salticidae) from hawaii and east asia  ap. 201-204.  aWe describe a new genus for a jumping spider that was originally placed in the large genus Menemerus Simon 1868, from which the new genus is clearly different.

Human dermal fibroblasts are key cells for tissue replacement during wound healing. Thus, any biomaterial for wound healing applications should enable growth, differentiation and matrix synthesis by these cells.Cryogels are highly porous scaffolds consisting of a network of interconnected pores. Here, we used a novel group of cryogels generated from acrylated hyaluronan where the polymerization was initiated by accelerated electrons (E-beam). This novel procedure omits any toxic polymerization initiators and results in sterile, highly elastic scaffolds with adjustable pore size, excellent swelling and low flow resistance properties.We show that these cryogels are effective 3D-substrates for long-term cultures of human dermal fibroblasts in vitro. The cells proliferate for at least 28days throughout the cryogels and deposit their own matrix in the pores. Moreover, key modulators of dermal fibroblasts during wound healing like TGFβ and PDGF efficiently stimulated the expression of wound healing-relevant genes.In conclusion, electron beam initiated cryogels of acrylated hyaluronan represent a functional and cell compatible biomaterial that could be adapted for special wound healing applications by further functionalization.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abioengineering 3aelectrons 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3aflow resistance 3ahuman cell lines 3ahyaluronic acid 3amedicine 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3atissue repair 3atoxicity 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aElectron-beam cryogels 0aHyaluronan acrylate 0aFibroblast 0aProliferation 0aMatrix synthesis 0aGene expression1 aKutz, L.M.1 aOehmichen, S.1 aBecher, J.1 aHeymann, K.1 aSaalbach, A.1 aKnolle, W.1 aSchnabelrauch, M.1 aReichelt, S.1 aAnderegg, U.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017 Jan., v. 94 p.611-620dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2016.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245012400178300001400302520158100316592002801897650000801925650001501933650001901948650001601967650002201983650002502005650001902030650001902049650001602068653000802084653000802092653000802100653000902108653000902117653000802126653000802134653002602142653000802168653003102176653001902207653002702226653002702253700002602280700002302306700002102329773009002350856008302440852000902523655001202532IND60611817720221117232650.0180904e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeaton-Green, Lindsay A.10aFoundations of identifying individual chromosomes by imaging flow cytometry with applications in radiation biodosimetry  ap. 18-24.  aBiodosimetry is an important tool for triage in the case of large-scale radiological or nuclear emergencies, but traditional microscope-based methods can be tedious and prone to scorer fatigue. While the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been adapted for use in triage situations, it is still time-consuming to create and score slides. Recent adaptations of traditional biodosimetry assays to imaging flow cytometry (IFC) methods have dramatically increased throughput. Additionally, recent improvements in image analysis algorithms in the IFC software have resulted in improved specificity for spot counting of small events. In the IFC method for the dicentric chromosome analysis (FDCA), lymphocytes isolated from whole blood samples are cultured with PHA and Colcemid. After incubation, lymphocytes are treated with a hypotonic solution and chromosomes are isolated in suspension, labelled with a centromere marker and stained for DNA content with DRAQ5. Stained individual chromosomes are analyzed on the ImageStream®X (EMD-Millipore, Billerica, MA) and mono- and dicentric chromosome populations are identified and enumerated using advanced image processing techniques. Both the preparation of the isolated chromosome suspensions as well as the image analysis methods were fine-tuned in order to optimize the FDCA. In this paper we describe the method to identify and score centromeres in individual chromosomes by IFC and show that the FDCA method may further improve throughput for triage biodosimetry in the case of large-scale radiological or nuclear emergencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalgorithms 3ablood sampling 3acentromeres 3acomputer software 3acytogenetic analysis 3aflow cytometry 3aimage analysis 3alymphocytes 0aCIB 0aDCA 0aEDF 0aFDCA 0aFISH 0aIFC 0aPNA 0aChromosome aberration 0aDNA 0aDicentric chromosome assay 0aImageStream®X 0aImaging flow cytometry 0aRadiation biodosimetry1 aRodrigues, Matthew A.1 aLachapelle, Sylvie1 aWilkins, Ruth C.0 tMethods.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 112 p.18-24dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014500171300001400316520174300330592002802073650002102101650000802122650002002130650001102150650001902161650001102180650002602191650001202217650001302229650000902242650001302251650001902264650001502283650002202298650001102320650001802331650001002349650001902359650002102378650001502399653001302414653002302427653001202450653001402462653002002476653001502496700002202511700002202533700001902555773012502574856008802699852000902787655001202796IND60566348020221122091411.0190318e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056634802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hailong10aAssessing the environmental controls on Scots pine transpiration and the implications for water partitioning in a boreal headwater catchment  ap. 58-66.  aClimate change projections indicate reduced summer precipitation and increased air temperature for the northern high latitudes. These climate changes are likely to alter forest water budgets of which plant transpiration (T) forms a significant component. Plant transpiration is regulated by stomata behavior of particular species, which is constrained by ambient air and soil conditions. Here, we measured sap flow in a Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) plantation in a low energy Scottish headwater catchment during the main summer growth period. Effects of rainfall on forest transpiration, as well as the response of T to four environmental variables were investigated at a daily scale. In this boreal environment, transpiration was mainly restricted by radiation and vapor pressure deficit. Air temperature was the least important controlling factor. Soil water became an important factor when rainfall was limited. Frequent but small rain events dictated that precipitation met short-term transpiration demand most of the time. The trees needed supplementary water from antecedent soil water stores when weekly rainfall was below ∼8mm, but such periods were rare. Water exchange mainly occurred in the canopy or upper 10cm of the soil, with 47% of rainfall transpired, 45% intercepted and <8% evaporated from the soil surface. Understanding interactions between forests and their hydroclimate, as well as the role of forests in water partitioning is crucial to assist a sustainable land and water management in a changing climate. Whilst such studies are common in semi-arid regions, they are limited in boreal zones, therefore, our findings are a valuable contribution to understanding plant-water relations in a changing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aair 3aair temperature 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3alatitude 3arain 3asap flow 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3astomatal movement 3asummer 3atranspiration 3atrees 3avapor pressure 3awater management 3awatersheds 0aSap flow 0aEvapotranspiration 0aClimate 0aHydrology 0aWater partition 0aScots pine1 aTetzlaff, Doerthe1 aDick, Jonathan J.1 aSoulsby, Chris0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2017 June 15, v. 240-241 p.58-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01371naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017900164520035600343592002800699653003000727653003400757653001300791653002200804700001300826700001700839700001100856700001700867773009400884856008200978852000901060655001201069IND60739134920221120233031.0210624e20210702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073913492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1322212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Panwei12aA facile and diverse synthesis of coumarin substituted spirooxindole and dispiro oxindole-pyrrolizidine/pyrrolothiazole/pyrrolidine derivatives via 1, 3-dipolar cycloaddition  aA diverse series of coumarin substituted spirooxindole and dispirooxindole-pyrrolizidine/pyrrolothiazole/pyrrolidine derivatives have been obtained via azomethine ylide specific three-component 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction.

Therefore, 15 sows were conducted to a wheat bran (WB) group, in which the sows’ diets included 25% of WB in gestation and 14% in lactation, and a control (CON) group, in which the sows’ diets at all stages of reproduction did not contain WB. The results show that maternal high WB intervention seems not to have an impact on the growth of the offspring or the villus height of the duodenum, and the ratio of villi/crypts in the duodenum and jejunum were all higher in piglets born from WB sows, which may indicate that WB piglets had a larger absorption area and capacity for nutrients. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and interleukin 6 (IL6) expression levels were notably upregulated in the ileal mucosa of WB piglets, while no immune-related genes in the colonic mucosa were affected by the maternal WB supplementation. In conclusion, adding a high proportion of wheat bran to the sow’s gestation and lactation diet can affect the intestinal architecture and the expression of some inflammation genes, to some extent, in the ileal mucosa in the progeny.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adiet 3aduodenum 3agene expression 3aileum 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ajejunum 3alactation 3amaternal nutrition 3anutritional intervention 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3avilli 3awheat bran1 aZhang, Yuping 1 aWavreille, José 1 aUerlings, Julie 1 aSchroyen, Martine 1 aSureda, Ester  Arévalo1 aSoyeurt, Hélène 1 aDehareng, Frédéric 1 aGrelet, Clément 1 aOswald, Isabelle P.,1 aLi, Bing 1 aBindelle, Jérôme 1 aZhang, Hongfu 1 aEveraert, Nadia 0 tAnimals.g2020 Nov. 06, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani101120513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245014100205300001400346520137800360592002801738650001001766650002001776650001901796650002301815650001001838650001701848650004301865650001101908650002601919650001501945650001401960650001001974650001401984650000701998650002102005653001402026653002102040653001102061653002002072700001902092700002202111700002102133700002202154700001702176773012502193856008302318852000902401655001202410IND60542670420221121014743.0190405e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054267042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2014.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiorgi, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3657-470310aPharmacokinetic Evaluations of Sulpiride After Intravenous, Intramuscular, and Oral Single-Dose Administration in Jennies (Equus asinus)  ap. 13-18.  aSulpiride is an antipsychotic human drug. It is commonly used to encourage ovulation in noncycling mares and to stimulate lactation in adoptive mares. No pharmacokinetic data are available for donkeys. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics profile of sulpiride after intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), and oral (PO) administrations in healthy jennies. Animals (n = 6) were treated with sulpiride, 1 mg/kg by IV, IM, and PO routes according to a randomized cross-over design (3 × 3 Latin square). Blood samples (5 mL) were collected at predetermined times and analyzed using a validated high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method. IV and IM administrations gave similar curves, but they were not bioequivalent. The IM average bioavailability was 73.5%. After PO administration, the drug plasma concentrations were low and consequently both area under the curve and bioavailability (9.4%) were low. This finding could be because of the physicochemical features of the drug. Indeed, considering that sulpiride is a weak base, existing in the ionized form at gastric and physiological pH, it is unsurprising that it is poorly absorbable, especially in equine species whose gastric pH is particularly acidic. In conclusion, injective routes are definitely preferable to PO dosing because of the very low F% via this route.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasses 3abioavailability 3ablood sampling 3across-over studies 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aintravenous injection 3aionization 3alactation 3amares 3aovulation 3apH 3apharmacokinetics 0aSulpiride 0aPharmacokinetics 0aDonkey 0aBioavailability1 aVullo, Cecilia1 aDe Vito, Virginia1 aCatone, Giuseppe1 aFaillace, Vanessa1 aLaus, Fulvio0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.13-18dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245014100155300001600296500001900312520169100331592002802022650001002050650001902060650001702079650003302096650001702129650001502146650001902161650001402180650003802194650002702232651001002259651001202269651001502281653001202296653001502308653001602323653001802339700002402357700001702381700002202398700002102420700002202441700001802463700001502481700002202496773010202518856007202620852000902692655001202701IND60695717420221122045025.0200518e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069571742DNAL7 a10.2216/17-139.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Jianjun10aTaxonomic reassessment of Ulva prolifera (Ulvophyceae, Chlorophyta) based on specimens from the type locality and Yellow Sea green tides  ap. 692-704.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSince 2008, the green seaweed Ulva prolifera has caused the world's largest green tide in the Yellow Sea, China. It has subsequently attracted considerable research interest. However, species identification is an essential step for advancing this research. Based on phylogenetic analyses using molecular sequences such as internal transcribed spacer (ITS) or ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (rbcL), specimens of U. prolifera collected worldwide were separated into a European clade and the Ulva linza–procera–prolifera (LPP) complex clade that included the Chinese bloom-forming strains and Japanese brackish strains. This has resulted in considerable controversy as to the identity of U. prolifera and the bloom-forming species in the Yellow Sea. To resolve this issue, we examined populations of U. prolifera from the type locality at Lolland Island, Denmark, and globally significant sites including sites from Japan and China using morphological, developmental, molecular and crossing studies. We found that almost all the Danish strains agree with the description of the type specimen and were included in the LPP clade. They had a branched morphology in culture and an obligate asexual life history with quadriflagellate zoosporoids. We conclude that this taxon in the LPP clade is true U. prolifera. Based on culture morphology, mating compatibility and the 5S rDNA spacer sequences, the Chinese bloom-forming strains were distinct, and the new subspecies U. prolifera subsp. qingdaoensis subsp. nov. is described. Strains of the European clade showing gamete incompatibility with the sexual members of the LPP clade were assigned to the species Ulva splitiana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aUlva prolifera 3aalgal blooms 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alife history 3amacroalgae 3anew subspecies 3aphylogeny 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aspecies identification 3aChina 3aDenmark 3aYellow Sea 0aAsexual 0aGreen tide 0aMating test 0aType locality1 aMonotilla, Alvin P.1 aZhu, Wenrong1 aTakano, Yoshihito1 aShimada, Satoshi1 aIchihara, Kensuke1 aMatsui, Tohru1 aHe, Peimin1 aHiraoka, Masanori0 tPhycologia.g2018 Nov. 1, v. 57, no. 6 p.692-704dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1959x2330-29687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2216/17-139.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245009300209500002200302506007600324520123400400592002801634506003701662650003201699650001501731650001001746650001701756650002201773650000901795650002201804650001901826650002701845650004301872650001301915650001101928653001001939653001101949653000801960653000801968653000701976653000801983653002201991653002102013653002202034653001302056653001802069700003102087700002402118700002102142773005602163856008102219852000902300655001202309IND60564565620221207074854.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2017.03.0102doi7 aPMC59605982pmcid7 a282862062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGureev, Artem P.10aSimplified qPCR method for detecting excessive mtDNA damage induced by exogenous factors  aPre-press version  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDamage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a meaningful biomarker for evaluating genotoxicity of drugs and environmental toxins. Existing PCR methods utilize long mtDNA fragments (∼8–10kb), which complicates detecting exact sites of mtDNA damage. To identify the mtDNA regions most susceptible to damage, we have developed and validated a set of primers to amplify ∼2kb long fragments, while covering over 95% of mouse mtDNA. We have modified the detection method by greatly increasing the enrichment of mtDNA, which allows us solving the problem of non-specific primer annealing to nuclear DNA. To validate our approach, we have determined the most damage-susceptible mtDNA regions in mice treated in vivo and in vitro with rotenone and H2O2. The GTGR-sequence-enriched mtDNA segments located in the D-loop region were found to be especially susceptible to damage. Further, we demonstrate that H2O2-induced mtDNA damage facilitates the relaxation of mtDNA supercoiled conformation, making the sequences with minimal damage more accessible to DNA polymerase, which, in turn, results in a decrease in threshold cycle value. Overall, our modified PCR method is simpler and more selective to the specific sites of damage in mtDNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3abiomarkers 3adrugs 3agenotoxicity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amice 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3anucleic acid annealing 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arotenone 3atoxins 0amtDNA 0a8-oxoG 0aFPG 0aHSP 0aOR 0aTAS 0amitochondrial DNA 0aoxidative damage 0ahydrogen peroxide 0arotenone 0aRTGR-sequence1 aShaforostova, Ekaterina A.1 aStarkov, Anatoly A.1 aPopov, Vasily N.0 tToxicology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010400164300001500268520133000283592002801613650002201641650001101663650000901674650001601683650001901699650001401718650001601732650001401748650001801762650002001780650001301800650001401813650001101827651001501838653002101853653001601874653003001890653001701920653001401937653003501951700001901986700002202005700002302027700002602050700002102076700002002097700001902117700002202136700002402158700002202182700002202204700002002226773011302246856008202359961000902441852000902450655001202459IND60613338120221120183227.0190415e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2018.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Jayme12aA decade and a half of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. and domoic acid along the coast of southern California  ap. 87-104.  aBlooms of the marine diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia that produce the neurotoxin domoic acid have been documented with regularity along the coast of southern California since 2003, with the occurrence of the toxin in shellfish tissue predating information on domoic acid in the particulate fraction in this region. Domoic acid concentrations in the phytoplankton inhabiting waters off southern California during 2003, 2006, 2007, 2011 and 2017 were comparable to some of the highest values that have been recorded in the literature. Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia have exhibited strong seasonality, with toxin appearing predominantly in the spring. Year-to-year variability of particulate toxin has been considerable, and observations during 2003, 2006, 2007, 2011 and again in 2017 linked domoic acid in the diets of marine mammals and seabirds to mass mortality events among these animals. This work reviews information collected during the past 15 years documenting the phenology and magnitude of Pseudo-nitzschia abundances and domoic acid within the Southern California Bight. The general oceanographic factors leading to blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia and outbreaks of domoic acid in this region are clear, but subtle factors controlling spatial and interannual variability in bloom magnitude and toxin production remain elusive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3acoasts 3adiet 3adomoic acid 3amarine mammals 3amortality 3aneurotoxins 3aphenology 3aphytoplankton 3apoisonous algae 3aseabirds 3ashellfish 3aspring 3aCalifornia 0aPseudo-nitzschia 0aDomoic acid 0aSouthern California Bight 0aToxic blooms 0aUpwelling 0aMarine animal mass mortalities1 aConnell, Paige1 aEvans, Richard H.1 aGellene, Alyssa G.1 aHoward, Meredith D.A.1 aJones, Burton H.1 aKaveggia, Susan1 aPalmer, Lauren1 aSchnetzer, Astrid1 aSeegers, Bridget N.1 aSeubert, Erica L.1 aTatters, Avery O.1 aCaron, David A.0 tHarmful algae.g2018 Nov., v. 79 p.87-104dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3946763x1568-98837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2018.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006800173300001800241520081900259592002801078650001501106650000901121650001501130650000701145650001301152650002201165650002301187650002001210650001101230650001201241650002001253700001701273700001901290773011001309856008601419852000901505655001201514IND60560935420221121090318.0170118e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056093542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b027622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewenstam, Andrzej10aAll-Solid-State Reference Electrode with Heterogeneous Membrane  ap. 1068-1072.  aNovel reference electrodes with a solid contact coated by a heterogeneous polymer membrane are described.

The design of new primers targeting the cytb gene of Equus caballus enabled proposing two types of assays: species-specific PCR and real-time quantitative PCR with EvaGreen dye. The assays demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, down to 0.0001% (w/w) of horse meat in beef mixtures and 0.1 pg of horse DNA, in both raw and autoclaved meats. A normalised real-time PCR approach based on the ΔCt method was further proposed in the range of 25% down to 0.0001%, which was effectively validated and applied to a total of 67 processed foods. The estimated horse meat content (0.10%) in one sample suggests the occurrence of cross-contamination rather than adulteration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadulterated products 3aautoclaving 3abeef 3across contamination 3acrystal proteins 3agenes 3ahorse meat 3ahorses 3ainsecticidal proteins 3aprocessed foods 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aEquus caballus 0aMeat products 0aSpecies detection 0aReal-time PCR 0aAuthentication1 aCosta, Joana1 aVilla, Caterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9471-36121 aRamos, Fernando1 aOliveira, M.

In lines with these efforts, our work demonstrates that mitochondrial translation inhibition by tigecycline or depletion of EF-Tu mitochondrial translation factor effectively targets RCC and significantly sensitizes RCC response to chemotherapy. We show that antibiotic tigecycline inhibits multiple biological functions of RCC, including growth, colony formation and survival. It also significantly enhances in vitro and in vivo efficacy of paclitaxel in RCC. Tigecycline preferentially inhibits translation of mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, activities of mitochondrial respiratory complexes that contain mitochondrially encoded subunits. As a consequence of mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition, decreased mitochondrial respiration is observed in RCC cells exposed to tigecycline. In contrast, tigecycline is ineffective in RCC ρ0 cells that lack mitochondrial DNA and subsequent mitochondrial respiration, further confirm mitochondrial translation inhibition as the mechanism of tigecycline's action in RCC. Importantly, genetic inhibition of mitochondrial translation by EF-Tu knockdown reproduced the inhibitory effects of tigecycline. Finally, we show the association between mitochondrial translation inhibition and suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Our work used pharmacological and genetic strategies to demonstrate the important roles of mitochondrial translation in RCC and emphasize the therapeutic value of sensitizing RCC to chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3aelectron transport chain 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3apaclitaxel 3aproteins 3arenal cell carcinoma 3asignal transduction 3atigecycline 0aRCC 0aTigecycline 0aMitochondrial translation 0aEF-Tu 0aChemotherapy1 aAo, Jinsong1 aYu, Dan1 aRao, Ting1 aRuan, Yuan1 aYao, Xiaobin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245013600174500002200310500002200332520167400354592002802028650002302056650001102079650001102090650001802101650002402119650001002143650002002153650001302173650002002186650001602206650001102222650001602233650001102249653001302260653003002273653002002303653001002323653001302333700002102346700001802367700001702385700001702402700002202419700001702441773010002458856008302558852000902641655001202650IND60605771120221120023428.0180914s2018    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060577112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauvigné, François10aSeasonal-and dose-dependent effects of recombinant gonadotropins on sperm production and quality in the flatfish Solea senegalensis  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aConsecutive treatments with recombinant follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones (rFsh and rLh, respectively) stimulate spermatogenesis and potentiate sperm production in pubescent specimens of the oligospermic Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis). However, sperm production in response to the hormones is highly variable, and the steroidogenic potential of the testis may be diminished due to sustained hormone supply. Here, we compared the effectiveness of low (9 μg/kg) and high (18 μg/kg) doses of rFsh and rLh to improve sperm production in adult sole during late winter-early spring (onset of the natural spawning period), and in autumn under a controlled temperature of 12 °C (period of testicular recrudescence). Treatment with rFsh over six weeks during spring, followed by a single rLh injection, did not enhance sperm production, possibly because of an advanced stage of sexual maturation of the males, as reflected by high Lh plasma levels (~17 ng/ml) before rFsh treatment. In contrast, in autumn, when the Lh circulating levels were much lower (~3 ng/ml), the low doses of rFsh and rLh generated a four-times increase in sperm production, whereas the high doses of the hormones were ineffective. However, treatment with rLh, regardless of the effect of rFsh, improved the motility of spermatozoa during both spring and autumn. These data confirm that consecutive rFsh and rLh treatments increase sperm production and quality in adult sole males, although they seem to be highly sensitive to the rFsh dose. The efficiency of recombinant gonadotropins also appears to be season-dependent despite the asynchronous nature of the sole testis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolea senegalensis 3aadults 3aautumn 3adose response 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3asexual maturity 3aspawning 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatozoa 3aspring 3atemperature 3atestes 0aFlatfish 0aRecombinant gonadotropins 0aSpermatogenesis 0aSperm 0aMotility1 aGonzález, Wendy1 aRamos, Sandra1 aDucat, Carla1 aDuncan, Neil1 aGimenez, Ignacio,1 aCerdà, Joan0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2018, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2018.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245012900179500002200308520164600330592002801976650002102004650001202025650001902037650001602056650002302072650003102095650001002126650001702136650002202153650001602175650001102191650001902202650002002221650002402241650001402265650002902279653001702308653002802325653002102353653002502374700003502399700002802434700003302462700002702495700003402522700001702556773009702573856008202670852000902752655001202761IND60570520620221121115013.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057052062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiménez-Garduño, Aura M.13aIL-1β induced methylation of the estrogen receptor ERα gene correlates with EMT and chemoresistance in breast cancer cells  aPre-press version  aInflammation has been recently acknowledged as a key participant in the physiopathology of oncogenesis and tumor progression. The inflammatory cytokine IL-1β has been reported to induce the expression of markers associated with malignancy in breast cancerous cells through Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Aggressive breast cancer tumors classified as Triple Negative do not respond to hormonal treatment because they lack three crucial receptors, one of which is the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Expression of ERα is then considered a good prognostic marker for tamoxifen treatment of this type of cancer, as the binding of this drug to the receptor blocks the transcriptional activity of the latter. Although it has been suggested that inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment could regulate ERα expression, the mechanism(s) involved in this process have not yet been established. We show here that, in a cell model of breast cancer cells (6D cells), in which the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β induces EMT by activation of the IL-1β/IL-1RI/β-catenin pathway, the up regulation of TWIST1 leads to methylation of the ESR1 gene promoter. This epigenetic modification produced significant decrease of the ERα receptor levels and increased resistance to tamoxifen. The direct participation of IL-1β in these processes was validated by blockage of the cytokine-induced signaling pathway by wortmannin inactivation of the effectors PI3K/AKT. These results support our previous reports that have suggested direct participation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in the transition to malignancy of breast cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acarcinogenesis 3aepigenetics 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amethylation 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3apathophysiology 3asignal transduction 3atamoxifen 3atranscription (genetics) 0aInflammation 0aEpigenetic modification 0aHormone receptor 0aTamoxifen resistance1 aMendoza-Rodríguez, Mónica G.1 aUrrutia-Cabrera, Daniel1 aDomínguez-Robles, María C.1 aPérez-Yépez, Eloy A.1 aAyala-Sumuano, Jorge Tonatiuh1 aMeza, Isaura0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012100167300001800288500001900306520114500325592002801470650002101498650001401519650001701533650001401550650001101564650001301575650001801588650000901606650001301615650002401628650001301652650001501665650001001680650001201690650004401702700001801746700002101764700002101785700001801806773013201824856008201956852000902038655001202047IND60741404620221120092041.0210612e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140462DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04787-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabikun, Nahar10aEvaluation of chicken nugget properties using spent hen meat added with milk fat and potato mash at different levels  ap. 2783-2791.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was aimed to develop chicken nuggets using spent hen meat (SHM) added with milk fat (MF) and potato mash (PM) at different levels. Four different spent hen nuggets (SHNs) i.e. T1 (75% SHM with 5% MF), T2 (70% SHM with 8% MF and 2% PM), T3 (65% SHM with 11% MF and 4% PM), and T4 (60% SHM with 14% MF and 6% PM) were formulated and compared with the control, using broiler chicken meat without MF and PM. The control, T1, and T2 were not significantly different with respect to protein and fat contents. The emulsion stability (92.2%), frying yield (84.1%), hardness (19.2 N) and chewiness (11.4 N) of T2 were similar to the control. The incorporation of MF and PM resulted in increased taste and flavor scores for SHN. The overall acceptability score was same for the control and T2. The conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance results showed that the addition of MF at 8 to 10% did not have an effect on the oxidative stability of SHN during storage. MF-incorporated SHN may be a regular chicken nugget for all consumers due to improved texture and sensory quality with similar fat content to the control.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3achewiness 3achicken meat 3aemulsions 3aflavor 3ahardness 3alipid content 3amash 3amilk fat 3aoxidative stability 3apotatoes 3aspent hens 3ataste 3atexture 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aBakhsh, Allah1 aRahman, Shafiur,1 aHwang, Young-Hwa1 aJoo, Seon-Tea0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.2783-2791dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04787-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009400168300001400262520126300276592002801539650001901567650001701586650001601603650001101619650001301630650001001643650002201653650003301675650002001708650001801728650001801746650001401764651001001778651001501788653001901803653001501822653003601837653001601873700005701889700001901946700001601965700001901981700001902000700001802019700001402037700005502051700001402106700002102120773009802141856008202239852000902321655001202330IND60613338420221120182523.0201202e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061333842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hal.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qing-Chun10aGenetic evidence in tracking the origin of Ulva prolifera blooms in the Yellow Sea, China  ap. 86-94.  aRecurrent green tides have been recorded in the Yellow Sea for 11 consecutive years. The origin of floating green algae in the Yellow Sea, however, remains a subject of debate. Previous studies suggest that the major bloom-forming green alga Ulva prolifera represent a unique ecotype different from other attached populations of U. prolifera in China. In this study, 97 green algal samples collected during the 2012 green-tide event and from other locations along the coastline of China were analyzed. Based on the sequences of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 5S rDNA spacer region, the green alga U. prolifera in the samples were identified. The intraspecific genetic diversity within U. prolifera was then examined using sequences of 5S rDNA spacer and a marker of sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) highly specific for bloom-forming U. prolifera in the Yellow Sea. The screening results for SCAR marker demonstrated that U. prolifera attached to aquaculture rafts in Subei Shoal belong to the same ecotype of the bloom-forming U. prolifera in the Yellow Sea.

It is considered a major bactericidal agent as it is released in the phagosome where it catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species. It is also released in the extracellular spaces including blood where it is absorbed on (lipo)proteins and endothelial cell surface, interfering with endothelial function. We performed RNA sequencing on MPO-treated endothelial cells, analyzed their transcriptome and validated the profile of gene expression by individual qRT-PCR. Some of the induced genes could be grouped in several functional networks, including tubulogenesis, angiogenesis, and blood vessel morphogenesis and development as well as signal transduction pathways associated to these mechanisms. MPO treatment mimicked the effects of VEGF on several signal transduction pathways, such as Akt, ERK or FAK involved in angiogenesis. Accordingly MPO, independently of its enzymatic activity, stimulated tube formation by endothelial cells. RNA interference also pointed at a role of endogenous MPO in tubulogenesis and endothelium wound repair in vitro. These data suggest that MPO, whether from endogenous or exogenous sources, could play a role in angiogenesis and vascular repair in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aangiogenesis 3ablood 3ablood vessels 3acatalytic activity 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3aenzyme activity 3aexogenous sources 3agenes 3amammals 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amorphogenesis 3amyeloperoxidase 3aperoxidase 3aphagosomes 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aMyeloperoxidase 0aAngiogenesis 0aEndothelial cell 0aEndothelial dysfunction 0aInflammation1 aMedfai, Hayfa1 aPoelvoorde, Philippe1 aKazan, Mohammad Fayyad1 aDelporte, Cedric1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7453-70281 aVan Antwerpen, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4934-88631 aEL-Makhour, Yolla1 aBiston, Patrick1 aDelrée, Paul1 aBadran, Bassam1 aVanhamme, Luc1 aZouaoui Boudjeltia, Karim,0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 654 p.55-69dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013900157300001800296520126700314592002801581650001501609650001701624650001601641650001601657650001201673650001701685650001001702700002301712700002101735700002101756773009401777856007301871852000901944655001201953IND60390710520221118110334.0150823e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6039071052DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.104412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaur, Shishir10aMultiobjective fuzzy optimization for sustainable groundwater management using particle swarm optimization and analytic element method  ap. 4175-4187.  aGroundwater management involves conflicting objectives as maximization of discharge contradicts the criteria of minimum pumping cost and minimum piping cost. In addition, available data contains uncertainties such as market fluctuations, variations in water levels of wells and variations of ground water policies. A fuzzy model is to be evolved to tackle the uncertainties, and a multiobjective optimization is to be conducted to simultaneously satisfy the contradicting objectives. Towards this end, a multiobjective fuzzy optimization model is evolved. To get at the upper and lower bounds of the individual objectives, particle Swarm optimization (PSO) is adopted. The analytic element method (AEM) is employed to obtain the operating potentio metric head. In this study, a multiobjective fuzzy optimization model considering three conflicting objectives is developed using PSO and AEM methods for obtaining a sustainable groundwater management policy. The developed model is applied to a case study, and it is demonstrated that the compromise solution satisfies all the objectives with adequate levels of satisfaction. Sensitivity analysis is carried out by varying the parameters, and it is shown that the effect of any such variation is quite significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3afuzzy logic 3agroundwater 3amarkets 3awater policy 3awells1 aSrinivasa Raju, K.1 aKumar, D.

Affected by the complex and rapid environmental changes in karst areas, water and soil variables and their relationships changes significantly. Dynamically revealing the driving factors of the relationship between water and soil variables behind such changes is an urgent need to control rocky desertification. This study simulated soil loss and water yield in the Wujiang Basin in China from 2000 to 2018 by a modified RUSLE model and InVEST model, respectively. The relationships between soil loss and water yield were calculated by geographically weighted regression, and geographical detector considering stratification heterogeneity was used to quantitatively identify the determinants and their interactions of trade-off and synergy. The results showed that the area of the trade-off between water yield and soil loss in the basin and in different geomorphological types clearly increased over time, and accordingly, that of the synergy gradually decreased with time. At the basin scale, precipitation is the determinant for the trade-off and synergy, with an explanatory power between 5% and 45%, and the interaction between precipitation and elevation has the greatest explanatory power for the trade-off and synergy. In each geomorphological type, only three environmental factors significantly affected the trade-off and synergy between soil loss and water yield, namely precipitation, elevation, and lithology. The interaction of elevation and lithology dominantly affecting the trade-off in the low/middle elevation terrace indicates that the topographical factors of the region require further attention. The interaction between precipitation and elevation and the interaction between precipitation and lithology are worth noting in the other four geomorphological types.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abasins 3adesertification 3akarsts 3alithology 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3awater yield 3aChina 0aKarst ecosystem service 0aTrade-off and synergy 0aQuantitative attribution 0aGeomorphological type 0aDynamic change1 aGao, Jiangbo0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Apr., v. 137 p.108754-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1087543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01608naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245008400160300001400244520067000258592002800928650001000956650002000966650002600986650002001012650001201032650001401044700001401058700001801072773011301090856008201203852000901285655001201294IND60567468120221121012435.0191025e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaggs, E10aNLR diversity, helpers and integrated domains: making sense of the NLR IDentity  ap. 59-67.  aPlant innate immunity relies on genetically predetermined repertoires of immune receptors to detect pathogens and trigger an effective immune response. A large proportion of these receptors are from the Nucletoide Binding Leucine Rich Repeat (NLR) gene family. As plants live longer than most pathogens, maintaining diversity of NLRs and deploying efficient ‘pathogen traps’ is necessary to withstand the evolutionary battle.

Genomic variability in the CADPS2 gene has been associated to autism spectrum disorders and Alzheimer's disease, both characterized by altered neurotransmission. Biological evidence also linked CADPS2 to Parkinson's disease (PD), as a disease-causing mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) was reported to increase CADPS2 gene and protein expression. Furthermore, restoration of CADPS2 physiologic levels was able to provide neuroprotection in patient-derived neurons, consistent with the synaptic dysfunction postulated to underlie PD. However, little is known about the influence of PD-related proteins on transcriptional regulation of critical synaptic genes such as CADPS2. Here we aimed at investigating the transcriptional effects of LRRK2 and alpha-synuclein (aSyn) on CADPS2 gene expression, using a combination of in silico analyses and cell biology techniques. First, we identified a predicted promoter in the human CADPS2 genomic sequence, which we then utilized in a luciferase-based gene reporter assay. This approach enabled us to disclose a differential effect of high levels of LRRK2 and aSyn on CADPS2 promoter activity. Specifically, CADPS2 transcriptional activity was enhanced by high cellular levels of LRRK2 and reduced by overexpression of aSyn. Consistently, CADPS2 mRNA levels were diminished in aSyn overexpressing cells.Our results indicate that LRRK2 and aSyn participate in the dysregulation of CADPS2 by altering transcription and support the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunctions, through different mechanisms, might contribute to the neuronal defects of diseases such as PD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aParkinson disease 3aautism 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3aneurons 3aneuroprotective effect 3anucleotide sequences 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asecretion 3asynaptic vesicles 3atranscription (genetics) 0aAlpha-synuclein 0aCADPS2 0aLRRK2 0aGene expression 0aParkinson's disease 0aNeuroblastoma cells 0aCADPS2 0aaSyn 0aPD 0aCNS 0aGWAS 0aiPSC 0aLRRK2 0aPCR 0aSP1 0aNeuroD2 0aBARHL-1/2 0aGFI 1 0aStat6 0aUSF2 0aSNARE 0aRT 0aBSA 0aWT 0aSN1 aÜberbacher, Christa1 aPramstaller, Peter P.1 aHicks, Andrew A.1 aCorti, Corrado1 aVolta, Mattia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0300-67960 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245019800167300001300365520157700378592002801955650002601983650002602009650002102035650001102056650001602067650001002083650002202093650002002115650003102135650001002166650001002176650002002186650002202206650001202228650001002240650001802250650002202268650001302290650002402303650004302327650001102370653002402381653001702405653002602422653002002448653001102468653001102479653002802490700002002518700001802538700001202556700001702568700001502585700001602600700001802616773011902634856008302753852000902836655001202845IND60605771520221120023349.0200128e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060577152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2018.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Chen-Lei10aMolecular cloning and expression analysis of interleukin-1β and interleukin-1 receptor type I genes in yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco): Responses to challenge of Edwardsiella ictaluri  ap. 1-15.  aInterleukin-1β (IL-1β) is one of the pivotal early pro-inflammatory cytokines, which play important roles in regulating immune response and inducing a series of inflammatory reactions to infections. Interleukin-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI) is a receptor of the IL-1β that can mediate IL-1-dependent activation. In this study, partial cDNA sequences of the Pf_IL-1β and Pf_IL-1RI genes were cloned from yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco). The open reading frames (ORF) of Pf_IL-1β and Pf_IL-1RI genes encode putative peptides of 280 and 543 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of these two genes shared highly conserved structures with those from other teleosts. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the Pf_IL-1β mRNA had relatively high expression levels in trunk kidney and blood, and the Pf_IL-1RI mRNA was highly expressed in blood and had relatively high expression level in liver. Ontogenetic expression analyses indicate that the Pf_IL-1β and Pf_IL-1RI genes may play important roles during the embryonic developmental stages. The mRNA expression levels of Pf_IL-1β and Pf_IL-1RI genes were up-regulated in the trunk kidney, head kidney, blood, spleen, heart and liver after Edwardsiella ictaluri challenge. Western blot analyses showed that Pf_IL-1β protein was highly expressed in the spleen and head kidney, but not in the fin of adult individuals. These results suggest that the Pf_IL-1β and Pf_IL-1RI genes may play significant roles in the immune regulation and defense against E. ictaluri in the yellow catfish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella ictaluri 3aTachysurus fulvidraco 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aamino acids 3ablood 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheart 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-1beta 3akidneys 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3aontogeny 3aopen reading frames 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 0aBacterial challenge 0acDNA cloning 0aEdwardsiella ictaluri 0aGene expression 0aIL-1β 0aIL-1RI 0aPelteobagrus fulvidraco1 aZhang, Gui-Rong1 aZhu, Dong-Mei1 aJi, Wei1 aShi, Ze-Chao1 aJiang, Rui1 aFan, Qi-Xue1 aWei, Kai-Jian0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2018 Sept., v. 223 p.1-15dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2018.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04368naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245010600164506011700270506007600387520265500463592002803118506003703146650002203183650002503205650001503230650001603245650002603261650001503287650003303302650002303335650001403358650001503372650001703387650001103404650001603415650001503431651001003446653002303456653002903479653003003508653001703538653002303555700001703578700001603595700001503611700001603626773010103642856008603743852000903829655001203838IND60770205720221207072227.0220614e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1087572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Chao10aAssessing the impacts of Grain-for-Green Programme on ecosystem services in Jinghe River basin, China  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLand-use/land-cover (LULC) change could have huge impacts on a wide range of ecosystem services, such as the quality, types, processes, temporal, and spatial patterns of ecosystem, leading to dramatic changes in different types of ecosystem services. China has implemented Grain-for-Green Programme (GFGP) to alleviate soil erosion, restore and improve ecosystem services. We selected Jinghe River basin, one of the main GFGP pilot areas in the central part of the Loess Plateau in China as study area. InVEST models were adopted to quantify three of the most important ecosystem services (water yield, sediment control and carbon storage) from 2000 to 2015, during which an important GFGP process happens. Results showed that compared with 2000, the area of farmland decreased by 466 km², the area of degraded grassland decreased by 394 km², while the area of forestland increased by 339 km² (including shrub land) in Jinghe River basin. The average annual water yield and sediment export from 2000 to 2015 is 1.11 × 10⁹ m³ and 9.67 × 10⁷ t, which is 36.2% and 60.7% lower than the average of the previous 50 years. Unsurprisingly, carbon storage has increased 5907559.28 mg, about 2.4% more compared to 2000. There are trade-offs between water yield and sediment control as well as carbon storage, and there are synergies between sediment control and carbon storage. Our quantitative assessment has revealed the complex spatial and temporal trade-offs and synergies among competing ecosystem services during the GFGP process. In addition, the results of t-tests in the sub-basin showed that the water yield and sediment control of grassland restoration area and forestland restoration area are better than those of farmland. The water yield of grassland restoration area is better than that of forestland restoration area. But it is difficult to judge the sediment export in forestland restoration area and grassland restoration area. Therefore, considering the trade-offs between water yield and sediment control, grasses are better vegetation type of GFGP compared to trees for the Loess Plateau which has relatively limited precipitation. Our results showed that the control of the erosion by adding vegetation triggers to a diminution of water yield, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Decision making regards to future GFGP and ecological restoration projects should consider the complex and competing trade-offs and synergies in a wide range of ecosystem services, and optimize the planting structure and scale of vegetation in order to achieve long-term, secure, and sustainable provision of vital ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystems 3aforest land 3agrassland restoration 3agrasslands 3aland use and land cover maps 3asediment transport 3asediments 3ashrublands 3asoil erosion 3at-test 3awater yield 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aEcosystem services 0aTrade-offs and synergies 0aGrain-for-Green Programme 0aInVEST model 0aJinghe River Basin1 aJiang, Yanan1 aSu, Zhenhui1 aLiu, Yujun1 aLyu, Jingyu0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Apr., v. 137 p.108757-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1087573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015100169300001600320520177900336592002802115650002102143650002502164650001002189650001302199650002102212650003102233650001802264653001602282653003102298653001102329653001802340700001702358700001902375700002002394773007602414856008402490852000902574655001202583IND60564566320221117010305.0170628e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2017.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagahama, Koji10aQuantitative relationship between chemical properties and bioactivities of anti-microRNA oligonucleotides targeted to tumor-associated microRNA-21  ap. 124-131.  aSynthetic anti-microRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) are promising drug candidates to inactivate disease-related microRNAs because of their sequence-specific binding to their targets and the variety of chemical modifications available. Over the last decade, the qualitative relationships between the chemical properties of AMOs and bioactivity (inactivation of their target miRNAs) have been studied to enhance their bioactivity. On the other hand, in real-world drug development, drugs must be designed case-by-case, taking many factors into account. Thus, in order to design AMOs that target specific miRNA, understanding the quantitative relationship between the chemical properties of AMOs and inactivation of their target miRNA is necessary. Here, we aimed to find the specific quantitative relationship of AMOs targeted to tumor-associated miR-21 through direct comparison of their inactivation efficacies with systematically varied chemical properties, including sequence-specific binding affinity, nuclease resistance, and RNase H activation. As a result, we newly found the quantitative relationships; (1) sequence-specific binding affinity of AMOs against miR-21 is the main determining factor for inactivation efficacy, (2) nuclease resistance of AMOs impacts their miR-21 inactivation efficacy acting cooperatively with the binding affinity, although nuclease resistance alone does not affect the miRNA inactivation efficacy, and (3) RNase H activation is unnecessary. This study also demonstrates the utility of the obtained relationship for the design of AMO-based drugs targeted to miR-21, through cell-based analyses. Thus, the obtained quantitative relationship would make it possible to predict the miR-21 inactivation efficacy of AMOs which are newly designed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3abioactive properties 3adrugs 3amicroRNA 3aoligonucleotides 3aphysicochemical properties 3aribonucleases 0amicroRNA-21 0aAntisense oligonucleotides 0aCancer 0aSynthetic DNA1 aIseda, Kenta1 aKawano, Daichi1 aKawakami, Junji0 tBiochimie.g2017 June, v. 137 p.124-131dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011900209300001800328500001900346520151200365592002801877650001601905650001201921650001801933650001001951650002701961650001401988650001302002650001302015650003202028650001302060650001102073650001702084650001502101650001202116650001402128650001702142650001602159650002202175700005602197773013202253856008202385852000902467655001202476IND60741405120221121031604.0210612e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140512DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04769-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshwath Kumar, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0854-132210aEffect of fat and sugar replacement on rheological, textural and nutritional characteristics of multigrain cookies  ap. 2630-2640.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFat and sugar are responsible for the structure of cookies but make them nutritionally inferior. Therefore, in the present study, cookies with improved nutrition using whole wheat flour (WWF) and incorporation of multigrain mix (MM-oats, peas and fenugreek flours) at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% levels was studied. Further, fat was replaced using pumpkin seed (PS) or watermelon seed (WS) at 25, 50 and 75% level and sugar was replaced using dry dates (DD) or raisins (RS) separately at 20, 40 and 60%. MM having protein at 15.13% and dietary fibre at 12.83% significantly decreased the water absorption (68.1–60.6%), stability (2.52–1.35 min), amylograph peak viscosity (665–821 BU), and cookie dough hardness (1737–690.5) at 100% MM. Based on the physico-sensory analysis, 75% replacement of WWF with MM was selected for replacement of fat or sugar. Addition of PS or WS increased the dough hardness (1235–4103 g), whereas the spread ratio of cookies decreased from 6.25 and 6.31 to 5.54 and 4.06 respectively. Replacement of fat with PS at 50%, sugar by DD at 40% along with a combination of sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) and glycerol mono stearate (GMS) showed improvement in the cookie texture. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) of cookie showed coating of starch granules and appearance of sheet-like covering of protein network. The mono and polyunsaturated fatty acid profile of cookies improved apart from a two-fold increase in protein and three-fold increase in dietary fibre.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylographs 3acookies 3adietary fiber 3adough 3afatty acid composition 3afenugreek 3aglycerol 3ahardness 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apumpkins 3asodium 3astearic acid 3atechnology 3atexture 3aviscosity 3awater uptake 3awatermelons 3awhole wheat flour1 aSudha, M.

To reduce the risk of drug resistance developed in aquaculture, safer biocontrol programs are needed. Antivirulence therapy, with less chance for developing drug resistance, is a promising approach. To facilitate antivirulence inhibitor design against Vibrio anguillarum, a serious aquaculture pathogen, we present crystal structures for isochorismatase domains of AngB and VabB, which are required to synthesize siderophore, a critical virulence factor. Both structures are highly similar to known isochorismatases in fold and active site, therefore we conclude inhibitors for isochorismatases can be developed in a common framework. The structural information will improve design of virulence inhibitors against Vibrio anguillarum. We also firstly report that isochorismatase family could bind endogenous metabolite during the hetero-expression process, which is likely nicotinic acid, nicotinamide or pyrazinic acid, based on structural analysis and affinity prediction. Taken together, our results provide precise structural information of isochorismatase domains for antivirulence inhibitor design against Vibrio anguillarum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aactive sites 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aaquaculture 3abiological control 3acrystal structure 3adisease control 3ametabolites 3aniacin 3anicotinamide 3apathogens 3aprediction 3arisk reduction 3asiderophores 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 0aVibrio 0aIsochorismatase 0aUnknown electron density 0aAntivirulence 0aInhibitor 0aAquaculture disease1 aDeng, Tian1 aMa, Qingjun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007600148245009400224300001800318500001900336520135700355592002801712596004801740650003401788650002501822650001801847650001801865650002301883650001401906650001701920650001501937700002201952773013201974856008202106852000902188655001202197IND60741405220221121031714.0210612e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074140522DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-020-04765-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzydłowska-Czerniak, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0356-393610aEffect of new antioxidants: phenolipids on quality of fried French fries and rapeseed oil  ap. 2589-2598.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of five novel synthetic antioxidants: octyl sinapate (OSA), octyl ferulate (OFA), octyl caffeate (OCA), cetyl sinapate (CSA) and cetyl ferulate (CFA) added to refined rapeseed oil for the first time on antioxidant activity (AA) and total phenolic content (TPC) in French fries. French fries after frying in enriched oils had higher the AA determined by three assays: 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS = 2907–20,029 μmol TE/100 g), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH = 657–6886 μmol TE/100 g), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP = 332–2659 μmol TE/100 g) and total phenolic content (TPC = 44–378 mg SA/100 g) than those prepared in refined rapeseed oil (ABTS = 2146 μmol TE/100 g, DPPH = 403 μmol TE/100 g, FRAP = 218 μmol TE/100 g, TPC = 14 mg SA/100 g). Moreover, the presence of phenolipids in rapeseed oil decreased the oil content in fried French fries by 22–45%. However, the AA and TPC in the fortified oils significantly increased, whereas slower changes in oxidation parameters of supplemented oils after frying were observed. A new lipophilic antioxidants can be useful for the development of management system for the preparation of French fries and the prolongation of frying oil shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018/29/N/NZ9/02748cNarodowe Centrum Nauki 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3alipid content 3alipophilicity 3amanagement systems 3aoxidation 3arapeseed oil 3ashelf life1 aRabiej, Dobrochna0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2021 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.2589-2598dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-020-04765-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009700168300001800265500001500283520123700298592002801535650002001563650001601583650002601599650000801625650001501633650002001648650002901668650002301697650001501720650002201735653002401757700001801781700001601799700001401815700001801829700001701847773011001864856008601974852000902060655001202069IND60560936120221120194800.0170118e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056093612DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b035362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaokun10aSimultaneous Detection of Dual Nucleic Acids Using a SERS-Based Lateral Flow Assay Biosensor  ap. 1163-1169.  a2019-12-06  aA new class of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based lateral flow assay (LFA) biosensor has been developed for the simultaneous detection of dual DNA markers. The LFA strip in this sensor was composed of two test lines and one control line. SERS nano tags labeled with detection DNA probes were used for quantitative evaluation of dual DNA markers with high sensitivity. Target DNA, associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and bacillary angiomatosis (BA), were tested to validate the detection capability of this SERS-based LFA strip. Characteristic peak intensities of SERS nano tags on two test lines were used for quantitative evaluations of KSHV and BA. The limits of detection for KSHV and BA, determined from our SERS-based LFA sensing platform, were estimated to be 0.043 and 0.074 pM, respectively. These values indicate approximately 10 000 times higher sensitivity than previously reported values using the aggregation-based colorimetric method. We believe that this is the first report of simultaneous detection of two different DNA mixtures using a SERS-based LFA platform. This novel detection technique is also a promising multiplex DNA sensing platform for early disease diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3acolorimetry 3aquantitative analysis 3aDNA 3aDNA probes 3agenetic markers 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 8 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3adisease diagnosis 0aHuman herpesvirus 81 aChoi, Namhyun1 aCheng, Gao,1 aKo, Juhui1 aChen, Lingxin1 aChoo, Jaebum0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 89, no. 2 p.1163-1169dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b035363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011200204300001600316520149100332592002801823650001801851650001001869650001501879650001701894650001101911650001001922650002001932650001301952650001601965650001201981650001301993650001602006650002302022650002802045650001302073650001902086650001202105653001502117653001702132653001802149653002202167653001602189653002302205700002002228700005702248700007002305773012502375856008202500852000902582655001202591IND60609305820221120172107.0190711e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060930582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlagoz, Yagiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5081-687410acis-carotene biosynthesis, evolution and regulation in plants: The emergence of novel signaling metabolites  ap. 172-184.  aCarotenoids are isoprenoid pigments synthesised by plants, algae, photosynthetic bacteria as well as some non-photosynthetic bacteria, fungi and insects. Abundant carotenoids found in nature are synthesised via a linear route from phytoene to lycopene after which the pathway bifurcates into cyclised α- and β-carotenes. Plants evolved additional steps to generate a diversity of cis-carotene intermediates, which can accumulate in fruits or tissues exposed to an extended period of darkness. Enzymatic or oxidative cleavage, light-mediated photoisomerization and histone modifications can affect cis-carotene accumulation. cis-carotene accumulation has been linked to the production of signaling metabolites that feedback and forward to regulate nuclear gene expression. When cis-carotenes accumulate, plastid biogenesis and operational control can become impaired. Carotenoid derived metabolites and phytohormones such as abscisic acid and strigolactones can fine-tune cellular homeostasis. There is a hunt to identify a novel cis-carotene derived apocarotenoid signal and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which it facilitates communication between the plastid and nucleus. In this review, we describe the biosynthesis and evolution of cis-carotenes and their links to regulatory switches, as well as highlight how cis-carotene derived apocarotenoid signals might control organelle communication, physiological and developmental processes in response to environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabscisic acid 3aalgae 3abiogenesis 3abiosynthesis 3afruits 3afungi 3agene expression 3ahistones 3ahomeostasis 3ainsects 3alycopene 3ametabolites 3aphotoisomerization 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3apigments 3astrigolactones 3atissues 0aCarotenoid 0acis-carotene 0aApocarotenoid 0aRegulatory switch 0aPhotoswitch 0aPhotoisomerization1 aNayak, Pranjali1 aDhami, Namraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6014-35001 aCazzonelli, Christopher I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3096-31930 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 654 p.172-184dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011200152300001800264520162300282592002801905650001501933650001701948650001201965650003501977650001602012650001502028650001102043650002002054650001602074650001502090650001002105651001002115700001602125700001602141700001602157700001602173773009402189856007302283852000902356655001202365IND60390711020221118111146.0150823e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6039071102DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.104712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xin10aOptimizing layout of pumping well in irrigation district for groundwater sustainable use in northwest China  ap. 4188-4198.  aOptimizing layout of pumping well plays a vital role in curbing the groundwater level decline. A novel optimization model is presented in this study. First, the optimal well number is obtained by taking into account factors of local economy and environment based on nonlinear programming model. Then, the well spatial layout assessment model is attained based on information entropy weight and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). After that, the relative closeness to positive ideal solution of alternative (cᵢ) on the rationality of well spatial layout in cultivated land is calculated, and a set of alternatives are ranked according to the descending order of cᵢ. Finally, the well optimization layout is obtained by combining the optimal well number with well spatial layout assessment result based on the GIS data of pumping wells. As a case study, this method was applied in Yongchang Irrigation District of Shiyang River Basin, the arid region of northwest China. Results show that under the conditions of sustainable use of water resources, the irrigation district needed 724 wells for irrigation, with a decrease of 31.0% when compared with the existing number of wells. The wells with low flow rate and operating efficiency distributed in high density where groundwater is over‐exploitation were recommended to be closed. This well optimization layout method is expected to play a significant role in helping make plans for exploiting groundwater at more sustainable level, curbing the groundwater level decline trend, and improving the local ecological environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3acase studies 3aentropy 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3amodels 3awater resources 3awater table 3awatersheds 3awells 3aChina1 aWang, Sufen1 aHuo, Zailin1 aLi, Fusheng1 aHao, Xinmei0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 29, no. 19 p.4188-4198dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.104713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245015700179300001600336520128000352592002801632650001201660650002801672650002501700650001001725650001801735650001701753650001201770650001201782650002301794650002101817650002001838650002101858650002001879650001401899650001001913650002201923650002901945653000901974653001401983653002301997653001702020653002102037700003302058700002902091700003102120700002602151700003102177700004202208700004102250700002702291700002902318700003202347700002402379700003102403700002602434700003102460773007602491856008402567852000902651655001202660IND60564566620221117010052.0170713e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2017.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto-Junior, Vanir Reis10aMolecular modeling, docking and dynamics simulations of the Dioclea lasiophylla Mart.

The Diocleinae subtribe presents lectins with high structural similarity, but different effects based on biological activity assays. This variability results from small structural differences. Therefore, in this context, the present study aimed to perform a structural analysis of the lectin from Dioclea lasiophylla Mart. ex Benth seeds (DlyL) and evaluate its inflammatory effect. To accomplish this, DlyL was purified in a single step by affinity chromatography on Sephadex® G-50 matrix. DlyL primary structure was determined through a combination of tandem mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing. DlyL showed high similarity with other species from the same genus. Its theoretical three-dimensional structure was predicted by homology modelling, and the protein was subjected to ligand screening with monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and complex N-glycans by molecular docking. Stability and binding of the lectin with α-methyl-d-mannoside were assessed by molecular dynamics. DlyL showed acute inflammatory response with hypernociceptive effect in the paw edema model, possibly by interaction with glycans present at the cell surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioclea 3aaffinity chromatography 3abioactive properties 3aedema 3aglycoproteins 3ainflammation 3alectins 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3amonosaccharides 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3ascreening 3aseeds 3asequence analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aDlyL 0aStructure 0aMolecular dynamics 0aInflammatory 0aHypernociceptive1 aOsterne, Vinicius Jose Silva1 aSantiago, Mayara Queiroz1 aLossio, Claudia Figueiredo1 aNagano, Celso Shiniti1 aRocha, Cintia Renata Costa1 aNascimento, Jessica Catarine Frutuoso1 aNascimento, Francisco Lucas Faustino1 aSilva, Ivanice Bezerra1 aOliveira, Antonia Simoni1 aCorreia, Jorge Luis Almeida1 aLeal, Rodrigo Bainy1 aAssreuy, Ana Maria Sampaio1 aCavada, Benildo Sousa1 aNascimento, Kyria Santiago0 tBiochimie.g2017 Apr., v. 135 p.126-136dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245013300160300001800293520066200311592002800973596007201001596007501073596011101148596009201259650003501351650001101386650001001397650000801407650002001415650001501435650001301450650001401463650001901477651001001496700001801506700001501524700001801539700001601557700001601573700001901589700005601608773011601664856008101780852000901861655001201870IND60615244620221123005708.0181009e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061524462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3928-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Yun10aGenetic characterization of a novel HIV-1 CRF01_AE/CRF07_BC recombinant form among men who have sex with men in Guangdong, China  ap. 3093-3097.  aGenome recombination is a major strategy employed by HIV to generate new variants for the benefit of escaping immune surveillance.

The increasing genetic complexity of the HIV-1 epidemic in China warrants continued investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016A020215008cGuangdong Province Science and Technology Programme  aA2016359cMedical Scientific Research Foundation of Guangdong Province  a201508020256cJoint-Innovative Program in Healthcare for Speical Scientific Research Projects of Guangzhou  a81561128007cInternational Collaboration Program of Natural Science Foundation of China 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3agenome 3amales 3amen 3amixed infection 3amonitoring 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3asuperinfection 3aChina1 aZhu, Wenchang1 aHu, Fengyu1 aTang, Shixing1 aLi, Linghua1 aCai, Xiaoli1 aTang, Xiaoping1 aCai, Weiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1287-06230 tArchives of virology.g2018 Nov., v. 163, no. 11 p.3093-3097dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3928-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007600169300001400245520079500259592002801054650001401082650002501096650001301121650001601134650001001150650002001160650001301180700002001193773011301213856008201326852000901408655001201417IND60567468720221120233751.0191025e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056746872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo Presti, Libera10aHow filamentous plant pathogen effectors are translocated to host cells  ap. 19-24.  aThe interaction of microbes with “signature” plants is largely governed by secreted effector proteins, which serve to dampen plant defense responses and modulate host cell processes. Secreted effectors can function either in the apoplast or within plant cell compartments. How oomycetes and fungi translocate their effectors to plant cells is still poorly understood and controversial. While most oomycete effectors share a common ‘signature’ that was proposed to mediate their uptake via endocytosis, fungal effectors display no conserved motifs at the primary amino acid sequence level. Here we summarize current knowledge in the field of oomycete and fungal effector uptake and highlight emerging themes that may unite rather than set apart these unrelated filamentous pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOomycetes 3aamino acid sequences 3aapoplast 3aendocytosis 3afungi 3aplant pathogens 3aproteins1 aKahmann, Regine0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2017 Aug., v. 38 p.19-24dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04515naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016600165506011700331506007600448520258900524592002803113506003703141650001303178650001203191650001503203650002303218650001503241650001203256650001403268650001203282650001103294650002403305650002503329650001503354653002103369653002703390653002403417653003203441653003903473653003903512653002103551700001503572700001503587700001303602700001803615700001303633700001603646700001903662700001703681700001503698700001603713773010103729856008603830852000903916655001203925IND60770206320221207072550.0220614e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077020632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1087632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Bolin10aSpatio-temporal coupling coordination analysis between marsh vegetation and hydrology change from 1985 to 2019 using LandTrendr algorithm and Google Earth Engine  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe interaction between marsh vegetation and hydrology has become one of the hotspots in the field of ecosystem research. Taking the Honghe National Nature Reserve as the study area, this paper integrated the GEE platform and LandTrendr algorithm to build a spatio-temporal monitoring model for marsh vegetation and hydrology change using remote sensing techniques for the first time. The temporal and spatial dynamics of disturbance and restoration of marsh vegetation and hydrology from 1985 to 2019 were monitored. The Magnitude and Duration were selected to explore the temporal and spatial dynamic evolution of marsh vegetation and hydrology in the past 35 years. At the same time, an innovative coupling coordination model of marsh vegetation and hydrology was constructed to quantitatively assess the relationship between vegetation loss and restoration and hydrology change. The sensitivity analysis of the coupling relationship between marsh vegetation and hydrology was carried out by the transfer entropy model, and the influencing factors of marsh vegetation change were determined using the transfer rate. The results showed that: (1) This paper integrates the time series Landsat series images and the LandTrendr algorithm to monitor the dynamic changes of marsh vegetation and hydrology, and the accuracy rates are 83.68% and 85.78%, respectively, which proves that this method can effectively monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of marsh vegetation and hydrology. (2) In the past 35 years, the marsh vegetation in the study area has generally shown a recovery trend, and the recovery duration is ≥ 20 years. The vegetation disturbance is fragmented and marginalized, and the disturbance duration is less than 20 years. (3) The quadratic regression model was utilized to quantify the correlation between marsh vegetation and hydrology changes. The R² between vegetation loss and restoration, and hydrology reached 0.885 and 0.811, respectively, which indicated that there is a significant correlation between wetland hydrology and vegetation changes. (4) The relationship between marsh vegetation and hydrology were in a state of imbalance from 1985 to 2019, but there was a high level of coupling between vegetation loss and hydrological changes. (5) The transfer entropy from hydrological changes to vegetation loss and restoration is significantly larger than the transfer entropy from marsh vegetation loss and restoration to hydrological changes, which indicated that hydrological changes are the driving factor for marsh vegetation loss and restoration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aentropy 3ahydrology 3amarshes 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 0aMarsh vegetation 0aHydrological situation 0aGoogle Earth Engine 0aDisturbance and restoration 0aSpatio-temporal dynamic monitoring 0aCoupling and coordination analysis 0aTransfer entropy1 aLan, Feiwu1 aXie, Shuyu1 aLiu, Man1 aHe, Hongchang1 aLi, Ying1 aLiu, Lilong1 aHuang, Liangke1 aFan, Donglin1 aGao, Ertao1 aChen, Zhili0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Apr., v. 137 p.108763-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1087633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010800178300001400286520123400300592002801534596011701562596012601679596011901805650001901924650001301943650001801956650001201974650002701986650001902013650000902032650001802041650002102059650002302080650001302103650001702116650002202133650002102155650001602176653002402192653002302216653001702239653002602256653002102282700002302303700001902326700001702345773012802362856008502490852000902575655001202584IND60630409820221119071212.0190207e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063040982DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2018.14553132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArfaoui, Mohamed Ameur10aPreparation of a hydrophobic recycled jute-based nonwoven using a titanium dioxide/stearic acid coating  ap. 16-25.  aThis work aims at developing a hydrophobic treatment for jute fiber-based nonwovens. Three solutions of titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles were prepared through a sol–gel method by varying the molar ratio of the various constituents. The nonwoven was pretreated with these solutions before being impregnated with different concentrations of stearic acid. The TiO₂ nanoparticles synthesized are amorphous; their size varies with the concentration of ethanol used as a solvent in the sol–gel method. The nanoparticle coating produced on the jute fibers is uniform. The nonwoven wettability was evaluated by measuring its water contact angle and retention time; the nonwoven became hydrophobic at the lowest fatty acid concentration tested. An increase in the stability of the hydrophobicity was observed when the TiO₂ nanoparticle pretreatment was used compared to the application of the stearic acid treatment only. No detrimental effect of the hydrophobic treatment on the nonwoven mechanical performance and thermal stability was observed. These results demonstrate the potential of the TiO₂ nanoparticle/stearic acid treatment as a fast method to provide a stable hydrophobicity to recycled jute-based nonwovens.  aPublisher supplied data  aFRQNT/BMP #184743cFonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003151  aNSERC/RDA2 #445628-12cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  aFRQNT/BMP #184743cFonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologiesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003151 3aacid treatment 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aethanol 3afatty acid composition 3ahydrophobicity 3ajute 3ananoparticles 3anonwoven fabrics 3asol-gel processing 3asolvents 3astearic acid 3athermal stability 3atitanium dioxide 3awettability 0aJute-based nonwoven 0aTiO2 nanoparticles 0astearic acid 0ahydrophobic treatment 0asol–gel method1 aDolez, Patricia I.1 aDubé, Martine1 aDavid, Eric,0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2019 Jan. 2, v. 110, no. 1 p.16-25dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2018.14553133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006800172300001400240520157000254592002801824650002701852650002601879650001901905650001001924650001601934650001601950650001801966650002401984650002002008650002002028650001802048650001202066650002302078650001602101650001002117650001802127650000902145650003702154650001202191650001702203650002002220650002102240653001202261653001502273653001102288653000802299653000702307653000902314700002802323700001802351700002002369700002202389773007402411856008402485852000902569655001202578IND60564566820221117005319.0170628e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056456682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2017.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Amira Sayed10aERK1 and ERK2 activation modulates diet-induced obesity in mice  ap. 78-87.  aObesity is a worldwide problem, and dietary lipids play an important role in its pathogenesis. Recently, Erk1 knock-out (ERK1−/−) mice have been shown to exhibit low preference for dietary fatty acids. Hence, we maintained Erk1−/− mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) to assess the implication of this mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in obesity. The Erk1−/− mice, fed the HFD, were more obese than wild-type (WT) animals, fed the same diet. Erk1−/− obese mice gained more fat and liver mass than WT obese animals. No difference was observed in daily food and energy intake in HFD-fed both group of animals. However, feed efficiency was higher in Erk1−/− than WT animals. Blood cholesterol, triglyceride and insulin concentrations were higher in Erk1−/− obese mice compared to WT obese animals. Accordingly, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) value was higher in Erk1−/− obese mice compared to WT obese animals. Interestingly, only Erk1−/− obese mice, but not WT-obese animals, exhibited high degree of phosphorylation of liver MEK, the upstream regulator of ERK1/2. This phenomenon was associated with high liver ERK2 phosphorylation in Erk1−/− obese mice which also had high liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA expression, suggesting high lipogenesis in these animals. The Erk1−/− obese mice also had low PPAR-α and CPT1β mRNA, indicating low fatty acid oxidation. Our observations suggest that ERK1 and ERK2 might play key roles in the regulation of obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aanimal disease models 3abeta oxidation 3ablood 3acholesterol 3adietary fat 3aenergy intake 3afatty-acid synthase 3afeed conversion 3agene expression 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3aphosphorylation 3atriacylglycerols 0aObesity 0aMAP kinase 0aLipids 0aHFD 0aLA 0aLCFA1 aSubramaniam, Selvakumar1 aDramane, Gado1 aKhelifi, Douadi1 aKhan, Naim Akhtar0 tBiochimie.g2017 June, v. 137 p.78-87dElsevier B.V.x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2017.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01625naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011500168300001800283500001500301520040700316592002800723650001800751650004200769650001100811650001200822650001300834650001200847650003400859650002500893650001400918653003200932700002200964700002400986700002301010773011601033856008101149852000901230655001201239IND60615244820221123005751.0181009e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061524482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3959-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazzucchi, Moira10aComplete genome sequences of a cytophatic/noncytophatic pair of bovine viral diarrhea virus subtype 1a viruses  ap. 3171-3172.  a2019-12-06  aThe complete genome sequences of both biotypes of a pair of bovine viral diarrhea viruses isolated from a bovid affected by mucosal disease were determined by next generation sequencing.

The ensemble projections by the GCMs showed that the mean annual rainfall is likely to reduce in the future decades by 2–5% in comparison with the current climate (1987–2012). The results of ensemble runoff projections indicated that the mean annual runoff would reduce in future decades by 35%. However, considerable uncertainty in the runoff estimates was found as the ensemble results project changes of the 5ᵗʰ (dry scenario) and 95ᵗʰ (wet scenario) percentiles by −73% to +27%, −73% to +12%, −77% to +21% and −80% to +24% in the decades of 2021–2030, 2031–2040, 2061–2070 and 2071–2080, respectively. Results of uncertainty estimation demonstrated that the choice of GCMs dominates overall uncertainty. Realisation uncertainty (arising from repetitive simulations for a given time step during downscaling of the GCM data to catchment scale) of the downscaled rainfall data was also found to be remarkably high. Uncertainty linked to the choice of hydrological models was found to be quite small in comparison with the GCM and realisation uncertainty. The hydrological model parameter uncertainty was found to be lowest among the sources of uncertainties considered in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3aparameter uncertainty 3arain 3arunoff 3awatersheds 3aAustralia1 aRahman, Ataur1 aHagare, Dharma1 aKibria, Golam1 aKarim, Fazlul0 tHydrological processes.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 29, no. 19 p.4339-4349dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.104923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245016000168500002200328520119200350592002801542650001301570650001301583650002001596650001001616650001801626650001701644650003101661650002201692650003001714650002401744650001601768650001801784650000901802650001701811650000901828650002001837650003201857653002501889653001101914653003101925653002501956653003001981700005702011700005802068773009702126856008202223852000902305655001202314IND60570521520221119025141.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057052152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hsuan-Miao10aFarnesoid X receptor agonist GW4064 ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced ileocolitis through TLR4/MyD88 pathway related mitochondrial dysfunction in mice  aPre-press version  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex and relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastro intestinal tract characterized by diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) plays an important role in enteroprotection and mucosal injury by regulating inflammatory responses and barrier function in the intestinal tract. Here we show the mechanisms of FXR agonist, GW4064, inhibits mucosal injury in ileum caused by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Ileum injury was induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS in Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) mice. GW4064 alleviates LPS-mediated tight junction dysfunction as well as macrophage infiltration in WT mice, but not in FXR KO mice. Interesting, GW4064 suppresses NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP3) inflammasome mediates tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β, as well as mitochondrial respiratory complexes mRNA expression in WT and FXR KO mice treated with LPS. This results demonstrated that central roles of FXR in coordinating regulation of both inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We propose that GW4064 is promising therapeutic agent for treatment of ileocolitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3adiarrhea 3agene expression 3aileum 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aintraperitoneal injection 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitochondria 3apain 3atight junctions 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aFarnesoid X receptor 0aGW4064 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aToll-like receptor 4 0aMitochondrial dysfunction1 aLiao, Jyh-Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3657-03581 aLee, Tzung-Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4097-20850 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.06.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008900171300001400260520100300274592002801277650002401305650001501329650001901344650002401363650001301387650002001400650001301420650002601433650001501459650001201474650001801486650001101504653002401515653001501539653002601554653002001580653001801600653002301618700002201641700001801663700002301681700002301704700002201727700002101749773014501770856008401915852000901999655001202008IND60605772020221120065142.0181002e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060577202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarly, Frédéric10aEnhancing erythritol productivity in Yarrowia lipolytica using metabolic engineering  ap. 19-24.  aErythritol (1,2,3,4-butanetetrol) is a four-carbon sugar alcohol with sweetening properties that is used by the agrofood industry as a food additive. In this study, we demonstrated that metabolic engineering can be used to improve the production of erythritol from glycerol in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. The best results were obtained using a mutant that overexpressed GUT1 and TKL1, which encode a glycerol kinase and a transketolase, respectively, and in which EYK1, which encodes erythrulose kinase, was disrupted; the latter enzyme is involved in an early step of erythritol catabolism. In this strain, erythritol productivity was 75% higher than in the wild type; furthermore, the culturing time needed to achieve maximum concentration was reduced by 40%. An additional advantage is that the strain was unable to consume the erythritol it had created, further increasing the process's efficiency. The erythritol productivity values we obtained here are among the highest reported thus far.  aPublisher supplied data 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3aerythritol 3afood additives 3agene overexpression 3aglycerol 3aglycerol kinase 3aindustry 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolism 3amutants 3atransketolase 3ayeasts 0aYarrowia lipolytica 0aErythritol 0aMetabolic engineering 0aGlycerol kinase 0aTransketolase 0aErythrulose kinase1 aVandermies, Marie1 aTelek, Samuel1 aSteels, Sébastien1 aThomas, Stéphane,1 aNicaud, Jean-Marc1 aFickers, Patrick0 tMetabolic engineering.g2017 July, v. 42 p.19-24dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132024002200170024001900192024001200211040001800223100001400241245015200255506007600407506017300483520134200656506003701998650001602035650002702051650001802078650001202096650002302108650001002131650002002141650002002161650001302181650001302194650004202207650000902249650003002258650002702288650000902315650001902324700001302343700001902356700001502375700001702390700001602407700001302423700001402436700001702450700001502467700001802482700001702500773008902517856011202606856008402718956011802802961000902920852000902929655001202938IND60006304020221214225307.0160804e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000630402DNAL7 a3207342aris7 a10113/630402hdl7 a10.1371/journal.pone.01397752doi7 aPMC45950162pmcid7 a264405222pmid8 ans10898  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Tao10aHigh-Throughput Development of SSR Markers from Pea (Pisum sativum L.)

Mendel used to lay the foundation of modern genetics. However, genomics resources of pea are limited comparing to other crop species. Application of marker assisted selection (MAS) in pea breeding has lagged behind many other crops. Development of a large number of novel and reliable SSR (simple sequence repeat) or microsatellite markers will help both basic and applied genomics research of this crop. The Illumina HiSeq 2500 System was used to uncover 8,899 putative SSR containing sequences, and 3,275 non-redundant primers were designed to amplify these SSRs. Among the 1,644 SSRs that were randomly selected for primer validation, 841 yielded reliable amplifications of detectable polymorphisms among 24 genotypes of cultivated pea (Pisum sativum L.) and wild relatives (P. fulvum Sm.) originated from diverse geographical locations. The dataset indicated that the allele number per locus ranged from 2 to 10, and that the polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.08 to 0.82 with an average of 0.38. These 1,644 novel SSR markers were also tested for polymorphism between genotypes G0003973 and G0005527. Finally, 33 polymorphic SSR markers were anchored on the genetic linkage map of G0003973 × G0005527 F(2) population.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA primers 3aGeographical Locations 3aPisum sativum 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acrops 3adata collection 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aloci 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apeas 3awild relatives1 aFang, Li1 aZhang, Xiaoyan1 aHu, Jinguo1 aBao, Shiying1 aHao, Junjie1 aLi, Ling1 aHe, Yuhua1 aJiang, Junye1 aWang, Fang1 aTian, Shufang1 aZong, Xuxiao0 tPlos One.g2015 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.e0139775-wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/630403Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.01397753Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/High-Throughput%20Development%20of%20SSR.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013400164300001600298520132200314592002801636650001501664650001401679650001101693650001901704650001901723650001201742650001301754650001201767650001401779650001201793650001601805650004001821650001601861700001401877700001401891700001901905700001901924700001701943773010001960856008102060852000902141655001202150IND60120823620221119170721.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012082362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-013-2854-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wu-Cai10aTentative identification of sex-specific antibodies and their application for screening bovine sperm proteins for sex-specificity  ap. 217-223.  aOur previous studies indicated that a purified rabbit antiserum against X-sperm contained sex-specific antibodies (SSAbs) which preferentially bound to sex-sorted X-sperm. The specificity of sex-specific antiserum was initially demonstrated using flow cytometry only, which resulted in uncertainty. In this study, the putative SSAbs against bovine X-sperm (XSSAb) were produced by a series of immunological approaches, and the effectiveness of separation of sperm using putative XSSAb was validated. Subsequently, the XSSAb was used to immunoprecipitate sex-specific proteins (SSPs) in bovine sperm, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The results showed 7.6, 15.2 and 52.1 % of sex-sorted Y-sperm, sex-sorted X-sperm and unsorted sperm were recognized by the neutralized rabbit antisera against X-sperm, respectively. Also the purity of separation of sperm using putative XSSAb reached 74.3 % when the immunologically separated sperm were injected into oocytes. In addition, three candidate SSP sports about 30 kDa were captured by the XSSAb. Our results confirmed that the putative XSSAb contained SSAbs, and implied that these three protein sports might be SSPs in bovine X-sperm. This provides a potentially more efficient method for sorting sperm and lays a foundation for future search for SSPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aantiserum 3acattle 3aflow cytometry 3aneutralization 3aoocytes 3aproteins 3arabbits 3ascreening 3asorting 3aspermatozoa 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3auncertainty1 aSang, Lei1 aXiao, Yao1 aZhang, Hua-Lin1 aTang, Ke-Qiong1 aYang, Li-Guo0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.217-223dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-013-2854-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245009800173300001600271520104100287592002801328650002901356650002301385650001201408650001701420650001001437650001301447650001601460650000901476650001601485650001201501650001601513650003001529700002301559700001901582700001901601700002101620773010201641856008401743852000901827655001201836IND60605772220221120065116.0200117e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060577222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakočiūnas, Tadas10aCasPER, a method for directed evolution in genomic contexts using mutagenesis and CRISPR/Cas9  ap. 288-296.  aHere we describe a method for robust directed evolution using mutagenesis of large sequence spaces in their genomic contexts. The method employs error-prone PCR and Cas9-mediated genome integration of mutant libraries of large-sized donor variants into single or multiple genomic sites with efficiencies reaching 98–99%. From sequencing of genome integrants, we determined that the mutation frequency along the donor fragments is maintained evenly and successfully integrated into the genomic target loci, indicating that there is no bias of mutational load towards the proximity of the double strand break. To validate the applicability of the method for directed evolution of metabolic gene products we engineered two essential enzymes in the mevalonate pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with selected variants supporting up to 11-fold higher production of isoprenoids. Taken together, our method extends on existing CRISPR technologies by facilitating efficient mutagenesis of hundreds of nucleotides in cognate genomic contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3adirected evolution 3aenzymes 3agene editing 3agenes 3agenomics 3aisoprenoids 3aloci 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3anucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aPedersen, Lasse E.1 aLis, Alicia V.1 aJensen, M.

The addition of exogenous cholesterol to MβCD-treated cells or virions moderately restored PDCoV infectivity. Furthermore, the pharmacological sequestration of cellular or viral cholesterol efficiently blocked both virus attachment and internalization. Taken together, the current data indicate that the cholesterol present in the cell membrane and viral envelope contributes to PDCoV replication by acting as a key component in viral entry.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2015R1D1A1A09057406cNational Research Foundation of Korea0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDeltacoronavirus 3acell membranes 3acholesterol 3adose response 3apathogenicity 3avirion 3aviruses1 aLee, Changhee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5930-54610 tArchives of virology.g2018 Nov., v. 163, no. 11 p.3119-3124dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3967-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162300002000281520137300301592002801674596006401702596007801766650001201844650001201856650001401868650002301882650001301905650000901918650001001927650001801937650001301955650001501968650001801983650002402001650001302025650002102038650001102059650002302070650001602093650001302109700001602122700001502138700001602153700002002169700001302189700001202202773012402214856008202338852000902420655001202429IND60610585620221119185849.0180904e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061058562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2728-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Gang10aProcess study about silica anti-reflection coatings prepared by sol–gel method for cadmium telluride solar cells  ap. 15588-15599.  aSilica (SiO₂) thin films with different refractive indexes as the anti-reflection coating for cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells were prepared by sol–gel method in this paper. In order to obtain the preparation process of SiO₂ films with suitable refractive index, the different hydrolysis processes relied on the acid-base environment as well as the ratio of reactants was studied, respectively. It mainly includes that (I) the gel growth model in hydrogen or hydroxide ion environment provided by hydrochloric and ammonia. (II) The ratio of solvent, precursor and catalyst under base catalysis. (III) The weight and amount of polyethylene glycol molecular which is an additive agent to increase the porosity of sol film under acid catalysis. Based on the results above, a monolayer SiO₂ coating with optimized refractive index was applied onto the glass substrate of CdTe solar cell, and the quantum efficiency has been enhanced at the band of 400–800 nm. After that, multilayer SiO₂ coatings with high–low refractive indexes were designed according to the Fresnel theory to achieve wider spectrum (390–870 nm) enhancement. The broadband anti-reflection coatings (BARCs) were deposited on CdTe solar cell. The results were not consistent with expectations, which required further study about process matching between BARCs and device manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015AA050610cNational High-Tech R & D Program 863 of China  a2014GZ0159cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province (CN) 3aammonia 3acadmium 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoatings 3agels 3aglass 3agrowth models 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3amanufacturing 3apolyethylene glycol 3aporosity 3arefractive index 3asilica 3asol-gel processing 3asolar cells 3asolvents1 aHu, Dingqin1 aLi, Chuang1 aWang, Wenwu1 aZhang, Jingquan1 aWu, Lili1 aLi, Wei0 tJournal of materials science.g2018 Nov., v. 53, no. 22 p.15588-15599dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2728-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006700163300001600230520073300246592002800979650001501007650002001022650001901042650001101061650001301072650001901085650002501104650002001129650001701149650002901166650002701195700001601222700001801238773010001256856008101356852000901437655001201446IND60120823720221119170326.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012082372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-013-2855-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Sami10aMicroRNAs with a role in gene regulation and in human diseases  ap. 225-232.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 20–22 nucleotide non-coding RNA sequences.

Due to small ruminants being at a higher risk of developing obstructive urolithiasis after early castration, a relationship is expected to exist between disturbed local immunity, castration and disease. However, the underlying pathophysiology and histological correlation of this assumption are unknown. This study examines the local cellular immunity of the LUT in male lambs with respect to castration status or a recent history of obstructive urolithiasis. Various tissue samples were taken and examined. The sample consisted of 34 male lambs, aged six months (n = 11 early and n = 11 late castration; n = 12 intact) and eight rams that had undergone necropsy due to fatal outcome after obstructive urolithiasis. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD3-T-cells, CD79α-B-cells and MAC 387-macrophages were performed and compared among the groups. Whereas no global group differences were evident, significant differences were found for the localizations (P = 0.002) with a significant interaction between group and localization (P = 0.004). The immunohistochemical results suggest that castration did not affect the cell number, but did have an effect on the distribution pattern of local T-cells within the urethra. In the urolithiasis cases, a reduction of CD3-positive cells along the middle part of the urethra was noticeable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3acastration 3acell-mediated immunity 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3anecropsy 3apathophysiology 3aresearch 3arisk 3aurethra 3aurolithiasis 3aveterinary medicine 0aImmune cells 0aOvine1 aWehrend, Axel1 aWenisch, Sabine0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2021 July, v. 137 p.274-280dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012300168300001600291520141700307592002801724650001101752650002401763650001501787650001101802650001301813650002301826650001401849650002201863650001501885650001401900651001501914700002201929700002101951700002301972773009001995856004802085852000902133655001202142IND4469232320221120134450.0120710e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446923232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1136-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, Allison A.10aShort-term changes in-stream macroinvertebrate communities following a severe fire in the Lake Tahoe basin, California  ap. 117-130.  aLarge and severe wildfires can dramatically alter terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We documented changes in benthic macroinvertebrate communities and physical habitat at two sites along Angora Creek, CA, USA for 2Â years following a severe fire. Although post-fire years had low precipitation, canopy cover and bank stability declined dramatically following the wildfire (canopy cover: 88% pre-fire, 22% post-fire; stable bank: 93% pre-fire, 11% post-fire). Substrate also changed substantially, with fine sediment 8Ã more abundant post-fire and cobble 7Ã less abundant post-fire. We found no consistent changes in taxonomic richness or diversity following the fire, but post-fire densities and percentage of sensitive taxa were significantly reduced. We observed large reductions in relative abundances of shredder and scraper taxa, while collector-gatherer abundances increased. Community composition shifted away from pre-fire configurations, and continued to diverge in the second year following the fire. Scores from a regionally derived index of biotic integrity (IBI) were variable but overall much lower in post-fire samples and did not show recovery after 2Â years. Overall, our study demonstrated substantial post-fire effects to aquatic ecosystems even in the absence of large flooding or scouring events, and showed that these effects can be transmitted downstream into unburned reaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afloods 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3awatersheds 3awildfires 3aCalifornia1 aBogan, Michael T.1 aHerbst, David B.1 aDahlgren, Randy A.0 tHydrobiologia.g2012 Sept., v. 694, no. 1 p.117-130dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1136-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013900187300001600326520097500342592002801317650001601345650001301361650002601374650001001400650002001410650002501430650002401455650006101479650003001540650003801570650003301608650007201641650001001713650005701723650002801780650002201808650001401830650003001844650003001874650002301904650002601927650002701953700002501980700001802005700001702023773010702040856004802147852000902195655001202204IND50089965520221122140415.0140529e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008996552DNAL7 a244422772pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-013-0804-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRae, Georgina M.10aDRM1 and DRM2 expression regulation: potential role of splice variants in response to stress and environmental factors in Arabidopsis   ap. 317-332.  aThe DRM1/ARP gene family is increasingly exhibiting associations with stress conditions at the transcript level. Traditionally correlated with dormancy, increases in transcript levels in response to various treatments have also been reported in various species. As alternative transcript splicing is common in stress conditions, the splice variants of AtDRM1 and AtDRM2 were assessed further in this study. A previously undescribed splice variant of AtDRM1 (AtDRM1.6) is introduced in this work. In silico analyses of predicted protein sequence of all splice variants showed that all variants retain the predicted intrinsically disordered nature. Transcriptional studies of AtDRM1 and AtDRM2 in response to a wide range of abiotic, physical and hormonal treatments showed that AtDRM1.6 is differentially regulated at the transcriptional level compared with other splice variants. Promoter analyses demonstrated AtDRM1 light regulation via the upstream promoter sequence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3adormancy 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3astress response 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene-Environment Interaction 2aIntrinsically Disordered Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLight 2aMethyltransferasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPhenotype 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSalt Tolerancexgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aStress, Physiological 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aUversky, Vladimir N.1 aDavid, Karine1 aWood, Marion0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2014 June, v. 289, no. 3 p.317-332dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-013-0804-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245017700173300001500350520099100365592002801356650001101384650001401395650002001409650000901429650001001438650002301448650001101471650001301482650001601495650002101511700001601532773016001548856008101708852000901789655001201798IND60685892920221118062320.0200311e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6068589292DNAL7 a10.1017/S17427584000151742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamesse, Joseph Lebel10aIncidence de Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio) (Homoptera: Triozidae), Psylle Vecteur du Greening sur la Sensibilité des Plantules d’Agrumes dans une Pépinière au Cameroun  ap. 97-103.  aIt is known that in citrus orchards, the citrus psyllid Trioza erytreae (Homoptera: Triozidae) preferentially chooses certain varieties for egg laying, feeding and larval development. However, the selection mechanism in citrus nurseries is poorly understood. The aim of the present work was to study in the nursery, the behaviour of T. erytreae with respect to choice of egg laying and feeding sites in three species of citrus, namely Viliafranca lemon, Mexican lime and Fremont mandarin. One hundred young plants of each were exposed to the citrus psyllid on the fourth month after germination, and psyllids and pit galls counted every month. The impact of the psyllid’s damage on citrus was also assessed. Adults of T. erytreae were highly attracted to the young citrus plants three weeks after the germination of seeds. The average number of adults, eggs and larvae of T. erytreae by plant varied with the particular citrus plant: on young plants, adult, larval and egg populations  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aPsyllidae 3aTrioza erytreae 3aeggs 3agalls 3alarval development 3alemons 3aorchards 3aoviposition 3aseed germination1 aMessi, Jean0 tInternational journal of tropical insect science.g2002 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.97-103dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000093x1742-75927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17427584000151743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245011600174300001600290500001500306520088600321592002801207650001401235650001301249650001001262650001301272650001801285650001201303650000701315650002301322650001601345650002201361650003001383653001801413653000801431653002501439653001601464653001401480653001401494700001801508773014601526856008901672852000901761655001201770IND60611815020221117232518.0180904e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061181502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biologicals.2016.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakhija, Aditi10aCharacterization of duck plague virus stability at extreme conditions of temperature, pH and salt concentration  ap. 102-105.  a2019-12-06  aDuck plaque virus (DPV) belongs to the family Herpesviridae. The live attenuated vaccine is the only way to protect the ducks from DPV infection. The ineffectiveness of vaccine is one of the major causes of DPV outbreaks in the field condition. DPV is not well characterized for its pathogenicity and molecular biology in poultry. In the present study, we discuss briefly about the biology of DPV and its proteins under different conditions of temperature and pH in order to evaluate its infectivity under adverse physical conditions. Our results indicate that the DPV is non-infective above 42 °C and unstable above 65 °C. In addition, change in pH or salt concentrations significantly decreases the stability of the DPV. The study will be useful in estimating an optimum storage condition for DPV vaccines without causing any deterioration in its viability and effectiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aviability 3aproteins 3aducks 3avaccines 3apathogenicity 3aviruses 3apH 3asalt concentration 3atemperature 3amolecular biology 3aAnatid alphaherpesvirus 1 0aPathogenicity 0aDPV 0aAnatid herpesvirus 1 0aTemperature 0aInfection 0aStability1 aKumar, Sachin0 tBiologicals.g2017 Jan., v. 45 p.102-105dElsevier LtdaInternational Alliance for Biological StandardizationwJournal:11999x1045-10567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biologicals.2016.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
