Surfactant requires lamellar bodies (LBs), organelles containing densely packed concentric membrane layers, for storage and secretion. LB biogenesis remains mysterious but requires surfactant protein B (SP-B), which is synthesized as a precursor (pre-proSP-B) that is cleaved during trafficking into three related proteins. Here, we elucidate the functions and cooperation of these proteins in LB formation. We show that the N-terminal domain of proSP-B is a phospholipid-binding and -transfer protein whose activities are required for proSP-B export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and sorting to LBs, the conversion of proSP-B into lipoprotein particles, and neonatal viability in mice. The C-terminal domain facilitates ER export of proSP-B. The mature middle domain, generated after proteolytic cleavage of proSP-B, generates the striking membrane layers characteristic of LBs. Together, our results lead to a mechanistic model of LB biogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3abiogenesis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aexports 3akeratinosomes 3alipoproteins 3amechanistic models 3aphospholipids 3aproteolysis 3asecretion 3asurfactant proteins 3asurfactants 3aviability 0asaposin 0acrystal structure 0alipid transfer 0alysosome-related organelle 0amultilamellar 0aER exit 0aARDS 0aalveoli 0aDPPC 0aAT21 aMiličić, Goran1 aBodnar, Nicholas O.1 aWu, Xudong1 aRapoport, Tom A.0 tMolecular cell.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 81, no. 1 p.49-66.e8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245010600210506010400316506007600420520155600496592002802052506003702080650002102117650002302138650002202161650001102183653002402194653003202218653001402250653003602264653002402300700005702324700005402381773010502435856008802540852000902628655001202637IND60781424420221207064749.0220809e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078142442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.1100562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Phoebe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2020-198010aQuantifying the per-capita contribution of all components of a migratory cycle: A modelling framework  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMigratory species make use of different habitats and pathways at different life stages, and in different seasons. Ecological management strategies proposed for migratory species should acknowledge the importance of each component of the migratory cycle. Metapopulation approaches used to assess the quality of habitats do not capture key features of migratory populations. In recent years, contribution metrics – roughly, the annual contribution to a population from a single individual – that are suitable for migratory species and quantify the quality of habitats and pathways have been developed. However, existing contribution metrics are either not suitable for use on species that experience complex life histories or movement strategies; or are only able to differentiate between pathways taken during the first season of the annual cycle. Here, we develop a modelling framework to calculate contribution metrics that quantify the contribution of individuals migrating along specific pathways over any number of seasons in the annual cycle. Our framework yields easily-computable formulae, even for population models with complex migratory patterns. We illustrate our framework using hypothetical examples as well as a model inspired by the monarch butterfly, and highlight ecological insights that could not have been found using existing contribution metrics. We envisage our framework being used to identify the most important or vulnerable components of the migratory cycle, such that appropriate conservation strategies may be applied.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanaus plexippus 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3amodels 0aContribution metric 0aMatrix population modelling 0aMigration 0aSpatially-structured population 0aTheoretical ecology1 aGuiver, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6881-70201 aAdams, Ben1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9955-53610 tEcological modelling.g2022 Sept., v. 471 p.110056-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.1100563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245008800212300001900300500001900319520126400338592002801602650002201630650001201652650002901664650001201693650002001705653004001725653000801765653000901773653002001782653002701802653001401829653001201843653000901855653001001864653000901874700006101883700006001944700002302004700002702027700005902054773010802113856008402221852000902305655001202314IND60722848520221118051847.0210108e20210107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072284852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2020.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilbeck, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-453810aMimicry of Canonical Translation Elongation Underlies Alanine Tail Synthesis in RQC  ap. 104-114.e6.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAborted translation produces large ribosomal subunits obstructed with tRNA-linked nascent chains, which are substrates of ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). Bacterial RqcH, a widely conserved RQC factor, senses the obstruction and recruits tRNAᴬˡᵃ⁽ᵁᴳC⁾ to modify nascent-chain C termini with a polyalanine degron. However, how RqcH and its eukaryotic homologs (Rqc2 and NEMF), despite their relatively simple architecture, synthesize such C-terminal tails in the absence of a small ribosomal subunit and mRNA has remained unknown. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Bacillus subtilis RQC complexes representing different Ala tail synthesis steps. The structures explain how tRNAᴬˡᵃ is selected via anticodon reading during recruitment to the A-site and uncover striking hinge-like movements in RqcH leading tRNAᴬˡᵃ into a hybrid A/P-state associated with peptidyl-transfer. Finally, we provide structural, biochemical, and molecular genetic evidence identifying the Hsp15 homolog (encoded by rqcP) as a novel RQC component that completes the cycle by stabilizing the P-site tRNA conformation. Ala tailing thus follows mechanistic principles surprisingly similar to canonical translation elongation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aalanine 3acryo-electron microscopy 3ahybrids 3aquality control 0aribosome-associated quality control 0aRQC 0aRqcH 0aalanine tailing 0atranslation elongation 0aribosomes 0acryo-EM 0aSsrA 0aHsp15 0aRqcP1 aCerullo, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6042-78101 aPaternoga, Helge1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8335-32391 aTsaprailis, George1 aJoazeiro, Claudio A.P.1 aPfeffer, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5843-27950 tMolecular cell.g2021 Jan. 07, v. 81, no. 1 p.104-114.e6dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245012900177300001800306520163700324592002801961596009001989650002602079650001702105650002402122650001702146650002602163650002302189650001702212650001602229650001702245650001802262650001802280650001402298650002802312650001302340650001702353650001902370650003102389650001702420650001402437700002402451700003302475700002602508700002302534700002802557700003102585700003502616700002402651700001902675773013102694856008302825852000902908655001202917IND60789156420221118065005.0220818e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915642DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-022-07598-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Mirna Samara Dié10aIn vitro and in silico trichomonacidal activity of 2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl) quinoline analogs against Trichomonas vaginalis  ap. 2697-2711.  aTrichomoniasis is a great public health burden worldwide and the increase in treatment failures has led to a need for finding alternative molecules to treat this disease. In this study, we present in vitro and in silico analyses of two 2,8-bis(trifluoromethyl) quinolines (QDA-1 and QDA-2) against Trichomonas vaginalis. For in vitro trichomonacidal activity, up to seven different concentrations of these drugs were tested. Molecular docking, biochemical, and cytotoxicity analyses were performed to evaluate the selectivity profile. QDA-1 displayed a significant effect, completely reducing trophozoites viability at 160 µM, with an IC₅₀ of 113.8 µM, while QDA-2 at the highest concentration reduced viability by 76.9%. QDA-1 completely inhibited T. vaginalis growth and increased reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation after 24 h of treatment, but nitric oxide accumulation was not observed. In addition, molecular docking studies showed that QDA-1 has a favorable binding mode in the active site of the T. vaginalis enzymes purine nucleoside phosphorylase, lactate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, and thioredoxin reductase. Moreover, QDA-1 presented a level of cytotoxicity by reducing 36.7% of Vero cells’ viability at 200 µM with a CC₅₀ of 247.4 µM and a modest selectivity index. In summary, the results revealed that QDA-1 had a significant anti-T. vaginalis activity. Although QDA-1 had detectable cytotoxicity, the concentration needed to eliminate T. vaginalis trophozoites is lower than the CC₅₀ encouraging further studies of this compound as a trichomonacidal agent.  aPublisher supplied data  a88882.346971/2019-01cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aTrichomonas vaginalis 3aactive sites 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3anitric oxide 3anucleosides 3aparasitology 3aphosphorylase 3apublic health 3aquinoline 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch 3athioredoxins 3atrichomoniasis 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 3atrophozoites 3aviability1 aSena-Lopes, Ângela1 adas Neves, Raquel Nascimento1 aCasaril, Angela Maria1 aDomingues, Micaela1 aBirmann, Paloma Taborda1 ada Silva, Emerson Teixeira1 ade Souza, Marcus Vinicius Nora1 aSavegnago, Lucielli1 aBorsuk, Sibele0 tParasitology research.g2022 Sept., v. 121, no. 9 p.2697-2711dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-022-07598-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245017900164520130100343592002801644650002201672650000901694650002101703650001501724650002201739650001901761650001801780650002101798650001601819651002101835700002001856700001801876700002001894700002201914700001801936700002101954700002001975700001801995773012202013856007902135852000902214655001202223IND60754372920221118044025.0211023e20210922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075437292DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101019792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyeon-Min 10aNon-Deep Simple Morphophysiological Dormancy and Germination Characteristics of Gentiana triflora var. japonica (Kusn.)

Hara for developing a seed propagation method. The seeds were collected in October 2020 from plants at Mt. Sobaeksan, Korea. In a water imbibition experiment, seed weights increased by >101.9% of their initial masses over 12 h. Effects of incubation temperature (5, 15, 20, 25, 15/6, or 25/15 °C), cold stratification period (5 °C; 0, 4, 8, or 12 weeks), and gibberellic acid (GA₃; 0, 10, 100, or 1000 mg∙L⁻¹) and potassium nitrate treatment (KNO₃; 0, 1000, 2000, or 4000 mg∙L⁻¹) on seed germination were investigated to characterize seed dormancy. These seeds exhibited underdeveloped embryos during seed dispersal. The seeds failed to reach the final germination of 15.0% after treatment at 5, 15, 20, 25, 15/6, or 25/15 °C. After cold stratification for 8 weeks, the germination increased dramatically by >90.0% compared to that at 0 weeks. After the GA₃ treatment, the germination reached >80.0% within 5 days. The final germination was 90.0% in the 100 mg∙L⁻¹ GA₃ treatment group. However, the KNO₃ treatment had no effect on seed germination. Therefore, the G. triflora var. japonica seeds exhibited non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGentiana triflora 3acold 3agibberellic acid 3aimbibition 3apotassium nitrate 3aseed dispersal 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3atemperature 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKim, Jun-Hyeok 1 aLee, Da-Hyun 1 aJung, Young-Ho 1 aPark, Chung-Youl 1 aLee, Mi-Hyun 1 aKim, Kyeong-Min 1 aLee, Jae-Hyeon 1 aNa, Chae-Sun 0 tPlants.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101019793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245015800200500002000358520169400378592002802072596010202100650000902202650001002211650001602221650001302237650001802250650002802268650001402296650001602310650001502326650002402341650001702365650001202382700002102394700002102415700001902436773014302455856007402598852000902672655001202681IND60681257720221123032049.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068125772DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.143162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavahian, Mohsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4904-051914aThe effects of dielectric barrier discharge plasma gas and plasma‐activated water on texture, color, and bacterial characteristics of shiitake mushroom  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper presents the first study on the effects of 20‐min dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) gas plasma and arc plasma‐activated water (PAW) on the total bacterial count (TBC), color values, and textural characteristics of shiitake on day 0 and day 7 of storage at 4 °C. The results were then compared to those of untreated samples (DC) and samples soaked in distilled water (WC). According to the results, after 7 days of storage, TBC of PAW‐ and DBD‐treated samples were 0.89 ± 0.01 and 0.6 ± 0.05 log CFU/g lower than those of control samples, respectively. Furthermore, both DBD and PAW treatments reduced the overall color changes (∆E) in samples during storage. Besides, PAW‐treated samples had the greatest texture firmness value (1.27 ± 0.16 N) after a week of storage. These findings along with a good potential for the upscaling process suggest PAW can be a prospective commercial technique for extending the shelf‐life of fresh shiitake mushrooms. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The feasibility of shelf‐life enhancement of fresh produce confers a great interest in cold plasma gas and plasma‐activated water (PAW) with respect to their industrial application. Particularly, extending the shelf‐life of shiitake is an important topic for exporters of this fresh agricultural product, considering the high demands for this product in many countries. The findings of the present study introduced cold plasma, especially arc PAW, as a promising technique for shelf‐life enhancement of shiitake mushroom. The preservation method proposed in this study is scalable and further economic and engineering studies may result in its industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data  a108‐EC‐17‐A‐22‐0332cBureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Republic of Taiwan 3acold 3acolor 3aengineering 3afirmness 3afresh produce 3aindustrial applications 3amushrooms 3aplate count 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3atexture1 aSheu, Fang‐Hwa1 aTsai, Meng‐Jen1 aChu, Yan‐Hwa0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2020 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.e14316-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.143163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245006800201300001600269500001900285500002000304520231100324592002802635650002002663650001202683650001902695650001602714650003002730650001502760651001802775700002002793700002202813700001902835700002202854700002402876700002402900700002002924700001902944700002202963773011302985856007403098852000903172655001203181IND60740327920221122055925.0210602e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074032792DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.055042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodie, Stephanie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0869-993910aExploring timescales of predictability in species distributions  ap. 832-844.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAccurate forecasts of how animals respond to climate‐driven environmental change are needed to prepare for future redistributions, however, it is unclear which temporal scales of environmental variability give rise to predictability of species distributions. We examined the temporal scales of environmental variability that best predicted spatial abundance of a marine predator, swordfish Xiphias gladius, in the California Current. To understand which temporal scales of environmental variability provide biological predictability, we decomposed physical variables into three components: a monthly climatology (long‐term average), a low frequency component representing interannual variability, and a high frequency (sub‐annual) component that captures ephemeral features. We then assessed each component's contribution to predictive skill for spatially‐explicit swordfish catch. The monthly climatology was the primary source of predictability in swordfish spatial catch, reflecting the spatial distribution associated with seasonal movements in this region. Importantly, we found that the low frequency component (capturing interannual variability) provided significant skill in predicting anomalous swordfish distribution and catch, which the monthly climatology cannot. The addition of the high frequency component added only minor improvement in predictability. By examining models' ability to predict species distribution anomalies, we assess the models in a way that is consistent with the goal of distribution forecasts – to predict deviations of species distributions from their average historical locations. The critical importance of low frequency climate variability in describing anomalous swordfish distributions and catch matches the target timescales of physical climate forecasts, suggesting potential for skillful ecological forecasts of swordfish distributions across short (seasonal) and long (climate) timescales. Understanding sources of prediction skill for species environmental responses gives confidence in our ability to accurately predict species distributions and abundance, and to know which responses are likely less predictable, under future climate change. This is important as climate change continues to cause an unprecedented redistribution of life on Earth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aXiphias gladius 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimatology 3ageographical distribution 3aprediction 3aPacific Ocean1 aAbrahms, Briana1 aBograd, Steven J.1 aCarroll, Gemma1 aHazen, Elliott L.1 aMuhling, Barbara A.1 aPozo Buil, Mercedes1 aSmith, James A.1 aWelch, Heather1 aJacox, Michael G.0 tEcography.g2021 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.832-844dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.055043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245011300172300001600285500001500301520132700316592002801643650001401671650003001685650000901715653001701724700002401741773009801765856007801863852000901941655001201950IND60137882220221118060259.0150525e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013788222DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2014011092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSursyakova, Viktoria V.10aNew peak broadening parameter for the characterization of separation capability in capillary electrophoresis  ap. 690-696.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of separation conditions on peak broadening is usually estimated by the number of theoretical plates. Using the data available in literature and experimental data, it is shown that in pressure‐assisted capillary electrophoresis the plate number is not directly related to the separation capability of conditions used. The experiments at different electrolyte flow velocities demonstrate that a higher plate number (the best separation efficiency) can be obtained with a lower peak resolution. Since ions are separated by electrophoresis due to the difference in electrophoretic mobilities, the peak width in terms of electrophoretic mobility is suggested as a new peak broadening parameter describing the separation capability of the conditions used. The parameter can be calculated using the tailing factor and the temporal peak width at 5% of the peak height. A simple equation for the resolution calculation is derived using the parameter. The advantage of the peak width in terms of mobility over other parameters is shown. The new parameter is recommended to be used not only in pressure‐assisted capillary electrophoresis but also in general capillary electrophoresis when in a number of runs the virtual separative migration distance and separation capability of the conditions used change widely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aions 0aelectrolytes1 aRubaylo, Anatoly I.0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Feb., v. 38, no. 4 p.690-696dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014011093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013600175300001600311520100700327592002801334650001401362650003001376650001201406650002801418653002401446653001901470653004301489653001801532653003901550773012901589856005101718852000901769655001201778IND50088443720221117224810.0140414e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008844372DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2013.7793402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColocousis, Chris R.14aThe Biophysical Dimension of Community Economic Addiction: Examining the Emergence of Biomass Energy in a Northern Forest Community  ap. 688-701.  aThis article examines economic redevelopment in a small city once dependent on the pulp and paper industry.

This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects’ relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5–50% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It’s better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3acloud computing 3acomputer software 3ageographic information systems 3ainformation services 3amodels 3aspatial data 0aGIS data model 0aRelative space 0aMoving objects 0aSpatiotemporal analysis 0aHuman dynamics1 aShaw, Shih-Lung1 aFang, Zhixiang1 aCheng, Hao0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2019 July, v. 153 p.74-95dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

A Randomized Clinical Trial  aNAL-light  aDiet modulates gut microbiota and plays an important role in human health. The aim of this study was to test the effect of a low-fat vegan diet on gut microbiota and its association with weight, body composition, and insulin resistance in overweight men and women. We enrolled 168 participants and randomly assigned them to a vegan (n = 84) or a control group (n = 84) for 16 weeks. Of these, 115 returned all gut microbiome samples. Gut microbiota composition was assessed using uBiome Explorer™ kits. Body composition was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin sensitivity was quantified with the predicted clamp-derived insulin sensitivity index from a standard meal test. Repeated measure ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Body weight decreased in the vegan group (treatment effect -5.9 kg [95% CI, -7.0 to -4.9 kg]; p < 0.001), mainly due to a reduction in fat mass (-3.9 kg [95% CI, -4.6 to -3.1 kg]; p < 0.001) and in visceral fat (-240 cm³ [95% CI, -345 to -135 kg]; p < 0.001). PREDIcted M, insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM) increased in the vegan group (treatment effect +0.83 [95% CI, +0.48 to +1.2]; p < 0.001). The relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increased in the vegan group (+5.1% [95% CI, +2.4 to +7.9%]; p < 0.001) and correlated negatively with changes in weight (r = -0.24; p = 0.01), fat mass (r = -0.22; p = 0.02), and visceral fat (r = -0.20; p = 0.03). The relative abundance of Bacteroides fragilis decreased in both groups, but less in the vegan group, making the treatment effect positive (+18.9% [95% CI, +14.2 to +23.7%]; p < 0.001), which correlated negatively with changes in weight (r = -0.44; p < 0.001), fat mass (r = -0.43; p < 0.001), and visceral fat (r = -0.28; p = 0.003) and positively with PREDIM (r = 0.36; p < 0.001), so a smaller reduction in Bacteroides fragilis was associated with a greater loss of body weight, fat mass, visceral fat, and a greater increase in insulin sensitivity. A low-fat vegan diet induced significant changes in gut microbiota, which were related to changes in weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity in overweight adults, suggesting a potential use in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aadults 3abody weight changes 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3ahuman health 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amass 3amen 3anutrients 3aoverweight 3arandomized clinical trials 3asampling 3astatistical analysis 3avegan diet 3avisceral fat 3aweight 3awomen1 aRembert, Emilie 1 aAlwarith, Jihad 1 aYonas, Willy  N.1 aTura, Andrea 1 aHolubkov, Richard 1 aAgnello, Melissa 1 aChutkan, Robynne 1 aBarnard, Neal  D.0 tNutrients.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121029173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05494naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245025500174520313100429592002803560650002103588650001503609650002503624650001003649650001803659650002103677650002003698650001203718650003203730650002303762650001703785650001103802650001403813650000903827650001803836650002203854650002003876650001403896650002703910650001603937650004103953650001503994650001204009650000904021650003204030650001804062650002404080650001804104650001404122650001504136650003204151650002004183650001604203650001704219650001704236650002104253650001004274653000704284653000804291653000804299653000704307653000804314653000904322653001304331653001204344653001404356653002204370653001004392700001704402700001604419700002504435773011804460856008904578852000904667655001204676IND60676442020221121045453.0200128e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067644202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2019.1143412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvazkhanloo, M.10aFlaxseed extrusion and expansion coupled with enzyme and pelleting changed protein and lipid molecular structure of flaxseed and improved digestive enzymes activity, intestinal morphology, breast muscle fatty acids and performance of broiler chickens  aAn experiment was performed as a completely randomized design in a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 4 replicates of 15 chicks in each pen to investigate the effects of flaxseed extrusion and expansion accompanying with enzyme addition in mash or pelleted diets on protein and lipid molecular structure spectral and performance characteristics of broiler chickens. Factors included were four types of flaxseed: control (corn-soybean meal based diet with no flaxseed), raw flaxseed (RF, 200 g/kg), extruded flaxseed (ETF, 200 g/kg) and expanded flaxseed (EPF, 200 g/kg); two levels of carbohydrase enzyme (0 or 25 mg/kg) and two forms of diet (pellet or mash). Performance criteria, protein and lipid molecular structures, blood biochemical characteristics, digestive enzymes activity and nutrient digestibility, cecal microbial population and breast muscle fatty acids profile were evaluated during the trial. EPF increased BW and reduced FCR compared to the RF and ETF throughout the experimental period (0–28 d., P ≤ 0.001). Pelleting the diets increased BW, improved feed consumption and reduced FCR in comparison to the mash diets fed chicks (P ≤ 0.001). Enzyme addition had no impact on BW, FCR and feed intake of chickens. Both EPF and ETF reduced α-helix and increased ß-sheet height and increased CH3 asymmetric stretching compared to raw flaxseed (P < 0.05). Distinct spectral differences were detected between RF and processed flaxseed and also diets containing the processed flaxseed. Digestive lipase and alkaline phosphatase activity were increased when chicks were fed with diets containing EPF and ETF (P ≤ 0.003). Total alkaline protease (APA) was reduced by inclusion of RF. Plasma total protein concentration was significantly increased and triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels were reduced in chicks fed with flaxseed included diets (P ≤ 0.05). Except for villus to crypt ratio which was increased (P ≤ 0.05) by RF addition, no significant differences were observed in intestinal morphological characteristics by flaxseed processing, pelleting the diets and enzyme supplementation. Apparent total tract lipid and calcium digestibility were increased (P ≤ 0.001) and phosphorus digestibility was reduced as RF incorporated to the diets. Salmonella and E. coli population were considerably reduced by ETF and EPF (P ≤ 0.001). The total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were increased and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) were reduced in breast muscle by feeding the flaxseed containing diets regardless of flaxseed processing (P ≤ 0.01). Long chain n-3 fatty acids (18:3 n-3; 20:5 n-3; 22:5 n-3 and 22:6 n-3) were increased and n-6 to n-3 ratio was reduced with inclusion of flaxseed regardless of processing conditions (P≤0.01). Myristic, palmitic and stearic acid content of breast muscle were reduced (P ≤ 0.01) in EPF included diets. In conclusion the findings suggest that expansion of flaxseed is beneficial for inclusion of high levels of flaxseed in broiler rations and for meat enrichment with n-3 fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ablood 3abreast muscle 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3acalcium 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3achemical structure 3achicken meat 3achicks 3acorn meal 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestive enzymes 3aenzyme activity 3aextrusion 3afatty acid composition 3afeed intake 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aintestines 3alinseed 3amash 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3amyristic acid 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apalmitic acid 3apelleting 3aphosphorus 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotein content 3aproteinases 3asoybean meal 3astearic acid 3atriacylglycerols 3avilli 0aRF 0aETF 0aEPF 0aBW 0aFCR 0aFTIR 0aFlaxseed 0aBroiler 0aExpansion 0aStructural change 0aLipid1 aShahir, M.H.1 aKhalaji, S.1 aJafari Anarkooli, I.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2020 Feb., v. 260 p.114341-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2019.1143413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245011200205300001200317506007600329520183900405592002802244506003702272650001802309650001802327650001502345650001602360650001802376650001502394650001002409650002702419650002202446650001702468650002002485650001002505650001002515650002102525650001902546650002002565650001702585650001602602650001802618650001302636650001402649650001202663650003002675650002202705650002702727651001202754651001802766700001602784700002402800700001902824700001902843700002002862773009402882856004602976852000903022655001203031IND50063777620221207133619.0140228e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006377762DNAL7 a10.1186/1297-9716-44-102doi7 aPMC35985382pmcid7 a233988072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlias, Philipp10aModulation of the host Th1 immune response in pigeon protozoal encephalitis caused by Sarcocystis calchasi   ap. 215.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPigeon protozoal encephalitis (PPE) is an emerging central-nervous disease of domestic pigeons (Columba livia f. domestica) reported in Germany and the United States. It is caused by the apicomplexan parasite Sarcocystis calchasi which is transmitted by Accipter hawks. In contrast to other members of the Apicomplexa such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, the knowledge about the pathophysiology and host manipulation of Sarcocystis is scarce and almost nothing is known about PPE. Here we show by mRNA expression profiling a significant down-modulation of the interleukin (IL)-12/IL-18/interferon (IFN)-γ axis in the brains of experimentally infected pigeons during the schizogonic phase of disease. Concomitantly, no cellular immune response was observed in histopathology while immunohistochemistry and nested PCR detected S. calchasi. In contrast, in the late central-nervous phase, IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α-related cytokines were significantly up-modulated, which correlated with a prominent MHC-II protein expression in areas of mononuclear cell infiltration and necrosis. The mononuclear cell fraction was mainly composed of T-lymphocytes, fewer macrophages and B-lymphocytes. Surprisingly, the severity and composition of the immune cell response appears unrelated to the infectious dose, although the severity and onset of the central nervous signs clearly was dose-dependent. We identified no or only very few tissue cysts by immunohistochemistry in pigeons with severe encephalitis of which one pigeon repeatedly remained negative by PCR despite severe lesions. Taken together, these observations may suggest an immune evasion strategy of S. calchasi during the early phase and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction as cause of the extensive cerebral lesions during the late neurological phase of disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aColumba livia 3aPlasmodium 3aSarcocystis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToxoplasma 3abrain 3acell-mediated immunity 3aemerging diseases 3aencephalitis 3agene expression 3ahawks 3ahosts 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmune evasion 3aimmune response 3ainterleukins 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3anecrosis 3aparasites 3apigeons 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotein synthesis 3atumor necrosis factors 3aGermany 3aUnited States1 aMeyer, Anne1 aKlopfleisch, Robert1 aLierz, Michael1 aKaspers, Bernd1 aGruber, Achim D0 tVeterinary research.g2013 Dec., v. 44, no. 1 p.215-215dSpringer-Verlagx1297-97167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-10  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009800155500002000253520132700273592002801600596009001628596004901718650001501767650001501782650001101797650002101808650000901829650001301838650002201851650001401873650001801887650001501905700001701920700001501937700001901952700002001971700005701991773014302048856007402191852000902265655001202274IND60681258220221123021254.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068125822DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.142552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Weili10aFormation of crust of dried meat and its relationship to moisture migration during air drying  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTo speed up the migration of moisture during air drying under common condition (35°C, 60% relative humidity, 3 m/s wind speed), the relationship between crust formation and moisture migration was investigated. The results showed that shear force was inversely proportional to moisture content, meanwhile moisture content in surface decreased more quickly than that in the inner part of lamb cubes during air drying (p < .05). This indicated that the crust of meat surface was due to quicker decline of moisture content. Light microscopy showed that, the formation of crust and decrease of crust's porosity with drying was partly due to shrinkage of the connective tissue. This study concluded that changing the shrinkage characteristics of connective tissue might be a way to increase the meat porosity, influence the water migration, and shorten the drying time. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Jerky processing, especially drying of it, is time and energy consuming. The aim of this article was to find the relationship between crust and water migration during air drying. We found that changing the shrinkage characteristics of connective tissue might be a way to increase the meat porosity, influence the water migration, and shorten the drying time. This study provides some ideas for shortening the drying time of jerky.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014DFT30250cNational research programs cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan  aCARS‐39cChina Agriculture Research System 3aair drying 3adried meat 3aenergy 3alight microscopy 3ameat 3aporosity 3arelative humidity 3ashrinkage 3awater content 3awind speed1 aWang, Zhenyu1 aLi, Guixia1 aMeng, Tingting1 aSuleman, Raheel1 aZhang, Dequan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3277-61130 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2020 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.e14255-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.142553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015400168300001800322500001900340520100600359592002801365650001801393650000901411650001901420650001901439650001301458650001601471700005701487700005401544773011301598856008401711852000901795655001201804IND60740812120221118074921.0210608e20210524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074081212DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c008582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Lingqi10aSuperhydrophobic Poly(l-lactic acid) Membranes with Fish-Scale Hierarchical Microstructures and Their Potential Application in Oil–Water Separation  ap. 6765-6775.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, superhydrophobic poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) hierarchical membranes exhibiting excellent oil-removal performance, which is of great importance in curbing the oil-pollution environment, were fabricated by a simple solvent-evaporation-induced precipitation method. PLLA membranes with hierarchical micro/nanostructures (fish scales, fibrous sheets, and petal-like morphology) can be conveniently prepared by adjusting the preparation parameters including PLLA concentration, precipitation temperature, type of solvent and nonsolvent, and the addition of nano-SiO₂. The results show that the water contact angle of the fish-scale-structured PLLA membrane was 138.6°, revealing that water repellency was significantly improved compared to that of the solvent-casting PLLA membrane (∼72.8°). Moreover, the PLLA/SiO₂ nanocomposite membrane with a dense hierarchical micro/nanostructure had a water contact angle greater than 167.1°, which has great potential in oil–water separation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3afish 3ahydrophobicity 3ananocomposites 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aTao, Haizheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5013-837X1 aGong, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5513-53540 tLangmuir.g2021 May 24, v. 37, no. 22 p.6765-6775dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c008583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245009100201300001600292500001900308500002000327520181000347592002802157650001402185650002002199650002902219650001502248650001502263650001402278650001902292650001102311650001402322650002502336650001902361650002402380651001102404700005902415700006602474700005702540773011302597856007402710852000902784655001202793IND60740328420221120144723.0210602e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074032842DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.052102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Marlee A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7535-343110aHuman‐induced reduction in mammalian movements impacts seed dispersal in the tropics  ap. 897-906.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeed dispersal is a key process affecting the structure, composition and spatial dynamics of plant populations. Numerous plant species in the tropics rely upon animals to disperse their seeds. Humans have altered mammalian movements, which will likely affect seed dispersal distances (SDD). Altered SDD may have a range of consequences for plant communities including reduced seedling recruitment and plant biomass, seed trait homogenization, altered gene flow and a reduced capacity to respond to environmental changes. Therefore, modelling the consequences of altered animal behaviour on ecosystem processes is important for predicting how ecosystems will respond to human impacts. While previous research has focused on the link between animal species extirpation and SDD, it remains unclear how changes in mammalian movement will impact SDD. Here we implemented a mechanistic modelling approach to examine how mammalian movement reductions impact SDD in the tropics. We combined allometric theory with a mechanistic seed dispersal model to estimate SDD via the movement of 37 large frugivorous mammals (> 10 kg) in the tropics under different levels of human footprint, a global proxy of direct and indirect human disturbances. Our results suggest that assemblage‐level SDD reductions are estimated to be up to 80% across the tropics in response to human disturbance. This is particularly the case in areas with high human impact such as agricultural landscapes and suburban areas. The region with the largest reductions in SDD was the Asia‐Pacific with average reductions of 25%, followed by Central–South America (16%) and then Africa (15%). Our study provides insights into how human‐induced changes in movement behaviour of large mammals could translate into altered ecosystem functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallometry 3aanimal behavior 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystems 3afrugivores 3agene flow 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3aphytomass 3aseed characteristics 3aseed dispersal 3aspecies recruitment 3aAfrica1 aBusana, Michela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3806-85751 aHuijbregts, Mark A.

Artificial Intelligence-based models have been widely used in air quality forecasting. The Shallow Multi-output Long Short-Term Memory (SM-LSTM) model is suitable for regional multi-step-ahead air quality forecasting, while it commonly encounters spatio-temporal instabilities and time-lag effects. To overcome these bottlenecks and overfitting issues, this study proposed a Deep Multi-output LSTM (DM-LSTM) neural network model that were incorporated with three deep learning algorithms (i.e., mini-batch gradient descent, dropout neuron and L2 regularization) to configure the model for extracting the key factors of complex spatio-temporal relations as well as reducing error accumulation and propagation in multi-step-ahead air quality forecasting. The proposed DM-LSTM model was evaluated by three time series of PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, and NOₓ simultaneously at five air quality monitoring stations in Taipei City of Taiwan. Results indicated that the loss function values (mean-square-error) of the SM-LSTM and DM-LSTM models in the testing stages at horizon t+4 were 0.87 and 0.72, respectively. The Gbₑₙcₕ values of the DM-LSTM model in the testing stages for PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, and NOₓ reached 0.95 at horizon t+1 and exceeded 0.81 at horizon t+4, respectively. Results demonstrated that the proposed DM-LSTM model incorporated with three deep learning algorithms could significantly improve the spatio-temporal stability and accuracy of regional multi-step-ahead air quality forecasts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aalgorithms 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneurons 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3atime series analysis 3aTaiwan 0aMulti-output LSTM 0aDeep learning 0aArtificial intelligence (AI) 0aMulti-step-ahead forecast 0aAir quality 0aTaipei city1 aChang, Fi-John1 aChang, Li-Chiu1 aKao, I-Feng1 aWang, Yi-Shin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 209 p.134-145dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.2433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04272naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245006700201506007600268520235600344592002802700506003702728650002602765650001402791650001802805650001602823650001502839650001502854650000902869650001002878650001202888650002202900650002302922650002202945650001502967650002502982650001203007650002203019650002403041650004303065650001303108650001203121650001303133650001503146650000903161650001703170650001203187650004003199650001503239700001803254700001903272700001903291700002503310700002003335700003203355700001803387773012203405856007403527852000903601655001203610IND60650257720221207094041.0190709e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065025772DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100302712doi7 aPMC58726892pmcid7 a294955162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Carmen10aEffects of a Carob-Pod-Derived Sweetener on Glucose Metabolism  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a higher incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events. The ingestion of high-glycemic index (GI) diets, specially sweetened beverage consumption, has been associated with the development of T2DM and CV disease. Objective: We investigated the effects of the intake of a sweetened beverage, obtained from natural carbohydrates containing pinitol (PEB) compared to a sucrose-enriched beverage (SEB) in the context of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes. Methods: The study was divided in three different phases: (1) a discovery phase where the plasma proteomic profile was investigated by 2-DE (two-dimensional electrophoresis) followed by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight—MALDI-TOF/TOF) in healthy and IGT volunteers; (2) a verification phase where the potential mechanisms behind the observed protein changes were investigated in the discovery cohort and in an additional group of T2DM volunteers; and (3) the results were validated in a proof-of-concept interventional study in an animal model of diabetic rats with complementary methodologies. Results: Six weeks of pinitol-enriched beverage (PEB) intake induced a significant increase in two proteins involved in the insulin secretion pathway, insulin-like growth factor acid labile subunit (IGF1BP-ALS; 1.3-fold increase; P = 0.200) and complement C4A (1.83-fold increase; P = 0.007) in IGT subjects but not in healthy volunteers. Changes in C4A were also found in the serum samples of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats after four weeks of PEB intake compared to basal levels (P = 0.042). In addition, an increased expression of the glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2) gene was observed in the jejunum (P = 0.003) of inositol-supplemented rats when compared to sucrose supplementation. This change was correlated with the observed change in C4A (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the substitution of a common sugar source, such as sucrose, by a naturally-based, pinitol-enriched beverage induces changes in the insulin secretion pathway that could help to reduce blood glucose levels by protecting β-cells and by stimulating the insulin secretion pathway. This mechanism of action could have a relevant role in the prevention of insulin resistance and diabetes progression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal disease models 3abeverages 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acomplement 3adesorption 3adiet 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin secretion 3aionization 3aislets of Langerhans 3ajejunum 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3apinitol 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3arats 3asomatomedins 3asucrose 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3avolunteers1 aCubedo, Judit1 aPadró, Teresa1 aVilahur, Gemma1 aLópez-Bernal, Sergi1 aRocha, Milagros1 aHernández-Mijares, Antonio1 aBadimon, Lina0 tNutrients.g2018 Feb. 27, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100302713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003000155245011400185300001400299520106100313592002801374650002001402650000901422650001201431650002501443650002101468650001601489650002101505650001301526650001001539650001401549650002401563650001301587650001801600650001801618650001901636650001801655650000901673650001001682650001301692650001401705650002001719650002401739650002701763650002501790653002401815653002101839653001201860653001301872653001601885653001701901653001601918653002501934700002301959700002201982700005902004700002102063700005802084700002102142773011802163856009002281852000902371655001202380IND60644262820221121024157.0190613e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064426282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Romero, Domingo10aRosehip oil coating delays postharvest ripening and maintains quality of European and Japanese plum cultivars  ap. 29-36.  aIn the present research the effect of rosehip oil (RO) coating on postharvest ripening process and fruit quality parameters of `President´ and `Royal Rosa´ plums was evaluated. Results show that the ethylene production was significantly reduced in coated plums with respect to controls either during storage at 20 ᵒC or at 2 ᵒC + 2 d at 20 ᵒC, as well as respiration rate. The increase on free and total 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC) was also decreased in RO coated plums. The evolution of fruit quality parameters related with the plum ripening process, such as firmness, colour Hue and total soluble solid (TSS)/titratable acidity (TA) ratio, during storage at both temperatures was also delayed by the application of RO coating, as well as the increase in phenolic and carotenoid concentrations and the antioxidant activity due to hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. Thus, RO coating could be considered as a new eco-friendly tool to be applied in the agro-food industry to preserve plum quality and extend its storability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus salicina 3aRosa 3aacidity 3aantioxidant activity 3acarboxylic acids 3acarotenoids 3acell respiration 3acoatings 3acolor 3acultivars 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afood industry 3afruit quality 3ahydrophilicity 3alipophilicity 3aoils 3aplums 3aripening 3arose hips 3astorage quality 3astorage temperature 3asustainable technology 3atotal soluble solids 0aEthylene production 0aRespiration rate 0aQuality 0aRipening 0aPolyphenols 0aAnthocyanins 0aCarotenoids 0aAntioxidant activity1 aCastillo, Salvador1 aGuillén, Fabián1 aPaladine, Diego1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5425-94861 aZapata, Pedro J.1 aValero, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3945-16291 aSerrano, María,0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2019 Sept., v. 155 p.29-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245018800198300001600386500001900402500002000421520228600441592002802727650001202755650001002767650001202777650002002789650001902809650002102828650001102849650001202860650001602872650001502888650001202903650001102915700006102926700006002987700006303047773011303110856007403223852000903297655001203306IND60740328620221120140922.0210602e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074032862DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.055202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsen, Paul R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9953-796110aContrasting seasonal patterns of relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity and their influence on breeding and winter bird richness patterns across the conterminous United States  ap. 953-965.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnvironmental heterogeneity enhances species richness by creating niches and providing refugia. Spatial variation in climate has a particularly strong positive correlation with richness, but is often indirectly inferred from proxy variables, such as elevation and related topographic heterogeneity indices, or derived from interpolated coarse‐grain weather station data. Our aim was to develop new remotely sensed metrics of relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity, compare them with proxy measures, and evaluate their performance in predicting species richness patterns. We analyzed Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor data, calculated two thermal metrics during summer and winter, and compared their seasonal spatial patterns with those of elevation and topographic heterogeneity. We fit generalized least squares models to evaluate each variable's effect in predicting seasonal bird richness using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Generally speaking, neither elevation nor topographic heterogeneity were good proxies for temperature or thermal heterogeneity, respectively. Relative temperature had a non‐linear relationship with elevation that was negatively quadratic in summer, but slightly positively quadratic in winter. Topographic heterogeneity had a stronger positive relationship with thermal heterogeneity in winter than in summer. The magnitude and direction of elevation–temperature and topographic heterogeneity–thermal heterogeneity relationships in each season also varied substantially across ecoregions. Remotely sensed metrics of relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity improved the predictive performance of species richness models, and both thermal variables had significant effects on bird richness that were independent of elevation and topographic heterogeneity. Thermal heterogeneity was positively related to total breeding bird richness, migrant breeding bird richness and resident bird richness, whereas topographic heterogeneity was negatively related to total breeding richness and unrelated to migrant or resident bird richness. Because thermal and topographic heterogeneity had contrasting seasonal patterns and effects on richness, they must be carefully contextualized when guiding conservation priorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abirds 3aclimate 3arefuge habitats 3aremote sensing 3aspecies richness 3asummer 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atopography 3aweather 3awinter1 aFarwell, Laura S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5829-83971 aPidgeon, Anna M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0090-33521 aRadeloff, Volker C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9004-221X0 tEcography.g2021 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.953-965dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.055203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245012100180300001400301520115600315592002801471650002001499650001701519650002501536650002401561650000901585650002501594650001301619650002101632650001701653650001401670650002401684650002001708650001501728650002801743650000701771650001401778650001501792650001601807650001701823650002301840650002401863650002501887650002301912653002201935653003001957653002301987653002402010653003302034700002402067700002202091700002002113700002702133700002202160773011802182856009002300852000902390655001202399IND60644262920221121014323.0190613e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064426292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdiletta, Giuseppina10aOverall quality and antioxidant enzymes of ready‐to‐eat ‘Purple Queen’ pomegranate arils during cold storage  ap. 20-28.  aThis study evaluated the effectiveness of two different packaging systems, using micro-perforated (MPP) and semipermeable (SP) films, on the physico-chemical and nutraceutical traits, microbial quality, and antioxidant enzymatic system of ready-to-eat pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) arils (cultivar ‘Purple Queen’) stored at 5 °C for 16 d. Statistically significant differences in gas composition and arils qualitative traits such as pH and titratable acidity between the two packaging systems were found. Arils packaged in the SP system had higher polyphenols and anthocyanins contents, followed by a high antioxidant activity, with a positive correlation (r = 0.610 and 0.940, respectively) among them. An increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, were registered in the arils in the SP system, with a decrease in polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activity involved in arils-browning. Overall, SP packaging could be a valid system to preserve ready-to-eat arils within food chains that maintain high qualitative and nutraceutical features up to 16 d of storage.  aPublisher supplied

reaching consequences for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Crop modelling can help inform the improvement of agricultural productivity under future climate. This study applies the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to assessing the impacts of projected climate change on two (early and medium maturing) sorghum varieties under different management practices. Results show high model accuracy with excellent agreement between simulated and observed values for crop phenology and leaf number per plant. The prediction of grain yield and total biomass of an early maturing variety was fair RMSEₙ (22.9 and 23.1%), while that of the medium maturing was highly accurate RMSEₙ (14.9 and 11.9%). Sensitivity analysis performed by changing the calibrated variables of key plant traits in the model, showed higher significant yield change by + or - 10 % changed in radiation use efficiency, (RUE), coefficient extinction (Coeff_ext) and Phyllocron (Phyllo) for early maturing variety while + or - 10 % changed in phyllochron and RUE showed a significant yield change for the medium maturing variety. Under climate change scenerios using RCP 8.5, the simulated yield for the early–maturing variety revealed high inter-annual variability and potential yield loss of 3.3% at Bamako and 1% at Kano in the near-future (2010–2039) compared to baseline (1980–2009). The mid-century (2040–2069) projected yield decline by 4.8% at Bamako and 6.2% at Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009). On the contrary, the medium maturing variety indicated significantly yield gain with high yielding potential in both climate regimes compared to the baseline period (1980–2009). The simulated grain yield increased by 7.2% at Bamako and 4.6% at Kano, in the near-future (2010–2039) while in the mid-century (2040–2069) projected yield increase of 12.3% and 2% at Bamako and Kano compared to baseline (1980–2009). Adaptation strategies under climate change for varying sowing dates in the near-future (2010–2039, indicated that June sowing had a higher positive yield gained over July and August sowing for early maturing variety; July sowing simulated positive gained by 5 -11% over June and August sowing for medium maturing variety in both locations. Similarly, under the mid-century (2040–2069), among the sowing dates and in both locations, June sowing indicates lowest negative yield change over July and August sowing for early maturing variety. However, for medium maturing variety, July sowing had the highest yield gain of 16% over June and August sowing at Bamako and June highest positive yield gained of 11.4% over July and August at Kano. Our study has, therefore, demonstrated the capacity of APSIM model as a tool for testing management, plant traits practices and adoption of improved variety for enhancing the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers under climate change in the Sudanian zone of West Africa. This approach offers a promising option to design more resilient and productive farming systems for West Africa using the diverse sorghum germplasm available in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuta graveolens 3aaccuracy 3aadministrative management 3aagricultural productivity 3aagriculture 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acrop models 3acultivars 3adesign 3afarmers 3afield crops 3agermplasm 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3alivelihood 3aphenology 3aprediction 3aproduction technology 3aradiation use efficiency 3aresearch 3asowing date 3atesting 3avariability 3aWestern Africa 0aAPSIM 0aClimate scenarios 0aSorghum 0aWater-Limited environment 0aSimulated yield potential1 aAjeigbe, Hakeem A.1 aTraore, Pierre C.S.1 aAgele, Samuel O.1 aZemadim, Birhanu1 aWhitbread, Anthony0 tField crops research.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 246 p.107685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.1076853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012000167300001500287520171900302592002802021650002802049650001502077650002702092650002302119650002002142650004002162650001402202650001502216650001102231650004302242650001502285650001502300653002302315653002302338653002302361700001702384700001602401700001502417700001702432700001702449700001402466700001902480773034402499856008402843852000902927655001202936IND60611264920221123003124.0180831e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061126492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2016.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuzzetti, R.10aClinical worthlessness of genetic prediction of common forms of diabetes mellitus and related chronic complications  ap. 99-114.  aWe are currently facing several attempts aimed at marketing genetic data for predicting multifactorial diseases, among which diabetes mellitus is one of the more prevalent. The present document primarily aims at providing to practicing physicians a summary of available data regarding the role of genetic information in predicting diabetes and its chronic complications.Firstly, general information about characteristics and performance of risk prediction tools will be presented in order to help clinicians to get acquainted with basic methodological information related to the subject at issue. Then, as far as type 1 diabetes is concerned, available data indicate that genetic information and counseling may be useful only in families with many affected individuals. However, since no disease prevention is possible, the utility of predicting this form of diabetes is at question. In the case of type 2 diabetes, available data really question the utility of adding genetic information on top of well performing, easy available and inexpensive non-genetic markers. Finally, the possibility of using the few available genetic data on diabetic complications for improving our ability to predict them will also be presented and discussed. For cardiovascular complication, the addition of genetic information to models based on clinical features does not translate in a substantial improvement in risk discrimination. For all other diabetic complications genetic information are currently very poor and cannot, therefore, be used for improving risk stratification.In all, nowadays the use of genetic testing for predicting diabetes and its chronic complications is definitively of little value in clinical practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3acounseling 3adiabetic complications 3adisease prevention 3agenetic testing 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3amarketing 3ametabolism 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aphysicians 3aprediction 0aPrecision medicine 0aMolecular medicine 0aGenetic prediction1 aPrudente, S.1 aCopetti, M.1 aDauriz, M.1 aZampetti, S.1 aGarofolo, M.1 aPenno, G.1 aTrischitta, V.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2017 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.99-114dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2016.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012400171300001400295520183800309592002802147650002302175650001702198650001602215650001302231650001002244650001202254650001502266650002202281650001502303650004302318650005202361650001102413650002002424650001702444650001202461650002902473650002502502653002302527653001702550653003102567653002102598653001402619653002002633700001302653700001702666700001602683700001602699700001802715773011802733856009002851852000902941655001202950IND60644263020221121033643.0190613e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064426302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Jingqi10aEvaluation of dry and wet storage on vase quality of cut peony based on the regulation of starch and sucrose metabolism  ap. 11-19.  aHerbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) is one of the most important cut flowers worldwide, but the short natural florescence seriously affects its industrial development. In this study, the cut peony ‘Yang Fei Chu Yu’ was preserved in dry storage (DS) and wet storage (WS), respectively, at 0–4 °C. We set two treatments of short- and long-term storage (S-tS, 3 d; L-tS, 23 d). We assessed the postharvest performance; determined the changes in starch, sucrose, glucose, and fructose; and then analyzed the expression of a subset of representative genes that regulate starch and sucrose metabolism by RT-qPCR. When compared to WS, our results indicated that DS treatment exhibited significantly higher vase quality of cut peony after both S-tS and L-tS. For S-tS, this effect should be due to faster starch consumption during storage of 1–3 d and sucrose hydrolysis at the beginning of the vase period. The change in starch hydrolysis can be attributed to increased expression of PlSPS1 and PlSPS4 as well as decreased expression of PlSUS4, whereas the sucrose metabolism should be associated with the inducing of PlSUS3 expression. During S-tS, PlCWIN1 may positively and PlVIN1 may negatively affect vase quality by adjusting water use efficiency. Inducing expression of PlCIN1 and PlCIN2 may also improve cut flower quality, probably via other pathways. For L-tS, the higher level of glucose and fructose content at the end of the period may be more beneficial in improving vase quality. The increasing expression of PlSUS3 and the decreasing expression of PlVIN1 as well as the inducing expression of the three PlCINs may regulate this process at the transcriptional level. Based on these results, we recommend that DS is used for cut peony cold storage within a prescribed period, regardless of the storage time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaeonia lactiflora 3acold storage 3acut flowers 3afructose 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3aindustrialization 3ametabolism 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astarch 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3asucrose 3atranscription (genetics) 3awater use efficiency 0aPaeonia lactiflora 0aCold storage 0aSucrose phosphate synthase 0aSucrose synthase 0aInvertase 0aGene expression1 aTang, Ye1 aWang, Shunli1 aXue, Yuqian1 aLiu, Xianwu1 aZhang, Xiuxin0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2019 Sept., v. 155 p.11-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001800094024003100112040001800143100001400161245014300175300001800318520135000336592002801686650002201714650001301736650002001749650002001769650001601789650002201805650001501827650001001842650001001852650001501862650002601877650004901903650005701952650005102009650001102060651001102071651001402082651001502096651001402111700001402125700001902139700001902158700001702177700001802194700002302212700001302235700001402248700001602262700002102278700001402299700001602313773009902329856004402428852000902472655001202481IND50088784320221119055359.0140416e199711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008878432DNAL7 a96725812pmid7 a10.1007/s0070500502302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulyanto,10aDistribution of the hepatitis B surface antigen subtypes in Indonesia: implications for ethnic heterogeneityand infection control measures  ap. 2121-2129.  aPrevious studies on the distribution of subtypes of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in Indonesia have not entirely covered the whole nation. Consequently, we determined the HBsAg subtypes, adw, adr, ayw, and ayr in a total of 569 HBsAg-positive sera from areas so far not studied. With results in this and our previous studies taken together (a total of 3045 HBsAg-positive sera were analyzed), a nationwide picture on the HBsAg subtype distribution indicated that Indonesia could roughly be divided into 4 zones: (i) adw-predominant zone consisting of Sumatera, Java, southern part of Kalimantan, Bali, Lombok, Ternate, and Morotai; (ii) ayw-zone of the eastern part of Nusa Tenggara and Moluccas, (iii) adr-zone of Irian Jaya; and (iv) a mixed subtype-zone of Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Sumbawa. An interesting exception was Padang of Sumatera island: Padang was rich in adr although it is far from the adr-zone. Since the HBsAg subtype, like mutations in mitochondrial DNA, could be used as an ethnological marker, our present results suggest that the peoples in Indonesia have at least three major ethnic origins, represented by adw, ayw, and adr. Of another note, the diagnostic and preventive measures for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Indonesia may be improved by considering such diversity of HBV strains revealed in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3aantigens 3acontrol methods 3adisease control 3ahepatitis B 3amitochondrial DNA 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aEthnicity. 2aGenetic Heterogeneity 2aHepatitis Bxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aHepatitis B Surface Antigensxbloodxclassification. 2aHepatitis B virusxclassificationximmunology. 2aHumans 3aBorneo 3aIndonesia 3aNew Guinea 0aIndonesia1 aTsuda, F.1 aKarossi, A.

In this work, we study the effects of electrostatic inhibition on the reaction rate of unimolecular reactions catalyzed on the surface of a spherical model nanoparticle using particle-based reaction-diffusion simulations. Moreover, we derive closed rate equations based on an approximate Debye–Smoluchowski rate theory, valid for diffusion-controlled reactions, and a modified Langmuir adsorption isotherm, relevant for reaction-controlled reactions, to account for electrostatic inhibition in the Debye–Hückel limit. We study the kinetics of reactions ranging from low to high adsorptions on the nanoparticle surface and from the surface- to diffusion-controlled limits for charge valencies 1 and 2. In the diffusion-controlled limit, electrostatic inhibition drastically slows down the reactions for strong adsorption and low ionic concentration, which is well described by our theory. In particular, the rate decreases with adsorption affinity because, in this case, the inhibiting products are generated at a high rate. In the (slow) reaction-controlled limit, the effect of electrostatic inhibition is much weaker, as semiquantitatively reproduced by our electrostatic-modified Langmuir theory. We finally propose and verify a simple interpolation formula that describes electrostatic inhibition for all reaction speeds (“diffusion-influenced” reactions) in general.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3areaction inhibition 3asorption isotherms1 aRoa, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4439-418X1 aDzubiella, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6751-14870 tLangmuir.g2021 May 25, v. 37, no. 22 p.6800-6810dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c009033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007500167300001600242520076900258592002801027650002901055650003501084650002101119650001601140650001201156650001101168650001301179700001701192700001801209700001801227700001901245773010101264856008401365852000901449655001201458IND60083840820221119002007.0141101e20111020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008384082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2010.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Dandan10aConstruction of recombinant mercury resistant Acidithiobacillus caldus  ap. 515-520.  aA mercury-resistant plasmid of pTMJ212 which was able to shuttle between Acidithiobacillus caldus and Escherichia coli was constructed by inserting the mercury resistant determinants, the mer operon of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, into the IncQ plasmid of pJRD215. pTMJ212 was transferred from Escherichia coli into Acidithiobacillus caldus through conjugation.

The cirques under relatively low-altitude peaks (2200–2800 m) include the greatest variety of glacial landforms (moraines, fossil debris-covered glaciers and rock glaciers), but their age and formation process are poorly known. Here, we focus on the headwaters of the Garonne River, namely on the low-altitude Bacivèr Cirque (highest peaks at ~2600 m), with widespread erosive and depositional glacial and periglacial landforms. We reconstruct the pattern of deglaciation from geomorphological observations and a 17-sample dataset of ¹⁰Be Cosmic-Ray Exposure (CRE) ages. Ice thickness in the Bacivèr Cirque must have reached ~200 m during the maximum ice extent of the last glacial cycle, when it flowed down towards the Garonne paleoglacier. However, by ~15 ka, during the Bølling-Allerød (B-A) Interstadial, the mouth of the cirque was deglaciated as the tributary glacier shrank and disconnected from the Garonne paleoglacier. Glacial retreat was rapid, and the whole cirque was likely to have been deglaciated in only a few centuries, while paraglacial processes accelerated, leading to the transformation of debris-free glaciers into debris-covered and rock glaciers in their final stages. Climate conditions prevailing at the transition between the B-A and the Younger Dryas (YD) favored glacial growth and the likely development of small moraines within the slopes of the cirque walls by ~12.9 ka, but the dating uncertainties make it impossible to state whether these moraines formed during the B-A or the YD. The melting of these glaciers favored paraglacial dynamics, which promoted the development of rock glaciers as well as debris-covered glaciers. These remained active throughout the Early Holocene until at least ~7 ka. Since then, the landscape of the Bacivèr Cirque has seen a period of relative stability. A similar chronological sequence of deglaciation has been also detected in other cirques of the Pyrenees below 3000 m. As in other mid-latitude mountain regions, the B-A triggered the complete deglaciation of the Garonne paleoglacier and promoted the development of the wide variety of glacial and periglacial landforms existing in the Bacivèr cirque.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aaltitude 3adata collection 3afossils 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3aice 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3arivers 0aCentral Pyrenees 0aBølling-Allerød 0aDeglaciation 0aCosmic-Ray Exposure dating 0aMoraines 0aPolished bedrock 0aParaglacial processes1 aFernandes, M.1 aPalacios, D.1 aFernández-Fernández, J.-M.1 aSchimmelpfennig, I.1 aAntoniades, D.1 aAumaître, Georges1 aBourlès, Didier1 aKeddadouche, Karim2 aASTER Teameauthor0 tGeomorphology.g2021 July 15, v. 385 p.107735-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1077353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245008900206506007600295520141200371592002801783506003701811650003001848650003201878650001901910650001301929650002601942650002401968650002801992650001002020650002302030650001202053650001202065650001002077650001702087650002302104650001302127650001602140651001002156651001802166651001802184700001802202700001802220700002102238700002102259700002402280700001802304773012202322856007402444852000902518655001202527IND60650258120221207094124.0190709e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065025812DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100303822doi7 aPMC58728002pmcid7 a295584132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrarrázaval, Belén10aInfluence of Feeding Practices on Malnutrition in Haitian Infants and Young Children  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInfant malnutrition remains an important cause of death and disability, and Haiti has the highest prevalence in the Americas. Therefore, preventive strategies are needed. Our aims were (1) To assess the prevalence of malnutrition among young children seen at a health center in Haiti; (2) Examine adherence to infant feeding practices recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the association to nutritional status. This cross-sectional study recruited children from the Saint Espri Health Center in Port Au Prince in 2014. We recorded feeding practices, socio-demographic data, and anthropometric measurements (WHO-2006). We evaluated 278 infants and children younger than two years old, aged 8.08 ± 6.5 months, 53.2% female. 18.35% were underweight (weight/age <−2 SD); 13.31% stunted (length/age <−2 SD), and 13.67% had moderate or severe wasting (weight/length <−2 SD). Malnutrition was associated with male gender, older age, lower maternal education level, and greater numbers of siblings (Chi2, p < 0.05). Adherence to recommended breastfeeding practices was 11.8–97.9%, and to complementary feeding practices was 9.7–90.3%. Adherence was associated with a lower prevalence of malnutrition. Conclusion: Prevalence of infant and young child malnutrition in this population is high. Adherence to WHO-recommended feeding practices was associated with a better nutritional status.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanthropometric measurements 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3acomplementary feeding 3acomplementary foods 3across-sectional studies 3adeath 3aeducational status 3afemales 3ainfants 3amales 3amalnutrition 3anutritional status 3asiblings 3aunderweight 3aHaiti 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aBarja, Salesa1 aBustos, Edson1 aDoirsaint, Romel1 aSenethmm, Gloria1 aGuzmán, María Paz1 aUauy, Ricardo0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100303823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245009800175300001600273520195700289592002802246650001702274650001502291650001102306650001802317650002002335650004402355650001502399650001702414650001702431650001202448650001202460650001802472650001102490651001902501651001202520651001602532651001902548653001702567653002002584653002102604653001202625653001902637700002202656773010802678856008402786852000902870655001202879IND50060264020221122214705.0190318e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006026402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2012.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuraishi, Mohammed Z.10aCalibration of an on-line sensor for measurement of topsoil bulk density in all soil textures  ap. 219-228.  aAn on-line sensor for the prediction of bulk density (BD) has been previously developed, and calibrated for light textured soils. This study aims to expand the implementation of this sensor for all soil types, including clay soils. The on-line sensor consists of a single ended shear beam load cell to measure draught (D), a visible and near infrared (vis–NIR) sensor to measure moisture content (MC), and a wheel gauge equipped with a draw wire linear sensor to measure depth (d). This sensor was used to collect data from 14 fields across four European countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, the Netherlands and the UK) with different soil textures. The three measured parameters were substituted into a previously developed model to calculate BD. The calculated BD for 333 samples was compared with BD measured with a core sampling kit to validate the system and to calculate correction factors (CF) valid for each additional soil texture. A multiple linear regression (MLR), nonlinear multiple regression (NMR) and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses were carried out to establish models to predict CF, as a function of average field MC and soil texture fractions.For clay soils, the correlation between the measured and on-line predicted BD was satisfactory (R2=0.54–0.69), and suggested a large negative CF>−0.248Mgm−3. For other soil types with lighter soil textures, accuracy of measurements varied (R2=0.51–0.96), with lower CF values than those calculated for clay soils and ranged between negative and positive values (−0.007Mgm−3<CF<0.079Mgm−3). The ANN analysis resulted in the best model to predict CF as function of MC and soil texture fractions (R2=0.96), which allowed the utilisation of the on-line measurement system for any field having any texture and average MC. The on-line BD sensor was shown to be capable of predicting field dry BD rapidly for a large number of samples, as compared with traditional methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclay soils 3agauges 3alinear models 3aneural networks 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprediction 3asoil density 3asoil texture 3atexture 3atopsoil 3awater content 3awheels 3aCzech Republic 3aDenmark 3aNetherlands 3aUnited Kingdom 0aBulk density 0aSoil compaction 0aMoisture content 0aTexture 0aOn-line sensor1 aMouazen, Abdul M.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2013 Jan., v. 126 p.219-228dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2012.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245019200157300001600349500001900365500002000384520190100404592002802305650002502333650002102358650002102379650001502400650001802415650001102433650001802444650003002462650001302492650001202505650001802517650003202535650001702567650001302584650001002597650003502607650001302642650001502655700002402670700002002694700007502714773014902789856007302938852000903011655001203020IND60740329120221120155053.0210602e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074032912DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.134632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Jianwei,10aOntogeny of hepatic methionine catabolic enzyme activities (Transmethylation and Transsulphuration) and associated physiological amino acids in E10‐21 chick embryos and D1‐49 broilers  ap. 507-519.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDevelopmental changes in hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase, cystathionine β‐synthase, cystathionase, and glycine N‐methyltransferase were determined in broiler chick embryos and hatched chicks by using radiometric and spectrometric methods. Hepatic free methionine, S‐adenosylmethionine, S‐adenosylhomocysteine, homocysteine, cystathionine, and cysteine levels were also investigated. Results showed an increase in hepatic MAT activity from E10 to E21 during embryogenesis, suggesting greater transmethylation rates throughout the rapid embryonic growth and development period. A strong positive correlation between embryo BW and MAT activity also supports this idea. The MAT specific activity continued to increase after hatching, but there was a negative correlation between chick BW and MAT activities from D1 to D49. This may indicate different MAT isozymes exist for chick embryo hepatic tissue compared to hepatic tissue of hatched chick and growing broilers. The developmental pattern of MAT isozymes could be critical for methionine metabolism to cope with the demand imposed on the embryo, chicks, and growing broilers. Additionally, the specific activity of hepatic CBS in chick embryos was determined to be lower compared to that observed in older broilers (35 and 49 days). Since liver CBS specific activity is at the lowest point from D1‐7 in young chicks, the ability to convert adequate homocysteine to cysteine through transsulphuration may be limiting for cysteine synthesis at this time. Steady‐state hepatic homocysteine levels in chick embryos and chicks may be a function of the rates of homocysteine formation, remethylation, and catabolism via the transsulphuration pathway. The present study indicates young chicks from D1 to D7 may have a limited ability for adequate transsulphuration; therefore, dietary cystine may be needed for optimum performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aanimal nutrition 3abroiler chickens 3acatabolism 3achick embryos 3achicks 3acystathionine 3acystathionine gamma-lyase 3acysteine 3acystine 3aembryogenesis 3aglycine N-methyltransferase 3ahomocysteine 3aisozymes 3aliver 3amethionine adenosyltransferase 3aontogeny 3aradiometry1 aWeil, Jordan Taylor1 aCerrate, Sandro1 aCoon, Craig N.q(Craig Nelson),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4410-36800 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2021 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.507-519dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.134633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245015200203506007600355520143500431592002801866506003701894650001101931650001301942650000901955650001401964650001201978650001201990650001402002650002502016650002302041650001402064650001302078650002202091700001702113700002502130700002102155700002202176700002202198700002202220700001902242700002502261773012202286856007402408852000902482655001202491IND60650258220221207094125.0190709e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065025822DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100303832doi7 aPMC58728012pmcid7 a295584232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfawaz, Hanan A.10aEffects of Different Dietary and Lifestyle Modification Therapies on Metabolic Syndrome in Prediabetic Arab Patients: A 12-Month Longitudinal Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis three-arm, randomized, controlled study aimed to determine the differences in the effects of general advice (GA) on lifestyle change, intensive lifestyle modification programme (ILMP) and GA + metformin (GA + Met) in reducing the prevalence of full metabolic syndrome (MetS) in subjects with prediabetes; 294 Saudis with prediabetes (fasting glucose 5.6–6.9 mmol/L) were initially randomized, 263 completed 6 months and 237 completed 12 months. They were allocated into three groups: GA group which received a standard lifestyle change education; ILMP which followed a rigorous lifestyle modification support on diet and physical activity; and a GA + Met group. Anthropometric and biochemical estimations were measured. Full MetS (primary endpoint) and its components (secondary endpoint) were screened at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Full MetS in the ILMP group decreased by 26% (p < 0.001); in GA + Met group by 22.4% (p = 0.01) and in GA group by 8.2% (p = 0.28). The number of MetS components decreased significantly in the ILMP and GA + Met groups (mean change 0.81, p < 0.001 and 0.35, p = 0.05, respectively). Between-group comparison revealed a clinically significant decrease in MetS components in favor of the ILMP group (−0.58 (−0.88–0.28), p < 0.001). This study highlights the clinical potency of ILMP versus other diabetes prevention options in reducing MetS in Saudi adults with elevated fasting glucose.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3adiabetes 3adiet 3aeducation 3afasting 3aglucose 3alifestyle 3alongitudinal studies 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametformin 3apatients 3aphysical activity1 aWani, Kaiser1 aAlnaami, Abdullah M.1 aAl-Saleh, Yousef1 aAljohani, Naji J.1 aAl-Attas, Omar S.1 aAlokail, Majed S.1 aKumar, Sudhesh1 aAl-Daghri, Nasser M.0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100303833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245010700200300001600307500001900323500002000342520182600362592002802188650002702216650002102243650001302264650002302277650001402300650001502314650002102329650002202350650001702372650001402389650001302403650000902416650001202425650001002437650002402447650001902471650001802490650001102508650001302519650001302532650001002545700001802555700002002573700002102593700001702614773014902631856007302780852000902853655001202862IND60740329220221120155110.0210602e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074032922DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.134842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Kuijk, Sandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1264-985710aEffect of immunized egg proteins on the performance and neonatal diarrhoea incidence in newborn calves  ap. 462-469.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to assess the effects of feeding immunized egg proteins (IEP) on the health and performance of newborn dairy calves. Sixty‐four Holstein calves, both male and female, were divided over two treatments. Calves either received IEP or a placebo (PCB) in their colostrum and calf milk replacer (CMR) for the first 14 days of their life. Until day 49, CMR was offered at 15% of birth weight (BW), at 10% on days 49–57 and at 5% on days 57–63. In addition, calves received starter concentrate, chopped straw and water from 3 days old until 70 days old at the end of study. Individual CMR and concentrate intake were measured daily whilst BW was recorded weekly. Visual faecal scoring and health observations were conducted daily. Faecal samples were collected weekly up to 4 weeks and during the first 4 days of scouring to screen for presence of Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli and Salmonella. Results indicated that feeding IEP increased BW (p < .05) at 42 and 56 days old, and BW also tended (p = .06) to be higher after weaning at 63–70 days old compared to the PCB group. When analysed using a repeated measures model, compared to feeding PCB, feeding IEP increased total concentrate consumption (p = .001) by 3.6kg/calf. Over the entire study, daily water intake was higher (p = .002) for the IEP group when compared with the PCB group. In the IEP group, 12 calves were scored as scouring whereas there were 14 calves in the PCB group. There were no significant differences between treatments in faecal pathogen load of neither healthy nor scouring calves. In conclusion, supplementing IEP during the first 14 days of calf life improved the performance of newborn calves. Further work is warranted to understand the mode of action of IEP in calves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aEscherichia coli 3aHolstein 3aOrthocoronavirinae 3aRotavirus 3aSalmonella 3aanimal nutrition 3aanimal physiology 3abirth weight 3acolostrum 3adiarrhea 3aeggs 3afemales 3amales 3amechanism of action 3amicrobial load 3amilk replacer 3amodels 3aneonates 3aplacebos 3astraw1 aKinkead, Ruth1 aScoley, Gillian1 aMorrison, Steven1 aHan, Yanming0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2021 May, v. 105, no. 3 p.462-469dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54774x0931-24397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpn.134843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245026600165300001600431520093700447592002801384650002001412650002101432650004301453650001501496650002201511650001901533650001001552650002601562651001001588700002101598700001601619700002301635700002101658773009801679856007801777852000901855655001201864IND60137883520221118060114.0150525e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013788352DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2014010082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dong‐Xia10aSimultaneous separation and determination of phenolic acids, pentapeptides, and triterpenoid saponins in the root of Aster tataricus by high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry  ap. 571-575.  aWe established a qualitative method to analyze the main chemical compositions of the root of Aster tataricus.

In Chile, two out of three people are overweight, whereas 25% of the adult population is obese. Abdominal fat, has been linked to the development of a number of metabolic disorders. Waist circumference (WC) and the waist:height ratio (WHtR) have recently been evidenced as good predictors of metabolic risk for both adults and children. Thus, the present work aims at establishing smoothed centile charts and LMS tables for WC and WHtR for Chilean adults based on data from the National Health Survey-ENS, in order to have reliable information for identifying groups at risk.A sample of 4788 subjects aged 15–75 years old (mean age 46 ± 18 years old) was considered. Body weight, height, and WC were measured and Body Mass Index (BMI) and WHtR were also determined. Percentiles were calculated using the L (curve Box–Cox), M (curve median), S (curve coefficient of variation) method. In the obese group the WC cutoff values were 99.75 cm and 92.35 cm for men and women, respectively. The cutoff point for WHtR was 0.59 for both obese men and women.The study shows, for the first time, reference values for WC and WHtR for Chilean adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aadults 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3achildren 3amen 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3anormal values 3aobesity 3apublic health 3awaist circumference 3aweight gain 3awomen 3aChile 0aWHtR 0aMetabolic risk 0aOverweight 0aObesity 0aWHO 0aBMI 0aWC 0aWHtR 0aENS1 aGarcia-Rubio, J.1 aOviedo-Silva, F.1 aCollado-Mateo, D.1 aMerellano-Navarro, E.1 aOlivares, P.R.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2017 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.183-189dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2016.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03841naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245005900172500001900231520253000250592002802780650001202808650001502820650001602835650001402851650001602865650001102881650001602892650001102908650001602919650000902935650001502944650001202959650001502971650002202986650001603008653002003024653001303044653002603057653002003083700002603103700001703129700001903146773009803165856008703263852000903350655001203359IND60734010020221120215647.0210527e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073401002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1077462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGökkaya, Ergin10aSinkhole development in the Sivas gypsum karst, Turkey  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe extensive gypsum karst of Sivas, Turkey is one of the most outstanding examples of bare gypsum karst in the world. It displays a number of remarkable geomorphic features, including: (1) two stepped planation surfaces cut-across folded gypsum developed during an initial phase of slow base level deepening punctuated by periods of stability; (2) unusual deeply entrenched gypsum canyons related to a subsequent phase of rapid fluvial incision and water table lowering; (3) a polygonal karst of superlative quality mainly developed in the upper surface; (4) relict valleys disrupted by sinkholes in the lower erosional surface; (5) a large number of bedrock collapse sinkholes mostly associated with the lower surface; and (6) numerous cover subsidence sinkholes developed in the valley floors. This work analyses the spatial distribution, characteristics and evolution of the sinkholes within the broad Plio-Quaternary geomorphological and paleohydrological evolution of the epigene karst system dominated by autogenic recharge. A cartographic sinkhole inventory has been produced in an area covering 2820 km² with morphometric data and including 295 bedrock collapse sinkholes and 302 cover subsidence sinkholes. The different sinkhole types show a general spatial zonation controlled by the hydrogeological functioning of the different sectors: (1) solution sinkholes (polygonal karst) in the upper recharge area; (2) bedrock collapse sinkholes in the lower denudation surface and close to the base level, where well developed caves are inferred; and (3) cover subsidence sinkholes, with high densities probably associated with areas of preferred groundwater discharge. The morphology of the bedrock collapse sinkholes, varying from small cylindrical holes to large and deep tronco-conical depressions with gentle slopes reflect to geomorphic evolution of these sinkholes that reach exceptionally large hectometre-scale diameters. Their evolution, involving substantial enlargement and deepening, is attributed to the solutional removal as solute load of large volumes of gypsum by downward vadose flow. This type of morphological evolution with significant post-collapse solutional denudation differs from that observed in carbonate rocks characterised by lower solubility and erodibility. The analysis of historical imagery reveals that bedrock collapse sinkholes currently have a very low probability of occurrence and that buried cover subsidence sinkholes are used for urban development creating risk situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3acarbonates 3aerodibility 3aevolution 3agroundwater 3agypsum 3ainventories 3akarsts 3amorphometry 3arisk 3asolubility 3asolutes 3asubsidence 3aurban development 3awater table 0aEvaporite karst 0aCollapse 0aSolutional denudation 0aSinkhole hazard1 aGutiérrez, Francisco1 aFerk, Mateja1 aGörüm, Tolga0 tGeomorphology.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 386 p.107746-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1077463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245017300200506007600373520152700449592002801976506003702004650002102041650002502062650001602087650001702103650002002120650001202140650001302152650000902165650001802174650001702192650001302209650001702222650001402239650001402253700002002267700002102287773012202308856007402430852000902504655001202513IND60650258420221207092416.0190709e20180227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065025842DNAL7 a10.3390/nu100302722doi7 aPMC58726902pmcid7 a294955182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Takako10aVitamin D and Calcium Addition during Denosumab Therapy over a Period of Four Years Significantly Improves Lumbar Bone Mineral Density in Japanese Osteoporosis Patients  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study investigated whether or not vitamin D and calcium supplementation affected bone metabolism and bone mineral density (BMD) over a period of four years of denosumab therapy in patients with primary osteoporosis. Patients were divided into a denosumab monotherapy group (22 cases) or a denosumab plus vitamin D and calcium supplementation group (combination group, 21 cases). We measured serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b, urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (NTX), and BMD of the lumbar 1–4 vertebrae (L-BMD) and bilateral hips (H-BMD) at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months of treatment. There were no significant differences in patient background. Serum BAP, TRACP-5b, and urinary NTX were significantly and comparably inhibited in both groups from 12 to 48 months versus baseline values. L-BMD was significantly increased at every time point in both groups, while H-BMD was significantly increased at every time point in the combination group only. There were significant differences between the groups for L-BMD at 24, 36, and 48 months (P < 0.05) and for H-BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05). Compared with denosumab monotherapy, combination therapy of denosumab plus vitamin D and calcium significantly increased H-BMD at 12 months and L-BMD from 24 to 48 months. These findings indicate that continuous vitamin D and calcium supplementation is important, especially for 12 months to improve H-BMD and from 24 to 48 months to improve L-BMD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone metabolism 3acalcium 3acollagen 3ahips 3anormal values 3aosteoporosis 3apatients 3atherapeutics 3avertebrae 3avitamin D1 aNakamura, Yukio1 aKatō, Hiroyuki,0 tNutrients.g2018 Feb. 27, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100302723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245015400209500001900363506007600382520117100458592002801629506003701657650001501694650002601709650001201735650002001747650001201767650001801779650001601797650001701813650002301830650001701853650001001870650001501880650001401895650001901909650001601928650001701944650001701961650002901978650001502007650001402022651001002036653001702046653002302063653001802086700001902104700002302123773009402146856008502240852000902325655001202334IND60690786120221207045858.0200508e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069078612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e010402doi7 aPMC62991212pmcid7 a305820542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDua, Parimal10aVirulence gene profiles, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance of Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 bacteria isolated from West Bengal, India  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVibrio cholerae is the causative agent of acute dehydrating diarrhoeal disease cholera. Among 71 V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 isolates, all yielded negative results for ctxA, ctxB and tcpA genes in PCR assay. Few strains were positive for stn (28.38%), and ompU (31.08%) genes. While all isolates were negative for ace gene, only two were positive for zot gene. All strains expressed toxR and toxT genes. It was also found that all isolates were slime-producer and these were capable of forming moderate to high biofilm. Biofilm formation was controlled positively by the transcriptional regulators VpsR and VpsT and was regulated negatively by HapR, as well as CRP regulatory complex. These isolates were resistant to ampicillin, furazolidone, doxycycline, vancomycin, erythromycin, while these were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, kanamycin, polymixin B, norfloxacin, chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and streptomycin. Indeed, 69.01% isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics (MAR: resistance to 3 or more antibiotics). Treatment protocols for cholera patients should be based on local antibiogram data.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiofilm 3achloramphenicol 3acholera 3aciprofloxacin 3adoxycycline 3aerythromycin 3aetiological agents 3afurazolidone 3agenes 3agentamicin 3akanamycin 3analidixic acid 3anorfloxacin 3astreptomycin 3atetracycline 3atranscription (genetics) 3avancomycin 3avirulence 3aIndia 0aMicrobiology 0aInfectious disease 0aPublic health1 aKarmakar, Amit1 aGhosh, Chandradipa0 tHeliyon.g2018 Dec., v. 4, no. 12 p.e01040-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2018.e010403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008300169300001500252520085800267592002801125650002301153650001401176650000901190650001701199650001201216650002301228650001501251650001401266650002001280650002201300650001001322650001801332653000701350653001401357653000901371700002101380700002001401773009301421856008601514852000901600655001201609IND60533898420221122063850.0190403e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053389842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScheier, Rico10aPrediction of pork quality at the slaughter line using a portable Raman device  ap. 96-103.  aRaman spectroscopy is providing a fingerprint of the early postmortem metabolism in meat. In this study, for the first time, Raman spectroscopy is shown to measure and predict quality traits of intact muscles at the slaughtering process. Porcine semimembranosus muscles (N=151) were measured 30–60min post mortem at the veterinarian line of a commercial abattoir using a prototype handheld Raman device. The Raman spectra were regressed against technologically important quality traits as measured with classic reference methods. Predicting pH35, pH24 and drip loss with PLSR yielded coefficients of determination of 0.75, 0.58 and 0.83 and root mean square errors of cross validation of 0.09, 0.05 and 0.6%, respectively. This is demonstrating the on-line potential of early postmortem Raman spectra to measure pH35 and to predict pH24 and drip loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3adrip loss 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amuscles 3apostmortem changes 3aprediction 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3aspectral analysis 3aswine 3aveterinarians 0apH 0aDrip loss 0aPLSR1 aScheeder, Martin1 aSchmidt, Heinar0 tMeat science.g2015 May, v. 103 p.96-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2015.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02658naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147242012200160245012200282300001800404520139000422592002801812650001501840650001001855650001901865650001601884650001601900650002501916650002201941650001501963650002401978650001302002650001802015651001002033700001702043700001602060700001802076773009702094856004802191852000902239655001202248IND50069908120221121012337.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006990812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-013-1015-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Dan10aEstimating groundwater recharge beneath irrigated farmland using environmental tracers fluoride, chloride and sulfate10aEstimating groundwater recharge beneath irrigated farmland using environmental tracers fluoride, chloride and sulfate  ap. 1469-1480.  aAccurate recharge estimation is essential for effective groundwater management, especially in the North China Plain, where irrigation return flow is significant to vertical recharge but brings difficulty for recharge estimation. Three environmental tracers (F (super -) , Cl (super -) and SO (sub 4) (super 2-) ) were used to estimate vertical recharge based on the mass balance and cumulative methods. Four boreholes were dry-drilled to 5-25 m depth beneath irrigated farmland and one was drilled to 5 m beneath non-irrigated woodland; soil samples were collected in all boreholes at set depths. The results indicated that F (super -) , Cl (super -) and SO (sub 4) (super 2-) were suitable tracers beneath the non-irrigated woodland, yielding recharge rates of 16.9, 18.8 and 19.4 mm/year, respectively. Recharge estimation was not straightforward when taking account of crop type, irrigation and/or fertilizer use. After comparing with previous research, conclusions were drawn: Cl (super -) was an appropriate tracer for irrigated farmland when taking account of Cl (super -) input from irrigation and absorption by crops; recharge rates were 65.9-126.8 mm/year. However, F (super -) was a more suitable tracer for irrigated regions where account is made of the proportion of precipitation to irrigation return flow, provided low F (super -) concentrations can be measured reliably.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrops 3adrainage water 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater recharge 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3alabeling techniques 3asampling 3asoil sampling 3aChina1 aJin, Menggui1 aLiang, Xing1 aZhan, Hongbin0 tHydrogeology journal.g2013 Nov., v. 21, no. 7 p.1469-1480dSpringer-Verlagx1431-21747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-013-1015-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245011200186300001600298520102400314592002801338650001701366650002501383650002101408650001401429650002001443650001201463650001101475650001201486650002201498650001501520650003201535650001601567650002901583650002901612650003501641650003301676650005901709650002701768650004401795650002501839650002801864650001601892700001701908700002201925700002001947773009401967856008602061852000902147655001202156IND4478584420221119154344.0141112e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447858442DNAL7 a218890552pmid7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoo, Hee-Ock10aPositive effects of temperature and growth conditions on enzymatic and antioxidant status in lettuce plants  ap. 479-484.  aThe contents of two bioactive compounds (polyphenols and flavonoids) and their antioxidant and enzyme activities were determined in the leaves of six lettuce (Latuca sativa L.) cultivars subjected to 4 different day/night temperatures for 6 weeks. The total polyphenol and anthocyanin contents and the corresponding antioxidant activities were the highest at 13/10°C and 20/13°C, followed by 25/20°C and 30/25°C. The enzymatic activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were also the highest at low day/night temperatures, but the peroxidase (POD) activity was decreased at low day/night temperatures and increased at high day/night temperatures. The most significant positive correlation existed between anthocyanin content and PPO activity, total polyphenols and their antioxidant activities. The results showed that at relatively low temperatures, lettuce plants have a high antioxidant and enzymatic status.

Acetobacter aceti as a core subgroup of AAB is usually isolated from yogurt. A. aceti should be timely and effectively detected to prevent yogurt contamination. The present study focused on A. aceti to establish an assay that can be performed to detect AAB in yogurt. LAMP, PCR, and real-time PCR were applied and compared for detecting A. aceti from pure culture and artificially contaminated yogurt samples. In pure culture, LAMP showed the highest detection sensitivity with 10⁻¹ CFU/mL. For yogurt samples, the sensitivity limit of LAMP was 10² CFU/mL, which was lower than that of real-time PCR (10¹ CFU/mL). The results indicated that these methods could be quickly and efficiently applied to detect A. aceti. As LAMP technology has low cost and high detection efficiency, it can potentially be applied for detecting A. aceti in production and quality control programs of yogurt.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcetobacter (subgen.

However, traditional tough polyampholyte hydrogels only have salt responsiveness, and the self-healing usually takes a long time or needs extra treatments. Moreover, self-reinforcement of the hydrogels is essential for the hydrogels during use after the preparation process. In the present work, a weak cationic monomer is introduced to the polyampholyte hydrogel system and copolymerized with a strong cationic monomer and strong anionic monomer with an equal mole ratio between total cationic monomers and anionic monomers. The hydrogel can fix the temporary shape in HCl solution and recover to the original shape in NaOH solution. Interestingly, the hydrogel shows a self-reinforcement capability and the tensile strength increases continuously to ten times larger than that of the as-prepared one by alternately immersing in HCl and NaOH solutions, which presents a new strategy to strengthen the polyampholyte hydrogel. Moreover, the hydrogel exhibits a rapid self-healing capability within 5 min just by making contact without any extra treatment. Healable simulated blood vessels and conductive hydrogel devices are designed consequently. The present polyampholyte hydrogel with shape memory, self-reinforcement, self-healing, and electroconductivity provides a novel strategy for developing new materials in the fields of wearable electronics, flexible devices, and soft robotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectronics 3ahydrogels 3atensile strength1 aHu, Qiqian1 aYang, Shurui1 aWang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2396-377X1 aSun, Weixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6964-83131 aTong, Zhen0 tMacromolecules.g2021 May 20, v. 54, no. 11 p.5218-5228dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c026573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04161naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008900172300001600261520227500277592002802552650002202580650001902602650001902621650001902640650001602659650002502675650001202700650002802712650001902740650001802759650001102777650004002788650001702828650001802845650001302863650002002876650001102896650002502907653000602932653000802938653000702946653000702953653000702960653000702967653001602974653000802990653000702998653000803005653000603013653000703019653000803026653000803034653001103042653001203053653001903065653001903084653000803103700001603111700001503127700001603142700001703158700001603175773012703191856008703318961001303405852000903418655001203427IND50062002320221122214632.0190318e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006200232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleisher, D.H.10aEffects of elevated CO2 and cyclic drought on potato under varying radiation regimes  ap. 270-280.  aClimate change predictions include increased frequency of episodic drought in many potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) producing regions in the world. Quantitative data on potato response to periodic drought under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) conditions is lacking, but is needed to improve crop modeling tools suitable for investigating adaptation strategies. Two experiments E1 and E2 were conducted in sunlit soil-plant-atmosphere research (SPAR) chambers to evaluate effects of short-term drought cycles at ambient and twice-ambient CO2. Experiments were conducted in the same growing season, but at different planting dates in order to further examine effects of variation in solar radiation during the drought periods (daily average photosynthetically active radiation of 43.9molm−2d−1 in E1 and 24.7molm−2d−1 in E2). Drought cycles were applied at post-tuber initiation (R) or at both vegetative and post tuber-initiation (VR) stages. While total dry matter in E1 was nearly twice that of E2 as a result of the radiation differences, relative responses to drought and CO2 were consistent. Total dry matter production was reduced proportionately based on the number of drought cycles, with twice-droughted VR plants producing less biomass than non-droughted controls. Harvest index and the ratio of tuber to total dry matter growth rate increased with drought frequency, suggesting that tuber sink strength was higher for VR plants than R. Harvest index, the ratio of tuber to total plant growth rate, and tuber dry matter for VR and R treated plants were also higher at elevated versus ambient CO2. Water use efficiency for water deficient versus water sufficient plants was correlated with harvest index and also increased at the higher CO2 concentration. As there was also little influence of drought or CO2 on leaf extension characteristics, differences in dry matter production and allometric responses were assumed to predominantly be a function of assimilation rate and carbon partitioning. These results confirm potato drought sensitivity in terms of yield response is influenced by developmental stage and CO2 regardless of light environment, and provide necessary data for calibration and testing modeling tools for climate change studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acrop models 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3adry matter accumulation 3agrowing season 3aharvest index 3aleaves 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplant growth 3aplanting date 3apotatoes 3asolar radiation 3atubers 3awater use efficiency 0aC 0aCO2 0aD1 0aD2 0aE1 0aE2 0aH1 2, or, 3 0aH2O 0aHI 0aPAR 0aR 0aVR 0aVWC 0aWUE 0aPotato 0aDrought 0aCarbon Dioxide 0aClimate Change 0aWUE1 aBarnaby, J.1 aSicher, R.1 aResop, J.P.1 aTimlin, D.J.1 aReddy, V.R.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 171-172 p.270-280dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001300181245014100194300001800335506007600353520138400429592002801813506003701841650001601878650001101894650002601905650001101931650005101942650004801993650002202041650002302063650003802086650003502124650002902159653002502188653003002213653002402243653002802267653002902295653001802324653002602342700001202368700001402380700001702394700001802411700001602429700001502445700001802460700002002478700001402498773012602512856007402638852000902712655001202721IND60118851220221207091953.0141127e20120628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011885122DNAL7 a225118032pmid7 aPMC33984522pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hao10aGraft-union development: a delicate process that involves cell–cell communication between scion and stock for local auxin accumulation  ap. 4219-4232.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGrafting is an ancient cloning method that has been used widely for thousands of years in agricultural practices. Graft-union development is also an intricate process that involves substantial changes such as organ regeneration and genetic material exchange. However, the molecular mechanisms for graft-union development are still largely unknown. Here, a micrografting method that has been used widely in Arabidopsis was improved to adapt it a smooth procedure to facilitate sample analysis and to allow it to easily be applied to various dicotyledonous plants. The developmental stage of the graft union was characterized based on this method. Histological analysis suggested that the transport activities of vasculature were recovered at 3 days after grafting (dag) and that auxin modulated the vascular reconnection at 2 dag. Microarray data revealed a signal-exchange process between cells of the scion and stock at 1 dag, which re-established the communication network in the graft union. This process was concomitant with the clearing of cell debris, and both processes were initiated by a wound-induced programme. The results demonstrate the feasibility and potential power of investigating various plant developmental processes by this method, and represent a primary and significant step in interpretation of the molecular mechanisms underlying graft-union development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3amicroarray technology 3ascions 2aArabidopsisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBreedingxmethods 2aCell Communication 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolism 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0acell–cell communication 0aendomembrane system 0agraft-union development 0alocal auxin accumulation 0amicrografting 0avascular reconnection1 aYan, Bo1 aSun, Jing1 aJia, Pengfei1 aZhang, Zijuan1 aYan, Xiaosa1 aChai, Juan1 aRen, Zhizhong1 aZheng, Guochang1 aLiu, Heng0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 June 28, v. 63, no. 11 p.4219-4232dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03943naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013300163300001500296500001900311520223000330592002802560650001202588650002202600650002202622650001102644650001002655650002502665650001202690650001502702650001002717650001202727650002202739650001702761650002002778650001202798650001602810651001802826651001002844653001902854653004002873653004002913653002202953653001002975700001502985700002403000700002603024700002003050700005703070700002303127700001403150773010703164856008503271852000903356655001203365IND60722845220221118051549.0210527e20210730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072284522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Jiao14aThe Mammuthus-Coelodonta Faunal Complex at its southeastern limit: A biogeochemical paleoecology investigation in Northeast Asia  ap. 93-106.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring the past several decades, the paleoecology of the Mammuthus-Coelodonta Faunal Complex in the Palearctic has been thoroughly explored, especially using stable isotope analysis. Numerous studies have documented high ecological plasticity and regional heterogeneities for this fauna. However, very limited attention has focused on Northeast Asia, at the southeastern edge of the distribution of the mammoth steppe biome. In the present study, we undertook radiocarbon dating, zooarchaeology by mass spectrometry (ZooMS), and stable isotope analysis on the fossil faunas from Yanjiagang Paleolithic site, Northeast (NE) China, and from the Geographical Society Cave in the nearby Russian Far East, to explore the paleoecology of this fauna in this middle-latitude region. Isotopic (δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N) data from these two sites suggested that the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) was a grazer feeding on grasses/sedges, while the woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) and steppe bison (Bison priscus) utilized a wider range of food resources. All megaherbivores exhibited some ecological plasticity. Meanwhile, the mammal remains from Geographical Society Cave prevalently exhibited lower δ¹⁵N values than those from China, indicating variable environments and vegetation in Northeast Asia during MIS 3. Interestingly, through reevaluating the diachronic mammal distribution and ecology based on direct radiocarbon dating and ZooMS, we report the credible presence of Bubalus, typically interpreted as a mild climate faunal element in the Pleistocene, within the Mammuthus-Coelodonta Faunal Complex in Yanjiagang. This emphasizes the unique scenario of this biome in Northeast Asia, where the fauna exhibited sensitivity to synergic effects of climatic oscillations and local geographic traits. After comparing isotopic data of mammoth from different subregions of Asia, we found that NE China displayed both highest δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values, possibly related to the higher temperature compared to the Arctic regions. This study reveals the characteristics and complexity at the southeastern limit of the range of the mammoth steppe biome and urges more systematic studies within and outside this region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubalus 3aPalearctic region 3aPleistocene epoch 3aRussia 3abison 3acarbon radioisotopes 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3afauna 3afossils 3amass spectrometry 3apaleoecology 3astable isotopes 3asteppes 3atemperature 3aArctic region 3aChina 0aNortheast Asia 0aMammuthus-Coelodonta Faunal Complex 0aCarbon and nitrogen stable isotopes 0aRadiocarbon dates 0aZooMS1 aWang, Yuan1 aBaryshnikov, G.

All the animals were fed a basal diet without any probiotic (P₀) or supplemented with L. acidophilus (PL), S. cerevisiae (PS) or both in combination (PL₊S) at 0.2% of BW. The ADG of kids was also not influenced by probiotics supplementation; however, it was higher by 22.42 and 3.42% in PS and PL, respectively, over the control (P₀). There were no significant differences in the DM intake among the groups. Digestibility coefficients of OM, CP, EE, total carbohydrates, ADF, cellulose and hemi-cellulose were also similar (P>0.05) among the groups. However, the NDF digestibility was significantly (P<0.05) higher in PS in comparison to PL₊S. The cost of per unit daily gain was lowest in PS in comparison to the control and other two probiotic groups. It can be concluded that the sole supplementation of S. cerevisiae (strain NCDC-49) at 0.2% of BW may improve the intake and digestibility of cell wall fractions in Beetal kids under stall-fed conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeetal 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aanimal nutrition 3acell walls 3acellulose 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aeconomics 3afemales 3ahemicellulose 3amales 3anutrient utilization 3aprobiotics 3asole 3atechnology 0aBeetal kids 0aNutrient digestibility 0aSupplementation1 a, Chandrahas1 aSaini, A.L.1 aGangwar, M.0 tANIMAL NUTRITION AND FEED TECHNOLOGY.g2014 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.147-152dAnimal Nutrition AssociationwJournal:2096x0974-181X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245011800188520130800306592002801614650002401642650001701666650003001683650001801713650002301731650001201754650001501766650002501781650001901806650001601825650001601841650001501857651001301872653002301885653001901908653002701927653003001954653002401984653002102008653002502029653002202054700005702076700006202133700003302195700002802228700002802256700007502284700006902359700001902428700002802447700002602475773011902501856008602620852000902706655001202715IND60781421620221119014608.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078142162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1155902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavalcante, Rosane Barbosa Lopes10aMulticriteria approach to prioritize forest restoration areas for biodiversity conservation in the eastern Amazon  aDue to the global magnitude of forest degradation and deforestation and the high cost of ecological restoration, several approaches have been used to prioritize conservation or restoration areas based on different objectives and criteria. The present work aims to develop a multicriteria approach to defining forest restoration priority areas in the Itacaiúnas River basin, eastern Amazon, that maximizes the criteria equitably. The selected criteria were: improve forest connectivity, provide climatic refuges for biodiversity, mitigate the impacts of deforestation on streamflow, and improve the probability of natural regeneration. A strong difference between selected areas was observed when the criteria of forest connectivity and mitigate the impact on streamflow were considered separately, but greater equity among the criteria was achieved using the multicriteria approach. The most priority areas were concentrated near protected areas. The method used provides a flexible framework, and different criteria or subarea selections can be applied for different purposes to facilitate adaptive management. Analyzing forest restoration prioritization on rural properties can provide guidance for conserving and restoring biodiversity at the landscape scale while complying with legal requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3adeforestation 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3alandscapes 3anatural regeneration 3aprioritization 3aprobability 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aAmazonia 0aForest restoration 0aPriority areas 0aMulticriteria analysis 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aForest connectivity 0aClimatic refuges 0aNatural regeneration 0aStreamflow impact1 aNunes, Sâmia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5460-33121 aViademonte, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7492-83171 aRodrigues, Caio Marcos Flexa1 aGomes, Walisson Cardoso1 aFerreira, Jair da Silva1 aPontes, Paulo Rógenes Monteiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8172-78201 aGiannini, Tereza Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9830-12041 aAwade, Marcelo1 ade S.

Among monoglycerides, glycerol monolaurate (GML) exhibits particularly high antimicrobial activity, although enzymatic hydrolysis of its ester group can diminish potency. Consequently, there have been efforts to identify more chemically stable versions of GML, most notably its alkylglycerol ether equivalent called dodecylglycerol (DDG). However, despite high structural similarity, biological studies indicate that DDG and GML are not functionally equivalent and it has been speculated that the two compounds might have different interaction profiles with phospholipid membranes. To address this outstanding question, herein, we employed supported lipid bilayer (SLB) platforms to experimentally characterize the interactions of DDG with phospholipid membranes. Quartz crystal microbalance-dissipation experiments identified that DDG causes concentration-dependent membrane morphological changes in SLBs and the overall extent of membrane remodeling events was greater than that caused by GML. In addition, time-lapsed fluorescence microscopy imaging experiments revealed that DDG causes extensive membrane tubulation that is distinct from how GML induces membrane budding. We discuss how differences in the head group properties of DDG and GML contribute to distinct membrane interaction profiles, offering insight into how the molecular design of DDG not only improves chemical stability but also enhances membrane-disruptive activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aesterification 3afatty acids 3afluorescence microscopy 3aglycerol 3aimage analysis 3alipid bilayers 3amonoacylglycerols 3aphospholipids 3aquartz1 aJackman, Joshua A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1800-81021 aPark, Soohyun1 aMokrzecka, Natalia1 aCho, Nam-Joon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8692-89550 tLangmuir.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 35, no. 9 p.3568-3575dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b002443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245014300174520139200317592002801709650002001737650001801757650001601775650001101791650000901802650002001811650000901831650002001840650001601860650001701876650002301893650001801916650000901934650001101943650001401954651001201968700002201980700001702002700001902019700001902038700002102057700001702078700002902095773013302124856008402257852000902341655001202350IND60768177820221122234116.0220225e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076817782DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120202772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhakbazan, Mohammad 10aEffects of Silage-Based Diets and Cattle Efficiency Type on Performance, Profitability, and Predicted CH4 Emission of Backgrounding Steers  aFeed costs are the largest expense in commercial beef production. Increasing cattle (Bos taurus) feed efficiency should reduce feed costs and increase beef profitability. This study used data from two years of a backgrounding trial conducted in Lacombe, Alberta, Canada. The evaluation looked at economic and predicted CH₄ emission impacts of diet quality and cattle efficiency type in backgrounding systems. The hypothesis was that diet quality from use of barley (Hordeum vulgare c.v. Canmore) or triticale (xTriticosecale c.v. Bunker) silage-based diets and cattle efficiency type defined by residual feed intake would interact to affect profitability and CH₄ emissions. Effects of diet and cattle efficiency type on profitability and CO₂e emissions were assessed using statistical and stochastic risk simulation. The profitability of beef backgrounding was affected by cattle efficiency type and diet quality with higher quality barley silage also lowering CO₂e emissions. The difference in certainty equivalent (CAD~30 steer⁻¹) of efficient steers on barley silage and inefficient steers on barley silage or efficient or inefficient steers on triticale silage supports a beef backgrounding producer focus on diet quality and cattle efficiency type. This study did not address potential agronomic differences, including yield, which could provide nuance to forage choice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aTriticosecale 3aagriculture 3abarley 3abeef 3abeef production 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afood quality 3amethane production 3aprofitability 3arisk 3asilage 3atriticale 3aAlberta1 aBlock, Hushton C.1 aHuang, John 1 aColyn, Jeff J.1 aBaron, Vern S.1 aBasarab, John A.1 aLi, Changxi 1 aEkine-Dzivenu, Chinyere 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2022 Feb. 15, v. 12, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture120202773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245008700165520176800252592002802020650002102048650001602069650001802085650001402103650002102117650001402138650001502152650001502167650001102182700002102193700001702214700001802231700002302249700001802272773012202290856007902412852000902491655001202500IND60754369920221118044044.0211023e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075436992DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101020042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzasa, Kazunari 10aRegeneration of the Eyespot and Flagellum in Euglena gracilis during Cell Division  aCell division of unicellular microalgae is a fascinating process of proliferation, at which whole organelles are regenerated and distributed to two new lives. We performed dynamic live cell imaging of Euglena gracilis using optical microscopy to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the eyespot and flagellum during cell division and distribution of the organelles into the two daughter cells. Single cells of the wild type (WT) and colorless SM-ZK cells were confined in a microfluidic device, and the appearance of the eyespot (stigma) and emergent flagellum was tracked in sequential video-recorded images obtained by automatic cell tracking and focusing. We examined 12 SM-ZK and 10 WT cells and deduced that the eyespot diminished in size and disappeared at an early stage of cell division and remained undetected for 26–97 min (62 min on average, 22 min in deviation). Subsequently, two small eyespots appeared and were distributed into the two daughter cells. Additionally, the emergent flagellum gradually shortened to zero-length, and two flagella emerged from the anterior ends of the daughter cells. Our observation revealed that the eyespot and flagellum of E. gracilis are degraded once in the cell division, and the carotenoids in the eyespot are also decomposed. Subsequently, the two eyespots/flagella are regenerated for distribution into daughter cells. As a logical conclusion, the two daughter cells generated from a single cell division possess the equivalent organelles and each E. gracilis cell has eternal or non-finite life span. The two newly regenerated eyespot and flagellum grow at different rates and mature at different timings in the two daughter cells, resulting in diverse cell characteristics in E. gracilis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuglena gracilis 3acarotenoids 3acell division 3aflagellum 3alight microscopy 3alongevity 3amicroalgae 3aorganelles 3astigma1 aKang, Hyunwoong 1 aSong, Simon 1 aTamaki, Shun 1 aShinomura, Tomoko 1 aMaeda, Mizuo 0 tPlants.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101020043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245013900210300001800349520129700367592002801664650001101692650001901703650001901722650001701741650001601758650001401774650002101788650001801809650001301827650001101840650001901851650002001870651001101890651002901901653002301930653003101953653002301984653000802007653004602015653002702061700002102088700001702109773009202126856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60583893120221120211558.0180830e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058389312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChinese, Damiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7517-483910aWater-energy and GHG nexus assessment of alternative heat recovery options in industry: A case study on electric steelmaking in Europe  ap. 2670-2687.  aIn the last few years, the water-energy nexus concept has emerged as a global issue. However, studies on European countries are relatively few, and often focused on agriculture. Cooling purposes represent the main part of industrial water demand, and waste-heat recovery is a main strategy to improve resource efficiency. This paper presents a real case study of low-temperature waste-heat recovery in an electric steelmaking industry and evaluates the impact of feasible interventions on primary energy and water consumption, as well as on CO2 equivalent emissions. Based on a Europe wide review of energy and water prices, of energy sources and corresponding resource efficiency indicators, a Monte Carlo model was developed to undertake a generalization of the case study to the EU-15. It was found that solutions with the lowest primary energy demand and the lowest CO2 equivalent emissions demonstrate the greatest water footprint. This is the case of some southern European countries, where heat recovery projects with the highest water intensity are feasible due to high electricity and low water prices. As increasing carbon prices may exacerbate this phenomenon, inducing a switch to water intensive technologies, incentives to carbon emission reduction should be carefully designed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat recovery 3aindustry 3aprices 3aprimary energy 3awater footprint 3aEurope 3aSouthern European region 0aWater-energy nexus 0aIndustrial cooling systems 0aAbsorption cooling 0aORC 0aWater footprint of electricity generation 0aMonte carlo simulation1 aSantin, Maurizio1 aSaro, Onorio0 tEnergy.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 141 p.2670-2687dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016800166300001400334520131700348592002801665650004401693650001301737650001401750650002301764650002801787650001301815650001601828650002601844650001301870650001901883650001901902650001301921650001601934650000701950650001501957650001501972650001701987650002602004650003302030650002302063650002602086650001602112653002702128653002302155653001602178653001402194700001502208700001802223700001702241700001802258773012102276856008202397852000902479655001202488IND60608040720221118034911.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060804072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2015.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Guoqiang10aPhotodegradation of Orange II using waste paper sludge-derived heterogeneous catalyst in the presence of oxalate under ultraviolet light emitting diode irradiation  ap. 63-70.  aA waste paper sludge-derived heterogeneous catalyst (WPS-Fe-350) was synthesized via a facile method and successfully applied for the degradation of Orange II in the presence of oxalic acid under the illumination of ultraviolet light emitting diode (UV-LED) Powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscopy and N2 sorption isotherm analysis indicated the formation of α-Fe2O3 in the mesoporous nanocomposite. The degradation test showed that WPS-Fe-350 exhibited rapid Orange II (OII) degradation and mineralization in the presence of oxalic acid under the illumination of UV-LED. The effects of pH, oxalic acid concentration and dosage of the catalyst on the degradation of OII were evaluated, respectively. Under the optimal conditions (1g/L catalyst dosage, 2mmol/L oxalic acid and pH3.0), the degradation percentage for a solution containing 30mg/L OII reached 83.4% under illumination by UV-LED for 80min. Moreover, five cyclic tests for OII degradation suggested that WPS-Fe-350 exhibited excellent stability of catalytic activity. Hence, this study provides an alternative environmentally friendly way to reuse waste paper sludge and an effective and economically viable method for degradation of azo dyes and other refractory organic pollutants in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aazo dyes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aeconomic sustainability 3ahematite 3airradiation 3alight emitting diodes 3alighting 3amineralization 3ananocomposites 3aoxalates 3aoxalic acid 3apH 3aphotolysis 3apollutants 3aporous media 3apulp and paper sludge 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3aultraviolet radiation 3awaste paper 0aHeterogeneous catalyst 0aWaste paper sludge 0aOxalic acid 0aOrange II1 aGuo, Jinyi1 aZhou, Guowang1 aWan, Xiankai1 aShi, Huixiang0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2016 Sept., v. 47 p.63-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2015.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011600184300001800300520112400318592002801442650001501470650001301485650002901498650001601527650003001543650002001573650002401593650001501617650001601632650001501648650003801663650003901701650002101740650003201761650004101793650004901834651001801883700001901901700001601920700001901936700001801955773011801973856004802091852000902139655001202148IND50058892920221118065507.0121011e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005889292DNAL7 a221245842pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2448-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Jae Joon10aUsing GA-Ridge regression to select hydro-geological parameters influencing groundwater pollution vulnerability  ap. 6637-6645.  aFor groundwater conservation and management, it is important to accurately assess groundwater pollution vulnerability. This study proposed an integrated model using ridge regression and a genetic algorithm (GA) to effectively select the major hydro-geological parameters influencing groundwater pollution vulnerability in an aquifer. The GA-Ridge regression method determined that depth to water, net recharge, topography, and the impact of vadose zone media were the hydro-geological parameters that influenced trichloroethene pollution vulnerability in a Korean aquifer. When using these selected hydro-geological parameters, the accuracy was improved for various statistical nonlinear and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as multinomial logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural networks, and case-based reasoning. These results provide a proof of concept that the GA-Ridge regression is effective at determining influential hydro-geological parameters for the pollution vulnerability of an aquifer, and in turn, improves the AI performance in assessing groundwater pollution vulnerability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaquifers 3adecision support systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aneural networks 3aregression analysis 3atopography 3avadose zone 2aAlgorithms 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGroundwaterxchemistryxstandards. 2aModels, Chemical 2aTrichloroethylenexanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 0aKorea (South)1 aKim, Young Min1 aYoo, Keunje1 aPark, Joonhong1 aOh, Kyong Joo0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 Nov., v. 184, no. 11 p.6637-6645dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2448-1  aDNAL 7aarticle01169naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015600156300001300312520021900325592002800544650002000572650002300592650002700615650002800642700001600670773012200686856007400808852000900882655001200891IND60618676920221122121320.0181030e20180221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061867692DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra90018c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Weiwei10aCorrection: Synthesis of C14–C21 acid fragments of cytochalasin Z₈via anti-selective aldol condensation and B-alkyl Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling  ap. 8246.  aCorrection for ‘Synthesis of C14–C21 acid fragments of cytochalasin Z₈via anti-selective aldol condensation and B-alkyl Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling’ by Weiwei Han et al., RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 3899–3902.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3achemical structure 3acondensation reactions 3aorganic acids and salts1 aWu, Jinlong0 tRSC advances.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 8, no. 15 p.8246-8246dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra90018c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011400175300001600289520145100305592002801756650002301784650001901807650001001826650001001836650002501846650001601871650001401887653001601901653001401917653001401931653002301945653001901968653001601987653003402003700002102037700003302058773010302091856008602194852000902280655001202289IND60525389220221117225421.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052538922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroadhurst, Matt K.10aRelative efficiencies and durabilities of recreational hoop- and lift-nets targeting two Australian portunids  ap. 115-123.  aThe temporal efficiencies and durabilities of established and alternative recreational portunid crab (Scylla serrata and Portunus pelagicus) baited nets were assessed during two experiments (simulating conventional and ‘ghost’ fishing) with the objective of minimising environmental impacts. The established gear (‘hoop nets’) comprised a circular panel of large, thin-twined mesh designed to entangle portunids while approaching a centrally located bait. The alternative gear (‘lift net’) had an identical diameter and central bait, but instead of entangling catches, comprised thicker, smaller meshes that were raised in a barrier during retrieval to prevent egress. Both gears similarly caught more portunids during nocturnal than diurnal deployments. When actively fished (i.e. retrieved every 30min), lift nets were equally effective as hoop nets for catching S. serrata (and caused less exoskeleton damage—mostly limb loss) and more than twice as effective for P. pelagicus (attributed in part to broader size selection). Lift nets were minimally damaged, but irrespective of the deployment duration, all hoop nets had broken/missing meshes (lost as marine debris), and those left for up to 12 days quickly became non-functional. The results illustrate the utility of simply substituting problematic gears—instead of attempting their modification—with those that are inherently more benign to reduce environmental impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPortunus pelagicus 3aScylla serrata 3abaits 3acrabs 3aenvironmental impact 3aexoskeleton 3afish nets 0aCrustaceans 0aHoop nets 0aLift nets 0aPortunus pelagicus 0aScylla serrata 0aSelectivity 0aUnaccounted fishing mortality1 aButcher, Paul B.1 aMillar, R.

The recorder is positioned flat on the seabed and alternately exposes a shallow collector mounted in a smooth surface mimicking the sediment surface. The samples were analyzed for their content of chlorophyll a (Chl) and dry weight (DM). We compared the sediment recorder data with the results obtained with a sediment trap suspended 3.2 m above the sea floor. Measurements were carried out in spring and fall at two stations in the southern North Sea with different sediment type, maximum current velocities and biomass (sand, station B vs silty sand, station F). The recorder deployments in November yielded higher Chl fluxes and a higher quality of particles (Chl:DM ratio) than the trap at both stations. Unlike the trap samples, in which Chl and DM were always positively and strongly correlated, maximum Chl and DM fluxes in the recorder samples were out of phase, particularly at station B, pointing to a highly variable quality during the tidal cycle. Unexpectedly, Chl fluxes and Chl:DM ratios in the recorder samples at station B were higher than at station F in both seasons, although the benthic biomass at the latter station was five times higher. The highest Chl fluxes and particle quality (Chl:DM) at station B were measured during slack tides when interface feeding would be least hampered by drag forces. Station B is nevertheless characterized by a low macrobenthic biomass and a scarcity of interface feeders, specifically of suspension-feeding bivalves. Possible reasons for this apparent discrepancy are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3abedload 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3afood availability 3asand 3asediment traps 3aspring 3atides 3aNorth Sea1 aBoon, Arjen R.0 tHelgoland marine research.g2002 June, v. 56, no. 2 p.140-148dSpringer-Verlagx1438-387X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10152-001-0091-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03776naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014400167300001400311500001900325520248600344592002802830650002202858650001602880650001502896650001602911650001102927650001902938650001402957650001402971651002102985653002303006653002003029653002303049653002003072653001903092700005603111773010503167856008503272852000903357655001203366IND60722845720221118051729.0210415e20210530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072284572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2020.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, Swati10aActive tectonics, landscape evolution and sediment dynamics in Dehra Dun, Northwest Himalaya inferred from geomorphic indices and GIS tools  ap. 55-69.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGeomorphic evolution of the frontal parts of active mountain belts is strongly influenced by tectonic processes, usually manifested in fluvial, structural and morphotectonic parameters of the landscape. Geomorphic indices have long been used for understanding the tectonic imprints in river basins. However, their applicability and validation from field observations in the Himalayan basins have often been debated. Here we test the applicability of several geomorphic indices in the western Dehra Dun (intermontane valley) that includes well-known tectonic elements such as Main Boundary thrust (MBT), Main Frontal Thrust (MFT), Santaurgarh Thrust (ST), and other smaller faults. Based on the spatial distribution of the values of different geomorphic indices, we map four different tectonic zones to represent the relative tectonic activity from low to very high. We conclude from morphometric analysis that the MBT and the ST are active faults. However, we do not find any geomorphic evidence of recent activity along several other faults mapped in this region or any deformation in the major fan units. We argue that active tectonics has not played a significant role in shaping the landforms in this region except for providing accommodation space and sediment supply for the deposition of fan units. We have further employed DEM and limited borehole data to understand the sediment storage and excavation at Late Late Quaternary time scale. We compute the average stored volume of sediments since ~50 ka as 8.03 × 10¹⁰ m³ (using borehole data) and 12.24 × 10¹⁰ m³ (GIS approach). Total eroded volume has been computed as 0.47 × 10¹⁰ m³ (using borehole data) and 0.64 × 10¹⁰ m³ (GIS approach). These volumes give a time-averaged sediment discharge leaving the dun as 0.21–0.39 × 10⁶ m³/yr over Late Quaternary period. We note that the estimated average eroded material during the incision phase is only 5–6% of the total accumulated sediment volume. Further, the average estimated volume (8.03–12.24 × 10¹⁰ m³) in the valley is nearly half of the volume of the sediment that can be accommodated (27.2 × 10¹⁰ m³) in the valley. Also, the present-day sediment supply to the Dun (~0.14 × 10⁶ m³/yr) is low in comparison to estimated average erosion rate. Our results therefore suggest that the valley is only half filled, and is in excavation phase since Late Quaternary mostly driven by climatic perturbations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuaternary period 3adeformation 3alandscapes 3amorphometry 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asediments 3atectonics 3aHimalayan region 0aIntermontane basin 0aHimalayan front 0aSediment discharge 0aLate quaternary 0aClimate change1 aSinha, Rajiv1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3321-80950 tQuaternary international.g2021 May 30, v. 585 p.55-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016300168300001500331520103300346592002801379650001301407650001701420650001701437650002301454650002001477650001901497650000901516650001801525650001101543650001001554650001401564650001401578650001001592651001501602653003001617653002601647653002201673653001301695653001701708700002401725700003001749773010201779856008601881852000901967655001201976IND60525389320221117225419.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052538932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorbowy, Jan10aIncreasing occurrence of anisakid nematodes in the liver of cod (Gadus morhua) from the Baltic Sea: Does infection affect the condition and mortality of fish?  ap. 98-103.  aCod (Gadus morhua) taken from the southern Baltic Sea between 2011–2014 were visually examined for the presence of anisakid nematodes in the liver (Anisakis sp. and Contracaecum sp.). The prevalence of infection increased with year of sampling, and depended on the length of the fish. The most abundant parasites were Contracaecum sp. larvae. Both the prevalence and intensity of infection increased with fish length up to 70–80cm but then began to decline, exhibiting dome-shaped dependence. The decline may be attributed to the increasing mortality of large and heavily infected cod. The body condition of infected cod was lower than that of those free of parasites and declined with the intensity of infection; the condition of most infected fish was up to 20% lower than that of uninfected individuals. The biological basis for the negative effects of infection on the condition and survival of cod and the role of the grey seal Halichoerus grypus in the dispersion of anisakid nematodes in the Baltic Sea are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisakis 3aContracaecum 3aGadus morhua 3aHalichoerus grypus 3aadverse effects 3abody condition 3afish 3afish diseases 3alarvae 3aliver 3amortality 3aparasites 3aseals 3aBaltic Sea 0aQuantitative parasitology 0aBody condition factor 0aNatural mortality 0aAnisakis 0aContracaecum1 aPodolska, Magdalena1 aNadolna-Ałtyn, Katarzyna0 tFisheries research.g2016 July, v. 179 p.98-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013300167300001600300520201800316592002802334650001202362650001702374650001102391650002402402650001002426650001002436650001502446650001802461650002102479650002702500650001202527650001502539653002702554653002502581653002202606653002002628653005102648700001302699700003302712700001602745700002002761700001302781700001402794773010302808856008602911852000902997655001203006IND60525389420221117225347.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052538942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuiñez, R.10aPresent-day connectivity of historical stocks of the ecosystem engineer Perumytilus purpuratus along 4500km of the Chilean Coast  ap. 322-332.  aHistorical processes leading to the emergence of marine stocks, the mechanisms maintaining stock structure, and present-day connectivity patterns are elementary pieces of information to design wiser and more sustainable management of marine resources, and to understand speciation processes in the sea. Over geographical scales, biological and genetic continuity in the Southern Pacific coast is determined by historical geological-climate events (e.g., LGM), as well as by present oceanographic processes (Humboldt Current, ENSO and others) that can affect both, local adaptation and dispersal. The relative influence of such processes on the current distribution of species can be comprehensibly inferred from a detailed population sampling comprising the whole species range. In this work, we aimed to provide insights into historical and modern patterns of genetic connectivity between stocks of the intertidal mussel Perumytilus purpuratus, a species reported to have moderate pelagic development times of about 14–18 days. To this end, we analyzed the geographical pattern of variation of microsatellite polymorphisms across 17 localities scattered along ca. 4500km off the Chilean Coast and encompassing four biogeographic regions, previously defined based on compositional changes in marine flora and fauna, and which coincide with large changes in topography, the historical influence of glaciation, circulation patterns and upwelling variability around 26°S, 30°S and 40°S. Genetic structural data suggest that historical geological and climatic events have shaped the actual range of this species in the south-eastern Pacific, creating biogeographical limits, i.e., the north-central stock and the southern stock, that moderate to restricted dispersers cannot cross given present day coastal oceanographic processes. Conversely, the pattern of IBD observed within those two major biogeographical regions suggests that present-day coastal processes modulate the effective dispersal of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3aecosystem engineers 3afauna 3aflora 3aglaciation 3alittoral zone 3amarine resources 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amussels 3atopography 0aPerumytilus purpuratus 0aGenetic connectivity 0aHistorical stocks 0aChilean mussels 0aCoastal connectivity in the South-East Pacific1 aPita, A.1 aPerets, Mikhaʼel ben Yosef,1 aBriones, C.1 aNavarrete, S.A.1 aToro, J.1 aPresa, P.0 tFisheries research.g2016 July, v. 179 p.322-332dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01087naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009700156300001300253520016000266592002800426650001500454650001100469650002400480650001500504700001700519700002400536700002000560773012200580856007400702852000900776655001200785IND60618677020221122085749.0181030e20180226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061867702DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra90019a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Zhiwei10aCorrection: Preparation of magnesium silicate/carbon composite for adsorption of rhodamine B  ap. 8625.  aCorrection for ‘Preparation of magnesium silicate/carbon composite for adsorption of rhodamine B’ by Zhiwei Sun et al., RSC Adv., 2018, 8, 7873–7882.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3amagnesium silicates 3arhodamines1 aDuan, Xinhui1 aSrinivasakannan, C.1 aLiang, Jinsheng0 tRSC advances.g2018 Feb. 26, v. 8, no. 16 p.8625-8625dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra90019a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001800286520126100304592002801565650002201593650002501615650001301640650001201653650002201665650001601687650001401703650001701717650001901734650004001753650001901793650002201812650001301834650002601847700001401873700001401887700001901901700001401920700001701934700002001951773012501971856008202096852000902178655001202187IND60789154120221118064625.0220818e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-021-1125-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, Shasha10aReduced salinity interacts with ultraviolet radiation to alter photosystem II function in diatom Skeletonema costatum  ap. 1615-1627.  aTo investigate the effect of reduced salinity on diatoms’ capacity to cope with changing ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), Skeletonema costatum was grown in a range of salinity (15, 25, and 35). The photosystem II (PSII) function was analyzed by increasing PAR and UVR to mimic a mixing event in turbulent waters. The results show that high UVR exposure significantly reduced PSII activity, especially in cells grown at low salinity. UVR, but not salinity, stimulated the ‘removal’ rate of PSII protein PsbA. Salinity alone, in the range of 15 to 35, did not regulate PSII acceptor region; however, the low salinity+UVR treatment decreased the energy flux for electron transport per PSII reaction center in S. costatum. It showed that low salinity exacerbated the damaging effect of UVR on PSII function in S. costatum by suppressing PsbA protein synthesis and modifying the photochemistry of PSII. Although higher catalase (CAT) activity and NPQs were induced, they were unable to prevent the combined damage effect of low salinity+UVR. Our findings indicate that reduced salinity and increased UVR potentially affect the abundance and distribution of S. costatum with the escalation of climate disturbances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aSkeletonema costatum 3acatalase 3aclimate 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy flow 3alimnology 3aoceanography 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aphotosystem II 3aprotein synthesis 3asalinity 3aultraviolet radiation1 aYan, Fang1 aYu, Daode1 aSong, Jingjing1 aWang, Lei1 aXu, Zhiguang1 aZhending,cShi,0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2022 July, v. 40, no. 4 p.1615-1627dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-021-1125-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245014100179520159400320592002801914650002501942650001601967650001801983650001902001650002802020650001702048650001302065650001302078650001102091650001202102650003002114650002002144650001202164650001102176650001202187650001702199650001502216650001202231651001002243700003602253700001602289700002002305773013302325856008402458852000902542655001202551IND60768178220221123005937.0220225e20220216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076817822DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture120202812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Delgado, Goretti L.10aEffects of Peeling, Film Packaging, and Cold Storage on the Quality of Minimally Processed Prickly Pears (Opuntia ficus-indica L.

For this study, white and orange Opuntia ficus-indica fruits from the Canary Islands (Spain) were minimally processed, packed in a passive atmosphere, and stored at 7 °C. The effects of peeling (by hand or with an electric peeler) and two micro-perforated films (90PPlus and 180PPlus) were evaluated. Changes in the quality parameters, gas composition, bioactive compounds, sensory features, and microbial safety of fresh-cut prickly pears were examined during 10 days of cold storage. Both varieties, hand-peeled and electrically peeled, were microbiologically safe (aerobic mesophiles < 7 log(CFU/g fresh weight)) and retained suitable nutritional quality after 8 days of storage. The yield was greater when fruits were electrically peeled than hand-peeled (70.7% vs. 44.0% and 66.5% vs. 40.8% for white and orange fruits, respectively). The concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide were above 15% and below 7.5%, respectively, in all the treatments over the shelf life. TSS decreased during storage independently of variety, peeling method, or film. Fructose was the most abundant sugar, followed by glucose and sucrose. The electric peeling machine improved not only the edible part of the fruit but also the contents of bioactive compounds, such as ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aagriculture 3aascorbic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3acardiovascular diseases 3acold storage 3adiabetes 3afructose 3afruits 3aglucose 3amesophilic microorganisms 3anutritive value 3aobesity 3aoxygen 3apeelers 3aplant spines 3ashelf life 3asucrose 3aSpain1 aRodríguez-Rodríguez, Elena M.1 aDorta, Eva 1 aLobo, M.

Excessive soil salinity affects the establishment, development, and growth of plants, resulting in important losses in productivity. Plants have evolved biochemical and molecular mechanisms that may act in a concerted manner and constitute the integrated physiological response to soil salinity. These include the synthesis and accumulation of compatible solutes to avoid cell dehydration and maintain root water uptake, the regulation of ion homeostasis to control ion uptake by roots, compartmentation and transport into shoots, the fine regulation of water uptake and distribution to plant tissues by the action of aquaporins, the reduction of oxidative damage through improved antioxidant capacity and the maintenance of photosynthesis at values adequate for plant growth. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can help the host plants to cope with the detrimental effects of high soil salinity. There is evidence that AM symbiosis affects and regulates several of the above mentioned mechanisms, but the molecular bases of such effects are almost completely unknown. This review summarizes current knowledge about the effects of AM symbiosis on these physiological mechanisms, emphasizing new perspectives and challenges in physiological and molecular studies on salt-stress alleviation by AM symbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaporins 3ahomeostasis 3ahost plants 3aion transport 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asemiarid zones 3ashoots 3asoil salinity 3asolutes 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater uptake 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSalinity 2aSodium Chloridexmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSymbiosis 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aantioxidant 0aaquaporin 0aarbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis 0aionic homeostasis 0aosmoregulation 0aphotosynthesis 0asalinity1 aPorcel, Rosa1 aAzcón, Charo1 aAroca, Ricardo0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 June 28, v. 63, no. 11 p.4033-4044dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245016200166300001300328520147700341592002801818650002301846650001501869650002801884650001501912650001401927650002501941650001701966650001201983650002101995650001202016650001202028650001102040650001102051650002202062650002102084650001702105650002202122650001502144650001402159650002602173650002602199650002202225650001402247653002302261653001102284653001502295653001202310653001602322700002202338700005502360700005902415700002302474773009802497856008102595852000902676655001202685IND60565803920221120125113.0190405e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056580392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2017.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, Josué10aQuantitative proteomics reveals new insights into calcium-mediated resistance mechanisms in Aspergillus flavus against the antifungal protein PgAFP in cheese  ap. 1-10.  aThe ability of Aspergillus flavus to produce aflatoxins in dairy products presents a potential hazard. The antifungal protein PgAFP from Penicillium chrysogenum inhibits various foodborne toxigenic fungi, including Aspergillus flavus. However, PgAFP did not inhibit A. flavus growth in cheese, which was related to the associated cation content. CaCl2 increased A. flavus permeability and prevented PgAFP-mediated inhibition in potato dextrose broth (PDB). PgAFP did not elicit any additional increase in permeability of CaCl2-incubated A. flavus. Furthermore, PgAFP did not alter metabolic capability, chitin deposition, or hyphal viability of A. flavus grown with CaCl2. Comparative proteomic analysis after PgAFP treatment of A. flavus in calcium-enriched PDB revealed increased abundance of 125 proteins, including oxidative stress-related proteins, as determined by label-free mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Seventy proteins were found at lower abundance, with most involved in metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. These changes do not support the blockage of potential PgAFP receptors in A. flavus by calcium as the main cause of the protective role. A. flavus resistance appears to be mediated by calcineurin, G-protein, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase that combat oxidative stress and impede apoptosis. These findings could serve to design strategies to improve PgAFP activity against aflatoxigenic moulds in dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aG-proteins 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aaflatoxins 3aapoptosis 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acations 3acheeses 3achitin 3ahyphae 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidative stress 3apermeability 3aprotective effect 3aproteomics 3areceptors 3aresistance mechanisms 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxigenic strains 3aviability 0aAntifungal protein 0aCheese 0aProteomics 0aCalcium 0aCalcineurin1 aOwens, Rebecca A.1 aDoyle, Sean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1679-32471 aNúñez, Félix1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2718-61621 aAsensio, Miguel A.0 tFood microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 66 p.1-10dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2017.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245016000207300001600367520162800383592002802011650001402039650001402053650002302067650001902090650001902109650002102128650001302149650001402162650002602176650003702202650001302239650001302252653002002265653001402285653002702299653003802326653003602364653001802400700001802418700001702436700001702453773009002470856008502560852000902645655001202654IND60583893820221120211645.0180830e20171215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058389382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Pi-qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6992-881410aSize distributions, PAHs and inorganic ions of exhaust particles from a heavy duty diesel engine using B20 biodiesel with different exhaust aftertreatments  ap. 898-906.  aExhaust particle emissions from a heavy duty diesel engine using B20 biodiesel (20% biodiesel blend with 80% diesel by volume) were investigated, and the engine was equipped with three kinds of exhaust aftertreatment devices: DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst), DOC + DPF (diesel particle filter), and DOC + CDPF (catalyzed diesel particle filter). Particle mass, particle number and size distribution, and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and inorganic ions in the particle emissions from the engine were studied. Compared with the engine without exhaust aftertreatments, DOC decreased nucleation mode particle number by 19.83%, while accumulation mode particles exhibited slight changes. The DOC + DPF reduced the total particle number by 82.54%, while the DOC + CDPF reduced it by 91.71%. Compared with the engine without exhaust aftertreatments, the three aftertreatments were shown to reduce total PAH emissions. DOC + DPF and DOC + CDPF can decrease total TEQ (toxicity equivalent quantity) effectively with a sharp decrease in PAH mass. The DOC increased the TEQ of particles by 46.9%. The catalyst in the DOC increased some high molecular weight PAHs such as BaA, BbF + BkF, and BaP, which led to the increase in TEQ. The DOC increased the total inorganic ions by 2%, while the DOC + DPF and DOC + CDPF decreased inorganic ions by 89.5% and 82.9%, respectively. Catalysts in DOC and CDPF promotes the formation of SO4²⁻ and NO3⁻, which leads to higher inorganic ion emissions with DOC than no aftertreatments and higher inorganic ion emissions with a DOC + CDPF than with a DOC + DPF.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adiesel engines 3ainorganic ions 3amolecular weight 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aparticulate emissions 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asulfates 3atoxicity 0aDiesel particle 0aBiodiesel 0aExhaust aftertreatment 0aParticle number size distribution 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 0aInorganic ion1 aZhong, Yi-mei1 aHu, Zhi-yuan1 aLou, Di-ming0 tEnergy.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 141 p.898-906dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2017.09.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245013300172300001800305520151900323592002801842596007601870596007601946596007602022650001402098650001502112650002402127650003202151650001502183650001502198650001302213650002302226650002102249650001802270650001002288650001802298650001602316650002102332650003102353650001702384650001302401651001402414700003202428700002302460773013302483856008302616852000902699655001202708IND60684511920221120160731.0210623e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068451192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-019-02155-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuassolo, Florencia10aLitter decomposition of the invasive Potentilla anserina in an invaded and non-invaded freshwater environment of North Patagonia  ap. 1055-1065.  aPotentilla anserina is a common invasive species of Patagonian wetlands. Although this species is commonly found in temporary habitats, where it establishes during the dry phase, the littoral zones of lakes are also susceptible, as water fluctuations make this habitat extremely variable in terms of water availability. Decay rates and nutrient release of P. anserina were compared with two native macrophyte species, Eleocharis pachycarpa and Schoenoplectus californicus, in two different freshwater environments: a temporary wetland, where P. anserina develops important stands, and the littoral zone of a lake not yet colonized by the invasive plant. Our results showed that both environments differed in nutrient concentrations, being higher in the temporary wetland. However, the invasive species decomposed faster in the littoral zone of the lake, due to the presence of the amphipod Hyallela patagonica in the litter bags. The invasive plant litter decomposed twice faster than the native species. The species with highest N content, E. pachycarpa, released more N in leachates. After 71 days of decomposition, P. anserina loss more C and gained more N than the native species, while the P content remained constant across the three species. Our results demonstrated that the introduction of an invasive species as P. anserina into new habitats would contribute with dissolved and particulate organic matter impacting nutrient cycling and invertebrate assemblages with consequences to the entire ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2016 4151cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aPICT 2014 1604cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aPICT 2015 0418cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3aAmphipoda 3aEleocharis 3aPotentilla anserina 3aSchoenoplectus californicus 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amacrophytes 3anitrogen content 3aparticulate organic matter 3aplant litter 3awetlands 3aArgentina1 aDíaz Villanueva, Verónica1 aModenutti, Beatriz0 tBiological invasions.g2020 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.1055-1065dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-019-02155-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245012300179300001600302500001500318520146600333592002801799650002601827650000901853650001601862650003301878650002901911650002001940650001001960650001901970650003101989650002102020650001702041650002602058650001802084650002702102650003502129650002102164650003302185650004802218650003002266650004202296650003802338650003302376650002202409650003602431650003202467650002102499650001402520650004002534650004902574650003202623650002302655650002402678650002202702653001302724700001402737700001902751700001502770700001602785773009902801856004802900852000902948655001202957IND4473329920221120235602.0120824e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447332992DNAL7 a227332022pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-012-9938-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ying10aMotif analysis unveils the possible co-regulation of chloroplast genes and nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins  ap. 177-187.  a2019-12-06  aChloroplasts play critical roles in land plant cells. Despite their importance and the availability of at least 200 sequenced chloroplast genomes, the number of known DNA regulatory sequences in chloroplast genomes are limited. In this paper, we designed computational methods to systematically study putative DNA regulatory sequences in intergenic regions near chloroplast genes in seven plant species and in promoter sequences of nuclear genes in Arabidopsis and rice. We found that −35/−10 elements alone cannot explain the transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes. We also concluded that there are unlikely motifs shared by intergenic sequences of most of chloroplast genes, indicating that these genes are regulated differently. Finally and surprisingly, we found five conserved motifs, each of which occurs in no more than six chloroplast intergenic sequences, are significantly shared by promoters of nuclear-genes encoding chloroplast proteins. By integrating information from gene function annotation, protein subcellular localization analyses, protein–protein interaction data, and gene expression data, we further showed support of the functionality of these conserved motifs. Our study implies the existence of unknown nuclear-encoded transcription factors that regulate both chloroplast genes and nuclear genes encoding chloroplast protein, which sheds light on the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3arice 3aArabidopsis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3agenes 3aintergenic DNA 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3achloroplasts 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aChloroplast Proteinsxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aConserved Sequencexgenetics 2aDNA, Chloroplastxclassificationxgenetics. 2aDNA, Intergenicxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxclassificationxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Chloroplastxgenetics 2aLettucexgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aNucleotide Motifsxgenetics 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSolanum tuberosumxgenetics 2aSoybeansxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0aproteins1 aDing, Jun1 aDaniell, Henry1 aHu, Haiyan1 aLi, Xiaoman0 tPlant molecular biology.g2012 Sept., v. 80, no. 2 p.177-187dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-012-9938-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01695naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245008200128300001200210520063000222592002800852650001500880650001200895650001700907650002700924650001700951650002000968650002100988650002601009650001601035650001301051653002301064653003801087700001401125700001601139700001601155773014101171852000901312655001201321IND60709722820221122043819.0200908e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070972282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajya, D.R.10aInsecticide Resistance Management strategies for managing Cotton pest complex  ap. 1-5.  aThe Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM) strategies for managing cotton pest complex revealed that sucking and bollworm complex were low in IRM plots compared to Farmer Practice (FP) plots.

They are formed in different types of cells and have been found in fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. Two types of IFN have been found in ray-finned fish (Superclass: Osteichthyes, Class: Actinopterygii) so far, i.e. IFN type I (IFN I) and IFN type II (IFN II), while the presence of IFN type III (IFN III), which is found in phylogenetically older cartilaginous fishes, was not confirmed in this taxonomic group of vertebrates. Currently, type I IFN in Actinopterygii is divided into three groups, I, II and III, within which there are subgroups. These cytokines in these animals show primarily antiviral activity through the use of a signalling pathway JAK-STAT (Janus kinases — Signal transducer and activator of transcription) and the ability to induce ISG (IFN-stimulated genes) expression, which contain ISRE complexes (IFN-stimulated response elements). On the other hand, in Perciformes and Cyprinidae, it was found that type I/I interferons also participate in the antimicrobial response, inter alia, by inducing the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and influencing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells carrying out the phagocytosis process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3aPerciformes 3aantiviral properties 3acytokines 3afish 3aimmune response 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3aphagocytosis 3aphylogeny 3areactive oxygen species 3ashellfish 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 0aType I interferons 0aRay-finned fish 0aActinopterygii1 aTokarz-Deptuła, Beata1 aDeptuła, Wiesław0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2021 Mar., v. 110 p.35-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245012700211520130000338592002801638650001801666650001201684650001201696650001201708650002901720650002801749650002901777650002401806650001401830650002901844650001901873650000701892650002401899650001301923650001701936650001101953653001601964653001701980653003101997653003102028653002202059653001902081700006002100700006402160700005902224700005802283773011902341856008602460852000902546655001202555IND60781422520221119015107.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078142252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1156042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez, Eliana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3708-490110aEffects of the amendment with almond shell, bio-waste and almond shell-based biochar on the quality of saline-alkali soils  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of the amendment with almond shell bio-waste (AS) and almond shell-based biochar (ASB), in different mass ratios (5, 10, and 15%), on the physicochemical properties of three different saline soils, using the growth of arugula seedlings as a bioindicator of the enhancement achieved. Data were analyzed based on a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement with four replications. The results showed that the low-salinity soil (T1) presented the best physicochemical characteristics and growth parameters. The addition of AS and ASB in low proportions to the saline soils reduced the pH and electrical conductivity values. An increase in the amendment proportion led to an increase in these variables. Moisture, organic matter, and organic carbon increased, and the cation exchange capacity decreased, generating positive effects on soil quality. The values of exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) showed that T3 presented the highest sodicity, followed by T2 and T1. The treatment with 5% ASB produced better results regarding total plant length, fresh and dry weights, leaf area, and leaf chlorophyll content. Finally, linear regression models were applied to describe the dependence of the agronomic variables on the ratio of biochar added.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmond shells 3aalmonds 3aarugula 3abiochar 3acation exchange capacity 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental management 3aexchangeable sodium 3aleaf area 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aregression analysis 3asodicity 3asoil quality 3awastes 0aSaline soil 0aAlmond shell 0aAlmond-shell-based biochar 0aPhysicochemical properties 0aArugula seedlings 0aSoil amendment1 aZabaleta, Romina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0017-81541 aFabani, María Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4647-379X1 aRodriguez, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1252-47521 aMazza, Germán1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1362-85210 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 318 p.115604-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1156043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245010500167300001400272520155300286592002801839650001601867650001501883650001201898650001301910650001601923650001501939650002201954650001901976650001801995650001502013651001902028700001802047700001902065700001702084700001802101700001702119700001702136773008702153856008402240852000902324655001202333IND4472671820221118065615.0150808e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447267182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodcock, B.A.10aIdentifying time lags in the restoration of grassland butterfly communities: A multi-site assessment  ap. 50-58.  aAlthough grasslands are crucial habitats for European butterflies, large-scale declines in quality and area have devastated many species. Grassland restoration can contribute to the recovery of butterfly populations, although there is a paucity of information on the long-term effects of management. Using eight UK data sets (9â21years), we investigate changes in restoration success for (1) arable reversion sites, were grassland was established on bare ground using seed mixtures, and (2) grassland enhancement sites, where degraded grasslands are restored by scrub removal followed by the re-instigation of cutting/grazing. We also assessed the importance of individual butterfly traits and ecological characteristics in determining colonisation times. Consistent increases in restoration success over time were seen for arable reversion sites, with the most rapid rates of increase in restoration success seen over the first 10years. For grasslands enhancement there were no consistent increases in restoration success over time. Butterfly colonisation times were fastest for species with widespread host plants or where host plants established well during restoration. Low mobility butterfly species took longer to colonise. We show that arable reversion is an effective tool for the management of butterfly communities. We suggest that as restoration takes time to achieve, its use as a mitigation tool against future environmental change (i.e. by decreasing isolation in fragmented landscapes) needs to take into account such time lags.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutterflies 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3alandscapes 3along term effects 3arisk reduction 3aseed mixtures 3ashrublands 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBullock, J.M.1 aMortimer, S.R.1 aBrereton, T.1 aRedhead, J.W.1 aThomas, J.A.1 aPywell, R.F.0 tBiological conservation.g2012 Oct., v. 155 p.50-58dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245008200161300001800243520135100261592002801612650001701640650002501657650002001682650001101702650002001713650003101733650001401764650001501778650001701793650002001810650002201830650001301852650001601865650002101881650001801902650002001920700001601940700001401956700001701970700001201987700001601999700001702015773012502032856008202157852000902239655001202248IND60789154520221118064630.0220818e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078915452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-021-1076-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Xudan10aTranscriptome analysis of Porphyridium purpureum under salinities of 0 and 68  ap. 1600-1614.  aThe most prominent biological characteristic of Porphyridium purpureum is their unique extracellular sulfated polysaccharides that plays an important protective role against salt stress. Adaptation to stress is associated with metabolic adjustments. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such metabolic changes remain elusive. This study presents the first transcriptome profiling of P. purpureum. A total of 8 019 assembled transcripts were identified, annotated, and classified into different biological categories and pathways based on a BLAST analysis against various databases. The in-depth analysis revealed that many of the differentially expressed genes in P. purpureum under salinities of 68 and 0 involved polysaccharide metabolism. A comparison of the gene expression levels under different salinities revealed that the polysaccharide synthetic pathway was significantly upregulated under the 68 salinity condition. The increased expression of the FBP, pfkA, CS, pgm, USP, UGP2, galE, and MPI transcripts in the polysaccharide synthetic pathway and the increase in ATP2 and ATP6 transcripts in the energy metabolic pathway revealed the molecular mechanism of high-salt adaptation. This sequencing dataset and analysis could serve as a valuable resource to study the mechanisms involved in abiotic stress tolerance in Rhodophyta.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorphyridium 3abiochemical pathways 3adata collection 3aenergy 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3alimnology 3ametabolism 3aoceanography 3apolysaccharides 3aprotective effect 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aNan, Fangru1 aFeng, Jia1 aLü, Junping1 aLiu, Qi1 aLiu, Xudong1 aXie, Shulian0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2022 July, v. 40, no. 4 p.1600-1614dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-021-1076-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001700181245016900198300001800367506007600385520128000461592002801741506003701769650002001806650001101826650002101837650001101858650001301869650002401882650001701906650001801923650001101941650002101952650001001973650001901983650001102002650002702013650003202040650002602072650002202098650004102120650002802161650002402189650004002213650004402253650004302297653001802340653001102358653001302369653001402382653000702396653001002403653001902413653001502432700001402447773012602461856007402587852000902661655001202670IND60118852020221207092256.0141127e20120628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011885202DNAL7 a225631192pmid7 aPMC33984572pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/ers1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrantz, D.A.10aRoot and shoot gas exchange respond additively to moderate ozone and methyl jasmonate without induction of ethylene: ethylene is induced at higher O3 concentrations  ap. 4303-4313.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe available literature is conflicting on the potential protection of plants against ozone (O3) injury by exogenous jasmonates, including methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Protective antagonistic interactions of O3 and MeJA have been observed in some systems and purely additive effects in others. Here it is shown that chronic exposure to low to moderate O3 concentrations (4–114 ppb; 12 h mean) and to MeJA induced additive reductions in carbon assimilation (A n) and root respiration (R r), and in calculated whole plant carbon balance. Neither this chronic O3 regime nor MeJA induced emission of ethylene (ET) from the youngest fully expanded leaves. ET emission was induced by acute 3 h pulse exposure to much higher O3 concentrations (685 ppb). ET emission was further enhanced in plants treated with MeJA. Responses of growth, allocation, photosynthesis, and respiration to moderate O3 concentrations and to MeJA appear to be independent and additive, and not associated with emission of ET. These results suggest that responses of Pima cotton to environmentally relevant O3 are not mediated by signalling pathways associated with ET and MeJA, though these pathways are inducible in this species and exhibit a synergistic O3×MeJA interaction at very high O3 concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadditive effect 3acarbon 3achronic exposure 3acotton 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3agas exchange 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3amethyl jasmonate 3aozone 3aphotosynthesis 3ashoots 2aAcetatesxpharmacology 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aGossypiumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOxylipinsxpharmacology 2aOzonexpharmacology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0aAir pollution 0acotton 0aethylene 0ajasmonate 0aO3 0aozone 0aplant hormones 0asignalling1 aVu, H.-B.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 June 28, v. 63, no. 11 p.4303-4313dOxford University Press [etc.]x0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ers1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013700165520193200302592002802234650001802262650000802280650002702288650002602315650001602341650001702357650002002374650001502394650001402409650002502423653003302448653001402481653002002495653001402515653002002529700001602549700001902565700002402584700001802608700001202626700001502638700002402653700003402677700002602711700001502737773012402752856008402876961001302960852000902973655001202982IND60722846320221118051546.0210124e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072284632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2020.1070452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, LiHeng10aNew insights into the phylogeny and evolution of lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) by extensive sampling of genes and species  aLadybirds (family Coccinellidae) are one of the most diverse groups of beetles and globally comprise over 6000 species. Despite their scientific and economic significance, the taxonomy of Coccinellidae remains unstable, and we still know little about their evolutionary history. By using a small number of genes, previous phylogenetic analyses have not reliably resolved the relationships among major ladybird lineages. In this study, we sequenced 94 nuclear protein-coding genes for 214 species of Coccinellidae and 14 outgroups, covering 90 genera and 35 tribes. We found that nucleotide compositional heterogeneity is present among ladybird tribes so that phylogenetic inference at the amino acid level is more reliable than at the DNA level. Based on the maximum likelihood analyses of the amino acid dataset, we recognize three subfamilies in Coccinellidae: Microweiseinae, Monocoryninae stat. nov., and Coccinellinae. The subfamily relationships are strongly supported as (Microweiseinae, (Monocoryninae stat. nov., Coccinellinae)). The tribes of ladybirds are mostly monophyletic, except Ortaliini, Sticholotidini, Scymnini, and Coccidulini. The phylogenetic relationships among tribes of Coccinellinae are still not well resolved, with many nodes weakly supported. Our divergence time analysis suggests that the crown group of extant lady beetles arose in the Early Cretaceous ~ 143 million years ago (Mya) and experienced a rapid diversification during the Late Cretaceous (120–70 Mya). We hypothesize that the boom of angiosperms in the Late Cretaceous promoted the diversification of herbivorous Sternorrhyncha insects, especially aphids, which in turn drove the rapid radiation of predatory lady beetles. In summary, our work provides a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny of Coccinellidae that provides a sound framework for revising their classification and understanding the origin of their biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoccinellidae 3aDNA 3aEarly Cretaceous epoch 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aamino acids 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3aherbivores 3amonophyly 3astatistical analysis 0alady beetles (Coccinellidae) 0aPhylogeny 0aDivergence time 0aRadiation 0aSystematic bias1 aZhang, Peng1 aDeng, ShaoHong1 aEscalona, Hermes E.1 aWang, Xingmin1 aLi, Yun1 aPang, Hong1 aVandenberg, Natalia1 aŚlipiński, Stanisław Adam,1 aTomaszewska, Wioletta1 aLiang, Dan0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2021 Mar., v. 156 p.107045-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.1070453Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01797naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245008100128300001400209520074600223592002800969650002300997650002101020650001801041650002601059650001501085650002401100650000901124650001601133653001801149653002701167700001701194700001701211700001401228700001701242700001201259773014301271852000901414655001201423IND60709723020221122043648.0200908e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070972302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Gaje10aEffect of Bio-pesticides against Stem fly and Pod borer complex in Field pea  ap. 10-12.  aSix treatments viz., BeaUveria bassiana @ 2.0 kg/ha., Metarrhizium anisopliae. @ 2.0 kg/ha, NSKE 5% neemarin @ 3 lit/ha., B.t. @ 0.5 kg/ha and cartap hydrochloride (4G) @ 15 kg/ha at sowing time + endosulfan (35EC) @ 1.5 lit/ha and an untreated control.

However, our knowledge of bacterial communities associated with jellyfish in culture ponds and their potential roles in the regulation of aquaculture species remains unclear. In this study, sequencing based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the composition and variation of the bacterial communities associated with hydromedusa Gonionemus vertens in sea cucumber culture ponds and natural marine environment. The associated bacterial communities of G. vertens from the culture ponds in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea had significantly different compositions, when compared with those from ambient seawater environment. Furthermore, bacterial communities associated with G. vertens had similar diversity and composition in culture ponds and natural marine environment in the Yellow Sea. There were 31 unique bacterial biomarkers identified in three locations. The major communities were highly abundant in Kiloniellales, Octadecabacter, Polynucleobacter, and Polaribacter, and are related to the environmental information processing. Pathogen candidates such as Vibrionales and Chlamydiales had notably low relative abundances (<1%). The venom of the jellyfish was considered responsible for damage to the aquaculture. This study provides important data to help assess the impact of cnidarians-associated bacterial communities on pond aquaculture and the influences on material cycling and energy flow in marine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydiales 3aKiloniellales 3aOctadecabacter 3aPolaribacter 3aPolynucleobacter 3aScyphozoa 3aVibrionales 3abiomarkers 3aenergy flow 3agenes 3alimnology 3amariculture 3amarine environment 3aoceanography 3apathogens 3aseawater 3avenoms 3aYellow Sea1 aWang, Lei1 aLi, Fan1 aSun, Tingting1 aPeng, Saijun1 aLi, Yongxue1 aZhao, Jianmin1 aDong, Zhijun0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2022 July, v. 40, no. 4 p.1530-1543dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-021-1036-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002300191245005700214300001800271506007600289520095500365592002801320506003701348650001301385650001801398650001301416650001201429650001301441650001101454650002301465650001301488650002201501700002301523700005801546773011901604856008401723852000901807655001201816IND60632348020221207121644.0190314e20190220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063234802DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024092doi7 aPMC64167102pmcid7 a308947802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMensink, Liz I.

We show, using molecular dynamics simulations, that these coatings display rich wetting behavior. Depending on the interaction between the brushes and the polymeric droplets as well as on the self-affinity of the brush, we can distinguish between three wetting states: mixing, complete wetting, and partial wetting. We find that transitions between these states are largely captured by enthalpic arguments, while deviations to these can be attributed to the negative excess interfacial entropy for the brush droplet system. Interestingly, we observe that the contact angle strongly increases when the softness of the brush is increased, which is opposite to the case of drops on soft elastomers. Hence, the Young to Neumann transition owing to softness is not universal but depends on the nature of the substrate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3aentropy 3ahardness 3amixing 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3asimulation models1 aSnoeijer, Jacco H.1 ade Beer, Sissi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7208-68140 tMacromolecules.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 52, no. 5 p.2015-2020dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008200176300001600258520153900274592002801813650001301841650003001854650002501884650001901909650001801928650001501946650001501961650001601976650001501992650001702007650001302024650002602037650002102063653001702084653001302101653002302114653003002137653003002167700001802197700002902215773011102244856008602355852000902441655001202450IND60557608420221120193430.0180905e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055760842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatejko, Małgorzata10aSample preparation procedures utilized in microbial metabolomics: An overview  ap. 150-157.  aBacteria are remarkably diverse in terms of their size, structure and biochemical properties. Due to this fact, it is hard to develop a universal method for handling bacteria cultures during metabolomic analysis. The choice of suitable processing methods constitutes a key element in any analysis, because only appropriate selection of procedures may provide accurate results, leading to reliable conclusions. Because of that, every analytical experiment concerning bacteria requires individually and very carefully planned research methodology. Although every study varies in terms of sample preparation, there are few general steps to follow while planning experiment, like sampling, separation of cells from growth medium, stopping their metabolism and extraction. As a result of extraction, all intracellular metabolites should be washed out from cell environment. What is more, extraction method utilized cannot cause any chemical decomposition or degradation of the metabolome. Furthermore, chosen extraction method should correlate with analytical technique, so it will not disturb or prolong following sample preparation steps. For those reasons, we observe a need to summarize sample preparation procedures currently utilized in microbial metabolomic studies. In the presented overview, papers concerning analysis of extra- and intracellular metabolites, published over the last decade, have been discussed. Presented work gives some basic guidelines that might be useful while planning experiments in microbial metabolomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acellular microenvironment 3achemical degradation 3achromatography 3aculture media 3aguidelines 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3aplanning 3aprocessing technology 3aresearch methods 0aMetabolomics 0aBacteria 0aSample preparation 0aIntracellular metabolites 0aExtracellular metabolites1 aJacyna, Julia1 aMarkuszewski, Michał J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 1043 p.150-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2016.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002200172245009100194300001600285520121500301592002801516650002201544650001201566650002501578650002601603650001301629650002601642650002401668650001201692650001301704650001101717650001001728650001801738650001301756650003401769650001301803650001701816650002201833650001101855650002301866653001601889653001201905653002401917653001001941653001301951653001301964700002101977700001301998700001702011773010202028856008702130852000902217655001202226IND50060503420221120192721.0160902e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006050342DNAL7 a232201332pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.10.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSudarjanto, Gatut10aLaboratory assessment of bioproducts for sulphide and methane control in sewer systems  ap. 429-437.  aThe effectiveness of three bioproducts (also known as biomaterials) for liquid-phase biological treatment (LPBT) of sewer biofilms to control detrimental build-up of sulphide (H2S) and methane (CH4) in sewers was tested in a laboratory system mimicking a rising/force main sewer pipe. Bioproduct A claims to disrupt cell-to-cell communication of sewer anaerobic biofilms while Bioproducts B and C claim to enhance sulphidotrophic (sulphide-oxidising) capacity of the sewer biofilm, to avoid sulphide accumulation. The results demonstrated that all three bioproducts tested had no or negligible impact on sulphide or methane control, as opposed to traditional sulphide-controlling chemicals widely used by the wastewater industry such as oxygen, nitrate, iron salts and magnesium hydroxide. Those had previously been demonstrated to be effective using the same laboratory system with the same testing protocol. The implications of the findings are discussed. It is concluded that field application/trials of these three bioproducts are not warranted. It is recommended that other bioproducts should be subject to similar rigorous tests prior to being taken up by the water industry for field trials/application.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abiofilm 3abiological treatment 3afield experimentation 3aindustry 3alaboratory techniques 3amagnesium hydroxide 3amethane 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3apipes 3asewer systems 3asulfides 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiofilms 2aLaboratories 2aMethanexanalysis 2aSewage 2aSulfidesxanalysis 0aBioproducts 0aMethane 0aSCORe-CT lab system 0aSewer 0aSulphate 0aSulphide1 aGutierrez, Oriol1 aRen, Guo1 aYuan, Zhiguo0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 443 p.429-437dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.10.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008400171300001400255520158800269592002801857650001101885650001301896650001801909650001601927650001501943650001601958650001401974650001301988650001202001650001502013700002802028700002102056700001902077700002002096773012402116856005502240852000902295655001202304IND4382906520221118065532.0120925e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438290652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2006.00660.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDejean, Alain,10aAre myrmecophytes always better protected against herbivores than other plants?  ap. 91-98.  aThe present field study compared the degree of defoliation of three Guianian melastome, two myrmecophytes (i.e. plants sheltering ants in hollow structures) and Clidemia sp., a nonmyrmecophytic plant serving as a control. Maieta guianensis Aubl. hosted mostly Pheidole minutula Mayr whatever the area, whereas Tococa guianensis Aubl. hosted mostly Azteca bequaerti Wheeler along streams and Crematogaster laevis Mayr or Azteca sp. 1 in the understory where it never blossomed. Only Tococa, when sheltering A.âbequaerti in what can be considered as a truly mutualistic relationship, showed significantly less defoliation than control plants. In the other associations, the difference was not significant, but P.âminutula is mutualistic with Maieta because it furnishes some protection (exclusion experiments) plus nutrients (previous studies). When devoid of ants, Tococa showed significantly greater defoliation than control plants; therefore, it was deduced that Tococa probably lacks certain antidefoliator metabolites that control plants possess (both Tococa and control plants are protected by groundânesting, plantâforaging ants, which is termed âgeneral myrmecological protectionâ). Consequently, plantâants other than A.âbequaerti probably also protect Tococa slightly, thus compensating for this deficiency and permitting it to live in the understory until treefall gaps provide the conditions necessary for seed production.âÂ© 2006 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2006, 89, 91â98.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzteca 3aClidemia 3aCrematogaster 3adefoliation 3aherbivores 3ametabolites 3anutrients 3aplanting 3astreams 3aunderstory1 aDelabie, Jacques H.

The polymer nanocomposites so obtained with fractal-like aggregates have exceptional rheological behavior that have long been exploited in the tire industry. However, because of the disparity of time and length scales, our understanding of the relation between nanocomposites structure and rheology remains far from complete. We propose in this work a mesoscopic model to address the dynamics and the rheology of aggregate nanocomposites. While aggregates are represented explicitly as groups of interacting particles, we use for the polymeric matrix an implicit description based on generalized Langevin and Stokes equations that captures the average effect of a viscoelastic medium. These two-level modeling allows us to simulate large systems containing dozens of aggregates. Focusing here on the linear viscoelastic properties of PNCs (polymer nanocomposites), we characterize the influence of aggregate size, volume fraction, rigidity, and polydispersity. We demonstrate that rigid aggregates systems display salient features of the phenomenology of PNCs, namely, slow relaxation in the stress relaxation response, non-Maxwell elastic response at low frequency, and supralinear dependence of their storage modulus with volume fraction. We also point out the critical role played by aggregate rigidity and show that for either flexible aggregates or well-dispersed nanofillers the effects are far less spectacular. Our findings should help in designing nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aindustry 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymers 3arheology 3astorage modulus 3astress relaxation 3atires 3aviscoelasticity1 aMaurel, Gaëtan1 aCouty, Marc1 aDetcheverry, François1 aMerabia, Samy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2710-12420 tMacromolecules.g2019 Feb. 18, v. 52, no. 5 p.2021-2032dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b024553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007700173300001600250520150300266592002801769650002001797650000901817650001501826650001601841650002101857650001001878650001401888650002201902653002301924653001701947653001301964653001301977653002401990653001202014700002302026700002202049700002302071700002402094773010302118856008602221852000902307655001202316IND60525390220221117225507.0190318e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052539022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, Michael J.10aCompensatory response of invasive common carp Cyprinus carpio to harvest  ap. 168-178.  aInvasive species are often mechanically removed to reduce or eliminate their populations. However, removal may release survivors from density-dependent mechanisms resulting in stable or increasing population abundance through compensatory processes. Additionally, immigration of new individuals into systems where removal is occurring may negate efforts to control population abundance. Thus, understanding population-level responses to removal and immigration rates are essential aspects of invasive species management. We evaluated how common carp Cyprinus carpio populations respond to removal through commercial harvest in three interconnected lakes over five years. Nearly 230,000 common carp (up to 55 fish/ha/year) were removed and exploitation rates ranged from <1 to 43% across three lakes over four years. Despite high removal rates in some years, carp population abundance, recruitment, and growth remained stable. Carp survival ranged between 54–79% and was inversely related to removal rate. However, survival only decreased by 25% at 43% exploitation, suggesting a partial compensatory rather than additive response. Emigration among lakes was low (<1%; >2000 carp), but varied among years in response to water level fluctuations. Our results indicate that carp control is difficult in large interconnected systems due to compensatory mortality and interbasin movement patterns, limiting the ability of removal-based management practices alone to control these invasive populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3acarp 3aharvesting 3aimmigration 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3amortality 3apopulation growth 0aDensity-dependence 0aExploitation 0aInvasion 0aSurvival 0aPopulation dynamics 0aHarvest1 aHennen, Matthew J.1 aBrown, Michael L.1 aLucchesi, David O.1 aSt. Sauver, Todd R.0 tFisheries research.g2016 July, v. 179 p.168-178dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2016.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245010200163300001600265520127700281592002801558650002101586650002501607650002301632650002601655650001201681650001801693650001601711650001601727650001001743650001501753650001101768650002401779650001801803650003301821650001501854700001401869700002001883700001701903773010101920856008402021852000902105655001202114IND60083838020221120094858.0141101e20110320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008383802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2010.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Lili10aAntifungal activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles against Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum  ap. 207-215.  aAntifungal activities of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) and their mode of action against two postharvest pathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum) were investigated in this study. ZnO NPs with sizes of 70±15nm and concentrations of 0, 3, 6 and 12mmoll⁻¹ were used. Traditional microbiological plating, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy were used to study antifungal activities of ZnO NPs and to characterize the changes in morphology and cellular compositions of fungal hyphae treated with ZnO NPs. Results show that ZnO NPs at concentrations greater than 3mmoll⁻¹ can significantly inhibit the growth of B. cinerea and P. expansum. P. expansum was more sensitive to the treatment with ZnO NPs than B. cinerea. SEM images and Raman spectra indicate two different antifungal activities of ZnO NPs against B. cinerea and P. expansum. ZnO NPs inhibited the growth of B. cinerea by affecting cellular functions, which caused deformation in fungal hyphae. In comparison, ZnO NPs prevented the development of conidiophores and conidia of P. expansum, which eventually led to the death of fungal hyphae. These results suggest that ZnO NPs could be used as an effective fungicide in agricultural and food safety applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aPenicillium expansum 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aantifungal properties 3aconidia 3aconidiophores 3adeformation 3afood safety 3afungi 3afungicides 3ahyphae 3amechanism of action 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azinc oxide1 aLiu, Yang1 aMustapha, Azlin1 aLin, Mengshi0 tMicrobiological research.g2011 Mar. 20, v. 166, no. 3 p.207-215dElsevier GmbHx0944-50137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2010.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015300165500001400318520170200332592002802034650001402062650000802076650002502084650002802109650001702137650001602154650002002170650002802190650001202218650002602230650001302256650001602269650002702285650001002312650004002322650001602362650001102378650001402389650000902403650002102412650002802433650001402461650001802475650001302493700002302506700001902529700002502548700002002573700002402593700002102617773012302638856007402761852000902835655001202844IND60715327920221123031009.0201026e20201007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071532792DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121030632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCicero, Arrigo  F.G.10aPrevalent Seasoning and Cooking Fats, Arterial Stiffness and Blood Lipid Pattern in a Rural Population Sample: Data from the Brisighella Heart Study  aNAL-light  aBackground: Dietary fats have been variably associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between everyday mainly used dietary fats in cooking and as seasoning and hemodynamic and lipid parameters. Methods: For this study, we selected from the Brisighella Heart Study cohort subjects who were not treated with antihypertensive drugs and report with certainty their daily mean intake of dietary fats in cooking and as seasoning. Depending on the main source of dietary fat, the involved subjects were classified as prevalent extra-virgin olive oil (EVO) users, prevalent corn oil users, prevalent users of different vegetable oils and prevalent animal fat users, and we compared their characteristics. Results: Everyday consumption of EVO as a main seasoning and cooking fat source was significantly associated to lower body mass index, visceral adiposity index, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and cholesterolemia, when compared with predominantly animal fat users. Corn oil users also had lower blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and cholesterolemia, when compared with predominantly animal fat users, as well. In particular, in an age and systolic blood pressure adjusted model, the predictors of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity were the prevalent use of EVO (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.67–0.94 vs. other prevalent fat sources), LDL-Cholesterol (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.42), serum uric acid (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09–1.54) and estimated GFR (RR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.59–0.99). Conclusions: According to our findings, the choice of everyday seasoning and cooking fat is associated with a different metabolic and haemodynamic pattern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aage 3aanimal fats and oils 3aantihypertensive agents 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acardiovascular diseases 3acooking 3acooking fats and oils 3acorn oil 3adietary fat 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3aheart 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amethodology 3amodels 3anutrients 3arisk 3arural population 3asystolic blood pressure 3auric acid 3avegetable oil 3avelocity1 aFogacci, Federica 1 aGrandi, Elisa 1 aRizzoli, Elisabetta 1 aBove, Marilisa 1 aD’Addato, Sergio 1 aBorghi, Claudio 0 tNutrients.g2020 Oct. 07, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121030633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016900170300001600339520105500355592002801410650002201438650002601460650002001486650002201506650002601528650001501554650003301569650001501602650002301617651001001640653002901650653001101679653001301690653003301703653003301736700001601769700002001785700001501805700001501820700005501835700001801890700006001908773009501968856008702063852000902150655001202159IND60626578920221118123608.0210108e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062657892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zi-Chao10aMultivariate statistical analysis combined with e-nose and e-tongue assays simplifies the tracing of geographical origins of Lycium ruthenicum Murray grown in China  ap. 457-464.  aThis study aims to develop a fast and simple method to trace the geographical origins, harvest years and varieties of Lycium ruthenicum Murray (LRM) grown in China by employing e-nose and e-tongue assays and their combination. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied for qualitative classification and quantitative prediction. The results showed that e-nose and e-tongue assays and their combination failed to recognize harvest years and varieties of LRM, but achieved reliable results for tracing LRM geographical origins with a total classification ability of 86.4%, 86.8% and 92.6% respectively. In addition, the analysis procedure required shorter time and less chemical reagents as compared to high-end instrumental analysis or traditional methods like chemical analytical methods and sensory evaluation. This study demonstrated that the multivariate statistical analysis combined with e-nose and e-tongue assays could be a reliable and simplified method of tracing the geographical origins of LRM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycium ruthenicum 3adiscriminant analysis 3aelectronic nose 3aelectronic tongue 3amultivariate analysis 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3asensory evaluation 3aChina 0aLycium ruthenicum murray 0aE-nose 0aE-tongue 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aLinear discriminant analysis1 aYan, Yuzhen1 aNisar, Tanzeela1 aSun, Lijun1 aZeng, Yang1 aGuo, Yurong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6409-16211 aWang, Huichun1 aFang, Zhongxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9902-34260 tFood control.g2019 Apr., v. 98 p.457-464dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245016300175300001800338520157500356592002801931650002601959650001601985650002002001650002202021650003102043650001302074650001902087650001802106650002002124651002302144700002202167700001902189700001702208700001902225773013502244856008102379852000902460655001202469IND50074206120221118050127.0141211e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007420612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1839-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin-Laurent, Fabrice10aDetection and quantification of chlordecone in contaminated soils from the French West Indies by GC-MS using the 13C 10-chlordecone stable isotope as a tracer  ap. 4928-4933.  aChlordecone is an organochlorine insecticide that has been widely used to control banana weevil in the French West Indies. As a result of this intense use, up to 20,000 ha are contaminated by this insecticide in the French West Indies, and this causes environmental damage and health problems. A scenario of exposure was drawn by French authorities, based on land usage records. Many efforts have been made to monitor the occurrence of chlordecone and its main metabolites using different analytical methods, including GC, GC/MS, LC/MS, and NIRS. Although these different methods allow for the detection and quantification of chlordecone from soils, none of them estimate the bottleneck caused by extraction of this organochlorine from soils with high adsorption ability. In this study, we used¹³C₁₀-chlordecone as a tracer to estimate chlordecone extraction yield and to quantify chlordecone in soil extracts based on the¹³C/¹²C isotope dilution. We report the optimization of¹³C₁₀-chlordecone extraction from an Andosol. The method was found to be linear from 0.118 to 43 mg kg⁻¹in the Andosol, with an instrumental detection limit estimated at 8.84 μg kg⁻¹. This method showed that chlordecone ranged from 35.4 down to 0.18 mg kg⁻¹in Andosol, Nitisol, Ferralsol, and Fluvisol soil types. Traces of the metabolite β-monohydrochlordecone were detected in the Andosol, Nitisol, and Ferralsol soil samples. This last result indicates that this method could be useful to monitor the fate of chlordecone in soils of the French West Indies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCosmopolites sordidus 3achlordecone 3adetection limit 3aexposure scenario 3aisotope dilution technique 3aland use 3apolluted soils 3asoil sampling 3astable isotopes 3aFrench West Indies1 aSahnoun, Mehdi M.1 aMerlin, Chloé1 aVollmer, Guy1 aLübke, Markus0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Apr., v. 21, no. 7 p.4928-4933dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1839-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245011200198300001800310500001900328500001100347520166800358592002802026650001702054650001302071650002102084773012402105856007302229852000902302655001202311IND60740326520221120170156.0210602e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074032652DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.141222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaura, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5239-076314aThe habitat amount hypothesis predicts that fragmentation poses a threat to biodiversity: A reply to Fahrig  ap. 1536-1540.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLETTER  aIn Saura (Journal of Biogeography, 48, 11–22, 2021), I showed that the habitat amount hypothesis (HAH) has been considerably misinterpreted in several ways. In her response to my findings, Fahrig (Journal of Biogeography, 2021) admits that some predictions that were previously attributed to the HAH do not logically derive from it. She has however one main objection to my conclusions: that there are some cases where the HAH predicts higher site‐level species richness with more fragmentation in a region. I here explain why this is a partial and questionable observation that distracts and potentially misleads our understanding of the HAH predictions. It does not appropriately represent the fundamental and overwhelming negative effects of fragmentation on site‐level species richness that are predicted by the HAH. The HAH predicts that the highest site‐level species richness in a region will happen when all habitat is found in a single and compact habitat patch. Any departure from this zero‐fragmentation case, as well as any additional increase in the number, isolation, elongation or perforation of patches per se, will always have negative effects on site‐level species richness according to the HAH. I more briefly discuss a relatively minor comment by Fahrig on the possible slopes of the species–area relationship when the HAH holds. I conclude that the views and interpretations that have prevailed since the HAH was proposed—that the HAH negates the importance of fragmentation—can no longer be maintained. The HAH predicts that habitat configuration matters for conservation and that fragmentation is a threat to biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3ahabitats 3aspecies richness0 tJournal of biogeography.g2021 June, v. 48, no. 6 p.1536-1540dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.141223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013700162300001600299520166600315592002801981650001102009650001202020650001502032650002002047650001202067650001502079650002202094650002302116650002302139650002202162650002602184650001902210650001302229650002902242650001702271650002102288650001502309650002302324650001302347650002402360650001902384650001702403651001702420700002502437700001602462700001702478700002102495773011502516856008102631852000902712655001202721IND60575722120221120225057.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057572212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-017-9832-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotze, E.,10aSoil microbial communities in different rangeland management systems of a sandy savanna and clayey grassland ecosystem, South Africa  ap. 227-245.  aSoil nutrient supply in rangelands depends on the maintenance and performance of soil microbiological communities. In this study we investigated how different rangeland management systems affects the structure and function of soil microbial communities in the clayey grassland and sandy savanna ecosystems, South Africa. These ecosystems differ in climate, soil and vegetation, with the sandy savanna ecosystem being drier, and encroached by bush. Soils were sampled under continuous and rotational grazing systems along a gradient with increasing grazing pressure. Analyses comprised of enzyme activities and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). The results revealed that the clayey grassland ecosystem displayed elevated enzyme activities and PLFA contents compared with the drier, sandy savanna ecosystem, irrespective of the rangeland management practices, likely because soil texture played a significant role in maintaining microbial communities. However, when microbial activity was normalized to carbon, nitrogen and microbial biomass, specific enzyme activities were significantly higher in the sandy savanna ecosystem, indicating a more efficient functioning of microbes here. Furthermore, these microbial parameters were more sensitive to grazing pressure in the clayey grassland ecosystem than other chemical or physical soil properties, whereas in the sandy savanna ecosystem this was not the case. Decreasing the grazing pressure on rangeland, as, e.g., done by commercial farmers practicing rotational grazing, appeared to stimulate microbial performance and thus microbial mediated nutrient mineralization with positive consequences on plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3afarmers 3agrasslands 3agrazing intensity 3amanagement systems 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant growth 3arange management 3arangelands 3arotational grazing 3asavannas 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3asoil texture 3aSouth Africa1 aSandhage-Hofmann, A.1 aAmelung, W.1 aOomen, R.

In this work, we studied the revegetation success in different sites within a trace element-polluted area (Guadiamar River Valley, SW Spain). We analysed the survival and growth patterns of afforested plants of seven Mediterranean woody species, and their relation to soil pollution, over 3 years. We also analysed the trace element accumulation in the leaves of these species. The area was polluted mainly by As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn (soil total concentrations up to 250, 3.6, 236, 385 and 510 mg kg⁻¹, respectively). The woody plant performance was very different between sites and between species; in the riparian sites, plant survival rates were nearly 100%, while in the upland terrace sites species such as Quercus ilex and Ceratonia siliqua showed the lowest survival rates (less than 30%) and also the lowest relative growth rates. There were no significant relationships between plant performance and soil pollution in the riparian sites, while in the upland sites mortality, but not growth, was related to soil pollution, although that could be an indirect effect of different substrate alteration between sites. The accumulation of soil pollutants in the studied plants was low, with the exception of Salicaceae species, which accumulated Cd and Zn in the leaves above 1 and 200 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. We discuss the results with regard to the afforestation of trace-element polluted areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratonia siliqua 3aQuercus ilex 3aSalicaceae 3aafforestation 3ahighlands 3aland restoration 3aleaves 3apollutants 3ariparian areas 3ariparian soils 3arivers 3asoil pollution 3asurvival rate 3aterraces 3atrace elements 3avalleys 3awoody plants 3aSpain1 aMadejón, Paula1 aMarañón, Teodoro1 aMurillo, José Manuel0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2010 Jan., v. 129, no. 1 p.47-47dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-008-0253-33Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03451naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175100002100184245010700205300001600312500002400328500001500352520180000367650003002167650002102197650001002218650002602228650002302254650000802277650001802285650001002303650001502313650002102328650001002349651001102359651001102370651001502381653002202396700002402418700003102442700002102473773012502494852000902619856008502628856011202713930003302825945002502858946001302883961001302896655001202909IND4443339020221119090214.0101012e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444333902DNAL7 a10.1614/IPSM-D-09-00041.12doi7 a10113/464782hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aF9001 aConn, Jeffery S.10aCharacterizing Pathways of Invasive Plant Spread to Alaska: II.

The amounts of hay and straw imported into Alaska and the amounts and types of seed in imported and locally produced hay and straw was determined We purchased alfalfa hay, wheat straw, ryegrass straw, and timothy hay produced in Washington and Oregon (WA–OR) and locally produced straw and hay. The hay and straw were shaken over screens, and the remaining fines were mixed with sterile potting soil and incubated in the greenhouse. Forty-nine plant species were identified from hay and straw, nine of which are ranked as invasive in Alaska, including downy brome, foxtail barley, hare barley, narrowleaf hawksbeard, and quackgrass-a prohibited weed in Alaska. The number of seeds ranged from 0 to 6,205 seeds kg−1, with an average of 585 seeds kg−1, and the number of species ranged from 0 to 12, with an average of 4.2 species per bale. Crop seed comprised a large proportion of the germinated seeds in ryegrass straw, wheat straw, and timothy/brome hay (98, 78, and 62%, respectively), but was less prevalent (ranging from 0 to 38%) in the other three hay and straw crop types. Hay and straw from Alaska contained more total seeds and species than hay and straw from WA-OR, but the difference was not significant when only weed seed was used in the analysis. Alaska-grown timothy/brome hay contained significantly more total seed than alfalfa hay and wheat straw from WA–OR and Alaska-grown barley straw. The grower or distributor of the hay and straw also influenced the number of seeds and species among some crop types. Results of this study document that large numbers of alien plant species are transported by movements of hay and straw into and within Alaska. 3ageographical distribution 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3apropagation materials 3aintroduced species 3ahay 3agrowing media 3astraw 3aprovenance 3ainvasive species 3acrops 3aOregon 3aAlaska 0aWashington 0ainvasive pathways1 aStockdale, Casie A.1 aWerdin-Pfisterer, Nancy R.1 aMorgan, Jenny C.0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2010 , v.  3, no.  3 p.276-285dWeed Science Society of Americax1939-72917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614/IPSM-D-09-00041.13Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/464783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101217b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/11/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03191naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010600169520188300275592002802158650001602186650001202202650002102214650003302235650001102268650002002279650002902299650001302328650001502341650001902356650001102375650001802386650002302404651001402427653002002441653001402461653002402475653002202499653001002521700001902531773010302550856008302653852000902736655001202745IND60676440620221122113535.0200113e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067644062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1027502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrisarri, J.G.N.10aTemporal variation of stocking rate and primary production in the face of drought and land use change  aRangeland stocking rate is subjected to opposite forces. On the one hand, it is expected to fluctuate with interannual variations of aboveground net primary production (ANPP). On the other hand, it is expected to be stabilized by human interventions aimed at keeping a constant monetary flow. The global drought experienced during the first decade of the current century decreased ANPP in many regions. Argentinean rangelands suffered such drought amid an expansion of crop area. We assessed the relative impact of precipitation trends and human interventions on stocking rate and its components across a wide ANPP gradient in Argentina (from 1000 to 7000 kg.ha⁻¹.year⁻¹). We estimated ANPP through remote sensing, from 2001 to 2009, and gathered data on beef cattle stocking numbers per class and rangeland area (n = 67 political districts of Argentina) from 2002 to 2009. All the significant temporal trends of ANPP were negative (36% of the districts). Fifty-one percent of the districts showed a significant temporal trend of stocking rate. Despite the negative trend of ANPP, stocking rate increased in 76% of these districts. The decrease in the remaining 24% was less than expected from the reduction of ANPP. Positive trends of stocking rate were associated with an increase of total livestock in the same rangeland area, and negative ones with a decrease of total stocking and an increase of total rangeland area. Steers accounted for most of the stocking rate changes. As expected from this decoupling between stocking and ANPP, the interannual CV of stocking rate was about half the CV of ANPP. In the face of drought and strong land use changes, human interventions uncoupled or softened the response of stocking rate to ANPP. These responses were probably driven by economic factors and may have profound negative consequences on ecological sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef cattle 3adrought 3aeconomic factors 3aenvironmental sustainability 3ahumans 3aland use change 3anet primary productivity 3apolitics 3arangelands 3aremote sensing 3asteers 3astocking rate 3atemporal variation 3aArgentina 0aBeef production 0aRangeland 0aHuman interventions 0aCarryover effects 0aMODIS1 aOesterheld, M.0 tAgricultural systems.g2020 Feb., v. 178 p.102750-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2019.1027503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520087700306592002801183650002501211650001401236650001301250650001701263650002401280650001001304650001301314650001401327650001901341650001101360650002101371650002101392650001101413650001701424650001201441650001401453650001501467650001601482650002101498650001101519650002301530700002401553700005801577700001601635700002101651773011001672856008601782852000901868655001201877IND60626579220221118123622.0190409e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062657922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2018.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adel Olmo, Ana10aCheese supplementation with five species of edible seaweeds: Effect on proteolysis, lipolysis and volatile compounds  ap. 104-113.  aThe effect on the biochemical characteristics of Ibérico semi-hard cheese supplemented with Himanthalia elongata (HE), Laminaria ochroleuca (LO), Porphyra umbilicalis (PU), Ulva lactuca (UL) or Undaria pinnatifida (UP) seaweeds was investigated.

The Maillard reaction, a major reaction during the roasting process, produces melanoidin, which affects the overall antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory effects of coffee. In this experiment, coffee roasting was divided into four degrees: Light, Medium, City, and French. To examine the in vivo antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of coffee extracts with different roasting degrees, we used 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were pre-treated with coffee extracts for 10 days by oral gavage (300 mg/Kg.B.W). After the last pre-treatment, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 15 mg/Kg.B.W) was injected intraperitoneally for immune stimulation. Histopathological analysis showed that hepatic portal vein invasion and liver necrosis were severe in the LPS-treated group. However, these phenomena were greatly ameliorated when mice were pre-treated with Light- or Medium-roasted coffee extracts. Hepatic glutathione level was increased in the French group but decreased in the LPS-stimulated group. When mice were treated with LPS, mRNA expression level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) was increased, whereas TNF-α expression was significantly reduced in the Light and Medium groups. Treatment with coffee extracts decreased the mRNA expression levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in mice stimulated by LPS, regardless of coffee roasting degrees. These effects decreased with the increasing coffee roasting degree. Results of luciferase reporter assay revealed that these effects of coffee extracts were transcriptionally regulated by the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that the roasting degree affects the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of coffee extracts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMaillard reaction 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acolor 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3ahistopathology 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3aluciferase 3amales 3amelanoidins 3amice 3anecrosis 3aodors 3aportal vein 3aroasting 3ataste 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aJung, Soohan1 aKo, Kwang Suk0 tNutrients.g2018 Mar. 16, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu100303633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01892naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013400167300001600301520070000317592002801017650001401045650001201059650004301071650002301114650002201137650002201159650000901181650002701190650002401217650001301241650001601254700001301270700001201283700002101295700001601316773010501332856004801437852000901485655001201494IND50065965520221118051819.0130426e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006596552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-012-9815-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shu-Huan10aIsolation and characterization of twenty-six microsatellite loci for the tetraploid fish Dabry’s sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus)  ap. 409-412.  aTo evaluate the population genetic diversity as a means of devising conservation strategies, we constructed (CA)n and (CT)n enriched genomic libraries for Acipenser dabryanus, a narrowly endemic and endangered species in China.

In the present investigation, high‐speed counter‐current chromatography was used for the separation and purification of two classes of stilbenoids, namely, bibenzyls and 9,10‐dihydrophenanthrenes, on a preparative scale from whole plants of P. chinensis with different solvent systems after silica gel column chromatography fractionation. n‐Hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (1.2:1:1:0.8, v/v/v/v) was selected as the optimum solvent system to purify 1‐(3,4,5‐trimethoxyphenyl)‐1′,2′‐ethanediol (1), coelonin (2), 3,4′‐dihydroxy‐5,5′‐dimethoxybibenzyl (3), and 2,​7‐​dihydroxy‐​3,​4,​6‐​trimethoxy‐​9,​10‐​dihydrophenanthrene (4). While 2,7‐dihydroxy‐3,4,6‐trimethoxy‐​9,​10‐​dihydrophenanthrene (5), batatasin III (6), orchinol (7), and 3′‐O‐methylbatatasin III (8) were purified by n‐hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (1.6:0.8:1.2:0.4, v/v/v/v). After the high‐speed counter‐current chromatography isolation procedure, the purity of all compounds was over 94% assayed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography. The chemical structure identification of all compounds was carried out by mass spectrometry and¹H and¹³C NMR spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, the current investigation is the first study for the separation and purification of bibenzyls and 9,10‐dihydrophenanthrenes by high‐speed counter‐current chromatography from natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3achemical structure 3acountercurrent chromatography 3afractionation 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asilica gel 3asolvents 3astems 3astilbenoids 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aCai, Shining1 aDeng, Liang1 aXia, Qiang1 aDu, Lian‐Feng1 aCui, Guo‐Zhen1 aLi, Jun1 aZhou, Xu‐Mei1 aYe, Qizhang1 aZhou, Yan1 aLin, Mao0 tJournal of separation science.g2015 Feb., v. 38, no. 3 p.453-459dWiley-VCHx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2014010313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002200181245013800203300001800341500001500359506007600374520174300450592002802193506003702221650002602258650001702284650002102301650002002322650002802342650001502370650002202385650003102407650001402438650001502452650003202467650003102499650003502530650003002565650001502595650001102610650002202621650003902643650004202682653001602724700003202740700002002772700002702792700001802819700002402837700002202861773013602883856004303019852000903062655001203071IND4469063720221207131939.0120419e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446906372DNAL7 a223446362pmid7 aPMC33188482pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.07581-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez, Patricia,10aInteraction of Bifidobacterium bifidum LMG13195 with HT29 Cells Influences Regulatory-T-Cell-Associated Chemokine Receptor Expression  ap. 2850-2857.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProbiotics play an important role in the maintenance of the gastrointestinal barrier. In addition to direct effects on mucosal integrity, the interaction with the intestinal mucosa may have an active immunoregulatory effect. In the present work, we exposed HT29 intestinal epithelial cells to two Bifidobacterium species to determine their effect on gene expression profile, enterocyte monolayer integrity, and T-cell response. Bifidobacterium breve IPLA 20004 triggered a more pronounced increase in the transepithelial resistance of the enterocyte monolayer than Bifidobacterium bifidum LMG13195. The transcriptome profile of HT29 cells cultured in the presence of B. bifidum LMG13195 showed an increased expression of immune mediators and, interestingly, chemotactic molecules (CXCL10, CCL20, CXCL11 and CCL22) able to recruit lymphocytes. Since regulatory T cells (Treg cells) may express receptors for specific chemokines, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells with supernatants of HT29 cells previously treated with Bifidobacterium strains and analyzed FOXP3 and CD25 Treg markers and CCR6, CXCR3, CCR4, and CCR3 expression on CD4+ lymphocytes. The proportion of CD25high FOXP3+ cells was significantly increased after culture with B. bifidum LMG13195-conditioned HT29 supernatant. Moreover, this treatment led to the largest amount of CCR6+ CXCR3– CCR4+ CCR3+ CD4+ cells expressing high levels of CD25, corresponding to the Treg population. These results suggest that soluble factors secreted after B. bifidum LMG13195 contact with intestinal epithelial cells favored the generation of CD4+ CD25high lymphocytes expressing chemokine receptor Treg markers, thus making possible their recruitment to the intestinal mucosa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium breve 3acell culture 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3aBifidobacterium bifidum 3aprobiotics 3aintestinal mucosa 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3areceptors 3achemokines 2aBifidobacteriumximmunology 2aCulture Media, Conditioned 2aEpithelial Cellsxmicrobiology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aHT29 Cells 2aHumans 2aImmunophenotyping 2aReceptors, Chemokinexbiosynthesis 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryximmunology 0arecruitment1 aGonzález-Rodríguez, Irene1 aSánchez, Borja1 aRuas-Madiedo, Patricia1 aSuárez, Ana,1 aMargolles, Abelardo1 aGueimonde, Miguel0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 78, no. 8 p.2850-2857dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.07581-11  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001900163245011700182300001600299500002400315520170900339650001302048650001002061650002102071650001202092650001302104650001502117650000902132650004502141650001902186650005502205650002002260650001102280650003702291650001102328650004102339650000902380650002002389650001302409650002202422650001902444650002202463650002202485651001202507651001202519700001802531700002202549700002002571700002302591773010202614852000902716856008402725655001202809IND4369643020221119092816.0050505s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436964302DNAL7 a157351952pmid7 a10.2337/diacare.28.3.6002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Baiju R.10aClinical Inertia in Response to Inadequate Glycemic Control: Do specialists differ from primary care physicians?  ap. 600-606.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--Diabetic patients with inadequate glycemic control ought to have their management intensified. Failure to do so can be termed "clinical inertia." Because data suggest that specialist care results in better control than primary care, we evaluated whether specialists demonstrated less clinical inertia than primary care physicians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Using administrative data, we studied all non-insulin-requiring diabetic patients in eastern Ontario aged 65 or older who had A1c results >8% between September 1999 and August 2000. Drug intensification was measured by comparing glucose-lowering drug regimens in 4-month blocks before and after the elevated A1c test and was defined as 1) the addition of a new oral drug, 2) a dose increase of an existing oral drug, or 3) the initiation of insulin. Propensity score-based matching was used to control for confounding between groups. RESULTS:--There were 591 patients with specialist care and 1,911 with exclusively primary care. In the matched cohorts, 45.1% of patients with specialist care versus 37.4% with primary care had drug intensification (P = 0.009). Most of this difference was attributed to specialists' more frequent initiation of insulin in response to elevated A1c. CONCLUSIONS:--Fewer than one-half of patients with high A1c levels had intensification of their medications, regardless of specialty of their physician. Specialists were more aggressive with insulin initiation than primary care physicians, which may contribute to the lower A1c levels seen with specialist care. Interventions assisting patients and physicians to recognize and overcome clinical inertia should improve diabetes care in the population. 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3aglycemic control 3ainsulin 3apatients 3aphysicians 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitusxbloodxdrug therapyxmortality. 2aFamily Practice 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMedical Records 2aMedicine 2aPatient Selection 2aSpecialization 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTreatment Failure 3aOntario 0aOntario1 aHux, Janet E.1 aLaupacis, Andreas1 aZinman, Bernard1 avan Walraven, Carl0 tDiabetes care.g2005 Mar., v. 28, no. 3 p.600-606dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/diacare.28.3.6003Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02349naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245010300172300001600275500002400291520134800315650001701663650002501680650002301705650002201728651002201750651001001772700002301782700003001805700002201835773010901857852000901966856004801975655001202023IND4403711820221119093207.0080328e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440371182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-007-9303-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, Héctor M.10aCactus species turnover and diversity along a latitudinal transect in the Chihuahuan Desert Region  ap. 703-720.  aIncludes references  aA standardized sampling method was used to evaluate turnover (β diversity) among cactus species assemblages along a 798 km long latitudinal megatransect across the Chihuahuan Desert Region, from north-central Mexico to southern Texas. A total of 71 cactus species were found along the megatransect, 66.2% of which appeared at low frequencies, mostly as a consequence of their highly discontinuous distribution pattern. At the scale the study was conducted, there was always species turnover among cactus assemblages. The rate of turnover among contiguous sites primarily fluctuated from low to medium, but when all site combinations were considered (contiguous and non-contiguous), medium β diversity values were predominant (β = 0.331-0.66); however, 25.4% of the site pair combinations registered high values (β = 0.661-1.0). Our results showed that turnover among cactus species assemblages in the CDR does not consist for the most part of a process of species succession in the geographic space. Instead, we concluded that the continuous spatial changes in cactus species composition are primarily explained by the commonly intermittent distribution patterns of the species, by the presence in the megatransect of species at the margin of their distribution range, and, to a lesser extent, by the existence of narrowly endemic species. 3abiogeography 3acacti and succulents 3aindigenous species 3aspecies diversity 3aChihuahuan Desert 3aTexas1 aGoettsch, Bárbara1 aGómez-Hinostrosa, Carlos1 aArita, Héctor T.0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Apr., v. 17, no. 4 p.703-720dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-007-9303-2 7aarticle02976naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245019700169300001800366500002400384500001500408520171700423650001602140650001702156650001602173650001302189650002302202650001802225650001602243650001302259650001302272650001902285650001102304651001602315653002002331700002202351700002302373773010602396852000902502856005502511655001202566IND4446137520221119093229.0101208e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444613752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00921.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarsten, Ulf10aEcophysiological performance of the aeroterrestrial green alga klebsormidium crenulatum (charophyceae, streptophyta) isolated from an alpine soil crust with an emphasis on desiccation stress¹  ap. 1187-1197.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAeroterrestrial filamentous green algae of the genus Klebsormidium (Klebsormidiales, Streptophyta) are typical components of biological soil crusts, which occur worldwide in arid and semiarid habitats including alpine regions. In the present study, Klebsormidium crenulatum (Kütz.) Lokhorst was isolated from an alpine soil crust above the timberline of the Austrian Alps. Growth responses, photosynthetic performance, and desiccation tolerance were measured under controlled laboratory conditions. K. crenulatum exhibited optimal growth and the highest photosynthetic efficiency under relatively low photon fluence densities (30 and 21.9 μmol photons · m⁻² · s⁻¹, respectively), indicating low-light requirements. It grew in a narrow range of salinities between 1.2 and 15 practical salinity units (psu), pointing to a pronounced stenohaline response pattern. Increasing temperatures from 5°C to 40°C led to different effects on photosynthetic oxygen evolution and respiratory oxygen consumption in K. crenulatum. While at low temperatures (5°C-10°C) photosynthesis was relatively high, respiration was not detectable or was at a very low level. Conversely, at the highest temperature of 40°C, photosynthesis was inhibited, and respiration unaffected, indicating strong differences in temperature sensitivity between both physiological processes. K. crenulatum was capable of photosynthesizing efficiently for up to 2.5 h under desiccation, followed by a decrease to 15% of the initial value after 3 h. Complete recovery took place within 2 h after rehydration. All ecophysiological data explain the widespread abundance of K. crenulatum in soil crusts of the alpine regions of the European Alps. 3atemperature 3aCharophyceae 3arehydration 3asalinity 3aoxygen consumption 3aKlebsormidium 3asoil crusts 3ahabitats 3atreeline 3aphotosynthesis 3aoxygen 3aAlps region 0aKlebsormidiales1 aLütz, Cornelius.1 aHolzinger, Andreas0 tJournal of phycology.g2010 Dec., v. 46, no. 6 p.1187-1197dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2010.00921.x 7aarticle04432naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002600193245013900219300001800358500002400376506007600400520177300476506003702249650003502286650001802321650002602339650001102365650001902376650002402395650002602419650001602445650001002461650002102471650001402492650002402506650003002530650001302560650003402573650003102607650004102638650003402679650002202713650003702735650003802772650004602810650002802856650003402884650002402918650002702942650003402969650002503003700002103028700001603049700001803065700001803083700001903101700001603120700002903136700002503165700002103190700002403211700001703235700001603252700002203268700002103290700002403311700002803335700002203363700002403385700001803409773011103427852000903538856005503547655001203602IND4419506820221207062105.0090424e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441950682DNAL7 a191872832pmid7 aPMC27025002pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01825.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrittmatter, Axel W.10aGenome sequence of Desulfobacterium autotrophicum HRM2, a marine sulfate reducer oxidizing organic carbon completely to carbon dioxide  ap. 1038-1055.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) belonging to the metabolically versatile Desulfobacteriaceae are abundant in marine sediments and contribute to the global carbon cycle by complete oxidation of organic compounds. Desulfobacterium autotrophicum HRM2 is the first member of this ecophysiologically important group with a now available genome sequence. With 5.6 megabasepairs (Mbp) the genome of Db. autotrophicum HRM2 is about 2 Mbp larger than the sequenced genomes of other sulfate reducers (SRB). A high number of genome plasticity elements (> 100 transposon-related genes), several regions of GC discontinuity and a high number of repetitive elements (132 paralogous genes Mbp⁻¹) point to a different genome evolution when comparing with Desulfovibrio spp. The metabolic versatility of Db. autotrophicum HRM2 is reflected in the presence of genes for the degradation of a variety of organic compounds including long-chain fatty acids and for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which enables the organism to completely oxidize acetyl-CoA to CO₂ but also to grow chemolithoautotrophically. The presence of more than 250 proteins of the sensory/regulatory protein families should enable Db. autotrophicum HRM2 to efficiently adapt to changing environmental conditions. Genes encoding periplasmic or cytoplasmic hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases have been detected as well as genes for the transmembrane TpII-c₃, Hme and Rnf complexes. Genes for subunits A, B, C and D as well as for the proposed novel subunits L and F of the heterodisulfide reductases are present. This enzyme is involved in energy conservation in methanoarchaea and it is speculated that it exhibits a similar function in the process of dissimilatory sulfate reduction in Db. autotrophicum HRM2.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDesulfobacterium autotrophicum 3aDesulfovibrio 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acids 3agenes 3amarine sediments 3aoxidation 3aregulatory proteins 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates 2aAcetyl Coenzyme Axmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDeltaproteobacteriaxgenetics 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aInterspersed Repetitive Sequences 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrganic Chemicalsxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aSulfatesxmetabolism1 aLiesegang, Heiko1 aRabus, Ralf1 aDecker, Iwona1 aAmann, Judith1 aAndres, Sönke1 aHenne, Anke1 aFricke, Wolfgang Florian1 aMartinez-Arias, Rosa1 aBartels, Daniela1 aGoesmann, Alexander1 aKrause, Lutz1 aPühler, A.1 aKlenk, Hans-Peter1 aRichter, Michael1 aSchüler, Margarete1 aGlöckner, Frank Oliver1 aMeyerdierks, Anke1 aGottschalk, Gerhard1 aAmann, Rudolf0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2009 May, v. 11, no. 5 p.1038-1055dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01825.x 7aarticle03675naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008600187300001600273500002400289520186600313650001502179650001002194650001202204650002202216650001802238650001202256650002402268650002302292650001002315650002102325650001002346650002002356650002002376650001502396650001202411650001102423650001002434650001102444650001202455650002602467650004702493650001202540650003002552650003602582650002102618650002402639650001102663650000902674650003202683700001602715700002502731700002102756700001702777700001902794700001502813773013302828852000902961856005502970655001203025IND4444899420221119091249.0101105e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444489942DNAL7 a204870942pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00979.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalde, M.K.10aORIGINAL ARTICLE: Fish bones - a highly available calcium source for growing pigs  ap. e66-e76.  aIncludes references  aIn general, there is a lack of scientific documentation of nutritional value of marine by‐products. The bone fraction from fish has been regarded as waste. Due to the high mineral content of fish bones, this material can be well suitable as a natural calcium source. In the present study, apparent calcium absorption of different fish bone sources was tested using growing pigs. The experimental diets consisted of boiled salmon frames, or salmon, saithe or cod bones treated with enzymes. Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) was used as control. The experimental diets were formulated to contain 0.7% total calcium of which the added calcium source to be tested contributed about 71% (study 1) and 86% (study 2). Except for the calcium and phosphorus sources, the animals received similar basal diets. Apparent calcium digestibility coefficient was calculated using yttrium as indicator (both studies) and was based on complete collection of faeces and urine (study 2). The experimental design was parallel and cross‐over in study 1 and study 2, respectively. In study 1, piglets getting salmon bone treated with enzymes had significantly higher calcium absorption than piglets getting boiled fish bone or calcium carbonate. Therefore, in the second study only enzymatically treated fish bones were included. The higher calcium absorption from enzymatically treated salmon bone was also found in study 2, but this time not significant. Calcium from boiled salmon bones in study I, and from enzymatically treated saithe and cod bones in study II were absorbed as well as the calcium carbonate control. The results indicate that fish bones may be a useful and well absorbed calcium source. Due to the high mineral content of the bone fraction, salmon bones can be well suitable as a natural calcium and phosphorus source in, for example, food, feed or as supplement. 3aabsorption 3abones 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3adigestibility 3aenzymes 3aexperimental design 3aexperimental diets 3afeces 3afeed supplements 3afoods 3amineral content 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3apiglets 3asalmon 3aurine 3awastes 3ayttrium 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aCalciumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aFishes 2aMale 2aSwinexgrowth & development1 aGraff, I.E.1 aSiljander‐Rasi, H.1 aVenäläinen, E.1 aJulshamn, K.1 aPedersen, J.I.1 aValaja, J.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2010 Oct., v. 94, no. 5 p.e66-e76dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00979.x 7aarticle02717naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245006200186300001600248500002400264500001500288520108900303650001201392650001701404650001701421650001501438650001201453650001201465650001201477650001201489650001901501650001901520650002301539650002001562650001201582650003801594650000901632650001101641650002901652650004701681650005501728650002801783650003201811650005501843653001101898700002001909700001501929700001301944700001401957773011601971852000902087856005502096655001202151IND4437291920221119091356.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443729192DNAL7 a190324282pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01289.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSontas, BH10aUterine Leiomyoma in a Spayed Poodle Bitch: A Case Report  ap. 550-554.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA 16-year-old, spayed, female poodle dog was presented for evaluation of tenesmus, with the ability to attract male dogs and a willingness to mate. The dog had undergone an ovariohysterectomy when it was 7 years old. Haematological and serum biochemistry analyses demonstrated leucocytosis and a mild uraemia. A vaginal smear was predominantly made up of superficial cells, accounting for at least 80% of the cells. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous multicystic mass at the caudal abdomen and two masses with anechoic areas adjacent to the caudal pole of each kidney. A midline exploratory laparotomy identified a uterine mass and residual ovaries that were surgically excised. Histopathological examination of the mass demonstrated that it was a leiomyoma. The left ovary had a cystic structure and the right ovary had a papillary cystic adenoma. Seven months after the surgery, the owner reported that the dog was clinically normal. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a uterine leiomyoma after an incomplete ovariohysterectomy in the dog. 3aabdomen 3abiochemistry 3acase studies 3alaparotomy 3aspaying 3aadenoma 3abitches 3akidneys 3aanimal ovaries 3ahistopathology 3aPoodle (dog breed) 3aultrasonography 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisxsurgery. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aHysterectomyxveterinary 2aLeiomyomaxdiagnosisxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aOvarian Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aOvariectomyxveterinary 2aUltrasonographyxveterinary 2aUterine Neoplasmsxdiagnosisxsurgeryxveterinary. 0aPoodle1 aÖzyogurtcu, H.1 aTurna, Ö.1 aArun, S.1 aEkici, H.0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2010 June, v. 45, no. 3 p.550-554dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01289.x 7aarticle03723naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011900170300001400289520207600303650002602379650001602405650002102421650002302442650001302465650001202478650001102490650001402501650003902515650001502554650001002569650001902579650001202598650001202610650001402622650001202636650001402648650001102662650001302673650000702686650003002693650001302723650001402736650001902750650002002769650001302789650001202802650001602814651001202830700001902842700002202861700002102883773016902904856005103073852000903124655001203133IND60629616020221119091358.0190201e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062961602DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAly, Mohamed A.10aCharacterization of Biofilm Formation by Cronobacter spp. Isolates of Different Food Origin under Model Conditions  ap. 65-77.  aCronobacter spp. are opportunistic human pathogens that cause serious diseases in neonates and immunocompromised people. Owing to their biofilm formation on various surfaces, both their detection and their removal from production plants constitute a major challenge. In this study, food samples were randomly collected in Austria and examined for the presence of Cronobacter spp. Presumptive isolates were identified by a polyphasic approach. Five percent of the samples were positive for C. sakazakii and 2.4% for C. dublinensis. Individual growth of the isolates was characterized based on lag time, growth rate, and generation time. During an incubation period of 6 to 72 h, biofilm formation of 11 selected isolates was quantified under model conditions by a crystal violet staining assay with 96-well plates with different carbon sources (lactose, glucose, maltose, sucrose, and sodium acetate) and NaCl levels and under variable temperature and pH conditions. Biofilm formation was more pronounced at lactose concentrations between 0.25 and 3% compared with 5% lactose, which lead to thinner layers. C. sakazakii isolate C7, isolated from infant milk powder, was the strongest biofilm producer at 10 mM Mg2+ and 5 mM Mn2+, 0.5% sodium acetate, at pH levels between 7 and 9 at 37°C for 24 h. C. sakazakii strain C6 isolated from a plant air filter was identified as a moderate biofilm former and C. sakazakii strain DSM 4485, a clinical isolate, as a weak biofilm former. Based on PCR detection, genes bcsA, bcsB, and bcsG encoding for cellulose could be identified as markers for biofilm formation. Isolates carrying bcsA and bcsB showed significantly stronger biofilm formation than isolates without these genes (P < 0.05), in strong correlation with the results obtained in the crystal violet assay. Further investigations using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that extracellular polymeric substances and glycocalyx secretions were the dominating components of the biofilms and that the viable fraction of bacteria in the biofilm decreased over time. 3aCronobacter sakazakii 3aair filters 3aanimal pathogens 3aat-risk population 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3acellulose 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adried milk 3agenes 3agentian violet 3aglucose 3alactose 3amagnesium 3amaltose 3amanganese 3amodels 3aneonates 3apH 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apolymers 3asecretion 3asodium acetate 3asodium chloride 3astaining 3asucrose 3atemperature 3aAustria1 aReimhult, Erik1 aKneifel, Wolfgang1 aDomig, Konrad J.0 tJournal of food protection.g2019 Jan., v. 82, no. 1 p.65-77dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-036  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245018700178300001400365500001500379520153700394650000801931650002601939650001801965650002201983650001202005650000802017650001102025650001302036650001202049650002002061650001102081650001302092650001502105650001002120650001602130650001802146650002802164650002002192650001602212650001002228650002602238650002302264650001102287650000902298650004002307650002402347651001202371653003202383653001502415653003202430700001902462700001502481700001402496700002002510773018802530852000902718856006202727930003302789945002502822946001302847655001202860IND4381951020221119091239.0060714e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438195102DNAL7 a163448442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Design: A retrospective school-based cohort follow-up study. Subjects: A total of 1520 men born between 1927 and 1956 with serial height and weight measurements from the age of 9 to 18, followed up in adulthood at a mean age of 63 years. Measurements: Prepubertal (child) BMI; age at peak height velocity (APHV); adult leg length, waist and hip circumference (self-reported), and height and weight (measured). Results: Boys with a higher childhood BMI tended to have an earlier puberty (per s.d. increase in child BMI: -0.31 years, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.23 to -0.39, P<0.001). Childhood BMI correlated strongly and positively with adult adiposity, as measured by BMI (1.24 kg/m2, 95% CI: 1.04-1.45, P<0.001), waist (1.94 cm, 95% CI: 1.50-2.37, P<0.001) and hip (1.91 cm, 95% CI: 1.55-2.28, P<0.001). It correlated inversely with leg length (-0.40 cm, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.12, P=0.005), but not significantly with height or trunk length. Boys with a later puberty tended to be taller (per s.d. increase in APHV: 0.57 cm, 95% CI: 0.17-0.97, P=0.006) and less adipose as adults (-0.55 kg/m2, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.77, P<0.001). Conclusion: The long-term consequences of childhood obesity into adulthood are well known, but the potential impact on early pubertal maturation is less well appreciated. The factors that contribute to the onset and persistence of childhood obesity require more public health focus. 3amen 3along term experiments 3apublic health 3ahuman development 3apuberty 3aage 3aheight 3achildren 3aobesity 3abody mass index 3aadults 3abody fat 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAge Factors 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Heightxphysiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aChild 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aGrowthxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aObesityxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aPubertyxphysiology 3aEngland 0aanthropometric measurements 0aleg length 0aage at peak height velocity1 aBen-Shlomo, Y.1 aCole, T.J.1 aHolly, J.1 aDavey Smith, G.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2006 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.14-22x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/index.html3electronic resource  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/08  aOther US 7aarticle01948naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245011600172300001600288500002400304520082300328650002301151650001501174650001201189650001101201650001001212650001401222650002301236650001301259650001801272650002301290650001301313700002101326700002501347700002801372773010501400852000901505856004801514655001201562IND4440420420221119091053.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444042042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-009-9304-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazari, Rajab Mohammad10aApplication of synthetic hormone LHRH-A₂ on the artificial propagation of Persian sturgeon Acipenser persicus  ap. 837-841.  aIncludes references  aFor studying the effect of LHRH-A₂ hormone on the induction of final maturation and ovulation of Persian sturgeon, 71 matured females and 20 matured males were used. Five groups of breeders were injected with sturgeon pituitary gland hormone (50 mg per fish) and LHRH-A₂ in dosages of 3.5, 7, 8 and 10 μg kg⁻¹ for females and 3 and 5 μg kg⁻¹ for males. Results showed that LHRH-A₂ successfully induced final maturation and ovulation in females, and there was no significant difference between five groups of breeders in ovulation proportion, fertilization rate, survival rate of incubation, survival of yolk-sac absorption period and active feeding period of larvae. It can be concluded that the LHRH-A₂ is a proper alternative for pituitary gland hormone in artificial propagation of Persian sturgeon. 3aAcipenser persicus 3aabsorption 3afemales 3alarvae 3amales 3aovulation 3apituitary hormones 3asturgeon 3asurvival rate 3asynthetic hormones 3ayolk sac1 aModanloo, Maryam1 aGhomi, Mohammad Reza1 aOvissipor, Mahmoud Reza0 tAquaculture international.g2010 Aug., v. 18, no. 5 p.837-841dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-61207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-009-9304-0 7aarticle02247naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002300129245011100152300001600263520120300279650001801482650002801500650001801528650002501546650002201571650002501593650002201618700001401640700001401654700002301668700001301691700002001704700002001724773007401744852000901818939003301827946001301860655001201873IND9103802620221119091218.0910930e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910380262DNAL7 a166682462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelen, F.A. van.10aHeterogeneity and cell type-specific localization of a cell wall glycoprotein from carrot suspension cells  ap. 705-712.  aEP1, an extracellular protein from carrot (Daucus carota) cell suspensions, has been partially characterized by means of an antiserum and a cDNA clone. in both embryo and suspension cultures different molecular mass EP1 proteins were detected, some of which (31, 32, 52, and 54 kilodaltons) were bound to the cell wall and released into the medium, whereas others (49, 60, and 62 kilodaltons) were more firmly bound to the cell wall and could be extracted with a salt solution. immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products revealed a single primary translation product of 45 kilodaltons, suggesting that EP1 heterogeneity is due to differential posttranslational modification. In seedlings organ-specific modification of EP1 proteins was observed, a phenomenon which did not persist in suspension cultures initiated from different seedling organs. In culture EP1 proteins were only found to be associated with vacuolated, nonembryogenic cells, and on these cells they were localized in loosely attached, pectin-containing cell wall material. Purified 52154 kilodaltons EP1 proteins did not alleviate the inhibitory effect of the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin on somatic embryogenesis. 3aDaucus carota 3acell suspension culture 3aglycoproteins 3achemical composition 3aprotein synthesis 3acell wall components 3aculture filtrates1 aSterk, P.1 aBooij, H.1 aCordewener, J.H.G.1 aRook, W.1 aKammen, A. van.1 aVries, S.C. de.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 July, v. 96, no. 3 p.705-712x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01438naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245008400175300001200259500002400271520043600295650002300731650002000754650002600774650001400800650001200814650001300826650001400839650002200853650001100875700002100886773012700907852000901034856005701043655001201100IND4461148620221119091302.0110805e199405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446114862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1994.tb01762.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, Robert M.10aSpore germination and isozyme patterns in the apomictic fern Cyrtomium falcatum  ap. 1-8.  aIncludes references  aProgeny from a plant of the apomictic species Cyrtomium falcatum were examined by protein electrophoresis.

This study compared the social and ecological values of four land use types (small-scale woodlot [SSW], boundary tree and shrub planting [BTP], homestead tree and shrub growing [HTG] and cereal farming [CF]) by a criteria-based scoring approach using a bao game. The impacts of local wealth status and proximity to a forest on the value the community renders to the land use types were also assessed. The value comparison, assessed by relative scoring, was accompanied by farmer's explanations to reveal the existing local knowledge about land use values. It was found that HTG ≥ SSW > BTP > CF for both social and ecological values. Though this trend applies for the medium and rich households, the poor ones chose SSW as the most valuable. With increasing distance from a forest, the social and ecological values of land uses increased. The accompanying scoring justifications indicated the existence of in-depth ecological knowledge, which conform to contemporary scientific reports. Generally, this study showed that social and ecological values, besides financial values, strongly influence farmer's decision in implementing various practices related to the land use types. Thus, such values are worth considering for a holistic understanding of the diverse benefits of land uses. Finally, the strong preference for tree and shrub-based land use types is a good opportunity for enhancing tree and shrub growing to minimize the major environmental problems (e.g., soil degradation, wood shortage and deforestation) in the central highlands of Ethiopia. 3adeforestation 3adeveloping countries 3afarmers 3aforests 3ahighlands 3ahouseholds 3aland use 3aland values 3aplanting 3ashrubs 3asoil degradation 3atrees 3awood 2aEcology 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 3aEthiopia 0aEthiopia1 aHager, Herbert0 tEnvironmental management.g2011 May, v. 47, no. 5 p.969-982dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-011-9657-9 7aarticle02120naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001200129245010300141300001400244520099700258650001601255650002901271650001101300650001701311650002901328650001701357650001101374650001401385650002801399650002301427650002501450650001701475650001601492650001801508653002401526700001401550773006801564852000901632930003301641945001301674946001101687655001201698IND2332664320221119091506.0030520e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233266432DNAL7 a220619802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, M.10aAntioxidant and antimicrobial effects of four garlic-derived organosulfur compounds in ground beef  ap. 23-28.  aThe antioxidant and antimicrobial protection of diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), s-ethyl cysteine (SEC), n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in ground beef against discoloration, lipid oxidation and microbial contamination were studied. The exogenous addition of these garlic-derived organosulfur compounds significantly delayed both oxymyoglobin and lipid oxidations (P < 0.05). The antioxidant protection from these organosulfur compounds was dose-dependent (P < 0.05), and showed significantly greater antioxidant activity than alpha-tocopherol (P < 0.05). The presence of DAS and DADS in ground beef significantly reduced total aerobes and inhibited the growth of five inoculated pathogenic bacteria, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni (P < 0.05).

The fatty esters were prepared by reacting the starch with vinyl laurate or vinyl stearate in the presence of basic catalysts (Na₂HPO₄, K₂CO₃, and Na acetate) in DMSO at 110°C. The yellowish products were characterized by ¹H-, ¹³C-NMR and FT-IR. The DS of the products is a function of the carbon number of the fatty acid chain, vinyl ester to starch ratio and the type of catalyst. When performing the reactions using Na₂HPO₄ as the catalyst, the DS for the starch laurate compounds is higher than for the corresponding starch stearates. For low vinyl ester to starch ratios, an increase in the vinyl ester concentration leads to higher product DS values. At higher ratios, the DS decreases, presumably due to a reduction of the polarity of the reaction medium. K₂CO₃ and Na acetate are superior catalysts with respect to activity compared to Na₂HPO₄ and products with DS values close to 3 were obtained. 3aacetates 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acorn starch 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3asodium 3astarch 3astearic acid1 aSugih, Asaf K.1 aManurung, Robert1 aPicchioni, Francesco1 aJanssen, Leon P.B.M.1 aHeeres, Hero J.0 tStärke =.g2008 Dec., v. 60, no. 12 p.667-675dWiley-VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.200800025 7aarticle03223naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245024500167300001400412500002400426520187500450650002102325650001902346650001602365650001902381650001002400650000902410650002202419650002202441650001402463650002102477650002702498650001502525700001902540700001302559700003202572700001702604773009502621852000902716856008802725655001202813IND4414120420221119091202.0081226s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441412042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavén, Martin10aSerial mixed-mode cation- and anion-exchange solid-phase extraction for separation of basic, neutral and acidic pharmaceuticals in wastewater and analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry  ap. 49-62.  aIncludes references  aA novel solid-phase extraction (SPE) method is presented whereby 15 basic, neutral and acidic pharmaceuticals in wastewater were simultaneously extracted and subsequently separated into different fractions. This was achieved using mixed-mode cation- and anion-exchange SPE (Oasis MCX and MAX) in series. Analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/QTOF-MS). A fast separation was achieved, with all compounds eluting within 6min, narrow chromatographic peaks, with a peak base width of 6s on average, and a high mass accuracy of quantified wastewater sample ions, with average mass errors in absolute value of 0.7mDa or 2.7ppm. The recovery of the SPE method in the analysis of sewage treatment plant (STP) influent and effluent wastewater was on average 80% and the ion suppression 30%. For less demanding samples Oasis MCX used alone may be an alternative method, although for STP influent waters containing high loads of organic compounds the clean-up achieved using only Oasis MCX was insufficient, leading to unreliable quantitation. Furthermore, serial SPE separation according to molecular charge added an additional degree of analyte confirmation. For quantitation, an approach combining external standard calibration curves, isotopically labelled surrogate standards and single-point standard addition was used. The applicability of the method was demonstrated in the analysis of influent and effluent wastewater from an STP, using small sample volumes (25-50mL). The effluent wastewater had been subjected to three different treatments; activated sludge, activated sludge followed by ozonation, and a membrane bioreactor (MBR). Ozone treatment proved superior in removal of the analysed pharmaceuticals, while the MBR provided higher removal efficiencies than the activated sludge process. 3aactivated sludge 3aanion exchange 3abioreactors 3achromatography 3adrugs 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3aorganic compounds 3aozonation 3asewage treatment 3asolid phase extraction 3awastewater1 aAlsberg, Tomas1 aYu, Yong1 aAdolfsson-Erici, Margaretha1 aSun, Hongwen0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Jan. 2, v. 1216, no. 1 p.49-62dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.11.0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03164naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245019000170300001600360500002400376500001500400520191400415650002002329650002102349650003502370650001302405650001602418650001502434650004102449653004102490700002502531700002302556700002902579773009702608852000902705856008802714655001202802IND4414119520221119091124.0081226s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441411952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.11.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontana, Ariel R.10aSimple approach based on ultrasound-assisted emulsification-microextraction for determination of polibrominated flame retardants in water samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 147-153.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA simple, efficient, innovative and environmentally friendly analytical technique was successfully applied for the first time for the extraction and preconcentration of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) from water samples. The PBDEs selected for this work were those most commonly found in the literature in natural water samples: 2,2',4,4'-tetraBDE (BDE-47), 2,2',4,4,5-pentaBDE (BDE-99), 2,2',4,4,6-pentaBDE (BDE-100) and 2,2,4,4',5,5'-hexaBDE (BDE-153). The extracted PBDEs were separated and determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The extraction/preconcentration technique is based on ultrasound-assisted emulsification-microextraction (USAEME) of a water-immiscible solvent in an aqueous medium. Several variables including, solvent type, extraction time, extraction temperature and matrix modifiers were studied and optimized over the relative response the target analytes. Chloroform was used as extraction solvent in the USAEME technique. Under optimum conditions, the target analytes were quantitatively extracted achieving enrichment factors (EF) higher than 319. The detection limits (LODs) of the analytes for the preconcentration of 10mL sample volume were within the range 1-2pgmL⁻¹. The relative standard deviations (RSD) for five replicates at 10pgmL⁻¹ concentration level were <10.3%. The calibration graphs were linear within the concentration range of 5-5000pgmL⁻¹ for BDE-47 and BDE-100; and 5-10,000pgmL⁻¹ for BDE-99 and BDE-153, respectively. The coefficients of estimation were >=0.9985. Validation of the methodology was performed by standard addition method at two concentration levels (10 and 50pgmL⁻¹). Recovery values were >=96%, which showed a successful robustness of the analytical methodology for determination of picogram per milliliter of PBDEs in water samples. Significant quantities of PBDEs were not found in the analyzed samples. 3adetection limit 3aflame retardants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3asolvents 3atemperature 3achloroform 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0agas-chromatography-mass spectrometry1 aWuilloud, Rodolfo G.1 aMartínez, Luis D.1 aAltamirano, Jorgelina C.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Jan. 2, v. 1216, no. 1 p.147-153dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.11.0343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01894naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245012700169300001600296500002400312520088300336650002401219650002801243650002301271650001501294650001601309650001901325700002001344700002201364773009701386852000901483856008801492655001201580IND4414119320221119091216.0081226s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441411932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.11.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldaeus, Fredrik10aPrediction of retention times and peak widths in temperature-programmed gas chromatography using the finite element method  ap. 134-139.  aIncludes references  aOptimization of separations in gas chromatography is often a time-consuming task. However, computer simulations of chromatographic experiments may greatly reduce the time required. In this study, the finite element method was used to predict the retention times and peak widths of three analytes eluting from each of four columns during chromatographic separations with two temperature programs. The data acquired were displayed in predicted chromatograms that were then compared to experimentally acquired chromatograms. The differences between the predicted and measured retention times were typically less than 0.1%, although the experimental peak widths were typically 10% larger than expected from the idealized calculations. Input data for the retention and peak dispersion calculations were obtained from isothermal experiments, and converted to thermodynamic parameters. 3acomputer simulation 3afinite element analysis 3agas chromatography 3aprediction 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aThewalim, Yasar1 aColmsjö, Anders.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 Jan. 2, v. 1216, no. 1 p.134-139dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.11.0383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02151naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245013600166300001600302520105000318650002301368650002201391650001001413650001301423650001101436650001101447650001001458650001201468650001201480650001201492650001301504651001801517651001101535700002301546700001401569773012701583856004601710852000901756655001201765IND60590410620221119091143.0180313e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059041062DNAL7 a10.22621/cfn.v119i4.1772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallory, Mark L.10aBreeding and Non-Breeding Range of Canada, Branta canadensis, and Cackling Geese, Branta hutchinsii, in the Eastern Canadian Arctic  ap. 483-489.  aThe accepted breeding distribution of Canada Geese from the Atlantic Population (Branta canadensis interior) in the eastern  Canadian Arctic is currently confined to northern Québec and the south coast of Baffin Island.

Effectiveness factors near 1 were estimated.CONCLUSION: Immobilization induced increased production of reuterin in Lactobacillus reuteri and is a feasible option for increasing process productivity. 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3abacteriocins 3abiomass 3acalcium alginate 3aimmobilized cells 3amass transfer1 aHernandez-Mendoza, Adrian1 aRobles, Victor J.1 aMendoza-Garcia, Patricia G.1 aEspinosa-de-los-Monteros, José Joel1 aGarcia, Hugo S.0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.100-105dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.20123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03973naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245014200148300001800290520204800308650001002356650001202366650001902378650001202397650002302409650001202432650002802444650001602472650002102488650001302509650001602522650001402538650001802552650001202570650002802582650002402610650003202634650003802666650001102704650003202715650002002747650004002767650002602807650002002833650002602853650003402879650004302913650004802956650003503004650003803039650002203077650003503099653000903134653001103143700001403154700001603168773008403184852000903268939003303277946001303310655001203323IND9103902220221119091101.0911008e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390222DNAL7 a20663182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatamoros, I.A.10aEffects of exogenous insulin and body condition on metabolic hormones and gonadotropin-induced follicular development in prepuberal gilts  ap. 2081-2091.  aTo determine influences of insulin and body condition on follicular growth, prepuberal gilts (n = 16) treated with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG) were used in a 2 X 2 factorial experiment with main effects of insulin (0 or .4 IU/kg every 12 h beginning at 1800 on the day before PMSG) and backfat depth (moderate, 25 +/-.8; high, 32 +/-.7 mm; P < .0001). Body weights were similar. Blood sampling was at 6-h intervals for analyses of LH, FSH, growth hormone (GH), glucagon, cortisol, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), testosterone, estradiol-17 beta, and progesterone. Ovaries were removed 75 h after PMSG treatment, and visible small (less than or equal to 3mm), medium (4 to 6 mm), large (greater than or equal to 7 mm), and macroscopically atretic follicles were counted. Administration of insulin increased IGF-I in fluid of medium follicles (108.8 vs 60.7 ng/ml; SEM = 13.3; P < .05). Neither insulin nor fatness affected hCG binding by granulosa cells (12.5 +/- 1.6 ng/10(6) cells) or numbers of large (16.7 +/- 2.6) and medium (10.4 +/- 2.3) follicles. However, insulin increased the number of small follicles (58.9 vs 29.9; SEM = 9.7; P < .05) and reduced the number of atretic follicles (3.8 vs 11.3; SEM = 1.1; P < .05). The predominant effect of insulin on reducing number of atretic follicles was in the small size class (.6 vs 6.9; SEM = .6, P < .01). Follicular fluid estradiol and progesterone were not affected by treatments; however, testosterone concentrations in large follicles were lower in gilts with higher backfat (32.5 vs 59.9 ng/ml; SEM = 4.0; P < .05). Systemic LH, FSH, glucagon, cortisol, PUN, NEFA, estradiol and testosterone were not affected by insulin or level of feeding. However, GH was lower in gilts that had higher backfat (overall average of 3.2 vs 2.8 ng/ml; SEM = .1; P < .05). Insulin reduced atresia and altered intrafollicular IGF-I independently of body condition and without sustained effects on other hormones. 3agilts 3ainsulin 3abody condition 3abackfat 3aGraafian follicles 3aglucose 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3ametabolites 3afollicular fluid 3asteroids 3ablood serum 3aestradiol 3afat thickness 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aEstradiolxanalysisxblood. 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aFollicular Fluidxchemistry 2aGlucagonxblood 2aGonadotropinsxbloodxpharmacology. 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aHormonesxblood 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInsulinxbloodxpharmacology. 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aProgesteronexanalysisxblood. 2aReceptors, Gonadotropinxanalysis 2aSwinexphysiology 2aTestosteronexanalysisxblood. 0asize 0agrowth1 aCox, N.M.1 aMoore, A.B.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 May, v. 69, no. 5 p.2081-2091x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03743naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219072001700236100001200253245008600265300001600351520147600367650001301843650001901856650002001875650001501895650000901910650001201919650001601931650001701947650002201964650002301986650001802009650002702027650002002054650001602074650001902090650000702109650002302116650001002139650001002149650001202159650001002171650001402181650002402195650003202219650002402251650002102275650002402296650001802320650001602338650001302354650002302367650001802390650001602408650001402424650001702438650001502455650002102470650001702491650002402508650004402532651001002576653001502586700001702601700001602618700001802634773007002652852000902722856008902731930003302820945002502853946001102878655001202889IND4362950720221119091129.0040622e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436295072DNAL7 a220615242pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHoz, L.10aDevelopment of an n-3 fatty acid and α-tocopherol enriched dry fermented sausage  ap. 485-495.  aFive batches of "salchichon", which is a dry fermented Spanish sausage, were manufactured using backfat and meat enriched in polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids and α-tocopherol. Raw materials were obtained from animals fed on diets of the same ingredients with the exception of the oil source [sunflower oil (batch control, C), linseed oil (L and LE), 1/1 (w/w) linseed and olive oil (LO and LOE)] and α-tocopherol quantity [20 mg/kg diet of α-tocopherol (C, L and LO) or 200 mg/kg diet of α-tocopherol (LOE and LE)]. A final product with a healthier polyunsaturated fatty acid n-6:n-3 ratio (< 4) was obtained from all linseed oil-enriched batches as compared with the control (12). The batches of sausages manufactured with backfat and meat from animals fed on diets enriched in α-tocopherol and linseed, or linseed and olive oil with or without α-tocopherol supplementation show a higher lipid oxidative stability than those of diets enriched in linseed oil without α-tocopherol supplementation. Sausages of dietary treatment C, LE, LO and LOE did not show differences in water, protein, fat and ash contents, aw, pH, texture profile analysis and sensory features (odour, colour, texture, juiciness and taste quality). Sausages manufactured with material from animals fed on linseed oil-enriched diets and no added α-tocopherol (L) showed an unfavourable rancidity degree detected by both 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) index and sensory panel. 3asausages 3aenriched foods 3afermented foods 3adried meat 3apork 3abackfat 3aingredients 3afermentation 3achemical analysis 3adry matter content 3alipid content 3afatty acid composition 3aprotein content 3aash content 3awater activity 3apH 3asensory evaluation 3aodors 3acolor 3atexture 3ataste 3ajuiciness 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aexperimental design 3aswine feeding 3aLarge White 3acrossing 3aexperimental diets 3asunflower oil 3alinseed oil 3aolive oil 3ameat quality 3ameat aging 3avacuum packaging 3astorage time 3aoxidative stability 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aSpain 0aSalchichon1 aD'Arrigo, M.1 aCambero, I.1 aOrdonez, J.A.0 tMeat science.g2004 July, v. 67, no. 3 p.485-495x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/07/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02628naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245010700144300001800251500001500269520115100284650001901435650002201454650001401476650001201490650001601502650001801518650001201536650000901548650001801557650003101575650001201606650001101618650002401629650002601653650002101679650002501700650001401725650001201739650001401751650003401765650003201799650002201831650000901853653001801862653002101880700001801901700001601919773008401935852000902019939003302028946001302061655001202074IND9103901920221119091003.0911007e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390192DNAL7 a20663152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuesnet, M.10aRegulation of adipose tissue metabolism during pregnancy and lactation in the ewe: the role of insulin  ap. 2057-2065.  a2019-12-04  aThis study was conducted to examine the effect of insulin on lipid metabolism of adipocytes during pregnancy and lactation in ewes. During the first 3 mo of pregnancy, metabolism of adipocytes from omental adipose tissue was characterized by a high rate of de novo lipogenesis (90 to 125 nmol of acetate incorporated into lipids.2 h(-1).10(6) cells (-1)) and a 38% reduction in response to beta-lipolytic stimulus (isoproterenol 10(-6) M). Simultaneously, there was a rise in the number of high-affinity insulin receptors (Kd = .2 nM), and insulin binding characteristics showed a decrease in the negative cooperativity phenomenon. Moreover, lipogenesis stimulated by insulin (1 mU/ml) increased in comparison with observations in nonpregnant ewes. The last third of pregnancy and early lactation were characterized by a marked fall in lipogenesis and a simultaneous increase in isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. During lactation, the number of total insulin receptors was decreased by 62% and insulin stimulation of lipogenesis became inefficient. Results suggest that insulin plays a direct role in adipose tissue metabolism during pregnancy. 3aadipose tissue 3ahormone receptors 3apregnancy 3aomentum 3alipogenesis 3abinding sites 3ainsulin 3aewes 3aabdominal fat 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aInsulinxphysiology 2aLactationxmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLipidsxbiosynthesis 2aLipolysis 2aOmentum 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy, Animalxmetabolism 2aReceptor, Insulinxanalysis 2aSheepxmetabolism 2aSkin 0aewe lactation 0alipid metabolism1 aMassoud, M.J.1 aDemarne, Y.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 May, v. 69, no. 5 p.2057-2065x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01814naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002200132245004800154300001600202520058400218650002000802650001400822650001900836650001500855650000900870650003100879650001000910650002000920650001900940650001400959650003200973650002001005650001901025650001101044650001101055650002001066650002201086650003001108651001201138653002101150653001201171700001501183773008401198852000901282939003301291945000801324655001201332991588181960742620221119091324.0790910e197812  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794852612DNAL7 a7310312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobson, Alison M.10aIntroducing dietetics into general practice  ap. 467-471.  aA dietetic clinic, initially monthly, now weekly, is held in a general medical practice with four partners.

Gaseous emissions such as CO₂, CO and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured under oxidative conditions at 600°C in a fixed-bed reactor. Kinetic parameters were obtained and compared for the different mixtures of OMWW and sawdust. The absorption of the organic content of OMWW on sawdust improves the decomposition of cellulosic compounds at low temperatures in both atmospheres. Compared to sawdust, absorption of the organic content of OMWW on sawdust favours a combustion process with lower molar ratio of CO/CO₂ in the exhaust. Combustion of an impregnated sawdust containing 40wt.% of the organic content of the OMWW generates the same amount of gas in the exhaust as sawdust. OMWW/sawdust blends may therefore be a promising biofuel with low environmental impacts. 3aabsorbents 3aenvironmental impact 3agases 3aabsorption 3aindustry 3aolive oil 3asawdust 3avolatile organic compounds 3apollutants 3acombustion 3aemissions 3achemical oxygen demand 3atemperature 3awastewater 2aAbsorption 2aHot Temperature 2aIndustrial Wastexprevention & control 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aUltrafiltrationxmethods 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxisolation & purification 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purification 2aWoodxchemistry 0aatmosphere1 aJeguirim, Mejdi1 aTrouvé, Gwenaëlle1 aFavre-Reguillon, Alain1 aLe Buzit, Gérard0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Sept., v. 101, no. 18 p.6962-6971dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.04.017 7aarticle03132naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100003600128245008100164300001800245520175300263650001902016650001802035650001602053650001402069650001102083650000902094650000902103650001402112650001602126650001602142650001602158650001202174650002502186650001902211650002302230650002802253650001602281650001302297650001002310650003302320650002602353650001302379650002302392653001902415653001402434700001502448773008402463852000902547939003302556946001302589655001202602IND9103901120221119091415.0911007e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390112DNAL7 a20663092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDove, Robertc(College teacher)10aEffect of trace minerals on the stability of vitamin E in swine grower diets  ap. 1994-2000.  aThe stability of alpha-tocopheryl acetate and inherent tocopherols in swine grower diets containing high levels of trace minerals was studied in a 12-wk experiment. Corn-soybean meal diets with either 0 or 1% crude soybean oil and without trace minerals added (NOTM) were supplemented with a standard trace mineral mix (TM), TM + 250 ppm of Cu, TM + 1,000 ppm of Fe, TM + 1,000 ppm of Zn, or TM + 100 ppm of Mn. Alpha-tocopheryl acetate decreased linearly (P < .0001) during 12 wk of storage in diets containing NOTM, TM, Zn, or Mn at a rate of .015 mg/d. Addition of Fe (P < .005) or Cu (P < .05) increased the rate of alpha-tocopheryl acetate loss. The addition of soybean oil had no effect (P > .1) on the rate of alpha-tocopheryl acetate loss. The alpha-tocopherol levels of the NOTM diet decreased (P < .01) by approximately 50% during the 12-wk storage period. Addition of TM alone in diets that did not contain soybean oil had no effect (P > .1) on the rate of alpha-tocopherol loss. The addition of Cu, Fe, Zn, or Mn (P < .05) to diets that did not contain soybean oil increased the rate of alpha-tocopherol loss in comparison with NOTM and TM diets. Addition of Cu decreased alpha-tocopherol below 10% of initial levels in approximately 10 d. The addition of soybean oil to the diets containing TM, Fe, Zn (P < .005), or Mn (P < .05) further increased the rate of alpha-tocopherol loss. Within the diets containing soybean oil, all trace mineral additions increased (P < .01) the rate of loss of alpha-tocopherol loss. The loss of natural gamma-tocopherol was similar to that of alpha-tocopherol. The results indicate that the rate of oxidation of natural tocopherols is increased in diets containing increased levels of Cu, Fe, Zn, or Mn. 3afeed additives 3aswine feeding 3atocopherols 3aoxidation 3acopper 3airon 3azinc 3amanganese 3asoybean oil 3adietary fat 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCopperxpharmacology 2aDrug Stability 2aIronxpharmacology 2aManganesexpharmacology 2aSoybean Oil 2aSoybeans 2aSwine 2aTrace Elementsxpharmacology 2aVitamin Exmetabolism 2aZea mays 2aZincxpharmacology 0astorage losses 0astability1 aEwan, R.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 May, v. 69, no. 5 p.1994-2000x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02551naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002500128245016500153300001800318520106000336650001001396650002401406650002201430650002001452650001601472650002001488650002301508650001401531650001201545650001401557650001201571650002101583650002101604650001301625650001101638650001101649650003301660650001301693650000901706650001601715650003201731650001601763650001601779653002101795700001601816700001701832700002101849773008401870852000901954939003301963946001301996655001202009IND9103899520221119091427.0911007e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910389952DNAL7 a20662952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez Izquierdo, J.10aEffects of temperature on the performance of finishing swine.

Effects of a cold, diurnal temperature on average daily gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency  ap. 1850-1855.  aForty-eight crossbred barrows and gilts weighing 84.5 +/- .33 kg were used during two 21-d trials to investigate the effects of a cold, diurnal temperature (CD; -5.0 to 8.0 degrees C) compared with a constant, thermoneutral temperature (TN; 20 degrees C) and the effects of sex (barrows vs gilts) on performance. A second objective was to determine shrinkage as a result of a 24-h fast immediately after the 21-d study of hogs commingled vs those not commingled for both environmental treatments (CD vs TN). Pigs housed in the CD chamber gained 27.2% more slowly (P < .001; .75 vs 1.03 kg/d) than those in the TN environment and consumed 5.7% more feed (P < .05; 3.88 vs 3.67 kg/d). The lower ADG and higher feed intake (FI) exhibited by the CD pigs resulted in poorer (P < .05) feed efficiency (F/G; 5.33 vs 3.73, respectively). A temperature X sex interaction occurred for ADG but not for FI or F/G. Twenty-four-hour shrink for the CD pigs was 16.4% less than for the TN pigs (3.72 vs 4.45%, respectively); however, commingling did not affect shrinkage. 3aswine 3aambient temperature 3adiurnal variation 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3agender differences 3afinishing 3afasting 3ashrinkage 2aAnimals 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aCold Temperature 2aDrinking 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aHumidity 2aMale 2aSex Factors 2aSwinexgrowth & development 2aWeight Gain 2aWeight Loss 0arespiration rate1 aJesse, G.W.1 aBecker, B.A.1 aEllersieck, M.R.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 May, v. 69, no. 5 p.1850-1855x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03116naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219072001700236100001900253245007700272300001600349500001500365520114300380650000901523650001501532650001801547650001901565650001301584650002101597650001901618650001201637650003401649650001701683650001501700650001501715650001501730650001101745650001801756650001901774650001701793650001601810650002101826650001401847650001401861650001701875650001701892650000701909650001001916650001001926650001701936653002201953653002001975653002501995653002502020653001002045700001702055700001702072700001502089700001602104773007102120852000902191856008902200930003302289945002502322946001102347655001202358IND4363196220221119091354.0040630e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436319622DNAL7 a220620142pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The purpose of Study 1 was to evaluate the use of pH, glycolytic potential, and glucose levels in the drip to assess shelf life characteristics of modified atmosphere packaged (MAP), enhanced pork loin chops during display. Chops from higher pH carcasses had higher color scores and aerobic plate counts, and less discoloration. Study 2 evaluated shelf life characteristics of chops derived from high pH (>5.75) raw materials enhanced with solutions containing salt and phosphate, and/or lactate and/or acetate. Overall, pH was the best indicator of color and microbiological stability. Raw materials with high ultimate pH were least stable. MAP chops derived from high pH raw materials and enhanced with a sodium acetate-containing solutions had better color and microbiological shelf life than those enhanced with other solutions. 3apork 3ashelf life 3apig carcasses 3afood packaging 3alactates 3aflavor enhancers 3acarbon dioxide 3aglucose 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3afood storage 3aflavorings 3aphosphates 3aglycolysis 3aoxygen 3adiscoloration 3asodium acetate 3astorage time 3aplate count 3aloins (meat cut) 3adrip loss 3asolutions 3arigor mortis 3ameat quality 3apH 3acolor 3achops 3acold storage 0apotassium lactate 0acolor stability 0aglycolytic potential 0aaerobic plate counts 0asalts1 aBrewer, M.S.1 aKillifer, J.1 aBidner, B.1 aMcKeith, F.0 tMeat science.g2004 Sept., v. 68, no. 1 p.115-122x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.10.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02697naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013000145300001800275520127400293650001001567650001701577650001201594650001601606650002001622650002401642650000901666650001001675650000701685650002701692650001901719650001201738650004201750650001101792650001801803650003301821650003101854650000901885650002001894650002601914650003201940653001501972653001901987700001702006700001702023773008402040852000902124939003302133946001302166655001202179IND9103900820221119091345.0911007e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390082DNAL7 a20663062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, M.F.10aEffect of exogenous porcine somatotropin on the functional and textural characteristics of the porcine semimembranosus muscle  ap. 1975-1982.  aSixteen barrows and gilts (sex effects were balanced within treatment, but not included in the model for analysis) were used in a 2 (porcine somatotropin; 2 mg.animal-1.d-1 vs control) X 2 (10% dietary fat vs control) X 4 (time postmortem; 0, 3, 6, and 24 h) factorial treatment array to evaluate the effects of porcine somatotropin (pST) administration and level of dietary fat intake on the functional and textural characteristics of the semimembranosus muscle during the first 24 h postmortem. Porcine somatotropin administration resulted in a decrease (P < .05) in muscle tenderness, an increase (P < .05) in chilled carcass weight, and an increase (P < .08) in longissimus muscle area. The pH values were lower over time with elevated levels of dietary fat, but PST resulted in no alterations in muscle pH. The R-values (the ratio of inosine to adenine nucleotides) were unaffected by PST or by level of dietary fat, but the combination of the two resulted in an increase in moisture binding capabilities. It could be concluded from die present study that PST and increased level of dietary fat result in an alteration of certain functional (tenderness) and textural (water binding ability and cooling losses) characteristics of the porcine semimembranosus muscle. 3aswine 3asomatotropin 3amuscles 3adietary fat 3afeed conversion 3acarcass composition 3apork 3acolor 3apH 3awater binding capacity 3ashear strength 2aAnimals 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFood Handling 2aGrowth Hormonexpharmacology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aMusclesxdrug effects 2aSwinexgrowth & development 0atenderness 0acooking losses1 aGeorge, S.M.1 aReagan, J.O.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 May, v. 69, no. 5 p.1975-1982x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01884naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245005600115300001400171520107600185650002501261650001301286650000901299650001501308650002101323650001801344650001801362650001601380653003101396653002201427773007101449852000901520939003301529945000801562655001201570991588179920742620221119091245.0791105e197907  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794564902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL14aThe nature of weight loss during short term dieting  ap. 14-15.  aConcern for health and aesthetic reasons have made dieting a popular phenomenon in Europe and North America. New diets, frequently involving a low-carbohydrate approach, are constantly being suggested to the weight-conscious public. Six overweight males followed three diet regimens for periods of ten days each. The diets consisted of: 1) 800 kcal in mixed proportions of carbohydrates and fats; 2) 800 kcal on a ketogenic (low carbohydrate) regimen; and 3) starvation. A 1200 kcal mixed diet preceded and ended the program, and was also followed for five-day periods between each ten-day period. Energy nitrogen balance indicated the composition of weight change in each subject. Maximum weight loss (751 g/day) occurred during starvation; minimum weight loss (278 g/day) occurred on the mixed diet. The ketogenic diet led to a loss of 467 g/day. These differences were due to differences in water excretion. In terms of correction of obesity, the mixed and ketogenic diets were preferable to the starvation diet, and the mixed diet was preferable to the ketogenic one. 3aHealth and Pathology 3aproteins 3adiet 3astarvation 3anitrogen balance 3acarbohydrates 3aenergy intake 3aweight loss 0acarbohydrate modifications 0aFat modifications0 tNutrition and food science.g1979 , v. 59 p.14-15x0034-66597nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19791105c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01356naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245003600137300001200173520063100185650002100816650002400837650001800861651001900879653001800898653002000916773006900936852000901005939003301014945000801047946001101055655001201066991588179640742620221119091315.0810728e198103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810014852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Christine.10aDietary goals--past and present  ap. 2-3.  aDietary guidelines in the UK have been developed as a moderate approach to improving health through better dietary habits.

The guidelines do not reach a large enough audience or special risk groups, and they fail to address the problems of world-wide hunger and food supply. 3anutrition policy 3anutrition education 3apublic health 3aUnited Kingdom 0aDietary goals 0aGovernment role0 tNutrition and food science.g1981 , v. 69 p.2-3x0034-66597nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810728c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01633naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002600115300001100141520083200152650002400984650002001008650003001028650003201058650002601090650001701116651001101133653002201144653002101166773007101187852000901258939003301267945000801300946001101308655001201319991588179370742620221119091225.0810127s1980    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810002942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL14aThe French experience  ap. 15.  aA campaign for nutrition education of French consumers was described at the 1980 EEC Symposium on Nutrition and Food Technology. Although nutrition is a widespread health risk in France, it cannot be effectively advocated by coercive regulations. Instead, expectant mothers are encouraged to properly feed themselves and their families. A positive effect of food on health is seen as depending on good food choices. As part of a public relations effort, a card game, "Mangez Juste" (eat right), was distributed at holiday resorts. A third project focused on the feeding of children, 6-12 years old. Parents and teachers were involved with an information drive which included a teaching kit. These and other activities meet the need of the French public to receive simple nutrition information that can be applied to daily life. 3anutrition education 3achild nutrition 3ainformation dissemination 3afood and nutrition programs 3anutrition information 3afood choices 3aFrance 0ainformation needs 0aFamily nutrition0 tNutrition and food science.g1980 , v. 66 p.15-15x0034-66597nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810127c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02963naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245012000146300001800266500001500284520152800299650001001827650002701837650001901864650001001883650001701893650002101910650002301931650001201954650002601966650001301992650001102005650001302016650004302029650002702072650000902099650002402108650005002132650001002182650001202192653003102204653001602235653001602251653002002267700001902287773008402306852000902390939003302399946001302432655001202445IND9103900120221119091358.0911007e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390012DNAL7 a20663012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedrano, J.F.10aGrowth performance and plasma insulin-like growth factor I concentrations in sheep selected for high weaning weight  ap. 1912-1918.  a2019-12-04  aA study was undertaken to determine the effect of selection for high weaning weight on concentrations of plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in sheep and to evaluate the usefulness of measuring IGF-I as an aid in identification of genotypes with a higher growth potential. Lambs from two lines selected for high 120-d weight (HW and DH) and an unselected control (C) were weighed and blood samples collected monthly from birth to weaning (4 mo of age). A clear differentiation in size occurred after 1 mo of age between lines, between sexes, and between singles and twins. At weaning, selected lines were 3.8 and 5.0 kg heavier than controls. Plasma IGF-I concentrations were 1.5 to 2 times higher (P < .001) in males than in females after 1 mo of age. There were no significant differences in IGF-I concentration between lines or types of birth. However, line DH and single lambs on average had higher concentrations of IGF-I. Within sex and type of birth correlations between IGF-I concentrations at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mo and 4-mo BW ranged from-. 16 to .49 in the three lines, and most were not significant. Coefficients of variation for IGF-I concentrations (36 to 50%) were two to three times higher than those for BW (11 to 15%). Due to the high variability of IGF-I measurements, the low correlations between IGF-I concentration and BW, and the small differences in IGF-I between control and selected lines, measurement of plasma IGF-I is unlikely to be an effective aid to selection for growth rate in sheep. 3asheep 3aphenotypic correlation 3aweaning weight 3atwins 3ablood plasma 3aline differences 3aselection criteria 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixanalysis 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMale 2aSex Characteristics 2aSheepxbloodxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aTwins 2aWeaning 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0abody weight 0agrowth rate 0aage differences1 aBradford, G.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 May, v. 69, no. 5 p.1912-1918x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03582naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202072001700219100001700236245007800253300001600331500001500347520183300362650001402195650001502209650001302224650001302237650001702250650002302267650001202290650001202302650001902314650002302333650001202356650001902368650002502387650001602412650001802428650001102446650001802457650002802475650000702503650001002510650002002520653003302540653001802573653001702591653002902608653002002637700002102657700001702678773007002695852000902765856008902774930003302863945002502896946001102921655001202932IND4362948220221119091443.0040622e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436294822DNAL7 a220615112pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study, the effect of incorporating liver with meat and vegetables in loaves was studied. Different types of loaves were evaluated: (1) Control meat loaf, (2) liver-meat loaf (20% liver) and (3) liver-vegetable loaves (40% liver, 1:1 ratio of carrot and potato). The pH's; yield's, emulsion stabilities and proximate compositions were not significantly different between meat and liver-meat loaves. However, liver-vegetable loaves gave significantly (P<0.05) lower yields and different proximate compositions. Although, liver-meat and liver-vegetable loaves had acceptable sensory scores (above 6), control meat loaves gave significantly (P<0.05) higher sensory scores. Instrumental color evaluation suggested significantly (P<0.05) higher redness (a*) and chroma values in meat loaves and significantly (P<0.05) higher values of brightness (L*), yellowness (b*) and hue values in liver-meat and liver-vegetable loaves. Texture profile analysis showed that liver-meat and liver-vegetable loaves had significantly (P<0.05) lower values of hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness than the control meat loaves. Among the loaves, liver-vegetable loaves were softer and hence had lower values for the textural parameters than liver-meat loaves. During refrigerated storage, liver-vegetable loaves had significantly (P<0.05) lower thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) values than meat and liver-meat loaves. Shelf life studies indicated a shelf life of 15 days for meat and liver-meat loaves and 10 days for liver-vegetable loaves at 4+/-1°C. It was concluded that buffalo liver could be commercially utilized for the preparation of acceptable comminuted meat products. 3ajuiciness 3ashelf life 3ahardness 3apotatoes 3abuffalo meat 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3acarrots 3alivers as food 3afood acceptability 3aaerobes 3ashear strength 3aappearance (quality) 3aplate count 3awater content 3aflavor 3alipid content 3apsychrotrophic bacteria 3apH 3acolor 3aprotein content 0abulffalo vegetable meat loaf 0ameat products 0afood quality 0abulffalo liver meat loaf 0astorage quality1 aMendiratta, S.K.1 aKondaiah, N.0 tMeat science.g2004 July, v. 67, no. 3 p.377-383x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.11.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2004/07/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02374naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185072001700202100002100219245010300240300001600343520101900359650001601378650002101394650002101415650002001436650000701456650001901463650001701482650001701499650002301516650001401539650001001553650001201563700001501575700001901590700002001609700001201629700001801641700001701659773007001676852000901746856008901755945002501844946001101869655001201880IND4362371720221119091433.0040505e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436237172DNAL7 a220613312pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The meals included native corn gluten meal (CGM) that had been ph-adjusted from 4.4 to 6.6 and particle size reduced to either ~38 (MC38) or ~7 micrometer (MC7). When judged by a trained sensory panel, all CGM-based substances contributed the same degree of CGM off-odor intensity, but significantly lowered pork odor intensity when compared to SPI-containing products and controls. SPI and all CGM-based substances increased grain-like odor. Visual off-color was apparent in all meat products containing CGM-based substances. Instrumental color evaluation indicated that products containing CGM-based substances were lighter, more yellow colored than control and SPI-containing products. However, sensory denseness, springiness and cohesiveness, and texture profile analyses of meat products were not affected. 3asoy protein 3aprotein isolates 3acorn gluten meal 3aGRAS substances 3apH 3ameat emulsions 3acooked foods 3afood quality 3asensory evaluation 3aoff odors 3acolor 3atexture1 aRyan, K.J.1 aWicklund, S.E.1 aNicolalde, C.L.1 aLin, S.1 aMcKeith, F.K.1 aBrewer, M.S.0 tMeat science.g2004 June, v. 67, no. 2 p.335-341x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.10.0213Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdPNNe2004/05/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03633naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001600195245024300211300001600454500001500470520134600485650002801831650001801859650003501877650001701912650001801929650001301947650002001960650001401980650002001994650001502014650001502029650001402044650003202058650002002090650002802110650001602138650001202154650002702166650002302193650002402216650002002240650002702260650001402287650002202301650004402323650002002367650002602387650001702413650001702430650001902447650001402466650002002480650000702500650001002507650001702517653002602534653002202560653003302582653001402615700002202629700001602651700001602667700001502683700001402698773007002712852000902782945002502791946001102816655001202827IND4362372320221119091401.0040505e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436237232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

An equal number of pigs heterozygote (monomutant-MON) and normal on MH (nonmutant-NON) were used in the experiment. The pigs were fed finisher feed (control group) or finisher feed supplemented with magnesium (3.6 g MgO per pig per day; MgO group) for 5 days prior to slaughter. Pigs fed the diet supplemented with MgO had higher plasma Mg concentrations. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) measurements on postmortem (15 min) muscle samples (longissimus muscle) showed the highest phosphocreatine levels in normal pigs fed MgO (P<0.05). The MgO supplementation caused increased Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ ATPase activity only in normal (NON) pigs. ATPase activity was lowest (P<0.05) in heterozygote control pigs. Pigs fed MgO supplemented diet had higher pH (45 min postmortem). A significant lower pH (P<0.05) was obtained in heterozygous (MON) control pigs. Also pigs fed with MgO had lower percentage of drip losses and significant differences (P<0.05) were obtained between heterozygous (MON) pigs. The results indicate that dietary MgO supplementation can improve parameters of muscle energetic metabolism, Ca2+ uptake and meat quality (pH, drip loss). 3aelectrical conductivity 3aswine feeding 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aswine breeds 3aion transport 3acrossing 3anutrient intake 3aslaughter 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphates 3aglycolysis 3afinishing 3adietary mineral supplements 3aanimal genetics 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3aadenosine triphosphate 3alongissimus muscle 3aryanodine receptors 3aenzyme activity 3amalignant hyperthermia 3adrip loss 3abreed differences 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amagnesium oxide 3anutrient availability 3arigor mortis 3ameat quality 3aheterozygosity 3amagnesium 3aphosphocreatine 3apH 3acolor 3ahomozygosity 0abiochemical compounds 0alongissimus dorsi 0apostmortem muscle metabolism 0alightness1 aKuchenmeister, U.1 aBahelka, I.1 aVasicek, D.1 aLiptaj, T.1 aEnder, K.0 tMeat science.g2004 June, v. 67, no. 2 p.365-370x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  aINDdPNNe2004/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03399naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245003400171300001400205500002400219500001500243520219100258650002602449650001302475650002902488650001102517650000902528650003002537650001702567650001802584650002602602650002102628650001802649650001702667650001002684650001302694650002802707653002002735653001502755773013102770852000902901856005502910655001202965IND4432621220221119091055.0100213e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443262122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1476-4431.2009.00491.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSykes, Jane E.10aFeline hemotropic mycoplasmas  ap. 62-69.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo describe the current understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of feline hemotropic mycoplasmosis (feline infectious anemia). Manuscripts published on hemotropic mycoplasmosis in cats and other animal species, based on a search of PubMed using the search terms 'hemoplasmas,''haemoplasmas,''hemotropic,''haemotropic,' and 'Haemobartonella,' as well as references published within manuscripts accessed. Although hemotropic bacteria such as Bartonella bacilliformis have been recognized in humans for over 100 years, it has only been in recent years that some of these have been identified as hemotropic mycoplasmas. Three species of hemotropic mycoplasmas have been documented in cats worldwide, Mycoplasma haemofelis, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis,' and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum.' These organisms were previously known as Haemobartonella felis, but are now known to be mycoplasmas. M. haemofelis is the most pathogenic species, and causes anemia in immunocompetent cats. Although 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' may be more capable of causing anemia in immunosuppressed cats, their pathogenicity remains controversial. Assays based on polymerase chain reaction technology are the most sensitive and specific diagnostic tests available for these organisms, because they remain uncultivable in the laboratory setting. Blood smears are unreliable for diagnosis of hemoplasmosis because of their lack of sensitivity and specificity. Cats presenting to emergency/critical care specialists with hemolytic anemia should be tested using polymerase chain reaction assays for hemotropic mycoplasmas before instituting antimicrobial therapy. Positive test results for M. haemofelis suggest involvement of this organism in hemolytic anemia. Other differential diagnoses for hemolytic anemia should be considered in cats testing positive for 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum,' because the presence of these organisms is not always associated with anemia. Blood from infected cats should be handled with care because of the potential zoonotic nature of this infection. 3adiagnostic techniques 3aetiology 3aBartonella bacilliformis 3ahumans 3acats 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3amycoplasmosis 3aMycoplasma haemofelis 3ahemolytic anemia 3apathogenicity 3apathogenesis 3ablood 3abacteria 3aMycoplasma haemominutum 0aHaemobartonella 0aMycoplasma0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2010 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.62-69dBlackwell Publishing Incx1479-32617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2009.00491.x 7aarticle02368naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017300126300001600299500001500315520125100330650001701581650002001598650001301618650001801631650002501649650002001674650002401694650002401718653001701742653001201759700001701771700001501788700001701803700001401820773007001834852000901904930003301913945001301946946001101959655001201970IND2332665920221119091126.0030520e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233266592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiedler, I.10aPhenotypic variations of muscle fibre and intramuscular fat traits in Longissimus muscle of F2 population Duroc x Berlin Miniature Pig and relationships to meat quality  ap. 131-139.  a2019-12-05  aIn Longissimus muscle from a F2 population of Duroc x Berlin Miniature Pigs, micro-structural fibre traits and fatty acid composition were investigated to calculate correlation coefficients between these traits and meat quality. The animals of the F2 population exhibited low carcass weight (55.7+/-11.2 kg), low meat percentage (35.0+/-8.4%) but a relatively high intramuscular fat content (3.52+/-1.44%) compared to pure bred animals (F0). No unacceptable meat quality was observed. The variation coefficients of carcass composition, muscle fibre traits, and fat traits were high enough to allow the analysis of candidate genes which influence the growth of muscle fibres, fat cells, and meat quality. Phenotypic correlation coefficients between muscle fibre characteristics and meat quality traits were low whereas fatty acid composition and meat quality were more closely related. The correlation coefficients between muscle fibre traits and fatty acid composition ranged from 0.10 to 0.40. The relationship between a low quotient of n-6/n-3 fatty acids in muscle and greater fibre sizes, higher percentages of the oxidative fibre type and higher capillary density was noteworthy indicating good conditions for muscle growth and meat quality. 3ameat quality 3askeletal muscle 3acrossing 3amuscle fibers 3aphenotypic variation 3aminiature swine 3acarcass composition 3aquantitative traits 0aswine breeds 0apig fat1 aNurnberg, K.1 aHardge, T.1 aNurnberg, G.1 aEnder, K.0 tMeat science.g2003 Jan., v. 63, no. 1 p.131-139x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle02348naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245015100147300001600298520125600314650001601570650002801586650001701614650001001631650001801641650002501659650001601684650001601700650001701716650002501733653002401758653002001782700001401802700001701816773007401833852000901907939003301916946001301949655001201962IND9103806420221119091148.0911001e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910380642DNAL7 a166682822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillott, M.A.10aLight-induced chloroplast differentiation in soybean cells in suspension culture. Ultrastructural changes during the bleaching and greening cycles  ap. 962-970.  aSuspension cultures of SB-P cells of soybean (Glycine max) provide a novel, reproducible, and readily manipulable greening system useful for inducing chloroplast differentiation. The cells are subcultured and grown heterotrophically (3% sucrose) in the dark for at least three successive 14-day periods, subcultured and grown in the dark for 7 days more, and finally placed under white light and grown photoautotrophically. Chlorophyll begins to accumulate by 1 hour of light and continues up to 12 days. The chlorophyll a:chlorophyll b ratio is 3:1. Dark-grown cells contain a small amount of total carotenoids which increase 10-fold during greening. Chloroplast differentiation is strictly light dependent, with photosynthetic pigments accumulating in the light and being lost from cells returned to the dark. In the dark, the chloroplasts dedifferentiate to amyloplasts as the organized thylakoid network is lost and starch accumulates. Under continuous light, the amyloplasts differentiate into mature chloroplasts as the organelle elongates, becomes spanned by several bands of thylakoids, and undergoes grana formation. Chloroplast differentiation in SB-P cells is similar to that in intact angiosperms developing under normal light-dark cycles. 3aGlycine max 3acell suspension culture 3achloroplasts 3alight 3aplant anatomy 3adevelopmental stages 3achlorophyll 3acarotenoids 3abiosynthesis 3alaws and regulations 0acell ultrastructure 0adifferentiation1 aErdos, G.1 aBuetow, D.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 July, v. 96, no. 3 p.962-970x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03026naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009700144300001600241500001500257520190300272650001402175650001902189650001602208650002102224650001902245650002402264653001302288653001902301700001402320700001702334700001602351700001502367700001802382700001402400700001702414700002502431773007002456852000902526930003302535945001302568946001102581655001202592IND2332665620221119091150.0030520e200301  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233266562DNAL7 a220619922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiguel, E.10aCarcass classification in suckling lambs. Discrimination ability of the European Union scale  ap. 107-117.  a2019-12-05  aForty-nine Manchega suckling lambs were used in this trial. Lambs were slaughtered at 10, 12 and 14 kg liveweight (cold carcass weight lower than 13 kg). The degree of fatness was assessed by three assessors on colour photographs of the carcasses, using the European Union scale for light lambs (EU), and another new scale developed in our laboratory (Suckling Lamb scale, SL). Carcass degree of fatness was reassessed using the same scales divided into 0.25 point-intervals (EUI, SLI). Carcasses were allocated into four groups by means of a tree classification algorithm (cluster analysis), according to 27 variates, namely muscle percentage, whole fat percentage, subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, kidney knob and channel fat percentage and muscle percentage, both in the carcass and in three joints (leg, best end neck plus loin, and shoulder). SL scale groups showed a higher number of variates well correlated to assessors' scoring than EU scale groups. Nevertheless, the EU scale showed significant between-groups differences in a higher number of variates (P < 0.01). Using 0.25-points interval scales, EUI scale scoring was the best correlated to tissue composition. However, most variates were better correlated to dorsal fat thickness measurement (4 cm back from last rib and 4 cm from the carcass midline) than to assessors' scoring. All four groups in the tree classification were statistically different from one another, but assessors only were able to detect differences between whole fat percentage in group 1 and the rest. These results suggest that it is possible to improve the photographic standards of the EU method by using a 0.25 points interval scale. In abattoir conditions, the new SL method (1.0 point intervals) proved to be better. Measure of dorsal fat thickness proved to be a very good predictor of carcass tissue composition, but it is a more expensive measure. 3alamb meat 3aclassification 3aphotographs 3acluster analysis 3aEuropean Union 3acarcass composition 0amanchega 0ameat carcasses1 aOnega, E.1 aCañeque, V.1 aVelasco, S.1 aDiaz, M.T.1 aLauzurica, S.1 aPerez, C.1 aBlazquez, B.1 aRuiz de Huidobro, F.0 tMeat science.g2003 Jan., v. 63, no. 1 p.107-117x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle01929naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245011600143300001600259520097500275650002201250650003501272650002001307650002301327650001301350650002901363650002001392653001301412653002301425700001401448773007401462852000901536939003301545946001301578655001201591IND9103806120221119091039.0911001e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910380612DNAL7 a166682792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, C.10aEthylene and a wound signal modulate local and systemic transcription of win2 genes in transgenic potato plants  ap. 943-951.  aThe transcriptional regulation of a win2-beta-glucuronidase gene fusion in transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants by wounding and ethylene has been analyzed. In common with other genes that are expressed in response to mechanical or chemical stress, win2 is transcribed at the site of injury and also in distant undamaged parts of the wounded plant, Similar kinetics of induction and patterns of transcription were observed in response to mechanical, wounding, elicitor, or arachidonic acid application. Experiments involving the use of chemicals that inhibited ethylene action, and those that increased ethylene production, showed that local induction of win2 transcription did not have an absolute requirement for ethylene, but ethylene was necessary for high levels of expression. in contrast, systemic expression of win2 required both a putative wound signal and ethylene. Ethylene alone had no direct effect on win2 gene expression in the absence of wounding. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3agenetically modified organisms 3agene expression 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aethylene 3atranscription (genetics) 3astress response 0ainjuries 0agenetic regulation1 aBevan, M.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 July, v. 96, no. 3 p.943-951x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02040naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245009000146300001600236520110200252650002501354650002001379650002001399650001801419650001701437650002501454650002501479653002501504653002801529700001601557773007401573852000901647939003301656946001301689655001201702IND9103806620221119091501.0911001e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910380662DNAL7 a166682842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, C.B.10aGenes with homology to fungal and S-gene RNases are expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 980-984.  aThe only RNase genes that have been cloned from higher plants are those expressed in species that are known to exhibit self-incompatibility, such as the S genes of Nicotiana alata. In this report, we investigated whether the expression of this particular type of RNase gene is restricted to self-incompatible species, or if similar genes are expressed in other plants. Using a polymerase chain reaction approach we have identified a set of three putative RNase genes in the self-compatible plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. ecotype Columbia. These A. thaliana genes, designated RNS1, RNS2, and RNS3, do not cross-hybridize to each other, and their products are homologous to both the S-gene RNases of N. alata and a set of related fungal enzymes. The A. thaliana RNS1, RNS2, and RNS3 genes encode transcripts of 1.1, 1.3, and 1.1 kilobases, respectively, and of the three genes, RNS2 is the most highly expressed in whole plants. The identification of the RNS genes in a self-compatible species suggests that this class of RNases is of general significance in RNA catabolism in higher plants. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNicotiana alata 3agene expression 3aribonucleases 3agenetic code 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0aself incompatibility 0amolecular sequence data1 aGreen, P.J.0 tPlant physiology.g1991 July, v. 96, no. 3 p.980-984x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02204naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008600173300001600259500002400275520118500299650001601484650002401500650002001524650002001544650001501564650002601579650001801605650002301623700001801646700002801664773011001692852000901802856005501811655001201866IND4381230320221119091502.0060620e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438123032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2006.00068.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaj, Pavithra N.10aQuality assessment of oil blends by electronic nose technique and sensory methods  ap. 322-332.  aIncludes references  aTwo oil blends comprising 70 parts of groundnut oil (GNO) or rice bran oil (RBO) and 30 parts of coconut oil (CNO) or palmolein (PO) blends were studied for odor quality changes during deep fat frying by sensory and electronic nose techniques. Poori, a common Indian product, was deep fat fried in the two blends; altogether 10 fryings were made for each blend. Sensory odor evaluation by the method of quantitative descriptive analysis showed that freshly prepared blends and the blends after first frying had the characteristic oily note. In GNO + CNO blend, these notes became subdued but the earthy odor increased on subsequent fryings. At the end of the 10th frying, the heated oil odor was significantly higher accompanied with marked increase in husk-like and branny notes in RBO +PO blends. This was supported by the aroma pattern obtained by the electronic nose which showed discrimination between initial and fried oil samples. The consumer acceptance study conducted among the target groups using the hedonic scale showed that "poori" (fried product) fried in GNO +CNO blend had higher acceptance because of familiarity and liking for characteristic oil odor and aroma. 3acoconut oil 3aconsumer acceptance 3adeep fat frying 3aelectronic nose 3apeanut oil 3aquantitative analysis 3arice bran oil 3asensory evaluation1 aPrakash, Maya1 aBhat, Kodangala Keshava0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2006 June, v. 21, no. 3 p.322-332dBlackwell Publishing Incx0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2006.00068.x 7aarticle02498naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001900168245012800187300001600315500001500331520107900346650000901425650001301434650002001447650001101467650002701478650002301505650001801528650001401546650002001560650002301580650001901603650002001622650001701642650001701659653003701676653002201713653001601735700001301751700001501764773007001779852000901849856008901858930003301947945001301980946001101993655001202004IND2333219420221119091523.0030625e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233321942DNAL7 a220610692pmid7 a10.1016/S0309-1740(01)00212-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández, P.10aChloride salt type/ionic strength, muscle site and refrigeration effects on antioxidant enzymes and lipid oxidation in pork  ap. 405-410.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of NaCl and KCl at varying ionic strengths on catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and lipid oxidation in refrigerated ground pork muscles from different anatomical locations were studied.

Results indicated that pork samples with higher catalase and GSH-Px activities would undergo less lipid oxidation, and the accelerated lipid oxidation in salted pork may be partly related to a decrease in GSH-Px activity. 3apork 3acatalase 3askeletal muscle 3alipids 3aglutathione peroxidase 3alongissimus muscle 3arefrigeration 3aoxidation 3asodium chloride 3apotassium chloride 3aionic strength 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidants 3acold storage 0a2-thiobarbituric acid substances 0alongissimus dorsi 0aboston butt1 aPark, D.1 aRhee, K.S.0 tMeat science.g2002 Aug., v. 61, no. 4 p.405-410x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0309-1740(01)00212-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle03796naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245011200145300001600257500001500273520252500288650001002813650001702823650002102840650002302861650002002884650003202904650002602936650001402962650003202976650002403008650001303032651000903045653002803054653001503082700001503097700002103112700002003133700001803153700001903171773007003190852000903260930003303269945001303302946001103315655001203326IND2333218820221119091504.0030625e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233321882DNAL7 a220610662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahgoub, O.10aFatty acid composition of muscle and fat tissues of Omani Jebel Akhdar goats of different sexes and weights  ap. 381-387.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper describes the fatty acid (FA) composition of muscle and fat tissue in Omani Jebel Akhdar buck, wether and does slaughtered at 11, 18 or 28 kg body weight (BW). The fat percentage in dry matter (DM) of the subcutaneous and kidney fats ranged between 85 and 98% and that of muscle ranged between 17 and 21%. Subcutaneous fat tended to have lower DM than kidney fat. Palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0) and oleic (C18:1) acids comprised the largest proportions of FA in the muscle tissue (approximately 80%) with oleic acid being the most abundant. Ninety-one percent of the total FA were contributed by the C16 and C18 fatty acids being 31.6 and 58.5%, respectively. C19 and C20 were not detected in the muscle tissue. The essential FA, C20:2, C20:3 and C20:4 contributing about 1%. Muscle tissue of the Jebel Akhdar goat contained an average 51.3% and 48.7% of saturated (SFA) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), respectively. Polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) constituted about 5% and monounsaturated (MFA) 43.5% of the total FA. Subcutaneous fat contained more total FA (68.08%) than kidney fat (48.14%) in the whole tissue. Kidney fat contained higher percentages of C16 and C18 but less C:18:1 than subcutaneous fat. The proportions of SFA to UFA was high in both fat depots with the SFA being much higher in the kidney than subcutaneous fats. C16, C18 and C:18:1c acids comprised 64.2 and 78% and C16s and C18s made up 81 and 85% of total FA in subcutaneous and kidney fats, respectively. In both subcutaneous and kidney fats, there was a trend of increasing values of DM and fat percentage with intact males having the lowest and females the highest values. Males had higher levels of C15, C18:2 and C18:3 but lower levels of C17, C18 and total C16, C18 and C18:1 in muscle tissue. Intact males had higher levels of C10, 12, 15 FA but lower C16:1 and C16 + 18 + 18:1 than others in subcutaneous fat. Intact males had a similar trend for C12 and 14 but lower SFA and higher UFA in kidney fat. There was a trend of increasing DM and fat% in dry matter with increasing body weight. C10, 12 and 14 of the kidney fat decreased with increasing slaughter weight. There was a trend of the two C16 FA decreasing and the four C18 increasing with BW in the kidney fat. This resulted in proportions of the total C16 and C18 FA increasing from 81.8 to 86.8%. These findings confirm those of other studies on goat meat quality that, as judged by fatty acid composition it is not inferior to that of meats from other farm animals. 3agoats 3ameat quality 3aslaughter weight 3agender differences 3askeletal muscle 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3agoat meat 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3acarcass composition 3abody fat 3aOman 0aunsaturated fatty acids 0akidney fat1 aKhan, A.J.1 aAl-Maqbaly, R.S.1 aAl-Sabahi, J.N.1 aAnnamalai, K.1 aAl-Sakry, N.M.0 tMeat science.g2002 Aug., v. 61, no. 4 p.381-387x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US 7aarticle03192naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245007100176300001600247500001600263500001500279520176500294650002602059650001402085650001802099650001802117650001002135650001302145650002202158650002102180650001202201650002502213650003002238650001402268650003002282650002502312650001702337650001702354650001002371653001502381653001202396653002002408700001402428773007302442852000902515856007902524930003302603945001302636946001302649655001202662IND2331213420221119091236.0030306e200202  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233121342DNAL7 a118738342pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.2.2462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshizaki, N.10aChanges in shell membranes during the development of quail embryos  ap. 246-251.  anetherlands  a2019-12-04  aThe shell membrane of an avian egg acts as a bag enclosing albumen and water. At its interface with the albumen, a smooth layer of homogeneous, dense material called the limiting membrane demarcates the shell membrane. The present study aimed to investigate changes in the limiting membrane during development of quail embryos that were grown with or without being turned. Sixty-three percent of the embryos were hatched after the eggs were incubated at 39 C and in 60% humidity with automatic rotation around their long axis and with their equatorial side down, whereas the hatch rate decreased to 24% when the eggs were incubated without being turned. The width of the limiting membrane at the equatorial region of turned eggs gradually decreased from 74 nm on Days 0 to 2 of incubation to 35 nm on Day 10 and thereafter. Conversely, water permeability, measured by evaporation through the shell membrane increased from 4 to 5 nL/mm2 per min on Days 0 to 6, to 9 nL/mm2 per min on Day 12 and thereafter. In stationary eggs, the decrease in the width of the limiting membrane on the lower side of eggs was delayed until Day 8 of incubation. The water permeability of the shell membrane in this group was 51% of that of the membrane on the upper side of eggs on Day 8 of incubation. Forty to forty-four nanometers seemed to be the critical width of the limiting membrane at which high water permeation could occur. It was also shown that the albumen hinders water permeation through the membrane. These results show that (1) the limiting membrane is made thin during the development over the whole surface with egg-turning, possibly through digestion of still unknown agents, and (2) this thinning accelerates the rate of water permeation through the membrane. 3amembrane permeability 3athickness 3aegg membranes 3aembryogenesis 3awater 3ahatching 3aCoturnix japonica 3aegg hatchability 2aAnimals 2aCoturnixxembryology 2aEgg Shellxultrastructure 2aEgg White 2aMembranesxultrastructure 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aPermeability 2aTime Factors 2aWater 0aincubation 0aturning 0aJapanese quails1 aSaito, H.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.246-251x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.2.2463Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03762naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245015400175300001600329500001600345500001500361520215200376650001002528650001302538650001102551650001802562650001902580650001602599650002802615650001202643650001602655650001302671650002502684650001102709650001402720650005102734650000902785650001602794650004502810653001302855653002002868653001802888700001702906700001802923700001602941700001902957773007302976852000903049856007903058930003303137945001303170946001303183655001203196IND2331213220221119091350.0030306e200202  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233121322DNAL7 a118738332pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.2.2392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, H.M.10aFertility of broiler breeders following categorization by the OptiBreed sperm quality index when hens are inseminated with a constant number of sperm  ap. 239-245.  anetherlands  a2019-12-04  aIf semen quality was known prior to insemination, sperm doses could possibly be decreased, maximizing the number of hens inseminated. The sperm quality index (SQI), an indicator of overall semen quality, is determined by the number of deflections in a light path due to sperm movement inside a capillary tube. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine the age at which the SQI becomes a static predictor of semen quality and 2) to determine if fertility of males with a higher SQI responds more favorably to insemination dose reduction than that of males with a lower SQI. Weekly from 23 to 32 wk of age, 144 Cobb males were tested for SQI. At 32 wk of age, males were placed into four groups that represented the SQI population quartiles as follows: poor, fair, good, and best. A fifth SQI group, uncategorized, was created to determine fertility of the original population by mixing equal amounts of semen from each of the four groups. Semen was collected weekly from 33 to 40 wk of age from 18 males in each of the four groups, pooled by group, and used to inseminate 30 hens per group with 50 or 100 million sperm. Eggs were collected daily, incubated, and broken out to determine fertility. Correlation coefficients between weekly SQI results and overall averages for individual males indicated that the SQI stabilized after the birds were 28 wk of age. The main effect for SQI selection revealed that the best SQI group had the highest fertility (88%), which did not differ from the good (83%) or fair group (82%) but was greater than the uncategorized group (80%). Fertilities of the top three groups and the uncategorized group were higher than the poor group (63%) (P < 0.0001, SEM 2.18). In addition, there was an interaction between SQI classification and insemination dose. Fertilities of the top three SQI groups were similar at the 50 and 100 million sperm doses. However, the poor and uncategorized SQI groups had lower fertility at the 50 million dose as compared to the 100 million dose. By categorizing males into SQI groups after 28 wk of age, insemination dose can be reduced, maximizing a male's fertilizing potential. 3asemen 3aroosters 3adosage 3aegg fertility 3amale fertility 3aspermatozoa 3aartificial insemination 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aBreeding 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aInsemination, Artificialxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aSperm Count 2aSpermatozoaxclassificationxphysiology. 0achickens 0aage differences 0abroiler lines1 aKaraca, A.G.1 aYeatman, J.B.1 aFrank, L.R.1 aMcDaniel, C.D.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.239-245x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.2.2393Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04159naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001400158245011700172300001600289500001600305500001500321520193500336650002102271650001602292650001002308650002302318650003602341650001202377650002002389650001402409650002502423650002702448650001202475650001702487650001002504650002102514650002302535650001702558650001202575650002902587650001302616650002602629650004202655650003902697650003802736650006502774650002202839650002502861650004102886650002102927650004602948650003702994650001303031653002703044653003103071653003403102700001603136700001403152700002203166700001703188773007303205852000903278856007903287930003303366945001303399946001303412655001203425IND2331215420221119091240.0030306e200202  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233121542DNAL7 a118738352pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.2.2522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIqbal, M.10aAntioxidant enzyme activities and mitochondrial fatty acids in pulmonary hypertension syndrome (PHS) in broilers  ap. 252-260.  anetherlands  a2019-12-04  aMajor objectives of this study were to assess antioxidant protection and fatty acid profile in lung mitochondria and whole liver in broilers with pulmonary hypertension syndrome [(PHS; with and without high dietary vitamin E (VE)] (Experiment 1) and in broilers that did not develop PHS but were genetically selected (S) or not selected (NS) for resistance to PHS (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, lung mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was elevated in broilers with PHS compared to controls, broilers fed high VE, and broilers fed high VE with PHS (VE-PHS), but there were no differences in GSH reductase (GSH-Rd) among groups. In liver tissue, GSH-Px was also elevated by PHS but was lower in VE and VE-PHS groups than in controls. There were no differences in liver GSH-Rd, superoxide dismutase (SOD), or gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) activities with the exception that gamma-GCS was higher in the VE-PHS group than in the other groups. In Experiment 2, S lung mitochondria exhibited lower GSH-Px and higher GSH-Rd compared to NS broilers. In the liver, there were no differences in GSH-Px, GSH-Rd, or gamma-GCS, but SOD was lower in S compared to the NS broilers. High VE increased the percentage of saturated fatty acids and decreased the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in lung mitochondria in Experiment 1; there were no differences in fatty acid content between S and NS mitochondria in Experiment 2. Thus, it appears that GSH recycling enzyme activities are affected by PHS and high VE presumably in response to differences in oxidative stress and that genetic resistance to PHS is associated with an inherently better capability to metabolize oxidants in lung mitochondria. The increase in saturation of lung mitochondrial fatty acids with high dietary VE would presumably make them more resistant to oxidative stress and, thus, reduce the level of PHS-induced oxidative stress. 3abroiler chickens 3afatty acids 3aliver 3agenetic resistance 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aascites 3aenzyme activity 3avitamin E 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aligases 3amitochondria 3alungs 3aline differences 3aselection criteria 3aantioxidants 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aChickens 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aGlutamate-Cysteine Ligasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Reductasexmetabolism 2aHypertension, Pulmonaryxenzymologyxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aLiverxenzymology 2aLungxultrastructure 2aMitochondriaxchemistryxenzymology. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPoultry Diseasesxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aSyndrome 0agamma-glutamylcysteine 0aglutamatae-cysteine ligase 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH)1 aCawthon, D.1 aBeers, K.1 aWideman, R.F.

To investigate if HSPG expression is affected by muscle growth and gender, a turkey line (F) selected for increased 16-wk BW and its unselected random-bred control line, RBC2, were used in the present study. Heparan sulfate (HS) and HSPG levels were measured in embryonic and posthatch pectoralis major muscle. HS levels plateaued at embryonic day (ED) 16 in both lines. A significant decrease of HS occurred at ED 18 in F males and females, and at ED 20 and 22 in the RBC2 males and females, respectively. Embryonic HSPG levels peaked at ED 18, and were significantly higher from ED 14 through 18 in F males and females compared with those of the RBC2 line. Male pectoralis major muscle had more HSPG at early embryonic stages than female muscle in both lines. During 1 to 16 wk posthatch, F male and female pectoralis major muscle contained more HSPG than the RBC2 samples, and HSPG levels in F males were higher than those of the females. Myogenic satellite cells derived from F and RBC2 male and female pectoralis major muscle were cultured to measure HSPG expression during proliferation and differentiation. No significant difference in HSPG level was found between the RBC2 and F line cells. However, in both lines, male-derived satellite cells had more HSPG than the female cells during proliferation and differentiation. These data show that HS and HSPG expression are affected by muscle growth properties and sex. 3aselection response 3amuscle development 3abreast muscle 3aanimal proteins 3aturkeys 3aembryogenesis 3askeletal muscle 3agender differences 3aembryo (animal) 3agene expression 3acultured cells 3aglycosaminoglycans 3acell differentiation 3aline differences 3acell proliferation 3aselection criteria 3aextracellular matrix 3aproteoglycans 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Division 2aCells, Cultured 2aFemale 2aHeparan Sulfate Proteoglycansxmetabolism 2aHeparitin Sulfatexmetabolism 2aMale 2aMuscle Developmentxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPectoralis Musclesxcytologyxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aSatellite Cells, Skeletal Musclexcytologyxmetabolism. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Factors 2aTurkeysxembryologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0agrowth rate 0acells 0apectoralis major 0asatellite cells1 aNestor, K.E.1 aMcFarland, D.C.1 aVelleman, S.G.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.1621-1628x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.11.16213Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02981naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001500141245014400156300001800300520152500318650002101843650001101864650002001875650001801895650001801913650002001931650001701951650002401968650002101992650002002013650001602033650002002049650001702069650002402086653002002110700002002130700002402150700001602174700001602190700001402206700001502220700001502235773007602250852000902326856008102335930003302416945001302449946001302462655001202475IND2332111920221119091424.0030422e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233211192DNAL7 a10.1093/ps/81.11.16402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaouis, M.10aEarly-age thermal conditioning reduces uncoupling protein messenger RNA expression in pectoral muscle of boiler chicks at seven days of age  ap. 1640-1643.  aEarly-age thermal conditioning (TC) by exposing young chicks to 40 C for 24 h reduces body temperature (Tb) and has been showed by others to improve long-term resistance of broilers to heat stress. Uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation in pectoral muscle mitochondria might be related to heat production. Fertile eggs were hatched under video control, and 161 pedigree chicks from12 sires and 22 dams were immediately allocated to two groups (T, a group composed of 81 chicks exposed to TC at 5 d of age, and N, a control group of 80 nonexposed chicks). Body weights and Tb were measured at 2 and 7 d of age. Five pairs (one N and one T) of full sib chicks from families that exhibited the largest difference of Tb variation from 2 to 7 d of age between the two treatments were chosen for pectoral muscle sampling. Avian uncoupling protein (avUCP) messenger RNA expression was measured by reverse transcript-PCR coupled to southern blot in the pectoral muscle of 7-d-old broiler chicks. At 7 d of age, there were no BW differences between treatments and Tb was significantly reduced by TC (- 0.13 C on average). Heritability of Tb variation between 2 and 7 d was 0.38 +/- 0.20 (SE) for T chicks and 0.35 +/- 0.17 for N chicks without a significant genetic correlation between the two environments. Expression of avUCP mRNA was significantly (85%) lower in T chicks than in N chicks. Uncoupling protein mRNA expression in pectoral muscle and Tb are quickly adjusted in broiler chicks 24 h after early thermal conditioning. 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3agene expression 3abreast muscle 3amessenger RNA 3aanimal proteins 3amitochondria 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3aheat production 3abody weight 3amaternal effect 3aheritability 3agenetic correlation 0ahatching weight1 aBasilio, V. de.1 aMignon-Grasteau, S.1 aCrochet, S.1 aBouchot, C.1 aBigot, K.1 aCollin, A.1 aPicard, M.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.1640-1643x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.11.16403Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02113naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245008600158300001600244500002400260520110300284650001001387650001101397650001201408650001901420650002101439650001101460650001501471650001101486650002401497650001601521651001101537651001701548773009201565852000901657856008501666655001201751IND4423697920221119091317.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442369792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-009-0596-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Jian14aThe dynamics of the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature forcing of Sahel drought  ap. 445-460.  aIncludes references  aGiven the pronounced warming in the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) during the second half of the twentieth century and the empirical relationship between the Indian Ocean SST and Sahel summer precipitation, we investigate the mechanisms underlying this relationship using the GFDL atmospheric model AM2.0 to simulate the equilibrium and transient response to the warming of the Indian Ocean. Equatorial wave dynamics, in particular the westward propagating equatorial Rossby waves, communicates the signal of tropospheric warming and stabilization from the Indian Ocean to the African continent. The stabilization associated with the Rossby wave front acts to suppress the convection. Feedbacks with local precipitation and depletion of moisture amplify the dynamically induced subsidence. While this stabilization mechanism is expected to operate in climate change response, the future prospects for the Sahelian climate under global warming are complicated by the intricate sensitivities to the SSTs from different ocean basins and to the direct radiative forcing of greenhouse gases. 3aSahel 3abasins 3adrought 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3amodels 3asubsidence 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3atroposphere 3aAfrica 3aIndian Ocean0 tClimate dynamics.g2009 Sept., v. 33, no. 4 p.445-460dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-009-0596-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01453naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005700128300001800185520051000203650003500713650001000748650002500758650002100783650001700804650001800821650002700839650002500866651001000891653001100901653002200912700001700934700001800951773006900969852000901038939003301047946001101080655001201091IND9103906220221119091319.0911004s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauerwein, M.10aIndole alkaloids in hairy roots of Amsonia elliptica  ap. 1153-1155.  aTransformed root cultures of Amsonia elliptica were obtained after direct infection of the stem of the in vitro grown plants with Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4.

We investigated possible relationship between minerals and metabolic syndrome by analysis of hair tissue minerals. We selected 848 subjects older than 20 years of age at Ajou University Hospital from May 2004 to February 2007. We excluded the subjects who had cancers, steroid and thyroid medication, and incomplete record from the study. Finally, 343 subjects were eligible. We performed cross-sectional analysis for the relationship between minerals and metabolic syndrome. The contents of calcium, magnesium, and copper in the metabolic syndrome group were significantly lower than those of the normal group, whereas the amounts of sodium, potassium, and mercury in the metabolic syndrome group were significantly higher than those of the normal group. By dividing the subjects into quartile with the level of calcium, magnesium, and mercury concentrations, we carried out logistic regression analysis to study the subjects and found that the subjects in the third quartile of calcium and magnesium concentrations had significantly lower odds ratio (OR) of the metabolic syndrome compared with that of the lowest quartile group [OR = 0.30, confidence interval (CI) = 0.10-0.89; OR = 0.189, CI = 0.063-0.566] and that the subjects in the highest mercury quartile had significantly higher OR of the metabolic syndrome compared with that of the lowest mercury quartile group (OR = 7.35, CI = 1.73-31.1). As part of the metabolic syndrome, the optimal calcium and magnesium concentrations in hair tissue may reflect decreased risk of metabolic syndrome, whereas high mercury concentration in hair tissue may indicate increased risk of metabolic syndrome. 3acalcium 3aconfidence interval 3acopper 3aenzymes 3amagnesium 3amercury 3ametabolic syndrome 3aminerals 3aodds ratio 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asodium 2aAdult 2aAlcohol Drinking 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Mass Index 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aFemale 2aHairxchemistry 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aMagnesiumxanalysisxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMercuryxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aMetabolic Syndromexepidemiologyxmetabolism. 2aMiddle Aged 2aMineralsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aMotor Activity 2aNutritional Statusxphysiology 2aOdds Ratio 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRegression Analysis 2aSmoking 0aKoreaxepidemiology.1 aChoi, Seong Wha1 aNam, Ah Young0 tBiological trace element research.g2009 Sept., v. 130, no. 3 p.218-228dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8336-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01439naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007800128300001800206500001500224520042700239650002800666650001700694650004300711650002000754650001400774650001200788650001700800650001900817650002000836650001100856653002000867653004000887700001600927773006900943852000901012939003301021946001101054655001201065IND9103904720221119091350.0911004s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgandona, V.10aWater stress on proline content and enzyme activities in barley seedlings  ap. 1093-1094.  a2019-12-04  aThe activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyrroline carboxylate reductase are increased ca four-fold in water stressed epidermal tissue and in primary leaves of barley but activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) was not affected by the stress treatment, Proline concentration increased about three- and 2.3-fold in epidermal tissue and in intact leaves respectively as the relative water content decreased. 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3abiosynthesis 3aNADP-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aHordeum vulgare 3aseedlings 3aproline 3awater stress 3acarboxy-lyases 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 0aoxidoreductases 0aglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase1 aPahlich, E.0 tPhytochemistry.g1991, v. 30, no. 4 p.1093-1094x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001400160245009900174300001800273500001500291520117000306650002301476650002101499650001101520650001801531650001501549650001301564650001901577650000901596650001601605650001001621650001201631650002501643650000901668650003501677650001401712650001301726650000901739650001101748650005501759650001501814650003001829650005901859653001701918700001901935700001901954773007601973852000902049856008102058930003302139945001302172946001302185655001202198IND2332415320221119091518.0030506e200212  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233241532DNAL7 a125125702pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.12.18072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrake, J.10aEffects of the tricothecene mycotoxin diacetoxyscirpenol on egg production of broiler breeders  ap. 1807-1810.  a2019-12-04  aThree experiments were conducted to determine the effects of 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) on egg quality and egg production of broiler breeders. In Experiment 1, feed containing 0, 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg DAS/kg was fed from 67 to 69 wk of age followed by a 3-wk recovery period on a slat-litter floor. In Experiment 2, individually caged broiler breeder females were studied from 23 to 31 wk of age. The basal diet containing 0, 5, 10, or 20 mg DAS/kg was fed from 25 to 27 wk of age. In Experiment 3, individually caged broiler breeder hens were studied from 23 to 32 wk of age. DAS was fed at levels of 0 (basal), 5, 10, and 20 mg DAS/kg for 2 wk beginning at Week 24, followed by the basal breeder diet for 7 wk. Egg production was not affected by levels of up to 5 mg DAS/kg in the older hens of Experiment 1. When fed from 25 to 27 wk of age in Experiment 2, DAS decreased egg production at the 20 mg/kg level only. When fed from 24 to 25 wk of age in Experiment 3, DAS had no significant effect on egg production or egg quality. Short-term consumption of DAS at levels that might naturally occur appears to have little effect on broiler breeder egg production. 3adiacetoxyscirpenol 3abroiler chickens 3aweight 3adose response 3aegg weight 3aegg yolk 3aegg production 3ahens 3aegg albumen 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDiet 2aEgg Shellxanatomy & histology 2aEgg White 2aEgg Yolk 2aEggs 2aFemale 2aMycotoxinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aOrgan Size 2aOvipositionxdrug effects 2aTrichothecenesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0afood animals1 aHamilton, P.B.1 aKittrell, R.S.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Dec., v. 81, no. 12 p.1807-1810x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.12.18073Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01287naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007700127300001800204520027400222650001500496650001100511650002500522650001300547650001400560650001800574650002200592650001900614650002300633650002100656651001000677700001300687700001800700700001700718700001700735700001500752773006900767852000900836939003300845946001100878655001200889IND9103905420221119090724.0911004s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanzetta, R.10aIchthyotoxic sesquiterpenes and xanthanolides from Dittrichia graveolens  ap. 1121-1124.  aThe ichthyotoxicity of Dittrichia graveolens was found to be due to the major sesquiterpenes 12-carboxyeudesma-3,11(13)-diene and tomentosin.

This water-repellent property of Clunio's cuticle is caused by a complete cover of hydrophobic microtrichia offering an effective surf tolerance. These microtrichia not only trap a thin air layer above the cuticle but also maintain a larger air bubble between the insect's ventral side and legs. The effectiveness of the water repellence was quantitatively characterised on the basis of a known model (Crisp and Thorpe, Discuss Faraday Soc 3:210-220, 1948). The parameters of the model are the contact angle θ (>90°) at the contact line of air/water/microtrichia and the distance between individual microtrichia and their radius. When the microtrichia are 1.1 μm apart and have a radius of 0.1 μm and an estimated contact angle θ of 140°, the air layer is stable against hydrostatic pressures of up to 3 m water column. As shown by a modified version of the model, considerably larger air bubbles can be trapped by the microtrichia cover of the legs up to distances of 0.5 mm from the body. The widely spaced (about 8 μm apart) and longer setae of Clunio are not involved in the formation of air layers and air bubble. 3aair 3abubbles 3acontact angle 3ahydrophobicity 3ainsect cuticle 3alegs 3amidges 3amodels1 aWoermann, Dietrich0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2009 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.933-941dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0551-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02094naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012300166300001600289500002400305520098400329650002301313650002301336650001001359650001201369650001101381650001601392650001601408650003301424650002201457700001901479700002301498700002301521773009401544852000901638856008501647655001201732IND4423660620221119090918.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442366062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0553-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKroiss, Johannes13aAn epicuticular multilayer reflector generates the iridescent coloration in chrysidid wasps (Hymenoptera, Chrysididae)  ap. 983-986.  aIncludes references  aChrysidid wasps in the subfamily Chrysidinae are brood parasitoids or cleptoparasites of other insects and famous for their cuticular iridescence. In this study, we examine the dorsal abdominal cuticle of the chrysidid wasp Hedychrum rutilans to identify the underlying color mechanism. Using scanning electron microscopy, reflectance spectral analysis, and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate the presence of an epicuticular multilayer reflector consisting of six lamellae with a thickness of 185 nm each. The lamellae exhibit a rough surface probably functioning as spacers between the individual layers. The reflector has a measured reflectance maximum at λ = 630 nm, i.e., in the red part of the visible spectrum of light at normal incidence and the reflectance maximum shifts to green as the angle of incidence increases. Complementary theoretical modeling corroborates the view that the epicuticular multilayer generates the iridescent color of the chrysidid cuticle. 3aHedychrum rutilans 3aangle of incidence 3acolor 3ainsects 3amodels 3aparasitoids 3areflectance 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis1 aStrohm, Erhard1 aVandenbem, Cédric1 aVigneron, Jean-Pol0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2009 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.983-986dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0553-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03342naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013900166300001600305500002400321520200400345650002002349650002302369650001502392650001602407650000902423650001502432650001202447650001302459650001302472650001502485650001702500650001502517650001102532650001602543650001302559650001202572650003302584650001002617700001802627700002402645700001502669773009402684852000902778856008502787655001202872IND4423660520221119090902.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442366052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0548-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColazza, Stefano14aThe response of Trissolcus basalis to footprint contact kairomones from Nezara viridula females is mediated by leaf epicuticular waxes  ap. 975-981.  aIncludes references  aChemical footprints left behind by true bugs are perceived as contact kairomones by scelionid egg parasitoids. Female wasps encountering a contaminated artificial substrate display a characteristic arrestment posture, holding the body motionless and antennating the surface. In the system Nezara viridula (L.) and its egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston), previous studies have shown that the kairomone mediating such behavior is part of N. viridula's cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) and furthermore that the wasp's ability to discriminate host male and female footprints is mainly based on the presence/absence of nonadecane (nC₁₉). In this study, the effect of epicuticular waxes of leaves of broad bean, Vicia faba, on wasp responses to footprints of N. viridula females were investigated. Approximately 20% of T. basalis females displayed an arrestment posture when released on the adaxial leaf surfaces of broad bean plants with intact wax layer and without host chemical contamination; whereas ~70% of wasps displayed the arrestment posture when intact leaves were contaminated by host female footprints. Adaxial leaf surfaces of broad bean plants dewaxed with an aqueous solution of gum arabic and afterwards contaminated by N. viridula females induced arrestment responses in about 10% of female wasps; the same percentage of arrestment (10%) was observed when the wasps were released on leaves contaminated by host females and subsequently dewaxed. The side of the polymer film that was appressed to the leaf surface, peeled from the contaminated leaves, induced an arrestment posture in about 95% of observed wasps. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the epicuticular waxes occurred as a film densely crystallized as irregularly shaped platelets with spherical granules randomly distributed. These findings demonstrated that epicuticular waxes of broad bean leaves can mediate the foraging behavior of T. basalis females by absorbing contact kairomones of the host. 3aNezara viridula 3aTrissolcus basalis 3aVicia faba 3aantennating 3aeggs 3afaba beans 3afemales 3aforaging 3agranules 3agum arabic 3ahydrocarbons 3akairomones 3aleaves 3aparasitoids 3apolymers 3aposture 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awaxes1 aLo Bue, Mauro1 aLo Giudice, Daniela1 aPeri, Ezio0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2009 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.975-981dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0548-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02900naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012000164300001600284500002400300520173500324650000802059650003902067650001702106650003902123650002802162650001102190650001402201650000702215650001202222650001602234700001802250700002102268700001802289700001902307773009402326852000902420856008502429655001202514IND4423660420221119090748.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442366042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00114-009-0558-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrossmann, Kay10aVisualizing different uranium oxidation states during the surface alteration of uraninite and uranium tetrachloride  ap. 963-974.  aIncludes references  aLow-temperature alteration reactions on uranium phases may lead to the mobilization of uranium and thereby poses a potential threat to humans living close to uranium-contaminated sites. In this study, the surface alteration of uraninite (UO₂) and uranium tetrachloride (UCl₄) in air atmosphere was studied by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy using an excitation wavelength of 408 nm. It was found that within minutes the oxidation state on the surface of the uraninite and the uranium tetrachloride changed. During the surface alteration process U(IV) atoms on the uraninite and uranium tetrachloride surface became stepwise oxidized by a one-electron step at first to U(V) and then further to U(VI). These observed changes in the oxidation states of the uraninite surface were microscopically visualized and spectroscopically identified on the basis of their fluorescence emission signal. A fluorescence signal in the wavelength range of 415-475 nm was indicative for metastable uranium(V), and a fluorescence signal in the range of 480-560 nm was identified as uranium(VI). In addition, the oxidation process of tetravalent uranium in aqueous solution at pH 0.3 was visualized by CLSM and U(V) was fluorescence spectroscopically identified. The combination of microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy provided a very convincing visualization of the brief presence of U(V) as a metastable reaction intermediate and of the simultaneous coexistence of the three states U(IV), U(V), and U(VI). These results have a significant importance for fundamental uranium redox chemistry and should contribute to a better understanding of the geochemical behavior of uranium in nature. 3aair 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahumans 3aoxidation 3apH 3auranium 3awavelengths1 aArnold, Thuro1 aSteudtner, Robin1 aWeiss, Stefan1 aBernhard, Gert0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2009 Aug., v. 96, no. 8 p.963-974dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0558-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01381naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007000130300001800200500001500218520058200233650002500815650002200840650002800862650001500890650002100905653001500926653001600941773006900957852000901026939003301035946001101068655001201079IND9103903920221119090941.0911004s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenthal, G.A.14aThe biochemical basis for the deleterious effects of L-canavanine  ap. 1055-1058.  a2019-12-04  aL-Canavanine, L-2-amino-4-(guanidinooxy)butyric acid, is a potentially toxic analogue of L-arginine. Canavanine-sensitive organisms activate and aminoacylate this non-protein amino acid and thereby create structurally aberrant, canavanine-containing proteins. Incorporation of canavanine into protein can alter the conformation and disrupt the function of the native macromolecule. Production of functionally impaired, canavanyl proteins affects developmental processes and contributes significantly to the expression of canavanine's potent antimetabolic properties in insects. 3aCanavalia ensiformis 3aprotein synthesis 3ainsecticidal properties 3acanavanine 3apoisonous plants 0ainhibition 0aamino acids0 tPhytochemistry.g1991, v. 30, no. 4 p.1055-1058x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01738naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007800127300001800205500001500223520075300238650002200991650002401013650002601037650001501063650001201078650001401090650001001104650002001114650001801134651001101152653002301163653001401186700001501200700001501215773006901230852000901299939003301308946001101341655001201352IND9103904320221119090932.0911004s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiordani, R.10aTributyroylglycerol hydrolase activity in Carica papaya and other latices  ap. 1069-1072.  a2019-12-04  aLipase activity (measured with tributyrin as substrate) was detected for the first time in fresh latex of branched non-articulated laticifers of Euphorbia characias, Asclepias curassavica and A. serilofera.

To investigate the contribution of the HMGCR gene to lipids and lipoprotein subfractions in different ethnicities, we performed an association study in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). In total, 2,444 MESA subjects [597 African-Americans (AA), 627 Chinese-Americans (CHA), 612 European-Americans (EA), and 608 Hispanic-Americans (HA)] without statin use were included. Participants had measurements of blood pressure, anthropometry, and fasting blood samples. Subjects were genotyped for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After excluding SNPs with minor allele frequency <5%, a single block was constructed. The most frequent haplotype was H1 (41-56%) in all ethnic groups except AA (H2a, 44.9%). Lower triglyceride level was associated with the H2a haplotype in AA and H2 in HA. In HA, H4 carriers had higher levels of triglyceride and small low-density lipoprotein (s-LDL), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), while carriers with H7 or H8 had associations with these traits in the opposite direction. No significant association was discovered in both CHA and EA. The total variation for triglyceride that could be explained by H2 alone was 2.6% in HA and 1.4% in AA. In conclusion, HMGCR gene variation is associated with multiple lipid/lipoprotein traits, especially with triglyceride, s-LDL, and HDL-c. The impact of the genetic variance is modest and differs greatly among ethnicities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aAsian Americans 3aEuropean Americans 3aHispanic Americans 3aanthropometric measurements 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood 3ablood pressure 3afasting 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenetic variance 3ahaplotypes 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3alow density lipoprotein 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atriacylglycerols1 aChen, Yii-Der I.1 aLi, Xiaohui1 aPost, Wendy1 aHerrington, David1 aPolak, Joseph F.1 aRotter, Jerome I.1 aTaylor, Kent D.0 tLipids.g2009 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.733-743dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-009-3314-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02774naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003400145245014000179300001600319500002400335500001500359520140000374650002401774650002001798650001501818650001501833650002101848650001301869650002601882650001801908650001101926650002301937653001001960700003801970700003502008700003502043700002802078700003202106700002902138773011602167852000902283856004802292655001202340IND4429092920221119091124.0091120e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442909292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-009-9193-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValadez-Bustos, Ma.

In this study, a reliable protocol was developed for the in vitro regeneration of four types of chili, Capsicum annuum var. annuum (Jalapeño and Serrano), C. annuum var. glabriusculum/aviculare (Piquin), and C. chinense (Habanero) by direct organogenesis using three different explants (cotyledon, hypocotyls, and embryo) and three induction media. All evaluated culture media promoted the formation of adventitious shoots. When embryos or hypocotyls were used as explants, morphologically normal adventitious shoots developed, while culturing cotyledons resulted in nonelongating rosette-shaped shoots. The highest in vitro regeneration efficiency (14.6 shoots per explant) was achieved when Habanero chili hypocotyls were grown on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 1.7 μM indole-3-acetic acid and 22.2 μM N⁶-benzyladenine. This regeneration rate is higher than that obtained in previous reports. Regenerated plants were ready to be transferred to the greenhouse 13 wk after the explant culture. An evaluation carried out under greenhouse conditions showed differences in agronomic performance between in vitro regenerated plants and plants developed from seeds with the magnitude of the differences depending on the genotype being studied. 3aadventitious shoots 3aCapsicum annuum 3ahypocotyls 3acotyledons 3aagronomic traits 3agenotype 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3apepper 3aindole acetic acid 0aseeds1 aAguado-Santacruz, Gerardo Armando1 aCarrillo-Castañeda, Guillermo1 aAguilar-Rincón, Víctor Heber1 aEspitia-Rangel, Eduardo1 aMontes-Hernández, Salvador1 aRobledo-Paz, Alejandrina0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2009 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.650-658dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-009-9193-y 7aarticle02274naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245007500205300001600280500002400296506007600320520081700396506003701213650002101250650001201271650002301283650001301306650001201319650001301331650002201344650001501366650001201381650001301393650003401406650001801440650001601458700001801474700002401492700002101516700002101537700002701558700002001585773008101605852000901686856008501695655001201780IND4423658820221207070051.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442365882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11745-009-3316-42doi7 aPMC46381252pmcid7 a195365772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMomin, Amin A.10aCharacterization of Mutant Serine Palmitoyltransferase 1 in LY-B Cells  ap. 725-732.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHO-LY-B cells have been useful in studies of sphingolipid metabolism and function because they lack serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity. Cloning and sequencing of the SPT1 transcript of LY-B cells identified the mutation as a guanine to adenine change at nucleotide 738, causing a G246R transformation. Western blots revealed low expression of the mutant SPT1 peptide, but activity was not detectable by mass spectrometric analysis of [¹³C]-palmitate incorporation into sphinganine, sphingosine, 1-deoxysphinganine, or 1-desoxymethylsphinganine. Treatment of LY-B cells with chemical chaperones (DMSO or glycerol) increased the amounts of mutant SPT1 as well as SPT2, but SPT activity was not restored. This study has established that G246R mutation in hamster SPT1 results in the loss of SPT activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aadenine 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aglycerol 3aguanine 3ahamsters 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3amutants 3amutation 3aserine C-palmitoyltransferase 3asphingolipids 3asphingosine1 aPark, Hyejung1 aAllegood, Jeremy C.1 aLeipelt, Martina1 aKelly, Samuel L.1 aMerrill, Alfred H.

The author examines the origins and development of bottle-feeding, and argues that the present polarization of views can only be resolved by cooperation between the interested groups, including the food manufacturers, food technologists, civil servants, health service professionals, journalists, and mothers. 3abottle feeding 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3aweaning 3afood technology 3ahistory 3adeveloping countries 3ainfant formulas 2aAnimals 2aBottle Feedingxeconomicsxhistoryxpsychology. 2aCattle 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFood-Processing Industry 2aHistory, 18th Century 2aHistory, 19th Century 2aHistory, 20th Century 2aHistory, Medieval 2aHumans 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMilk 0aGreat Britain 0ainfant food industry0 tJournal of human nutrition.g1979 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.276-282x0308-43297nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800122c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle03339naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245013400146300001800280520146100298650001001759650002301769650002401792650001601816650001401832650001701846650002001863650002501883650002601908650000701934650002501941650001801966650001601984650001702000650002802017650002202045650001202067650002502079650003802104650003002142650003302172650001402205650003602219650001702255650001802272650001202290650003102302650002602333650002702359650000902386650002502395650003702420650002202457650001302479650001302492700001702505700001602522773008402538852000902622939003302631946001302664655001202677IND9103902820221119090717.0911008e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910390282DNAL7 a16485512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, H.S.10aRuminal protein metabolism and intestinal amino acid utilization as affected by dietary protein and carbohydrate sources in sheep  ap. 2134-2145.  aEight wether lambs fitted with ruminal, duodenal, and ileal cannulas were used in a replicated 4 X 4 Latin square design to study the effects of carbohydrate and protein sources on ruminal protein metabolism and carbohydrate fermentation and intestinal amino acid (AA) absorption. Treatments were arranged as a 2 X 2 factorial. Carbohydrate sources were corn and barley; protein sources were soybean meal (SBM) and fish meal (FM). Diets contained 15.5% CP, of which 40% was supplied by SBM or FM. Corn or barley provided 39% of dietary DM that contained equal amounts of grass hay and wheat straw. Fish meal diets produced a lower (P < .05) ruminal NH3 concentration and resulted in less CP degradation and bacterial protein flow to the duodenum than did SBM diets. Replacing SBM with FM increased (P < .05) ruminal digestion of all fiber fractions. In addition, cellulose and hemicellulose digestibilities in the rumen tended to increase (P > .05) when barley replaced corn in the FM diets. Carbohydrate X protein interactions (P < .05) were observed for OM digestion in the rumen and AA absorption in the small intestine (percentage of AA entering); these interactions were highest for the barley-FM diet. These results suggest that feeding FM with barley, which is high in both degradable carbohydrate and protein, might benefit ruminants more than feeding FM with corn, which is high in degradable carbohydrate but relatively low in degradable protein. 3asheep 3arumen fermentation 3aprotein degradation 3aamino acids 3afish meal 3asoybean meal 3adietary protein 3adietary carbohydrate 3aintestinal absorption 3apH 3avolatile fatty acids 3adigestibility 3afeed intake 3arumen fluids 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAmmoniaxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aDietary Carbohydratesxmetabolism 2aDietary Fiberxmetabolism 2aDietary Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDigestion 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aFermentation 2aFish Products 2aHordeum 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aIntestinesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRumenxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSheepxmetabolism 2aSoybeans 2aZea mays1 aJordan, R.M.1 aStern, M.D.0 tJournal of animal science.g1991 May, v. 69, no. 5 p.2134-2145x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02190naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245014500167300001400312500002400326520100100350650002701351650002801378650001701406650001601423650002401439650001001463650001301473650001101486700002801497700002201525700002101547773017501568852000901743856008801752655001201840IND4423595020221119090718.0090724s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442359502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalla, Sailesh10aEnhancement of doxorubicin production by expression of structural sugar biosynthesis and glycosyltransferase genes in Streptomyces peucetius  ap. 92-98.  aIncludes references  aTo enhance doxorubicin (DXR) production, the structural sugar biosynthesis genes desIII and desIV from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439 and the glycosyltransferase pair dnrS/dnrQ from Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 27952 were cloned into the expression vector pIBR25, which contains a strong ermE[low asterisk] promoter.

Three treatments were applied: a conventional 12-h feed withdrawal (control); provision of a highly digestible, carbohydrate-based feed withdrawal supplement (FWS) with no added protein source (FWS0); and provision of FWS containing 16% CP as a highly digestible protein source (FWS16). Both FWS treatments were designed to be highly and rapidly soluble, were formulated to result in nominally lower GIT residues, and were withdrawn for only 3 h prior to slaughter. Visual assessment of segments of the GIT at slaughter indicated no significant differences among treatments in the degree of emptiness of the crop, gizzard, and colon, whereas intestinal contents of both FWS groups were less (P < 0.05) than those of the control group. With or without prior acclimation to supplements, live weight losses for both FWS groups were consistently and significantly less than for the control group (P < 0.05). In birds acclimated to the supplement, hot eviscerated and chilled carcass weights and deboned breast meat yield were greater for FWS16 than for the control group (P < 0.05). Carcass water uptake during chilling was similar or lower for FWS treatments compared to controls so that the effect of supplement on improving product yield was not due to excessive water uptake. These data indicate that the provision of a highly digestible feed withdrawal supplement enhanced lower GIT emptying, reduced live weight loss, and in some instances improved product yield without the need for a prolonged period of feed withdrawal. 3abroiler chickens 3aGram-negative bacteria 3astarvation 3afeed supplements 3adigestibility 3aprotein sources 3aegg albumen 3adietary protein 3adigesta 3aslaughter weight 3abreast muscle 3awater uptake 3aanimal welfare 3acarcass weight 3aanimal stress 3aanimal use refinement 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDietary Supplements 2aGastric Emptyingxphysiology 0astress 0ameat yield 0aweight losses1 aEdward, M.E.1 aCostell, M.H.1 aHadley, J.A.1 aWalker, P.N.1 aVasilatos-Younken, R.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.1406-1414x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.9.14063Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03645naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245013500175300001600310520155800326650002101884650001501905650002201920650002101942650001401963650002301977650001102000650001802011650001002029650001302039650001602052650000702068650001702075650001702092650001802109650002702127650001902154650002702173650001002200650001902210650001002229650001902239650001402258650001202272650002802284650003802312650003302350650003102383650002002414650003502434650002002469650003702489650002302526650002902549650001902578653003002597700001702627700002002644700001502664700001302679773007202692852000902764856007902773930003302852945001302885946001302898655001202911IND2330943320221119085319.0030221e200205  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233094332DNAL7 a120334212pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.5.6992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavenije, B.10aEffects of feed deprivation and transport on preslaughter blood metabolites, early postmortem muscle metabolites, and meat quality  ap. 699-708.  aIn practice, poultry have their feed withdrawn several hours before being collected and put on transport to the slaughter plant. With the exhaustion of their internal energy stores, the chickens may lack energy to cope with the conditions to which they are subjected. Meat quality is affected by the energy stored in the muscle at time of slaughter and its rate of decrease postmortem. Of 320 broiler chickens, half were subjected to 5 h feed deprivation whereas the others had access to feed until transport. In both groups, half the chickens were transported for 1.5 h, and the rest were transported within 5 min to the on-site slaughter facility. Twenty chickens were equipped with an ultrafiltration-collection device for monitoring glucose and lactate profiles. After slaughter, liver pH was measured. Stimulation of muscle metabolism was minimized by avoiding plucking. Breast muscle samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h and analyzed for pH and metabolite concentrations, and meat quality was measured at 96 h. Although liver glycogen was depleted in feed-deprived chickens, feed deprivation and transport for short periods were not found to affect blood glucose or lactate levels nor glycogen levels in the muscle at slaughter. Muscle carbohydrate metabolism was found to come to a complete halt after 6 h, which was not caused by exhaustion of the glycogen store but by the muscle's ability to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) after 4 h. At this time, rigor mortis had set in and deboning could be done without risk of cold shortening. 3abroiler chickens 3astarvation 3awater deprivation 3aanimal transport 3aslaughter 3apostmortem changes 3aboning 3ablood glucose 3aliver 3aglycogen 3alactic acid 3apH 3achicken meat 3ameat quality 3abreast muscle 3aadenosine triphosphate 3ashear strength 3awater holding capacity 3acolor 3aanimal welfare 3ablood 3ablood sampling 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aChickensxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactatesxblood 2aLiverxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMeatxstandards 2aMusclesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPostmortem Changes 2aRigor Mortisxveterinary 2aTransportation 0aultrafiltration permeates1 aLambooij, E.1 aGerritzen, M.A.1 aVenema, K.1 aKorf, J.0 tPoultry science.g2002 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.699-708x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.5.6993Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04394naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002200158245017800180300001600358520201100374650001302385650002102398650003702419650001502456650001602471650001802487650003602505650003002541650002302571650001602594650002302610650001102633650001102644650001602655650002502671650001202696650004402708650007502752650003402827650001302861650005002874650001102924650003102935650001502966650004802981650006003029650000903089650005603098650006303154650005703217653001703274653001703291653003203308700001803340700002103358700001803379700001903397700001703416700002003433773007203453852000903525856007903534930003303613945001303646946001303659655001203672IND2330942420221119085418.0030221e200205  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233094242DNAL7 a120334142pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.5.6492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuul-Madsen, H.R.10aMajor histocompatibility complex-linked immune response of young chickens vaccinated with an attenuated live infectious bursal disease virus vaccine followed by an infection  ap. 649-656.  aThe influence of the MHC on infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine response in chickens was investigated in three different chicken lines containing four different MHC haplotypes.

In this study, we found a notable MHC haplotype effect on the specific antibody response against IBDV, as measured by ELISA. The BW1 haplotype was found to have a significantly higher serum antibody titer against IBDV (7,872) than haplotypes B19 (mean 5,243), B21 (5,570), and B131 (5,333) at 8 d postinfection. However, a virus-neutralizing antibody test did not reflect this result. Nevertheless, the MHC haplotype-associated protective immunity was further supported by the bursa of Fabricius (bursa) recovery from the disease, as measured by histological scorings of the bursa. Chickens carrying the BW1 haplotype had a significantly lower bursa lesion score (1.7) than the haplotypes B19 (mean 3.8), B21 (3.6), and B131 (4.3) 8 d postinfection. Furthermore, multiple line effects were found in other variables when comparing Day 6 with Day 8. Body weight, relative weights of the bursa and the spleen, percentage and relative number of MHC II molecules on MHC II-positive lymphocytes, percentage and relative number of CD4 molecules on CD4-positive lymphocytes, and the specific antibody response all differed significantly among lines. Line 1, with Red Jungle Fowl genes, was clearly differentiated from the other two investigated lines. These results suggest an MHC II restricted T-cell dependent secondary antibody response against IBDV. 3achickens 3aline differences 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3ahaplotypes 3avaccination 3alive vaccines 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3ainfectious bursal disease 3aantibody formation 3ablood serum 3abursa of Fabricius 3aweight 3aspleen 3abody weight 3aneutralization tests 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aBirnaviridae Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aBursa of Fabriciusxpathology 2aChickens 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aHaplotypes 2aInfectious bursal disease virusximmunology 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complexxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aVaccines, Attenuatedxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aViral Vaccinesxadministration & dosageximmunology. 0acd4 antigens 0acd8 antigens 0asecondary antibody response1 aNielsen, O.L.1 aKrogh-Maibom, T.1 aRontved, C.M.1 aDalgaard, T.S.1 aBumstead, N.1 aJorgensen, P.H.0 tPoultry science.g2002 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.649-656x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.5.6493Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03005naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245012200175300001600297520127700313650001901590650001601609650001801625650001901643650001601662650001301678650001001691650002001701650002901721650002701750650002001777650002201797650001201819650004001831650001301871650002801884650002201912650002801934650003101962650006401993650003202057650002402089650001702113650001202130653000902142700001502151700001602166700001402182773007202196852000902268856007902277930003302356945001302389946001302402655001202415IND2330944020221119085314.0030221e200205  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233094402DNAL7 a120334242pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.5.7212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawson, P.L.10aEffect of lauric acid and nisin-impregnated soy-based films on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes on turkey bologna  ap. 721-726.  aResearch in development of antimicrobial packaging applications for further processed meats has become more common with recent outbreaks of contamination of these products. In this present study, lauric acid (8%, wt/wt) and 2.5% pure nisin (4%, wt/wt) were incorporated singly and together into thermally compacted soy films. Biocide-impregnated films were compared to control films containing no biocide for inhibition of Listeria monocytogenes in liquid medium and on turkey bologna surface. L. monocytogenes suspended in 1% peptone medium exposed to control films increased from 10(6) to 10(9) after 48 h exposure at 22 C. Films with nisin alone suppressed cell numbers 1 log cfu/mL after 2 h but cell numbers increased to 10(8) after 24 and 48 h at 22 C. Films containing lauric acid and nisin completely eliminated detectable cells from a 10(6) culture after 8 h of exposure to the liquid medium (22 C). Refrigerated bologna exposed to control films increased by 0.5 log from 10(6) after 21 d at 4 C. Nisin films reduced cell numbers on turkey bologna from 10(6) to 10(5) after 21 d, as did films containing nisin and lauric acid. Films with lauric acid alone reduced L. monocytogenes culture from 10(6) to <10(2) after 48 h and by 1 log on turkey bologna after 21 d. 3aluncheon meats 3aturkey meat 3afood spoilage 3afood packaging 3asoy protein 3aglycerol 3anisin 3adodecanoic acid 3aantibacterial properties 3aListeria monocytogenes 3astorage quality 3afoodborne illness 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBiofilms 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Packagingxmethods 2aLauric Acidsxpharmacology 2aListeria monocytogenesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aNisinxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aTurkeys 0afilm1 aCarl, G.D.1 aActon, J.C.1 aHan, I.Y.0 tPoultry science.g2002 May, v. 81, no. 5 p.721-726x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.5.7213Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03014naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002200141245011200163300001800275520158300293650001101876650001501887650001401902650001901916650001601935650001601951650001201967650001301979650002201992650001802014650001802032650002002050650002202070650001002092650002302102650002602125650001802151650001802169650001902187700001702206700001402223700001602237700001802253773007602271852000902347856008102356930003302437945001302470946001302483655001202496IND2332112520221119085755.0030422e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233211252DNAL7 a10.1093/ps/81.11.16612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeggen-Peay, C.L.10aInteractions of poult enteritis and mortality syndorme-associated reovirus with various cell types in vitro  ap. 1661-1667.  aAn avian reovirus, ARV-CU98, has recently been isolated from poults experiencing poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS). To further understand ARV-CU98 and its role in PEMS, the current study investigates interactions of ARV-CU98 with various cell types in vitro. When macrophages, B cells, T cells, and liver cells of chicken or turkey origin were co-incubated with ARV-CU98, only cells of liver origin demonstrated cytopathic effects, the presence of viral antigen, and reduced metabolic activity over time. Furthermore, distinctive pockets of viral particles were evident in electron microscopic examination of a chicken hepatocellular carcinoma (LMH) cell line, but not in a chicken macrophage cell line (MQ-NCSU) co-incubated with virus. Additional evidence of viral replication in LMH, cells but not MQ-NCSU cells was demonstrated by the presence of two viral bands (43 and 145 kD size) in cell lysates from LMH cells exposed to ARV-CU98. Although not capable of being infected by ARV-CU98, MQ-NCSU cells do appear to be activated by the virus since IL-1 mRNA expression is increased in MQ-NCSU cells 2 h after addition of the virus. LMH cells exposed to the virus demonstrate a decrease in IL-1 mRNA expression by 8 to 10 h after addition of the virus, perhaps corresponding to the initiation of infection by the virus. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ARV-CU98 actively infects and replicates in LMH cells, but not in lymphocytes or macrophages, suggesting that the liver may be a target and site of replication of ARV-CU98 in poults experiencing PEMS. 3apoults 3aReoviridae 3aenteritis 3acultured cells 3amacrophages 3ahepatocytes 3aturkeys 3achickens 3acytopathogenicity 3ainterleukin-1 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3avirus replication 3aactin 3adisease resistance 3aresistance mechanisms 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aviral antigens1 aCheema, M.A.1 aAli, R.A.1 aSchat, K.A.1 aQureshi, M.A.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.1661-1667x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.11.16613Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03272naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001700160245015000177300001800327500001500345520109000360650003001450650001101480650001001491650002301501650002701524650001601551650002701567650001001594650002301604650002801627650001101655650001201666650002701678650001101705650001401716650001601730650001201746650004001758650003401798650001601832650001301848650002001861650003901881650005201920650005601972650002202028650006902050650003902119650003902158653001302197653002702210653002702237700001302264700001702277700001202294700001602306700001502322773007602337852000902413856008102422930003302503945001302536946001302549655001202562IND2332112320221119085620.0030422e200211  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233211232DNAL7 a124555922pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.11.16532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, A.10aEvaluation of aviguard, a commercial competitive exclusion product for efficacy and after-effect on the antibody response of chicks to Salmonella  ap. 1653-1660.  a2019-12-04  aThe competitive exclusion (CE) action of Aviguard (AG) and its effects on the antibody response of chicks were evaluated in this study. We observed that AG protected the chicks from overwhelming colonization. Fourteen days after infection, fewer AG-pretreated than nonpretreated chicks shed salmonellae from their coloaca in both infected groups, although much less from SE-infected chicks. Antibody titers of sera produced to Salmonella typhimurium (ST) and SE in pretreated and nonpretreated chicks were not significantly different. Immunoblotting showed that these antibodies reacted with SDS-PAGE-separated 71.4, 67.7, 44.0, and 30.3 kDa proteins detectable in the test strains. Few weak bands of doubtful significance were observed in the cross-reaction between the sera of ST- and SE-infected chicks with ST and SE antigens, respectively. Our study showed that AG protected chicks from overwhelming colonization by salmonellae, and neither altered the antigenic proteins of infecting salmonellae nor their recognition by specific antibodies produced in response to the infection. 3aintestinal microorganisms 3acloaca 3aliver 3aantibody formation 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3abody weight 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3acecum 3astrain differences 3amicrobial contamination 3aspleen 3akidneys 3aecological competition 3achicks 3amortality 3afood safety 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbiosynthesis 2aAntigens, Bacterialxanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aChickens 2aCross Reactions 2aDisease Susceptibilityxveterinary 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gelxveterinary 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aSalmonella enteritidisximmunology 2aSalmonella typhimuriumximmunology 0aimmunity 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aŌta, Y.1 aMizukami, A.1 aIto, T.1 aNgwai, Y.B.1 aAdachi, Y.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.1653-1660x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.11.16533Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01789naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011700129300001800246500001500264520052500279650002200804650002500826650002200851650003300873650001600906650003200922650002200954650001400976650001400990650002601004650002601030651000901056653001401065653001201079653001701091653001101108653001801119700001901137700001501156700001901171773008801190852000901278939003301287946001101320655001201331IND9301671620221119085654.0930319e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930167162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeffries, D.L.10aAcetylene reduction by cryptogamic crusts from a blackbrush community as related to resaturation and dehydration  ap. 1101-1105.  a2019-12-04  aN2 fixation Microcoleus and Scytonema dominated cryptogamic crusts as related to the resaturation-dehydration phenomenon was estimated using the acetylene reduction assay.

Broiler breast fillets were sliced into two 1 cm thick slices and the turkey breast fillets into three 1 cm slices. Color values for lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*) were measured on the same top slice singly or while placed over the corresponding broiler and turkey slices. Color was measured in triplicate while the fillets were placed on the following backgrounds: plastic-coated white paper, white nylon, aluminum foil, black plastic, and a yellow commercial packaging tray (broiler only). Sample thickness significantly affected L*, a*, and b* values of turkey and chicken. Increased breast meat thickness resulted in lower L*, a*, and b* values. Increased turkey meat thickness from 1 to 2 cm resulted in lower a* and b* values; however, only lower L* values were observed, with sample thickness increased from 1 to 3 cm. No differences in meat color were found when increasing turkey meat sample thickness from 2 to 3 cm. Background had a significant effect on single (1 cm) broiler and turkey meat color measurements but did not influence the color readings of the thicker multiple slice samples. These results indicate that the application of machine vision or in-line color measurement systems may have to take into account breast meat thickness, and in thinner samples, background color. 3abroiler chickens 3achicken meat 3abreast muscle 3aturkey meat 3acolor 3ameat quality 3aslicing 3athickness 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aColorimetryxveterinary 2aFood Handlingxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFood Technology 2aMeatxstandards 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiology 2aPigmentationxphysiology 2aTurkeys 0ameat color 0abackground color1 aFletcher, D.L.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.1766-1769x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.11.17663Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03555naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245012700175300001600302500001600318500001500334520166600349650002102015650002702036650001202063650000902075650002302084650002702107650002302134650001402157650002102171650001302192650001602205650001102221650002302232650002002255650002402275650001202299650001202311650003302323650003502356650003602391650002102427650001102448650001902459650002002478650001302498650000902511650002702520650003002547650003902577653002702616700001302643700001702656773007302673852000902746856007902755930003302834945001302867946001302880655001202893IND2331210120221119085304.0030306e200202  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233121012DNAL7 a118738272pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.2.1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, M.G.10aMicrosatellite markers linked to salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis vaccine response in young F1 broiler-cross chicks  ap. 193-201.  anetherlands  a2019-12-04  aReduction in Salmonella enteritidis (SE) contamination is of importance for poultry production as well as for food safety. The objectives of this study were to identify potential genetic markers of antibody response to SE vaccine in young broiler chicks and then to confirm this linkage in broiler-cross offspring, as well as to explore interactions of marker alleles with dam line and sex. The initial identification of suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTL) markers for antibody response to SE vaccine was conducted by using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) with 58 microsatellite markers in a broiler breeder male line. Four unlinked microsatellites that had allele frequency differences between the high and low antibody response DNA pools were selected for subsequent analysis in a linkage study. Antibody response was measured in an F1 population (n = 379) that was derived by crossing each of four males of the broiler line with several dams from four genetically distant, highly inbred lines (Spanish, Fayoumi, and MHC-congenic G-B1 and G-B2 Leghorn). These crosses enabled us to evaluate the broiler sire QTL-marker allele effects and to explore QTL interactions with the dam lines by individual genotyping. Each of the four microsatellites identified by BSA in the broiler population had a significant (P < 0.05) association with F1 population antibody response in one or more sire families. The effect of the interaction of microsatellite allele with dam line or sex on antibody response was frequently significant. Microsatellite markers linked to antibody response QTL were identified, and genetic interactions with dam line and sex were detected. 3abroiler chickens 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aalleles 3aloci 3aantibody formation 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3agenetic resistance 3aserotypes 3agene interaction 3agenotype 3avaccination 3achicks 3aselection criteria 3agenetic markers 3aquantitative traits 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aChickensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSalmonella enteritidisximmunology 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aDeeb, N.1 aLamont, S.J.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.193-201x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.2.1933Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle04585naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001900158245010400177300001600281500001600297500001500313520265000328650002102978650001102999650002003010650001103030650001003041650002003051650002003071650002303091650001903114650002003133650001803153650001603171650002003187650001803207650001403225650001103239650001703250650004703267650001203314650001603326650003503342650001903377650000903396650004603405650001103451650003603462650000903498650002903507650001303536650001603549653000903565653001503574700001603589700001603605700001603621700001803637773007303655852000903728856007903737930003303816945001303849946001303862655001203875IND2331212220221119085543.0030306e200202  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233121222DNAL7 a118738302pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.2.2172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSterling, K.G.10aResponses of broiler chickens to cottonseed- and soybean meal-based diets at several protein levels  ap. 217-226.  anetherlands  a2019-12-04  aThree experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of broiler chicks fed diets with cottonseed meal (CSM) as the major protein source. Experiment 1 was a 3 x 2 factorial with three crude protein levels (17, 20, and 23%) by two protein sources, CSM or soybean meal (SBM). Diets were fed to male broilers (n = 840) in floor pens from 21 to 49 d of age. L-Lysine-HCl was added to keep lysine at 5.22% of protein. Protein source and level had significant (P < 0.001) effects on BW gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), respectively (no source by level interactions). The average BWG were 1.80, 2.00, and 2.00 kg for birds fed CSM-based diets, compared with 1.93, 2.09, and 2.21 for SBM-based diets (17, 20, and 23% protein, respectively). The average FCR were 2.56, 2.31, and 2.25 for CSM-fed broilers and 2.39, 2.16, and 2.08 for SBM-fed broilers. Significant effects of protein source or level were found for percentage of chilled carcass, fillets, tenders, saddles, and fat pads. In Experiment 2, male broiler chicks (n = 336) were used to determine the lysine requirement of chicks fed a corn and CSM-based diet with 20% CSM and 6% SBM. The basal diet contained by calculation 3,200 kcal/kg of ME, 20% CP, and 0.81% lysine. Graded levels of lysine (0.81 to 1.30% in increments of 0.07%) were fed to chicks from 10 to 20 d, and BW and residual feed were measured at 20 d. The requirement, as determined by breakpoint analysis, was 1.023 +/- 0.01% lysine (R2 = 0.84) for BWG and 1.028 +/- 0.02% lysine (R2 = 0.56) for FCR. In Experiment 3, a 2 x 2 x 4 factorial arrangement of treatments involved feeding CSM or SBM to male and female broiler chicks (n = 768) from 21 to 42 d at four dietary protein levels (17, 20, 23, and 26% CP). Lysine was kept at 5.5% of the dietary protein and consisted of the calculated minimum level, established in Experiment 2, plus 7%. Protein level, but not source, had a significant effect on BWG and FCR (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) for males. The average BWG were 1.53, 1.74, 1.78, and 1.81 kg for birds fed CSM compared to 1.46, 1.72, 1.84, and 1.82 kg for those fed SBM (17, 20, 23, and 26% CP, respectively); average FCR were 2.36, 2.14, 2.05, and 1.97 for CSM compared to 2.35, 2.04, 1.87, and 1.80 for SBM. Protein source and level significantly (P < 0.05) affected feed intake. Significant effects of protein source or level were found for percentage carcass, fillet, tenders, leg quarters, and fat pads. Females had similar qualitative responses. This study showed that at slightly higher protein levels CSM could replace SBM in broiler grower diets to achieve similar performance. 3abroiler chickens 3aweight 3adietary protein 3alysine 3aliver 3aprotein sources 3afeed conversion 3agender differences 3acarcass weight 3aliveweight gain 3acrude protein 3afeed intake 3acottonseed meal 3aabdominal fat 3ameat cuts 3achicks 3asoybean meal 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aCottonseed Oil 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aLysinexadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aSoybeans 2aWeight Gain 0adiet 0ameat yield1 aCosta, E.F.1 aHenry, M.H.1 aPesti, G.M.1 aBakalli, R.I.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Feb., v. 81, no. 2 p.217-226x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.2.2173Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02890naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245009700165300001400262520154900276650002501825650001201850650001501862650001101877650000901888650001201897650001601909650001901925650001601944650001401960650001801974650001401992650005802006650001302064650001402077650001902091650005802110653001502168653001402183653001702197653001702214653001702231700001602248773006502264852000902329939003302338946001302371655001202384IND9301682420221119085620.0930319e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930168242DNAL7 a84397432pmid7 aPMC1602482pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParks, B.M.10ahy8, a new class of Arabidopsis long hypocotyl mutants deficient in functional phytochrome A  ap. 39-48.  aEmerging evidence suggests that individual members of the phytochrome family of photoreceptors may regulate discrete facets of plant photomorphogenesis. We report here the isolation of phytochrome A mutants of Arabidopsis using a novel screening strategy aimed at detecting seedlings with long hypocotyls in prolonged far-red light. Complementation analysis of 10 selected mutant lines showed that each represents an independent, recessive allele at a new locus, designated hy8. Immunoblot and spectrophotometric analyses of two of these lines, hy8-1 and hy8-2, showed that, whereas phytochromes B and C are expressed at wild-type levels, phytochrome A is undetectable, thus indicating that the long hypocotyl phenotype displayed by these mutants is caused by phytochrome A deficiency. A third allele, hy8-3, expresses wild-type levels of spectrally normal phytochrome A, suggesting a mutation that has resulted in loss of biological activity in an otherwise photochemically active photoreceptor molecule. Together with physiological experiments, these data provide direct evidence that endogenous phytochrome A is responsible for the "far-red high irradiance response" of etiolated seedlings, but does not play a major role in mediating responses to prolonged red or white light. Because the hy8 and the phytochrome B-deficient hy3 mutants exhibit reciprocal responsivity toward prolonged red and far-red light, respectively, the evidence indicates that phytochromes A and B have distinct photosensory roles in regulating seedling development. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3ahypocotyls 3alength 3aloci 3aalleles 3aphytochrome 3aphotoreceptors 3amutagenesis 3ared light 3afar-red light 3aphenotype 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPhotochemistry 2aPhytochromexgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 0adeficiency 0ahy8 locus 0ahy8-1 allele 0ahy8-2 allele 0ahy8-3 allele1 aQuail, P.H.0 tPlant cell.g1993 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.39-48x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01907naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002500136245009600161300001800257520089800275650001701173650001701190650001501207650000901222650001201231650002201243650001001265650001401275650001801289700001701307700002301324773011401347852000901461856007601470946001101546655001201557IND4445787920221119085633.0101126e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444578792DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.18472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZins, Emilie‐Laure10aEnergy‐dependent dissociation of benzylpyridinium ions in an ion‐trap mass spectrometer  ap. 1253-1260.  aBenzylpyridinium ions, generated via electrospray ionization of dilute solutions of their salts in acetonitrile/water, are probed by collisional activation in an ion‐trap mass spectrometer. From the breakdown diagrams obtained, phenomenological appearance energies of the fragment ions are derived. Comparison of the appearance energies with calculated reaction endothermicities shows a reasonably good correlation for this particular class of compounds. In addition, the data indirectly indicate that at threshold the dissociation of almost all of the benzylpyridinium ions under study leads to the corresponding benzylium ions, rather than the tropylium isomers. Substituent effects on the fragmentation for a series of benzylpyridinium ions demonstrate that neither mass effects nor differences in density of states seriously affect the energetics derived from the ion‐trap experiments. 3aacetonitrile 3adissociation 3aionization 3aions 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3asalts 3asolutions 3aspectrometers1 aPepe, Claude1 aSchröder, Detlef.0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2010 Nov., v. 45, no. 11 p.1253-1260dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1076-51747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.18473Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02947naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003300184245008400217300001800301506007600319520140100395506003701796650001601833650001501849650001801864650001601882650001201898650002101910650002101931650001501952650001401967650003001981700003202011700002602043700001602069700002102085700002902106700003102135773017302166852000902339856008302348930003302431946001302464655001202477IND4400891620221207072751.0080203e20080129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440089162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07081531052doi7 aPMC22341442pmcid7 a182162622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Menchaca, Aldo A.14aThe molecular basis of chloroquine block of the inward rectifier Kir2.1 channel  ap. 1364-1368.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough chloroquine remains an important therapeutic agent for treatment of malaria in many parts of the world, its safety margin is very narrow. Chloroquine inhibits the cardiac inward rectifier K⁺ current IK₁ and can induce lethal ventricular arrhythmias. In this study, we characterized the biophysical and molecular basis of chloroquine block of Kir2.1 channels that underlie cardiac IK₁. The voltage- and K⁺-dependence of chloroquine block implied that the binding site was located within the ion-conduction pathway. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed the location of the chloroquine-binding site within the cytoplasmic pore domain rather than within the transmembrane pore. Molecular modeling suggested that chloroquine blocks Kir2.1 channels by plugging the cytoplasmic conduction pathway, stabilized by negatively charged and aromatic amino acids within a central pocket. Unlike most ion-channel blockers, chloroquine does not bind within the transmembrane pore and thus can reach its binding site, even while polyamines remain deeper within the channel vestibule. These findings explain how a relatively low-affinity blocker like chloroquine can effectively block IK₁ even in the presence of high-affinity endogenous blockers. Moreover, our findings provide the structural framework for the design of safer, alternative compounds that are devoid of Kir2.1-blocking properties.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3aarrhythmia 3abinding sites 3achloroquine 3amalaria 3amargin of safety 3amolecular models 3apolyamines 3apotassium 3asite-directed mutagenesis1 aNavarro-Polanco, Ricardo A.1 aFerrer-Villada, Tania1 aRupp, Jason1 aSachse, Frank B.1 aTristani-Firouzi, Martin1 aSánchez-Chapula, José A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 29, v. 105, no. 4 p.1364-1368dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07081531053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080203b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02780naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245012900179300001600308520167400324650001501998650002002013650001002033650001802043650001302061650000902074650001902083650001402102650002702116650001002143700002402153700002202177773010502199852000902304856009202313946001302405655001202418IND4445789720221119085541.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444578972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7410.2010.00207.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCenzi De Ré, Francine10aGene and species trees reveal mitochondrial and nuclear discordance in the Drosophila cardini group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)  ap. 353-367.  aThe Drosophila cardini group includes 15 species, which are subdivided into the D. cardini and D. dunni subgroups. Although many phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed for this group during the last five decades (based on patterns of reproductive isolation, morphology of male genitalia, chromosomal inversions, isozyme variation, or molecular sequence data), these are mostly discordant with each other. We aimed to clarify some of the evolutionary patterns related to the origin of this incongruence, while also attempting to provide a better‐supported phylogenetic hypothesis for the D. cardini subgroup. For this purpose, sequences from three mitochondrial and three nuclear loci were gathered for at least eight species, and both individual gene trees and joint species tree estimates were evaluated. Although there was concordance among gene trees within each of the nuclear and mitochondrial sets, considerable incongruence was revealed in the comparisons between these two data sets. The branching position of D. neocardini was the main source of incongruence, and species trees reconstructed using different approaches with and without this species were particularly incongruent. In addition to providing a better approximation of the evolutionary history of the D. cardini group, this study suggests that incomplete lineage sorting or introgression may be biasing previous species tree estimates. More generally, the results also suggest that the use of supermatrix methods can lead to an overestimation of support for the inferred relationships, and highlight the potential effects of different taxon sampling strategies in phylogenetic reconstruction. 3aDrosophila 3adata collection 3agenes 3aintrogression 3aisozymes 3aloci 3amale genitalia 3aphylogeny 3areproductive isolation 3atrees1 aLoreto, Elgion L.S.1 aRobe, Lizandra J.0 tInvertebrate biology.g2010 Dec., v. 129, no. 4 p.353-367dBlackwell Publishing Incx1077-83067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7410.2010.00207.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02825naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245009400203300001800297506007600315520147100391506003701862650000801899650002901907650001901936650001901955650002101974650000801995650001202003650001102015650001802026650001602044650001402060700001902074773017202093852000902265856008302274930003302357946001302390655001202403IND4401289320221207052102.0080210e20080205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440128932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07073861052doi7 aPMC22341602pmcid7 a182528302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoos, Fortunat10aRates of change in natural and anthropogenic radiative forcing over the past 20,000 years  ap. 1425-1430.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe rate of change of climate codetermines the global warming impacts on natural and socioeconomic systems and their capabilities to adapt. Establishing past rates of climate change from temperature proxy data remains difficult given their limited spatiotemporal resolution. In contrast, past greenhouse gas radiative forcing, causing climate to change, is well known from ice cores. We compare rates of change of anthropogenic forcing with rates of natural greenhouse gas forcing since the Last Glacial Maximum and of solar and volcanic forcing of the last millennium. The smoothing of atmospheric variations by the enclosure process of air into ice is computed with a firn diffusion and enclosure model. The 20th century increase in CO₂ and its radiative forcing occurred more than an order of magnitude faster than any sustained change during the past 22,000 years. The average rate of increase in the radiative forcing not just from CO₂ but from the combination of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O is larger during the Industrial Era than during any comparable period of at least the past 16,000 years. In addition, the decadal-to-century scale rate of change in anthropogenic forcing is unusually high in the context of the natural forcing variations (solar and volcanoes) of the past millennium. Our analysis implies that global climate change, which is anthropogenic in origin, is progressing at a speed that is unprecedented at least during the last 22,000 years.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aanthropogenic activities 3acarbon dioxide 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aice 3amethane 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3atemperature 3avolcanoes1 aSpahni, Renato0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Feb. 5, v. 105, no. 5 p.1425-1430dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07073861053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle05434naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245015300175300001800328500001500346520286000361650002703221650002403248650001503272650001103287650002103298650002003319650002503339650002003364650002603384650003203410650001103442650001603453650001903469650002003488650001203508650001603520650002003536650001003556650000903566650001403575650002503589650003903614650003203653650003203685650001203717650003903729650003103768650003003799650003103829650003203860650004803892650002403940650001103964650001903975650003503994650003404029650000904063650003604072650001504108650004904123650002104172650001604193650002904209653001804238653002304256653001204279653000904291700001504300700001404315700001604329773007504345852000904420856008004429930003304509945001304542946001304555655001204568IND2331073220221119085323.0030228e200208  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233107322DNAL7 a122113102pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.8.11722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViveros, A.10aEffects of microbial phytase supplementation on mineral utilization and serum enzyme activities in broiler chicks fed different levels of phosphorus  ap. 1172-1183.  a2019-12-04  aAn experiment was conducted to study the effect of microbial phytase (Natuphos 500) supplementation in chicks (0 to 6 wk of age) fed different levels of nonphytate phosphorus (nPP) on performance, mineral retention, bone and plasma minerals and serum enzyme activities. Data were analyzed as a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two levels of nPP for age periods of 1-d-old to 3 wk (0.35 and 0.22%) and 3 to 6 wk (0.27 and 0.14%) and two levels of phytase (0 and 500 U/kg) in each period. A positive control, adequate in nPP and Ca without phytase, was used. The low-nPP diets caused a negative effect on the performance (P < 0.05) compared to the normal-nPP diet. Phytase had a favorable effect on weight gain at 3 wk (P < 0.004) and 6 wk (P < 0.0475) of age and on feed consumption only at 3 wk (P < 0.0106). Feed efficiency was not affected at any stage by addition of phytase. Performances of chicks fed with 0.35 and 0.27% nPP and phytase were comparable to those obtained with the normal-nPP diets. Decreasing nPP content in the diet increased (P < 0.0001) P retention at 3 and 6 wk of age, increased Mg retention at 6 wk, and decreased (P < 0.0001) Ca and Zn retentions at 3 and 6 wk, respectively. Phytase supplementation increased (P < 0.0001) Ca, P, Mg, and Zn retention at 3 and 6 wk of age. Likewise, the decrease in nPP content in the diet caused a significant reduction of tibia ash (P < 0.0023) and Mg content (P < 0.0001) in tibia ash and reduced liver (P < 0.0240), spleen (P < 0.0176), and tibia (P < 0.0001) weights. Similarly, Ca (P < 0.0369) and Zn (P < 0.0181) contents in tibia ash were increased in response to decreasing nPP levels in the diet. Phytase supplementation increased tibia weight (P < 0.0019), tibia ash (P < 0.0021), and Mg (P < 0.0339) and Zn (P < 0.0353) concentrations and reduced (P < 0.0161) the relative liver weight. By decreasing nPP levels in the diet, plasma Ca (P < 0.0001), Mg (P < 0.0001) and Zn (P < 0.0048) concentrations, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (P < 0.0299) increased, and plasma P content (P < 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity (P < 0.0001), and total protein (TP) content (P < 0.0050) were reduced. Phytase supplementation increased plasma P level (P < 0.0001) and serum AST activity (P < 0.0049), reduced plasma Ca (P < 0.0001) and Mg (P < 0.0050) contents, and reduced serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P < 0.0048), ALP (P < 0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P < 0.0192) activities. Plasma Zn was not affected by phytase supplementation. These results demonstrated that microbial phytase supplementation to low-P diets improved performance; P, Ca, Mg, and Zn use; and tibia weight and relative liver weight in broiler chickens. Likewise, serum AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH activities, as well as TP concentration, were also affected by phytase supplementation. 3aaspartate transaminase 3abone mineralization 3aphosphorus 3achicks 3abroiler chickens 3abioavailability 3aalanine transaminase 3aliveweight gain 3alactate dehydrogenase 3adietary mineral supplements 3aweight 3ablood serum 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3acalcium 3afeed intake 3aenzyme activity 3aliver 3azinc 3amagnesium 3aalkaline phosphatase 2a6-Phytasexadministration & dosage 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aBlood Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aCalcification, Physiologic 2aCalciumxbloodxmetabolism. 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aEating 2aEnzymesxblood 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenasexblood 2aMagnesiumxbloodxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMineralsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aOrgan Size 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aTibiaxchemistry 2aWeight Gain 2aZincxbloodxmetabolism. 0ablood protein 0amineral absorption 0aphytase 0adiet1 aBrenes, A.1 aArija, I.1 aCenteno, C.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Aug., v. 81, no. 8 p.1172-1183x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.8.11723Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02397naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245009700175300001800272500001500290520077700305650001601082650001401098650001201112650001101124650001201135650001801147650001801165650001401183650002101197650001201218650002401230650002701254650001201281650001201293650002101305650002401326650002101350650002001371650001401391650001601405650001901421650001201440650001001452653001101462653001101473653000901484653001101493653001101504700001801515700001501533773007501548852000901623856008001632930003301712945001301745946001301758655001201771IND2331074820221119085339.0030228e200208  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233107482DNAL7 a122113192pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.8.12432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeumier, F.10aSoaking turkey meat in salt-glucose syrup solutions--an experimental study of mass transfers  ap. 1243-1250.  a2019-12-04  aTurkey meat can be salted and dried in one step by soaking in a concentrated salt-glucose syrup solution at low temperature. Sugar impregnation is minimal; only low molecular weight sugars generally penetrate the product. Glucose uptake is very quick, suggesting the possible involvement of passive glucose transporters. The operational scope of this process, depending on the targeted end-product features, was determined for turkey meat on the basis of clearly characterized mass transport phenomena between the product and the soaking solution. With 2 cm thick meat fillets processed at 10 C it is thus possible to obtain salted-dried end-products containing 2 to 10% salt and 35 to 70% water, ranges that are compatible with a broad range of commercial cured products. 3aturkey meat 3asolutions 3aglucose 3asyrups 3asalting 3awater content 3amass transfer 3ameat cuts 3aoligosaccharides 2aAnimals 2aChemistry, Physical 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aGlucose 2aMaltose 2aOligosaccharides 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPoultry Products 2aSodium Chloride 2aSolutions 2aTemperature 2aTrisaccharides 2aTurkeys 2aWater 0asugars 0acuring 0asalt 0auptake 0alosses1 aCollignan, A.1 aBohuon, P.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Aug., v. 81, no. 8 p.1243-1250x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.8.12433Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03534naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245017800172300001600350500002400366520210600390650001202496650001102508650001802519650001802537650001202555650001102567650002702578650001902605650001102624650001302635650001502648650002002663653003002683653001802713653001402731653002602745653001702771653001702788653002502805653003102830653001502861653001002876773010202886852000902988856005502997655001203052IND4398982020221119085643.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439898202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01311.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Kazuharu14aThe leaf mass/number trade-off of Kleiman and Aarssen implies constancy of leaf biomass, its density and carbon uptake in forest stands: scaling up from shoot to stand level  ap. 188-191.  aIncludes references  a1. Kleiman & Aarssen (2007 ) propose that the regression slope of the mean individual leaf mass across species vs. the number of leaves does not differ significantly from -1.0, based on log-transformed experimental data for tree shoots (i.e. isometric trade-off). A quantitative model is set out here that explains the mechanism of isometric trade-off of leaf mass/number across species. 2. From Kleiman and Aarssen's result for the leaf mass/number trade-off in trees, the constancy of leaf biomass density per unit volume of shoot is derived theoretically. This constancy may scale up to the tree crown level, assuming proportionality of total shoot volume and crown volume, and also up to the canopy at stand level, based on the observed proportionality between crown depth and tree height. 3. On the basis of the constancy of leaf biomass density, the constancy of leaf biomass in a fully closed forest stand is analysed, since tree height tends to a limit as tree age increases due to hydraulic constraints. The resulting constancy of leaf biomass is consistent with previous reports for actual forest stands. 4. The allometric scaling theory of Enquist and colleagues suggests that metabolic rates of an entire organism scale as the 3/4 power of mass, so that scale-up is important: indeed, scaling up may be related to tree physiology and ecosystem carbon balance. The present scaling model from shoot to forest stand level is consistent with the work of Enquist and colleagues. The scaled-up result of leaf biomass constancy indicates that carbon uptake by forest stands may be almost constant if the mean leaf photosynthetic rate remains constant after closure of the forest canopy. 5. Synthesis. By analytically explaining the mechanism of the leaf mass/number trade-off at shoot level proposed by Kleiman and Aarssen, it is predicted that leaf biomass and carbon uptake are constant in fully closed forest stands, by scaling up the constancy of leaf biomass density from shoot to canopy level. The present analysis provides the theoretical basis for leaf biomass constancy in forest stands. 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aforest canopy 3aforest stands 3aforests 3aleaves 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aphotosynthesis 3ashoots 3atree age 3atree crown 3atree physiology 0aallometric scaling theory 0acarbon uptake 0aconstancy 0aforest canopy closure 0aforest stand 0aleaf biomass 0aleaf biomass density 0aleaf mass/number trade-off 0ascaling up 0ashoot0 tjournal of ecology.g2008 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.188-191dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01311.x 7aarticle02170naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003300145245009100178300001600269500002400285520132300309650001001632650002601642650002201668650001501690650001101705651001001716773009701726852000901823856004801832655001201880IND4417400520221119085453.0090306e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441740052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-009-9325-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz-Reinoso, José Carlos10aBoundaries and scales in shrublands of the Doñana Biological Reserve, southwest Spain  ap. 509-518.  aIncludes references  aTo verify that the stabilized sand dunes of Doñana, southwest Spain, are hierarchically nested, vegetation was sampled along topographic gradients at three spatial scales and Split Moving Window Boundary Analysis was applied to identify vegetation boundaries and ecotones. At small scale, only one window width was used, while for boundaries detection at upper scales the information from five windows was pooled. Environmental factors controlling plant composition were studied along topographic gradients, and diversity was estimated within the boundaries. According to several theoretical frameworks, I discuss the types of boundaries produced at different scales. Lower level boundaries are characterized by transitory gradients linked to local exchanges; intermediate boundaries are symmetric and very stable over the time; the large scale boundary is asymmetric with strong inherent abiotic constraints reinforced by strong biotic feedbacks. In spite of a similar plant composition, a plant community, the mixed shrub, works as an ecocline or an ecotone depending on the spatial scale considered. A certain parallelism exists between shrub composition along dune slopes and dune generations; however, processes at upper scale constraint plant composition at lower scale resulting in different mature formations. 3adunes 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant communities 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3aSpain0 tLandscape ecology.g2009 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.509-518dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-009-9325-0 7aarticle02647naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001700159245007200176300001800248520102000266650001301286650002101299650002301320650001401343650002501357650002101382650004101403650002501444650001201469650002301481650001801504650001101522650002501533650005501558650003801613650003401651650005701685650002401742650003801766650001701804653003401821700001801855700002001873773007601893852000901969856008001978930003302058945001302091946001302104655001202117IND2330859020221119085408.0030218e200209  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233085902DNAL7 a122696102pmid7 a10.1093/ps/81.9.13172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVleugels, B.10aStimulatory effect of CpG sequences on humoral response in chickens  ap. 1317-1321.  aOligonucleotides containing the dinucleotide CpG have an immunostimulatory effect in mammals. The CpG motif is interpreted as a signal of prokaryote invasion by the innate immune system and consequently activates defense mechanisms. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the immunostimulatory actions of CpG oligonucleotides take place in birds as well. To this end, birds were immunized with BSA and the serum antibody response was followed. A significantly higher BSA-specific response was observed in the CpG-treated group. Moreover, immunostimulatory DNA resulted in more persistent responses to immunization. After only one immunization, titers as high as in booster responses were observed in the CpG-treated birds. The effects were shown to depend on the presence of an unmethylated CpG core sequence in the DNA, because the reversal of CpG to GpC even caused a decrease in antibody response. These findings demonstrate that CpG oligonucleotides could be a valuable adjuvant for poultry vaccines. 3achickens 3ahumoral immunity 3aantibody formation 3aadjuvants 3anucleotide sequences 3aoligonucleotides 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxpharmacology 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aChickensximmunology 2aDinucleoside Phosphatesximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFreund's Adjuvantximmunology 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aRegression Analysis 2aSerum Albumin, Bovineximmunology 2aTime Factors 0anonspecific immunostimulation1 aVerverken, C.1 aGoddeeris, B.M.0 tPoultry science.g2002 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.1317-1321x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/81.9.13173Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01466naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100001600161245008000177300001600257520066300273650002100936650002300957700001800980773009500998852000901093856005701102939003301159945000801192655001201200991588132610742620221119085542.0780101e197709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7791167162DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0853912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhoot, G.K.10aOrganization and alkaloid production in tissue cultures of Hyoscyamus niger  ap. 943-949.  aCallus and cell suspension cultures were established from Hyoscyamus niger seedlings and their growth requirements investigated.

In addition, association between vibrios and sediment-inhabiting meiofauna, which is a major component of benthic ecosystems, was investigated. Culturable and total Vibrio spp. estimates by most-probable-number technique coupled with standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR methods, respectively, were at least one order of magnitude higher in sediment than in seawater. In addition, potential human pathogenic species Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus occurred in the sediment with V. parahaemolyticus being the most frequently found. In the pelagic environment, 60% of total variance in culturable Vibrio data was explained by sea surface temperature (40%), salinity (13%) and organic matter concentration (7%). In the benthic environment, sea surface temperature was the only factor that significantly affected culturable Vibrio occurrence although it explained only 25% of total variance, suggesting that additional unexplored factors may play a role as well. No correlation was found between culturable Vibrio spp. concentrations and the abundance of harpacticoid copepods in the sediment whilst a negative correlation was found between Vibrio spp. and nematode abundance which accounted for almost 90% of the total meiofaunal density. Taxonomic analysis revealed that selective bacterial feeders accounted for nearly 50% of the total nematode community and included genera such as Terschellingia, Molgolaimus and Halalaimus, suggesting that top-down control by nematode grazing may be an important factor affecting Vibrio occurrence in these sediments. It is concluded that the benthic marine environment may function as a reservoir of Vibrio spp. and potential pathogenic vibrios whose ecological features appeared substantially different from the ones recognised in the pelagic environment. 3aCopepoda 3aMediterranean climate 3aVibrio cholerae 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aVibrio vulnificus 3abenthic zone 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agrazing 3anematode control 3aorganic matter 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asediments 3asurface temperature 3avariance 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aEcosystem 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aRegression Analysis 2aSeasons 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology 2aTemperature 2aVibrioxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aWater Microbiology 3aItaly 3aMediterranean Sea 0aMediterranean Sea1 aPezzati, Elisabetta1 aMoreno, Mariapaola1 aFabiano, Mauro1 aPane, Luigi1 aPruzzo, Carla0 tMicrobial ecology.g2009 Nov., v. 58, no. 4 p.808-818dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-009-9542-8 7aarticle01810naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100002400161245006900185300001600254520100400270650002101274650002301295650002401318773009501342852000901437856005701446939003301503945000801536655001201544991588132540742620221119085304.0780101e197709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7791167122DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0853872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeslop-Harrison, Y.14aThe pollen stigma interaction: pollen tube penetration in Crocus  ap. 913-922.  aIn a compatible pollination in Crocus, pollen tube tips enter the stigma papillae after the enzymic erosion of the cuticle, and the tubes continue downward growth towards the ovary between the cuticle and the underlying pectocellulosic wall. The cuticle of the receptive zone of the stigma papilla is chambered, the chambers containing a secretion accumulated during the maturation of the stigma. Pollen exudates contain various acid hydrolases, but are incapable alone of eroding stigma cutin. Furthermore, there is no penetration when the proteins of the wall-held stigma secretions are degraded enzymically. These facts are taken to indicate that the pollen contributes a ‘cutinase’ precursor which is activated by a factor or factors held in the stigma secretion. Pollens of certain Cruciferae produce tubes capable of penetrating the Crocus stigma cuticle, suggesting that notwithstanding the taxonomic remoteness of Cruciferae and Iridaceae the enzyme activation systems are quite similar. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3ahorticultural crops0 tAnnals of botany.g1977 Sept., v. 41, no. 175 p.913-922wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a085387  a00000000b19780101c00000000  aIND 7aarticle03737naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001500181245011600196300001800312500002400330506007600354520145000430506003701880650002001917650001101937650001801948650001301966650001601979650001001995650001202005650001802017650001402035650001302049650001302062650000902075650001202084650001202096650001402108650001702122650001302139650001202152650005102164650004402215650002402259650003402283650003302317650002802350650002702378650003102405650002402436650001102460650003502471650000902506650002402515650003202539650004202571650007202613650007402685700001402759700001702773700001902790773011702809852000902926856008002935655001203015IND4423305220221207071408.0090718s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442330522DNAL7 a194707482pmid7 aPMC27156792pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01197-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNygren, E.10aEstablishment of an Adult Mouse Model for Direct Evaluation of the Efficacy of Vaccines against Vibrio cholerae  ap. 3475-3484.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe here a new animal model that offers the prospect of using conventional adult mice for direct evaluation of the protective potential of new cholera vaccines. Pretreatment of adult mice with oral streptomycin allowed intestinal colonization by streptomycin-resistant Vibrio cholerae strains of either the O1 or the O139 serogroup. Bacteria were recovered in greatest numbers from the cecum and large intestine, but recoveries from all regions of the gut correlated significantly with bacterial excretion in fresh fecal pellets, which thus provides a convenient indicator of the extent and duration of gut colonization. Mice immunized mucosally or systemically with viable or inactivated V. cholerae were shown to be comparatively refractory to colonization after challenge with the immunizing strain. Several variables were examined to optimize the model, the most significant being the size of the challenge inoculum; surprisingly, a smaller challenge dose resulted in more consistent and sustained colonization. Studies with mutant strains unable to produce cholera toxin or toxin-coregulated pili revealed that neither factor contributed significantly to colonization potential. Protection against V. cholerae challenge was shown to be serogroup restricted, and significant inverse correlations were detected between serum and intestinal anti-lipopolysaccharide antibody responses and the levels of excretion of challenge organisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVibrio cholerae 3aadults 3aanimal models 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3acecum 3acholera 3acholera toxin 3aexcretion 3afimbriae 3ainoculum 3amice 3amutants 3apellets 3aserotypes 3astreptomycin 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxanalysisxblood. 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aCholeraxprevention & control 2aCholera Vaccinesximmunology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aIntestine, Largexmicrobiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMucous Membraneximmunology 2aStreptomycinxadministration & dosage 2aVibrio cholerae O1xdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aVibrio cholerae O139xdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentximmunology.1 aLi, B.-L.1 aHolmgren, J.1 aAttridge, S.R.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 Aug., v. 77, no. 8 p.3475-3484dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01197-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03372naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245008300174300001600257500027400273520173700547650002202284650001902306650001402325650001502339650001202354650000902366650001802375650002302393650001502416650001502431650001402446650001202460650001502472650002002487650002202507650001902529650000902548650000802557650001802565650001402583651001302597700001802610700001402628700001502642773014502657856005502802852000902857655001202866IND60563460220221119085309.0170221e20161125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056346022DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1128.432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHakimien, A.

In Malaysia, the main biomass source is oil palm (94%). However, there exists a number of underutilised biomass species which could provide abundant, sustainable, ecosystem resilient and cost effective sources of biomass for renewable energy in addition to oil palm. This research aims to explore the potential of a novel biomass crop to mitigate the overdependence on oil palm as a source of biomass. Nypa palm (Nypa fruticans) is a monospecific genus palm endemic to estuaries in the South-East Asia region. In the past, the sap from this palm was traditionally harvested for beverages while leaflets was used in roofing thatching. However, these practices are slowly dwindling as local opt for higher paid jobs. Historically, alcohol from Nypa sap was used as fuel before World War II but this local industry collapsed at the arrival of the oil economy. Recent studies examining for new fuel alternatives suggested that Nypa sap has the potential to become a bioethanol feedstock. In particular, its high sugar content has been reported to have a potential ethanol yield of 8,200-15,400 L ha-1 y-1 under optimum conditions, which is higher than current yields obtained for commercial sugarcane or maize. Nypa also has potential as a lignocellulosic feedstock for conversion into multiple products, particularly for industrial (green chemicals) and medicinal purposes. Studies on genetic diversity, plantation management and cost analysis for biofuel production are lacking and needed to be carried out. This paper explores the potential of the crop to be a complementary source of biomass production to oil palm. 3aElaeis guineensis 3aNypa fruticans 3abeverages 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3acorn 3acost analysis 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystems 3aemployment 3aestuaries 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3agenetic variation 3alignocellulose 3aoils 3asap 3asugar content 3asugarcane 3aMalaysia1 aAlshareef, I.1 aHo, W.

Platelet ice algae remained highly shade adapted throughout the spring as shown by their low photoadaptive index (Ek, 3.7-8.4 μmol photons·m⁻²·s⁻¹), low mean specific absorption coefficient (<0.009 m² mg⁻¹ Chl a), high optical cross-sectional area of photosystem II (σPSII, 3.0-8.2), and high molar ratio of fucoxanthin:chlorophyll a (mean = 1.62 ± 0.15 SD). Between 24 October and 8 November, the algae exhibited a photoacclimative response that was marked by a 30% decrease in photosynthetic efficiency (αB), a 75% decrease in maximum photosynthetic rate (PB/ m), and a 60% increase in σPSII. The photochemical conversion efficiency at photosystem II (Fv/Fm= ca. 0.5) and the quantum yield of photosynthesis (ØC= 0.062- 0.078 mol C mol⁻¹ photons) were ca. 80% of their maximal values. After 8 November, changes in algal photophysiology and biochemistry, which were inconsistent with a photoacclimation response, suggest that the platelet ice algae near the platelet/congelation ice interface became increasingly nutrient limited. The number of pennate diatoms increased threefold to 150 × 10⁹ cells m⁻³ between 8 and 14 November, then remained unchanged throughout the remainder of the field season. Following the increase in cell number, Fv/Fm, ØC, and C:Chla decreased by >40%, σPSII increased by 70%; and the biochemical ratios C:N and C:Si increased 25%-30%. Nutrient depletion was apparent from the high-resolution vertical profiles, but nutrient concentrations limiting algal growth were not observed. However, nutrient concentrations at the likely site of nutrient limitation near the platelet/congelation ice interface were not measured, indicating that higher resolution sampling is necessary to fully characterize this highly variable habitat. 3aBacillariophyta 3ahabitats 3aice 3amicroalgae 3anutrient content 3aphotosystem II 3aspring 3aAntarctica 3aMcMurdo Sound1 aArrigo, Kevin R.1 aKolber, Zbigniew1 aGosselin, Michel1 aSullivan, Cornelius W.0 tJournal of phycology.g1998 Oct., v. 34, no. 5 p.788-797dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-36467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340788.x 7aarticle03465naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001800183245012900201300001800330500002400348506007600372520107600448506003701524650002501561650001201586650001801598650003001616650001201646650002801658650001201686650001301698650001601711650007701727650004801804650004501852650001801897650002601915650002301941650002201964650003401986650005202020650003902072650002302111650006102134650002202195650004902217650003802266650002502304650004202329700001902371700002002390700001502410700002002425700001702445700002102462700001602483700001802499700002002517773010902537852000902646856008202655856003002737655001202767IND4399723520221207065229.0080106e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439972352DNAL7 a180556102pmid7 aPMC21748842pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.107.0538762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoh, Tatsuaki10aVPS9a, the Common Activator for Two Distinct Types of Rab5 GTPases, Is Essential for the Development of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 3504-3515.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRab5, a subfamily of Rab GTPases, regulates a variety of endosomal functions as a molecular switch. Arabidopsis thaliana has two different types of Rab5-member GTPases: conventional type, ARA7 and RHA1, and a plant-specific type, ARA6. We found that only one guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), named VPS9a, can activate all Rab5 members to GTP-bound forms in vitro in spite of their diverged structures. In the vps9a-1 mutant, whose GEF activity is completely lost, embryogenesis was arrested at the torpedo stage. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ARA7 and ARA6-GFP were diffused in cytosol like GDP-fixed mutants of Rab5 in vps9a-1, indicating that both types of GTPase are regulated by VPS9a. In the leaky vps9a-2 mutant, elongation of the primary root was severely affected. Overexpression of the GTP-fixed form of ARA7 suppressed the vps9a-2 mutation, but overexpression of ARA6 had no apparent effects. These results indicate that the two types of plant Rab5 members are functionally differentiated, even though they are regulated by the same activator, VPS9a.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acytosol 3aembryogenesis 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aguanine 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3amutants 3amutation 3aroot growth 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Membrane Structuresxultrastructure 2aCell Polarity 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEnzyme Activatorsxmetabolism 2aGuanine Nucleotide Exchange Factorsxmetabolism 2aGuanosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aProtein Transport 2aSeedsxcytologyxenzymologyxultrastructure. 2aSubcellular Fractionsxmetabolism 2aSuppression, Genetic 2arab5 GTP-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism1 aUchida, Wakana1 aArakawa, Satoko1 aItō, Emi.1 aDainobu, Tomoko1 aEbine, Kazuo1 aTakeuchi, Masaki1 aSatō, Ken.1 aUeda, Takashi1 aNakano, Akihiko0 tplant cell.g2007 Nov., v. 19, no. 11 p.3504-3515dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.107.0538763Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle03494naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001800168245012900186300001600315500002400331520156900355650001201924650001301936650001601949650001401965650001201979650001801991650001102009650003202020650001902052650002202071650000902093650002002102650001202122650001802134650001602152650008702168650002602255650003802281650007102319650002402390650000902414650006002423650003502483650004602518650000902564650002502573650005202598650004502650700001702695700001902712773011202731852000902843856005202852655001202904IND4442828020221119085200.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444282802DNAL7 a199549532pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Jae-Sung10aDietary fish oil inhibits the early stage of recovery of atrophied soleus muscle in rats via Akt-p70s6k signaling and PGF2α  ap. 929-934.  aIncludes references  aSkeletal muscle recovery from disuse atrophy requires the recruitment of insulin signaling for muscle growth, which is driven by protein synthesis. Dietary fish oil, which is rich in long-chain n−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is known to enhance insulin signaling and protein metabolism. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate whether dietary fish oil facilitates muscle recovery during remobilization after disuse atrophy. Ten days of immobilization, followed by 3 or 13 days of remobilization, were applied to the hindlimbs of rats fed corn oil [corn oil diet group as control (CO)] or fish oil [fish oil diet group (FO)] as source of dietary fat. The immobilization-induced reductions in soleus muscle weight and myosin heavy-chain content were significantly restored by 3 days of remobilization in CO. However, in FO, these muscle recovery measurements did not significantly change until 13 days of remobilization. At 3 days of remobilization, both groups had significant elevations in p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70s6k) activation and at a greater extent in CO than in FO. The activation of Akt was also increased on Day 3, but it was not significant in FO. Throughout the remobilization period, levels of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA were significantly augmented. However, FO had a lesser increase in PGF2α than CO until Day 13. These findings indicate that dietary fish oil inhibits the early stage of soleus muscle recovery after disuse atrophy by suppressing the activation of Akt-p70s6k signaling and PGF2α synthesis. 3aatrophy 3acorn oil 3adietary fat 3afish oils 3ainsulin 3amessenger RNA 3amyosin 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprostaglandins 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3askeletal muscle 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDinoprostxmetabolism 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFish Oilsxadministration & dosagexpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHindlimb Suspension 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMuscular Atrophyxdrug therapy 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aRibosomal Protein S6 Kinasesxmetabolism1 aPark, Mi Na.1 aLee, Yeon-Sook0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2010 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.929-934dElsevier Sciencex0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2009.07.007 7aarticle02572naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072001700168072001700185100001600202245006200218300001600280520127700296650001701573650001401590650002801604650002101632650001901653650002501672650001601697650001901713650002401732650002501756650002301781650001801804650002301822650002501845650002501870700001601895773006901911852000901980856008901989945002502078946001102103655001202114IND4361966720221119084948.0040407e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436196672DNAL7 a220611292pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Analyses confirm that involvement in meat is a multidimensional construct including four facets: pleasure value, symbolic value, risk importance and risk probability. Four involvement-based meat consumer segments are identified: straightforward, cautious, indifferent, and concerned. Socio-demographic differences between the segments relate to gender, age and presence of children. The segments differ in terms of extensiveness of the decision-making process, impact and trust in information sources, levels of concern, price consciousness, claimed meat consumption, consumption intention, and preferred place of purchase. The two segments with a strong perception of meat risks constitute two-thirds of the market. They can be typified as cautious meat lovers versus concerned meat consumers. Efforts aiming at consumer reassurance through quality improvement, traceability, labelling or communication may gain effectiveness when targeted specifically to these two segments. Whereas straightforward meat lovers focus mainly on taste as the decisive criterion, indifferent consumers are strongly price oriented. 3ameat quality 3afreshness 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3aconsumer surveys 3aquestionnaires 3aconsumer information 3aadvertising 3afood marketing 3amarket segmentation 3asocioeconomic status 3agender differences 3aeating habits 3aconsumer attitudes 3aconsumer preferences 3aprobability analysis1 aVackier, I.0 tMeat science.g2004 May, v. 67, no. 1 p.159-168x0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2003.09.0173Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdPNNe2004/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03052naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012300168300001400291520185100305650002002156650002102176650002502197650002302222650002202245650001402267650002302281650001702304650001202321650001302333650002002346651000902366700001902375700001602394773007402410852000902484856009202493930003302585945001302618946001102631655001202642IND2333525020221118023244.0030711e200302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233352502DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00739.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooth, M.S.10aOverlapping resource use in three Great Basin species: implications for community invasibility and vegetation dynamics  ap. 36-48.  a1. In the Great Basin of the western United States of America, the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum has extensively replaced native shrub and bunchgrass communities, but the native bunchgrass Elymus elymoides has been reported to suppress Bromus. Curlew Valley, a site in Northern Utah, provides a model community to test the effects of particular species on invasion by examining competitive relationships among Elymus, Bromus and the native shrub Artemisia tridentata. 2. The site contains Bromus/Elymus, Elymus/Artemisia and monodominant Elymus stands. Transect data indicate that Elymus suppresses Bromus disproportionately relative to its above-ground cover. Artemisia seedlings recruit in Elymus stands but rarely in the presence of Bromus. This relationship might be explained by competition between the two grasses involving a different resource or occurring in a different season to that between each grass and Artemisia. 3. Time reflectometry data collected in monodominant patches indicated that in spring, soil moisture use by Bromus is rapid, whereas depletion under Elymus and Artemisia is more moderate. Artemisia seedlings may therefore encounter a similar moisture environment in monodominant or mixed perennial stands. However, efficient autumn soil moisture use by Elymus may help suppress Bromus. 4. In competition plots, target Artemisia grown with Bromus were stunted relative to those grown with Elymus, despite equivalent above-ground biomass of the two grasses. Competition for nitrogen in spring and autumn, assessed with 15N tracer, appears to be secondary to moisture availability in determining competitive outcomes. 5. Elymus physiology and function appear to play an important role in determining the composition of communities in Curlew Valley, by maintaining zones free of Bromus where Artemisia can recruit. 3aBromus tectorum 3aElymus elymoides 3aArtemisia tridentata 3aintroduced species 3aplant competition 3aseedlings 3asoil water content 3awater uptake 3abiomass 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aUtah1 aCaldwell, M.M.1 aStark, J.M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2003 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.36-48x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00739.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02799naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001100183245010300194300001600297500001500313520135700328650002501685650001201710650001201722650001201734650001501746650002101761650002101782650001201803650001001815650001301825650001701838650002501855650001201880650001201892650001901904653001401923653001801937653002001955653001901975700001801994773010402012852000902116856012302125930003302248945001302281946001102294655001202305IND2163470420221118022948.0980818e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216347042DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199704)73:4<503::AID-JSFA762>3.0.CO;2-Z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, A.10aEffect of cooking and pre-cooking on cell-wall chemistry in relation to firmness of carrot tissues  ap. 503-512.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this work was to investigate heat-induced changes in cell wall polysaccharides of carrot in relation to texture. Discs of fresh carrot (Daucus carota cv Amstrong) tissue were subjected to cooking (100 degrees C, 20 min), with or without a pre-cooking treatment (50 degrees C, 30 min). Alcohol-insoluble residues were prepared from the tissues and were extracted sequentially with water, NaCl, CDTA, Na2CO3 and 0.5 M KOH to leave a residue. These were analysed for their carbohydrate compositions, their degree of methyl esterification and the molecular size of selected soluble polysaccharides. Cooking caused tissues to soften. This involved cell separation, an increase in water- and salt-soluble, high-molecular-weight pectic polysaccharides and a concomitant decrease in the pectic polymers in all wall extracts and the residue. Pre-cooking prior to cooking enhanced cell-cell adhesion and reduced the extent of softening. This was accompanied by a general reduction in the degree of methylesterification of cell-wall pectic polymers, and a decrease in the cooking-induced modification to all pectic fractions. The firming effect of pre-cooking could be reversed by extracting the precooked + cooked tissue with CDTA, a chelating agent. The role of Ca2+ cross-linked polymers and pre-cooking in the enhancement of firmness are discussed. 3achemical composition 3aboiling 3atexture 3apectins 3acell walls 3achelating agents 3amolecular weight 3acalcium 3acells 3afirmness 3apretreatment 3acell wall components 3acarrots 3acooking 3ainorganic ions 0aadhesions 0acarbohydrates 0apolysaccharides 0aheat treatment1 aWaldron, K.W.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 Apr., v. 73, no. 4 p.503-512x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199704)73:4<503::AID-JSFA762>3.0.CO;2-Z3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02904naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001500183245012300198300001600321500001500337520150700352650001301859650001701872650001001889650001101899650001601910650001401926650002901940650002601969650001301995650002002008653002802028653001502056653002902071653002702100653002202127700001602149773010402165852000902269856012302278930003302401945001302434946001102447655001202458IND2163738320221118023051.0980831e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216373832DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199707)74:3<294::AID-JSFA720>3.0.CO;2-B2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, G.12aA rheological study of mechanical dough development and long fermentation processes for cream-cracker dough production  ap. 294-300.  a2019-12-04  aIn the manufacture of products such as bread and cream-crackers mechanical development and long fermentation processes are used to develop dough. A rheological study of cream-cracker doughs made using both types of process has shown that fermentation weakens, but does not rearrange, intermolecular interactions. The rearrangement of storage proteins into a continuous network of gluten is achieved by the shearing action of mixing, which need only be gentle after a sufficient period of fermentation, but must be intense if prior fermentation is omitted, as in mechanical dough development. In the long fermentation process a dough with the desired characteristics was produced following a minimum of 4 h fermentation time. Dough with similar rheology was produced by mechanical development when additional water was used in the recipe. For mechanically developed cream-cracker doughs there was also an increase in the elasticity of the developed gluten. When the Chorleywood Bread Process was invented it was found that more water and less protein were required to achieve the same dough rheology as in long fermentation processes. It seems that the same relationship between mechanical dough development and long fermentation may apply to other products, such as cream-crackers. These results confirm that the technological experience gained by switching from long fermentation to mechanical dough development processes for bread production could be applied to other products such as cream-crackers. 3acrackers 3afermentation 3adough 3amixing 3awheat flour 3aviscosity 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amodulus of elasticity 3aduration 3afood technology 0asponge and dough method 0aelasticity 0asponge and dough process 0arheological properties 0adough phase angle1 aBrock, C.J.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 July, v. 74, no. 3 p.294-300x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199707)74:3<294::AID-JSFA720>3.0.CO;2-B3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02569naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001900183245010500202300001600307500001500323520118500338650001701523650002501540650002301565650002701588650001701615650001601632650001601648653002501664653001901689653000901708653001101717653001801728653003001746700001601776700001601792700002201808773010401830852000901934856012301943930003302066945001302099946001102112655001202123IND2163739120221118023237.0980831e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216373912DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199707)74:3<308::AID-JSFA803>3.0.CO;2-N2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarrauri, J.A.10aSeasonal changes in the composition and properties of high dietary fibre powder from grapefruit peel  ap. 308-312.  a2019-12-04  aSeasonal changes in composition and properties of a high dietary fibre product from grapefruit peel were studied. Total dietary fibre decreased in January as compared to September (586-686 g kg-1). Main constituents from soluble fibre were: uronic acids (172-233 g kg-1), arabinose (13-41 g kg-1), galactose (4-11 g kg-1), glucose (5-10 g kg-1) and xylose (2-3 g kg-1). Insoluble dietary fibre (385-392 g kg-1) did not significantly change during the season. Its main constituents were: Klason lignin (29-37 g kg-1), uronic acids (33-70 g kg-1) and neutral sugars: glucose (149-196 g kg-1), mannose (45-50 g kg-1), xylose (25-38 g kg-1), galactose (20-22 g kg-1) and arabinose (16-45 g kg-1). Total neutral sugars from dietary fibre decreased over the harvest period (315-383 g kg-1) and an inverse trend was observed in total free-sugars from samples (49-85 g kg-1). Both, water holding capacity (7.0-9.3 g water g-1 dry sample) and glucose retardation index (7.0-25.3%) decreased from early stages in fruit development until late in the harvest season. Seasonal changes in grapefruit peel should be taken into account, in order to standardise the quality of rich fibre products. 3aharvest date 3amedicinal properties 3aseasonal variation 3awater holding capacity 3auronic acids 3acrude fiber 3agrapefruits 0achemical composition 0aneutral sugars 0apeel 0asugars 0afiber content 0aglucose retardation index1 aRuperez, P.1 aBorroto, B.1 aSaura-Calixto, F.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 July, v. 74, no. 3 p.308-312x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199707)74:3<308::AID-JSFA803>3.0.CO;2-N3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02139naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100002600183245006700209300001600276520086600292650001301158650001701171650002201188650002001210650002201230650002601252653002401278653001501302653001501317653002401332700002601356700002001382700001601402700001801418773010401436852000901540856012301549930003301672945001301705946001101718655001201729IND2164202620221118023120.0980922e199710  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216420262DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199710)75:2<167::AID-JSFA871>3.0.CO;2-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroek, L.A.M. van den10aPectin lyase is a key enzyme in the maceration of potato tuber  ap. 167-172.  aThe maceration of potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum cv Bintje) by technical enzyme preparations was examined with the aid of fluorescence microscopy using fluorescein diacetate as a dye. Treatment with Pectinex Ultra-SP-L from Aspergillus aculeatus resulted in a higher release of single viable cells and smaller clumps of cells than treatment with Rohament P from Aspergillus niger. Fractions with high pectin lyase and low polygalacturonase activity obtained by anion exchange chromatography of Pectinex Ultra SP-L showed the highest degree of maceration. When two different cloned polygalacturonases (PG1 and PG2) and a cloned pectin lyase (PL1) from A aculeatus were examined, the highest degree of maceration was observed with PL1. In conclusion, pectin lyase is probably the main enzyme in Pectinex Ultra-SP-L responsible for the maceration of potato tuber. 3apotatoes 3apectin lyase 3apolygalacturonase 3aenzyme activity 3aAspergillus niger 3aAspergillus aculeatus 0aenzyme preparations 0amacerating 0arohament p 0apectinex ultra-sp-l1 aAantrekker, E.D. den.1 aVoragen, A.G.J.1 aBeldman, G.1 aVincken, J.P.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 Oct., v. 75, no. 2 p.167-172x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199710)75:2<167::AID-JSFA871>3.0.CO;2-R3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02624naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001800183245011900201300001600320520118900336650001301525650002401538650001101562650001301573650001401586650002101600650004901621650001801670650001701688650001901705650002001724650001101744650001701755650002501772653001901797653002201816653001401838700002101852773010401873852000901977856012301986930003302109945001302142946001102155655001202166IND2164226920221118023221.0980923e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216422692DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199708)74:4<473::AID-JSFA819>3.0.CO;2-K2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, E.M.13aAn international collaborative blind trial on electron spin resonance (ESR) identification of irradiated crustacea  ap. 473-484.  aThe results of an interlaboratory collaborative trial are presented where 15 participating laboratories used the technique of ESR spectroscopy to detect three species of Crustacea irradiated in the frozen state and stored at -20 degrees C.

Long-term canopy dynamics in a large area of temperate old-growth beech forest in the Daisen Forest Reserve, south-western Japan (11.56 ha studied over 43 years), were investigated using digital elevation models (DEMs) of the canopy surface, constructed from aerial photographs taken in the growing season (i.e. with foliage) in 1958, 1978, 1992 and 2001. A ground surface DEM at the same resolution (a 2.5 x 2.5 m grid) was constructed using aerial photographs taken when foliage was absent (winter 2002). Canopy height data were obtained by calculating differences in elevation between the canopy and the ground surface, and a canopy height profile was constructed. 2. Topographic data for a 4-ha plot, located within the 11.56-ha area, were obtained via a ground survey and used to validate the ground surface DEM derived from aerial photographs. 3. Canopy height class distributions changed significantly over the 43 years. The total number of gaps, defined as areas where canopy height was less than or equal to 15 m, decreased but total gap area increased over time. Total gap area in 2001 was twice that of 1958. The density of gaps decreased as gap size increased. 4. Gap formation rates increased from 0.47% year(-1) (1958-78) to 1.30% year(-1) (1992-2001), with a mean of 0.77% year(-1), and substantially exceeded closure rates, which fluctuated from 0.28% year(-1) (1958-78) to 0.54% year(-1) (1978-92), with a mean of 0.39% year(-1). Gaps generally expanded and became connected to each other. 5. Temporal variation in gap formation and closure might be correlated with the frequency and severity of typhoon disturbances but, if the observed trends continue, this old-growth beech stand may become an open stand. The long-term dynamics of this forest type appear to be far from equilibrium. 3aFagus crenata 3aold-growth forests 3aforest trees 3acanopy gaps 3atree and stand measurements 3aaerial photography 3aforest growth 3atemporal variation 3aforest stands 3aimage analysis 3atyphoons 3aaltitude 3aheight 3asimulation models 3aunderstory 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3aspatial data 3aSasa 3aLindera 3aJapan 0aSasa kurilensis 0aSasa palmata 0aLindera umbellata 0acanopy height profile1 aItaya, A.1 aNishimura, N.1 aYamamoto, S.I.0 tJournal of ecology.g2004 Dec., v. 92, no. 6 p.945-953x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2004.00932.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080208b20080301c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/09/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02245naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001900183245009200202300001600294500001500310520083900325650001601164650002501180650001101205650001601216650001601232650001701248650001901265650002301284650001401307650002801321650001601349653001301365653001801378653001501396653001601411700002601427700001301453700001701466773010301483852000901586856012301595930003301718945001301751946001101764655001201775IND2163489520221118023104.0980819e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216348952DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199705)74:1<117::AID-JSFA777>3.0.CO;2-F2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, B.A.14aThe effect of extrusion conditions on the fermentability of wheat straw and corn silage  ap. 117-124.  a2019-12-04  aWheat (Triticum aestivum L) straw and corn (Zea mays L) silage were extruded under variable conditions of temperature and screw speed.

Extrusion treatment also led to significant differences, though the effect of screw speed and temperature were not always consistent. However, most differences in cumulative gas production were negative, particularly for wheat straw, which suggests that, under the conditions used, extrusion actually reduced the fermentability of the fibres. 3aacetic acid 3avolatile fatty acids 3ascrews 3awheat straw 3acorn silage 3abutyric acid 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3aextrusion 3aneutral detergent fiber 3atemperature 0ain vitro 0afiber content 0adry matter 0ascrew speed1 aPoel, A.F.B. van der.1 aBoer, H.1 aTamminga, S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 May, v. 74, no. 1 p.117-124x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199705)74:1<117::AID-JSFA777>3.0.CO;2-F3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03527naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001800203245010500221300001600326520212600342650002602468650001702494650001102511650002002522650001702542650002002559650002202579650001902601650002902620650001402649650002102663650001702684650001302701650001002714650000902724651001502733653002302748700001602771773007602787852000902863856009202872930003302964945002502997946001103022655001203033IND4371646420221118023114.0050622e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437164642DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0022-0477.2005.00992.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFalster, D.S.10aAlternative height strategies among 45 dicot rain forest species from tropical Queensland, Australia  ap. 521-535.  a1 Potential height, which spans at least an order of magnitude across species, is considered an important indicator of light capture strategy. Still, it remains unclear how potential height is coordinated with other traits that influence height growth rate, stem persistence and performance in low light. We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance. 2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass. 3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area(-1), leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient. 4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area(-1), lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient. 5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation. In several cases, trait relationships were weak or non-significant when species groupings were merged, indicating the importance of separating out the two sets for comparative studies. 3atropical rain forests 3aforest trees 3aheight 3asolar radiation 3aplant growth 3ashade tolerance 3aforest succession 3atree mortality 3aanthropogenic activities 3aleaf area 3anitrogen content 3awood density 3abranches 3aseeds 3amass 3aQueensland 0alight interception1 aWestoby, M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2005 June, v. 93, no. 3 p.521-535x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2005.00992.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080312b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02951naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001500183245011300198300001600311500001500327520138700342650002501729650001301754650000801767650001601775650002301791650001601814650001401830650001701844650001101861650001001872650002301882651001001905653003401915653001601949653001101965653002401976653001502000653001702015653001602032653001702048653003002065700001602095700001702111773010402128852000902232856012302241930003302364945001302397946001102410655001202421IND2163535320221118022942.0980821e199706  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216353532DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199706)74:2<209::AID-JSFA789>3.0.CO;2-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObanda, M.10aFlavanol composition and caffeine content of green leaf as quality potential indicators of Kenyan black teas  ap. 209-215.  a2019-12-04  aThe flavanol composition and caffeine content of green tea leaf, black tea quality parameters of theaflavins, thearubigins, liquor brightness and total colour varied more among clones than with time of the year.

  1 aCosta, F.R.C.10aMesoscale distribution patterns of Amazonian understorey herbs in relation to topography, soil and watersheds  ap. 863-878.  a2019-12-04  aMany authors have suggested that topography and soils are the major determinants of species distributions and community patterns at small or regional scales, but few studies addressed the patterns at mesoscales. We used Reserva Ducke (100 km2) as a model to analyse the effects of soil, topography and watersheds on the variation of the herb community composition, and to determine the relative importance of the environmental factors on species composition. Taxonomic groups are frequently used as surrogates in studies of biodiversity distribution and complementarity, but their efficacy is controversial. We therefore studied the correlations between the distributional patterns of three different herb groups (Marantaceae, pteridophytes and 'others') and their responses to environmental predictors. Terrestrial herbs were sampled in 59 plots of 250 x 2 m, systematically distributed over the reserve. Plots followed isoclines of altitude, to minimize the internal variation of soil. Composition of the total herb community and of the three herb groups was summarized with PCoA. Soil structure, represented by PCA axes, was the main determinant of the variation in herb composition for all groups, but slope affected only pteridophytes. Soil and topography explained less than one-third of the variance in community data. Herb composition was significantly different between watersheds, but watersheds differ only slightly in soil parameters. Our results indicate high turnover in species composition, on spatial scales of 5-10 km in central Amazonia, which is not necessarily associated with soil change. Compositional patterns of the three groups analysed were significantly correlated, but with low values for the correlation coefficient. Although composition was correlated, the responses to environmental predictors differed among groups, and the use of one group as a surrogate will miss around 50% of the variation in other groups. Although important, soil and topography alone cannot predict herb community structure. Knowledge of geographical, historical or other landscape features, such as watershed morphology, may therefore be necessary to predict the turnover patterns over mesoscales. Moreover, the same factors may not have the same effectiveness as predictors of the structure of seemingly similar biological groups. 3atropical rain forests 3acommunity structure 3aplant communities 3aspatial distribution 3abotanical composition 3aforested watersheds 3asoil structure 3aforest soils 3aaltitude 3aforbs 3aforest ecology 3aunderstory 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0atopography 0abiodiversity1 aMagnusson, W.E.1 aLuizao, R.C.0 tJournal of ecology.g2005 Oct., v. 93, no. 5 p.863-878x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01020.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080421b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03516naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100001700186245014000203300001600343500001500359520207900374650003002453650001702483650001702500650001602517650001502533650002602548650001702574650001302591650002002604650002202624650002502646650001902671651002002690653002402710653001702734653001902751700001802770773007602788852000902864856009202873930003302965945002502998946001103023655001203034IND4375601620221118022952.0051028e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437560162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01046.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRossetto, M.14aThe tension between dispersal and persistence regulates the current distribution of rare palaeo-endemic rain forest flora: a case study  ap. 906-917.  a2019-12-04  a1 Eidothea hardeniana (Proteaceae) is a narrow endemic representative of an ancient lineage restricted to a single site in northern New South Wales (Australia). This study aims to identify the life-history traits most likely to have influenced the current distribution pattern of this rain forest tree. 2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of reproductive failure. 3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing further favour relatively high levels of diversity (H(E) = 0.542) despite a small effective population size (N(e) = 21.6). 4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted for by linking two important components of community assembly theory: dispersal and niche assembly. 5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa. Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances. 6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret species distribution and population structure are applicable across a broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response to changing circumstances and opportunities. This has important implications for species conservation, habitat management and reserve design. 3ageographical distribution 3alife history 3aforest trees 3aoutcrossing 3aProteaceae 3abotanical composition 3arain forests 3aregrowth 3aforest habitats 3agenetic variation 3apopulation structure 3aseed dispersal 3aNew South Wales 0asexual reproduction 0abiodiversity 0aforest ecology1 aKooyman, R.M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2005 Oct., v. 93, no. 5 p.906-917x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01046.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/11/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03135naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203072001700220100001700237245013700254300001400391500001500405520151000420650002501930650001401955650002201969650002401991650001402015650001402029650001302043650002202056650001402078650001702092650002102109650002602130651001002156651002502166651001502191653001002206653001402216653001502230653002602245653001102271700001702282700001402299773007402313852000902387856009202396930003302488945002502521946001102546655001202557IND4377973420221118023028.0060217e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437797342DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01092.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Resprouting capacity (R) and propagule-persistence (P) are traits that are often considered to have evolved where there are predictable crown fires. Because several indicators suggest a stronger selective pressure for such traits in California than in the Mediterranean Basin, we hypothesize that plant species should have evolved to become R+ and P+ more frequently in California than in the Mediterranean Basin. 2. To test this hypothesis we studied the phylogenetic association between R and P states in both California and the Mediterranean Basin using published molecular phylogenies. 3. The results suggest that R and P evolved differently in the two regions. The occurrence of the states differs significantly between regions for trait P, but not for trait R. The different patterns (towards R+ and P+ in California and towards R+ and P- in the Mediterranean Basin) are reflected in the higher abundance and the wider taxonomic distribution of species with both persistence traits (R+P+ species) in California. 4. The differential acquisition of fire persistence mechanisms at the propagule level (P+) supports the idea that fire selective pressures has been higher in California than in the Mediterranean Basin. 5. Our comparative phylogenetic-informed analysis contributes to an understanding of the differential role of the Quaternary climate in determining fire persistence traits in different Mediterranean-type ecosystems and, thus, to the debate on the evolutionary convergence of traits. 3aconvergent evolution 3asprouting 3aplant communities 3aselection intensity 3aphylogeny 3awildfires 3aregrowth 3anatural selection 3awoodlands 3aburied seeds 3aclimatic factors 3aMediterranean climate 3aSpain 3aMediterranean region 3aCalifornia 0aseeds 0aevolution 0aseed banks 0apropagule persistence 0aplants1 aKeeley, J.E.1 aVerdu, M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2006 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.31-39x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01092.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060611b20060702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/05/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03841naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100001500186245011800201300001400319500001500333520224200348650001202590650004702602650002202649650001402671650002602685650001802711650001802729650001302747650002202760650002202782650002402804651001902828653002402847653002502871653002202896653002202918653001802940653001102958653001102969700001502980700001702995700001803012700001303030773007403043852000903117856009203126930003303218945002503251946001103276655001203287IND4377973720221118023131.0060217e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437797372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01065.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSuzuki, J.10aEffects of neighbourhood structure and tussock dynamics on genet demography of Festuca rubra in a mountain meadow  ap. 66-76.  a2019-12-04  a1. We examined whether genet demography in the clonal grass Festuca rubra in a mountain grassland in the Krkonose Mountains (Czech Republic) changes in response to local environment. The data were also used to compare genet recruitment with estimates of genet mortality. 2. We sampled F. rubra from four permanent plots in which ramet densities of all species have been recorded at a fine scale for a decade. Identities of 224 ramets were assessed by means of RAPD, yielding 145 different genets, of which most (68%) were found only once. The genet with the highest number of sampled ramets was recorded nine times. 3. By assuming that the probability that two ramets are genetically identical is a function of distance between ramets, we estimated that successful seedling recruitment rates were between 0.15 and 16 genets m(-2) yr(-1) depending on the plot. Genet mortality was estimated from ramet mortality using the assumption that ramet mortality was uncorrelated over space. In three of the four plots, genet mortalities fell into the same range as the genet recruitment rates. 4. The total number of genets per unit area must be known to enable determination of per capita recruitment and mortality rates. We developed an estimation technique involving simulation of the sampling process, which yielded values of 231-968 genets m(-2). Genet turnover was therefore low (0.1-1% annually) and the high genet diversity is maintained by a very low recruitment. 5. Spatial analysis showed that two ramets were more likely to be genetically identical when they came from a microhabitat where Festuca ramet density had recently increased; patches in which Festuca ramet density had decreased were more likely to contain ramets from several genets. Expanding tussocks are thus more likely to be composed of ramets of one genet only. Density and biomass of other species in the neighbourhood showed little correlation with the genet structure of Festuca rubra. 6. Although ramets of Festuca rubra intermingle with other species at a fine scale, the population biology of its genets is driven mainly by the dynamics of its own ramets. Interactions with other species and response to local environments have little effect on genet structure. 3agrasses 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aplant communities 3aseedlings 3abotanical composition 3aFestuca rubra 3amicrohabitats 3agenotype 3aspatial variation 3agenetic variation 3apopulation dynamics 3aCzech Republic 0amountain grasslands 0aseedling recruitment 0aspecies diversity 0acommunity ecology 0aplant ecology 0agenets 0aramets1 aHerben, T.1 aKrahulec, F.1 aStorchova, H.1 aHara, T.0 tJournal of ecology.g2006 Jan., v. 94, no. 1 p.66-76x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01065.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060611b20060702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/05/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03427naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001800203245013100221300001400352500001500366520206300381650001702444650002202461650002002483650001802503650002202521650002202543650001002565650002002575650002102595650001402616650001402630650001502644651001302659653002202672653001902694773007402713852000902787856009202796930003302888945002502921946001102946655001202957IND4368280420221118023114.0050408e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436828042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00946.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVon Holle, B.10aBiotic resistance to invader establishment of a southern Appalachian plant community is determined by environmental conditions  ap. 16-26.  a2019-12-04  a1 Tests of the relationship between resident plant species richness and habitat invasibility have yielded variable results. I investigated the roles of experimental manipulation of understorey species richness and overstorey characteristics in resistance to invader establishment in a floodplain forest in south-western Virginia, USA. 2 I manipulated resident species richness in experimental plots along a flooding gradient, keeping plot densities at their original levels, and quantified the overstorey characteristics of each plot. 3 After manipulating the communities, I transplanted 10 randomly chosen invaders from widespread native and non-native forest species into the experimental plots. Success of an invasion was measured by survival and growth of the invader. 4 Native and non-native invader establishment trends were influenced by different aspects of the biotic community and these relationships depended on the site of invasion. The most significant influence on non-native invader survival in this system of streamside and upper terrace plots was the overstorey composition. Non-native species survival in the flooded plots after 2 years was significantly positively related to proximity to larger trees. However, light levels did not fully explain the overstorey effect and were unrelated to native survivorship. The effects of understorey richness on survivorship depended on the origin of the invaders and the sites they were transplanted into. Additionally, native species growth was significantly affected by understorey plot richness. 5 The direction and strength of interactions with both the overstorey (for non-native invaders) and understorey richness (for natives and non-natives) changed with the site of invasion and associated environmental conditions. Rather than supporting the hypothesis of biotic resistance to non-native invasion, my results suggest that native invaders experienced increased competition with the native understorey plants in the more benign upland habitat and facilitation in the stressful riparian zone. 3aplant growth 3atemperate forests 3alight intensity 3astand density 3aspecies diversity 3aplant competition 3aweeds 3aforest habitats 3ainvasive species 3aoverstory 3amortality 3aunderstory 3aVirginia 0aplant communities 0aforest ecology0 tJournal of ecology.g2005 Feb., v. 93, no. 1 p.16-26x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00946.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02643naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001500203245009900218300001400317520132000331650001201651650001301663650001701676650002101693650001801714650001401732650002201746650002001768650001801788650001701806650001401823651001601837653001901853653002501872700001401897700001801911773007401929852000902003856009202012930003302104945002502137946001102162655001202173IND4368281820221118023019.0050408e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436828182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2004.00961.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We investigated the effects of forest edges on growth, survival and density of seedlings, juveniles and adults of an endemic New Zealand mistletoe, Alepis flavida, over a 5-year period. 2 Rates of establishment and growth were significantly higher for seedlings in forest interior than on forest edges but both juveniles and adults grew significantly faster on forest edges. 3 Mortality rates were greater for juveniles than for adults, but there was no significant difference between forest edge and interior. 4 Densities of seedlings and the larger size class of juvenile plants were significantly greater in the forest interior than on forest edges, whereas densities of the larger size class of adults were significantly greater on edges. 5 Changes in densities over 5 years showed that larger juveniles increased in density only in the forest interior, whereas larger adults increased in density only on forest edges. 6 Thus, seedlings of A. flavida have strong advantages in the forest interior, whereas juveniles and adults grow faster on forest edges. 7 This study emphasizes the need to examine multiple life-history stages in studies of edge effects. 3aforests 3aecotones 3aLoranthaceae 3aparasitic plants 3amature plants 3aseedlings 3aspatial variation 3aforest habitats 3aplant density 3aplant growth 3amortality 3aNew Zealand 0aAlepis flavida 0aforest edge habitats1 aKelly, D.1 aHazlett, B.A.0 tJournal of ecology.g2005 Feb., v. 93, no. 1 p.79-86x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2004.00961.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02165naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001700183245008400200300001600284500001500300520094500315650001601260650002201276650001101298650002101309650002301330650000901353650001501362650000801377650001201385653000901397653002001406700001501426700002101441773010401462852000901566856012301575930003301698945001301731946001101744655001201755IND2163464920221118023157.0980818e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216346492DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199702)73:2<226::AID-JSFA709>3.0.CO;2-M2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasanthi, S.10aAflatoxin intake from maize-based diets in a rural population in southern India  ap. 226-230.  a2019-12-04  aThe aflatoxin intake through the consumption of maize was assessed in 12 households in a rural population in southern India. This was based on the measurement of aflatoxin levels in cooked maize and the quantity of consumption of the maize. The average aflatoxin intakes in nine out of 12 household ranged from 0.33 to 1.5 micrograms day-1. Individual intakes varied from 0.08 to 2.22 micrograms day-1. When assessed on a body weight basis, aflatoxin intakes in the younger age groups were observed to be higher. The average intakes in different age groups 1-5, 5-12, 12-18 and above 18 years were observed to be 47, 35, 33 and 22 ng kg-1 body weight day-1, respectively. Aflatoxin intakes calculated from aflatoxin levels in maize before cooking tended to be higher by 36% when compared with intakes calculated from cooked maize. This significant difference (P < 0.001) was attributed to the effect of cooking on aflatoxin levels in maize. 3afood intake 3arural communities 3ahumans 3arural population 3afood contamination 3acorn 3aaflatoxins 3aage 3acooking 0adiet 0aage differences1 aBhat, R.V.1 aSubbulakshmi, G.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 Feb., v. 73, no. 2 p.226-230x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199702)73:2<226::AID-JSFA709>3.0.CO;2-M3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03254naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001400183245013000197300001600327520162100343650001401964650001101978650001901989650001902008650002902027650001102056650000702067650001902074650002302093650001602116650003202132650002502164650001602189650001902205650002002224650000802244650002302252650001602275650001702291650002302308653002002331653001102351653002602362700001702388700001402405773010402419852000902523856012302532930003302655945001302688946001102701655001202712IND2163465120221118023237.0980818e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216346512DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199702)73:2<231::AID-JSFA710>3.0.CO;2-D2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, U.10aEffect of yeast culture supplement on ruminal microbial populations and metabolism in buffalo calves fed a high roughage diet  ap. 231-236.  aThe effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast culture (YC, Yea-Sacc 1026) as a supplement to the high-roughage diet of buffalo calves on the rumen microbial populations, fermentation pattern and in sacco dry matter disappearance of dietary constituents was examined. A control group was fed a diet consisting of, on a dry matter basis, 2.12 kg bajra (Pennisetum typhoides) hay and 0.45 kg groundnut cake per day per calf, while the treatment group had the same diet plus 5 g YC. After feeding for 6 weeks, inclusion of YC was stopped and both groups were given the control diet for 2 weeks. At week 4 the pH in the rumen fluid (RF) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) up to 6 h post-feeding in the treatment group compared with the control group. The concentrations of total, total viable and cellulolytic bacteria were increased by 41.0 (P < 0.05), 33.5 and 57.4% (P < 0.01), respectively, with YC supplement. The concentration of total volatile fatty acids (P < 0.05), particularly at 4 h post-feeding (P < 0.01) and acetate (P < 0.01) and acetate to propionate ratio (P < 0.05) were higher in the treatment compared with the control group. On YC supplementation, the concentration of NH3-N was decreased (P < 0.05) while that of TCA-precipitable protein in RF was marginally but non-significantly increased. Withdrawal of YC from the diet reversed these effects and the rumen variables returned to values close to control levels after 2 weeks. The in sacco dry matter disappearance of dietary components was higher in the treatment compared with the control group, particularly during the first 24 h of incubation. 3abuffaloes 3acalves 3afeed additives 3acultured cells 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ayeasts 3apH 3arumen bacteria 3arumen fermentation 3aplate count 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3avolatile fatty acids 3aacetic acid 3apropionic acid 3aprotein content 3ahay 3aPennisetum glaucum 3apeanut meal 3arumen fluids 3aammonium compounds 0abuffalo feeding 0aratios 0acellulolytic bacteria1 aSareen, V.K.1 aSingh, S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 Feb., v. 73, no. 2 p.231-236x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199702)73:2<231::AID-JSFA710>3.0.CO;2-D3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03611naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152100002200169245006800191300001600259500001500275520235500290650001702645650001602662650001502678650002102693650001402714653002302728653002202751653002302773653001502796653001102811653001802822653002302840653002302863700001502886700001802901773007602919852000902995856009203004930003303096945002503129946001103154655001203165IND4369770220221118023249.0050511e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436977022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00952.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMazancourt, C. de10aUnderstanding mutualism when there is adaptation to the partner  ap. 305-314.  a2019-12-04  a1 A mutualism is a mutually beneficial interaction between individuals of two species. Here we show that the degree of benefit resulting from an interaction depends on whether adaptation within the mutualism is considered. 2 A species' proximate response measures the short-term effect of addition or removal of the partner species, without allowing for any adaptation. We define a proximate mutualism as an interaction in which removal of each partner results in a decreased performance of the other, i.e. both species show a positive proximate response to the presence of the partner. 3 A proximate mutualism might, however, only reflect evolved dependence (i.e. the species has lost its ability to perform well without the partner). Some authors therefore insist on an ultimate criterion, regardless of the use of proximate responses in almost all empirical studies. 4 A species' ultimate response measures the long-term effect of adding or removing the partner species, thus allowing the focal species to adapt. In an ultimate mutualism neither partner could ever have performed as well without the other. In other words, a mutualism is called ultimate if both species show a positive ultimate response to the presence of the partner. Despite the conceptual attractiveness of this definition, ultimate responses are difficult to measure, rendering its use operationally problematic. 5 Mutualistic evolution, the evolution of a trait that is costly to the bearer but beneficial to its partner, is not, paradoxically, a necessary consequence of either proximate or ultimate mutualism. Another counterintuitive result is that even obligate mutualisms are not necessarily ultimate interactions. 6 We conclude that the proximate response is the only workable criterion for mutualism. Our understanding of mutualism, however, requires further evaluation of how evolved dependence may be responsible for such responses. 7 These concepts clarify the ongoing debate about whether plant-herbivore interactions can be considered as mutualistic. 8 This is not a semantic case of hair splitting: naive aspects in current views of mutualism need revision. In most, if not all, interactions now considered as mutualisms, some of the measured benefits are likely to result from evolved dependence, rather than what we would like to consider as ultimate benefits. 3aplant growth 3acoevolution 3aherbivores 3aplant adaptation 3amutualism 0aproximate response 0aultimate response 0aliterature reviews 0aadaptation 0aplants 0aplant ecology 0aobligate mutualism 0aevolved dependence1 aLoreau, M.1 aDieckmann, U.0 tJournal of ecology.g2005 Apr., v. 93, no. 2 p.305-314x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00952.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060209b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02582naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001900183245009100202300001600293500001500309520115400324650001701478650002401495650002201519650002301541650003001564650002201594650001501616650002501631650001901656650001801675650002001693650002001713650002001733650002401753653002201777653001401799700001801813773010401831852000901935856012301944930003302067945001302100946001102113655001202124IND2163466920221118023246.0980818e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216346692DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199704)73:4<432::AID-JSFA744>3.0.CO;2-O2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUgwuanyi, J.O.10aSome pectinolytic and cellulolytic enzyme activities of fungi causing rots of cocoyams  ap. 432-436.  a2019-12-04  aRepresentative isolates of Aspergillus niger, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Corticium rolfsii, Geotrichum candidum, Fusarium oxysporum and F solani recovered from rotten cocoyams were studied for the production of pectinolytic and cellulolytic enzymes.

  1 aCosyns, E.10aGermination success of temperate grassland species after passage through ungulate and rabbit guts  ap. 353-361.  a2019-12-04  a1 Dispersal of endozoochorous seed involves uptake by a herbivore and exposure to different kinds of digestive fluids during passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Assessment of the ecological significance of endozoochory therefore requires examination of the survival rate of seeds during this phase. 2 A feeding experiment was conducted with seeds of 19 plant species that are important constituents of temperate semi-natural grasslands and five animal species (two ruminants, two colon fermenters and a caecum fermenter). Mean retention time of germinable seeds was determined and seed characteristics that might affect germination success were examined. 3 Gut-passed seeds had a much lower germination success (0-26%) than non-gut-passed seeds either sown directly on dung (2-79%) or bare soil (7-89%). 4 Relative germination success differed considerably between both plant and animal species. This may result from complex, herbivore-specific interactions between animal behaviour (chewing, digestion) and seed characteristics. 5 Germination success was positively related to seed longevity and, remarkably, also to seed mass and seed shape. Retention time of germinable seeds varied from c. 12 hours (rabbit) to 72 hours (ungulates), potentially allowing long-distance seed dispersal. This study highlights both the complex interaction between animal species and seed characteristics and the considerable differences in germination success of gut-passed seeds, which exist between plant species. The loss of seed germinability after gut passage calls into question the ecological significance of endozoochory, although the costs of other dispersal mechanisms remain to be tested. 3adigestive juices 3agrasslands 3agrasses 3aseed germination 3arabbits 3aseed predation 3acattle 3asheep 3amastication 3adigestion 3aasses 3aplant ecology 3aforbs 3ahorses 3aseed dispersal 0aseed shape 0aseed mass 0aendozoochory 0adigestive system1 aDelporte, A.1 aLens, L.1 aHoffmann, M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2005 Apr., v. 93, no. 2 p.353-361x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2005.00982.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060209b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/01/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02783naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001900203245008800222300001600310500001500326520144300341650002301784650002201807650002301829650002101852650002601873650001401899650002201913650001301935651001501948653001001963653002201973653001401995653001802009700001802027700002202045773007602067852000902143856009202152930003302244945002502277946001102302655001202313IND4377974720221118023225.0060217e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437797472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01052.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We examined in situ diversity and distribution of vascular epiphytes, as well as site environmental variables at six sites along a continuous elevational gradient (30-2600 m a.s.l.) of old-growth forest in Costa Rica. 2. A total of 555 species of vascular epiphytes from 130 genera of 53 families were identified to species or morphospecies. The ferns were the most diverse group, with 138 species, followed by orchids (112 species). Cloud forest at 1000 m was the richest site, representing the maximum of a pronounced mid-elevation peak in epiphyte species richness. 3. Spatial randomizations of recorded elevational ranges suggest that the overall elevational richness pattern of most epiphyte groups on this transect is substantially influenced by the mid-domain effect (MDE, the mid-elevation overlap of large-ranged species). Among the environmental factors considered (rainfall, temperature and canopy light environment), only rainfall was significantly correlated with richness. 4. Different patterns of richness for vascular epiphytes and for trees indicate that mechanisms differ between life forms. 5. We collected 26% of the estimated epiphyte species of Costa Rica along a single mountain transect. This, together with the finding that different groups and life forms varied in the elevation at which species richness peaked, highlights the need to conserve the few remaining intact elevational gradients in Latin America. 3aold-growth forests 3aplant communities 3aplant architecture 3atropical forests 3abotanical composition 3aepiphytes 3aspatial variation 3aaltitude 3aCosta Rica 0aslope 0aspecies diversity 0alifeforms 0aplant ecology1 aColwell, R.K.1 aWatkins, J.E.

To evaluate the advantage of early germination for the seedling establishment, differences in the temporal pattern of leaf development between the seedlings and overstorey trees were investigated, together with the timing of dry mass gain and allocation, survival and mortality agents of seedlings. These traits were contrasted at four sites with different types of foliage phenology in the overstorey trees (FU-1 and FU-2, forest understorey in which overstorey trees unfolded and shed the leaves as a flush and succeedingly, respectively; SG, small gaps; and FE, forest edge). Seasonal growth patterns of the seedlings were greatly affected by the differences in the coupling of leaf development between the seedlings and the overstorey trees. For early germinating cohorts of Acer mono, 79, 61, 50 and 53% of annual dry mass gain occurred within 2 months of germination, in FU-1, FU-2, SG and FE, respectively. After this point (canopy closure) mass increment decreased abruptly in both FU sites, but continued to increase in both SG and FE. Seedling mass, however, increased after September again in FU-2 but not in FU-1, mainly due to earlier leaf shedding of the canopy trees in FU-2. After canopy closure, leaf mass ratio was greatest in FU-1 where light was most limited, but lowest in FE. In contrast, root mass ratio was greatest in FE but lowest in FU-1 where soil moisture was most abundant. These traits might lead to the optimization of growth by making all resources equally limiting even after canopy closure in forest understorey. Higher seedling survival resulting from early germination was observed in all four sites, since predators and pathogens selectively attacked late germinating individuals. The advantage of early germination was greater in both FU-1 and FU-2 than in FE, mainly due to large differences in available light for early vs. late germinating individuals in both FU sites compared with the FE site. These observations suggest that phenological traits of A. mono such as rapid germination in early spring and earlier deployment of leaves compared with overstorey trees has been selected to maximize annual mass gain and survival in understorey habitats of deciduous broad-leaved forests. 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3alight intensity 3aUlmus davidiana 3aroots 3ashoots 3adeciduous forests 3aphenology 3aearly development 3aOstrya 3aAcer palmatum 3aleaves 3atemporal variation 3asoil water content 3acanopy gaps 3abiomass production 3amortality 3aseed germination 3aAcer pictum subsp. mono 3aQuercus mongolica 3aJapan 0adry matter 0aostrya japonica 0ajuglans ailanthifolia 0aestablishment 0acanopy 0alight0 tJournal of ecology.g1998, v. 86, no. 2 p.219-228x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00245.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02401naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009100171300001600262500001500278520114900293650001501442650001301457650001401470650002501484650002601509650001101535650001701546650001401563650001601577650002501593650002401618651001201642653002501654653001101679653001601690700002001706773007101726852000901797856009201806930003301898945001301931946001101944655001201955IND2123638320221118023106.0980625s1998    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212363832DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00255.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterken, G.F.10aLong-term change in an unmanaged population of wych elm subjected to Dutch elm disease  ap. 205-218.  a2019-12-04  aChanges in a population of Ulmus glabra in Lady Park Wood (UK), a mixed deciduous native woodland, were studied by means of permanent transects.

Twenty-three years after the outbreak of disease the number of elm individuals had increased by about 40%. Disease has, however, continued to afflict vigorous, exposed individuals. The large-scale distribution of elm has been unaffected, but the small-scale pattern has changed due to the concentration of seedling regeneration in gaps. The elm population appears to be differentiating into a large high-turnover subpopulation of fast-growing, but repeatedly diseased maiden individuals and sprouts, and a small, low-turnover subpopulation of slow-growing individuals rooted in suboptimally dry, secluded sites. 3aOphiostoma 3adiameter 3aseedlings 3aspatial distribution 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3aUlmus glabra 3amortality 3acanopy gaps 3anatural regeneration 3apopulation dynamics 3aEngland 0aophiostoma novo-ulmi 0acanopy 0arecruitment1 aMountford, E.P.0 tJournal of ecology.g1998, v. 86, no. 2 p.205-218x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00255.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02915naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245008400170300001600254500001500270520173100285650002402016650002502040650001802065650002202083650002002105650001902125653002202144653001802166653002102184700001502205700001602220700001602236700001902252773007602271852000902347856009202356930003302448945001302481946001102494655001202505IND2063172520221118023218.0980416e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206317252DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00244.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrelich, L.E.10aNeighbourhood effects in forests: implications for within-stand patch structure  ap. 149-161.  a2019-12-04  a1 MOSAIC, a spatially referenced Markov model was used to show how interactions among trees in a neighbourhood may influence the patch structure of forests. A series of two-species simulations were conducted with neighbourhood strength ranging from neutral (chances of species replacing each other independent of neighbourhood composition) to strong (chance of replacement for each species proportional to neighbourhood composition), and with neighbourhood sizes including 1-50 neighbours. 2 Neighbourhood strength was positively correlated with the degree of patchiness. Very high neighbourhood strength is necessary to form mono-specific patches composed of hundreds of individual trees. Intermediate neighbourhood sizes (5-12 neighbours) led to the most distinct patches where individuals were arranged so that contact between species was minimized. 3 Neighbourhood effects alone are unlikely to lead to large areas (several ha) dominated by one species. However, simulations showed that neighbourhood effects can augment small differences in the environment, resulting in large mono-specific patches. 4 Simulations with 4 and 5 species indicated that groups of species can interact to form spatially distinct communities, starting from a random mixture on a uniform environment. This implies that neighbourhood effects may be responsible for some unexplained variability in studies that attempt to relate environmental parameters to forest composition. 5 Patch structures that develop due to neighbourhood effects are usually not recognized by current vegetation classification schemes or by forest managers, and this lack of recognition could lead to the loss of certain natural spatial structures on forested landscapes. 3amathematical models 3aspatial distribution 3aplant density 3aspecies diversity 3astand structure 3aforest ecology 0aplant communities 0aneighborhoods 0amarkov processes1 aSugita, S.1 aReich, P.B.1 aDavis, M.B.1 aFriedman, S.K.0 tJournal of ecology.g1998 Feb., v. 86, no. 1 p.149-161x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00244.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010700168300001600275520165800291650002201949650002601971650001501997650001502012650002502027650001002052650001402062650001202076650001002088651001102098653001602109653001902125653001502144700001402159773007102173852000902244856009202253930003302345945001302378946001102391655001202402IND2123642920221118023101.0980625s1998    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212364292DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00252.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrandin, U.10aAttributes of the seed bank after a century of primary succession on islands in Lake Hjalmaren, Sweden  ap. 293-303.  aA large number of islands was created when the water table of Lake Hjalmaren, south central Sweden, was lowered between 1882 and 1886. We have complete lists of vascular plant species for 40 of these islands from 1886, 1892, 1903-04, 1927-28 and 1984-85. We have investigated the seed bank on nine of these islands and compared species composition at different soil depths with the species lists from the islands in 1886-1985, and with the present vegetation in the area of seed bank sampling. We have also investigated the distribution in the soil of seeds from species with different ecological attributes, including seed longevity, successional status, seed weight, seed form and species longevity. Seeds in soil samples were allowed to germinate over the course of two summers with an intermediate cold storage. We found 1944 seeds representing 65 taxa. The mean seed density was 84 seeds dm-2. The similarity between the surface soil (0-3 cm) seed bank and the vegetation at the different vegetation analyses increased from 1886 to 1993. The similarity between the present vegetation and the seed bank decreased with increasing soil depth, and the soil at 12-15 cm had no species in common with the present vegetation. Several species now absent from the vegetation were found in the seed bank. Deeply buried seeds came from early successional, annual species with long-term persistent and low-weight seeds, as expected from seed bank theories, but were slightly elongated, which was in contrast to theories. Spherical seeds were associated with the surface soil, as were short-lived and high-weight seeds from late successional, perennial species. 3aspecies diversity 3aecological succession 3asoil depth 3avegetation 3aspatial distribution 3aseeds 3alongevity 3adensity 3ashape 3aSweden 0aseed weight 0aseed longevity 0aseed banks1 aRydin, H.0 tJournal of ecology.g1998, v. 86, no. 2 p.293-303x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00252.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03443naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245011200168300001400280500001500294520201900309650001702328650001502345650004002360650001102400650002702411650001102438650001302449650001802462650002402480650001302504650001502517650001302532650002202545650001402567650001102581651001602592653000902608653002602617653003602643653001102679700001502690773007402705852000902779856009202788930003302880945001302913946001102926655001202937IND2200847320221118023347.0990930e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220084732DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00315.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, A.M.10aExperimental demography of the old-field perennial Solidago altissima: the dynamics of the shoot population  ap. 17-27.  a2019-12-04  aControl strategies are needed for the clonal species Solidago altissima, which is an aggressive invader in Europe that propagates vegetatively by persistent rhizomes that produce annual shoots. The shoot dynamics of a population of S. altissima that had invaded an old-field site in 1984 were studied from 1987 to 1992. Shoots from 120 genets of the same cohort were followed in relation to their parent genets. We assessed the effect of yearly mowing, yearly cutting of rhizomes and repeated removal of close neighbour plants on growth, survival, probability of reproduction and flux of these shoots. In unmown plots, both shoot survival until the end of the growing season and the proportion of shoots producing seeds decreased (59% to 36% and 67% to 32%, respectively, from 1988 to 1992). The proportion of rhizomes producing shoots, however, rose (from c. 50% to more than 90%) so that annual shoot density increased almost fivefold by the end of the study, when it had almost reached equilibrium. In contrast, shoot density in mown plots remained roughly constant from 1988 to 1992, after an increase from 1987 to 1988. Shoots were much smaller and a smaller proportion of them reproduced than in unmown plots. Rhizome cutting (reduced clonal integration) produced a small but consistent decrease in height and in the percentage of sexually reproducing shoots. The removal of close neighbour plants increased shoot density, and a higher percentage of these shoots survived and reproduced. Experimental demographic studies thus show that (i) continued regular mowing reduces the production of both seeds and shoots, and so would prevent further spread of an invading S. altissima population; (ii) clonal integration may contribute to the species' success as an invader because disconnected rhizomes produce smaller shoots with a lower chance of sexual reproduction; and (iii) competition decreases shoot density, mainly as a consequence of reduced shoot survival, and can therefore control S. altissima growth. 3aweed control 3aperennials 3aSolidago altissima subsp. altissima 3amowing 3avegetative propagation 3aheight 3aregrowth 3aplant density 3asexual reproduction 3agenotype 3ademography 3arhizomes 3aseed productivity 3amortality 3ashoots 3aSwitzerland 0asize 0aplant characteristics 0aSolidago canadensis var. scabra 0agrowth1 aSchmid, B.0 tJournal of ecology.g1999 Feb., v. 87, no. 1 p.17-27x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00315.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02615naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001900185245010200204300001800306520123900324650003501563650002001598650002401618650001301642650002301655650001801678650001601696650001701712650001101729650001801740650003601758653001901794700001901813700001701832700001701849700001601866773010801882852000901990856012501999930003302124945001302157946001102170655001202181IND2204614620221118023443.0000516e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220461462DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199909)79:12<1698::AID-JSFA421>3.0.CO;2-K2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmud, T.M.M.10aPak Choi (Brassica rapa ssp Chinensis L) quality response to pre-harvest salinity and temperature  ap. 1698-1702.  aThe effects of pre-harvest salinity levels (1.7, 9.5 and 12.3 mS cm(-1)) and temperatures (18, 21 and 25 degrees C) on the ascorbic acid and total chlorophyll contents of Pak Choi (Brassica rapa ssp. Chinensis L) were investigated. The relationships of these chemical contents with storage period (0, 7 and 14 days) and water loss were also monitored. Increased production temperatures significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the ascorbic acid and total chlorophyll (p <0.01). Ascorbic acid content in leaves grown at various salinities was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced beyond 9.5 mS cm(-1). Total chlorophyll was not affected by these different levels of salinity. Ascorbic acid contents of harvested shoots fell rapidly during the first seven days of storage, most markedly in shoots taken from plants grown at high salinity. The pattern of chlorophyll degradation depended on the plants' production environment where higher temperatures resulted subsequently in rapid degradation during storage. For shoots grown at high salinity, the chlorophyll content was sustained during early storage. Linear relationships were apparent between water loss and ascorbic acid and total chlorophyll contents of shoots from the range of treatments. 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3asalinity 3anutrient solutions 3aascorbic acid 3achlorophyll 3afood quality 3ashoots 3awater content 3achemical constituents of plants 0astorage losses1 aAtherton, J.G.1 aWright, C.J.1 aRamlan, M.F.1 aAhmad, S.H.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 12 p.1698-1702x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199909)79:12<1698::AID-JSFA421>3.0.CO;2-K3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02438naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001700185245012300202300001800325520102200343650001601365650002001381650001201401650000901413650001201422650002301434650001501457650001601472650001301488650002601501650001601527650001201543650001401555650001201569653001601581653001001597653001301607653002901620700002001649773010801669852000901777856012501786930003301911945001301944946001101957655001201968IND2204615320221118023536.0000516e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220461532DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199909)79:12<1737::AID-JSFA432>3.0.CO;2-Y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeland, J.O.14aThe texture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) muscle as measured instrumentally using TPA and Warner-Brazler shear test  ap. 1737-1746.  aMuscle texture measurements were performed on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) using two different instrumental methods; The Texture Profile Analysis, which is a uniaxial compression test, and the Warner-Brazler shear test. The performances of the two tests were evaluated as to their ability to differentiate between recently killed salmon and salmon stored on ice for up to 24 days. Both tests performed well, but the shear test was slightly more sensitive than the compression test. Further, salmon were either starved or fed for two weeks prior to slaughter. The muscle from fed salmon lost its strength slightly faster than that from starved salmon, but this difference was only detectable during the first two days of chilled storage. The effects of temperature, fish size and degree and mode of deformation on the instrumental test results were studied and were found to be significant. Also, the sample geometry, ie the thickness of the fillet was found to have a very significant effect on the TPA-test results. 3aSalmo salar 3askeletal muscle 3atexture 3afish 3acooling 3apostmortem changes 3astarvation 3atemperature 3asampling 3amechanical properties 3adeformation 3afillets 3athickness 3atesting 0acompression 0ashear 0aanalysis 0atexture profile analysis1 aTorrissen, O.J.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 12 p.1737-1746x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199909)79:12<1737::AID-JSFA432>3.0.CO;2-Y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02388naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001400185245014400199300001800343520117800361650001001539650002301549650001001572650002201582650001901604650001001623650004301633700001701676700001901693700001601712773010701728852000901835856012501844930003301969945001302002946001102015655001202026IND2203396720221118023553.0000329e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220339672DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199908)79:11<1461::AID-JSFA388>3.0.CO;2-K2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez, R.10aIdentification of impact odorants of young red wines made with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache grape varieties: a comparative study  ap. 1461-1467.  aAn Aroma Extract Dilution Analysis (AEDA) has been carried out on three monovarietal young red wines plus a mixture of wines aged one year. The aromograms contain 85 odour-active regions classified in four categories of intensity. The 11 most powerful odorants, 14 out of the 17 second-most powerful, and 34 of the rest could be identified using a HPLC prefractionation method and standard HRGC-MS-olfactometric techniques. The most active odorants of the monovarietal wines were isoamyl and beta-phenylethyl alcohols, the ethyl esters of butyric, isobutyric, 2-methyl butyric and hexanoic acids, gamma-nonalactone and eugenol. Some others worth mentioning are ethyl isovalerate, isoamyl acetate, hexanol, c-3-hexenol, linalool, geraniol, guaiacol, ethyl cinnamate, ethyl dihydrocinnamate, beta-damascenone, delta-decalactone and wine lactone. Compounds with less aromatic intensity but also present in some of the wines were sotolon, isopropyl- and isobutylmethoxypyrazines and 4-mercapto-4-methylpentan-2-one. Data show that there are no impact compounds characteristic of only one variety, and that differences between varieties are quantitative rather than qualitative. 3awines 3avolatile compounds 3aodors 3amass spectrometry 3awine cultivars 3asmell 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography1 aFerreira, V.1 aHernández, P.1 aCacho, J.F.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Aug., v. 79, no. 11 p.1461-1467x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199908)79:11<1461::AID-JSFA388>3.0.CO;2-K3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02832naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001700185245014800202300001800350500001500368520126400383650001301647650000901660650001101669650001601680650002301696650001601719650000901735650001601744650001001760650001801770650001901788650001601807650001201823650002201835650001101857653001501868653002501883653001101908653001701919653001901936700001501955700002001970700001401990773010702004852000902111856012502120930003302245945001302278946001102291655001202302IND2204504120221118023431.0000511e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220450412DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1855::AID-JSFA446>3.0.CO;2-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToufeili, I.10aSubstitution of wheat starch with non-wheat starches and cross-linked waxy barley starch affects sensory properties and staling of Arabic bread  ap. 1855-1860.  a2019-12-04  aSubstitution of starch from barley, corn, oat, potato, rice or sorghum for prime wheat starch in the formulation of Arabic bread resulted in breads with significantly (P < 0.05) different textural attributes from regular wheat bread except for barley starch. Substitution of waxy barley starch (957 g kg(-1) amylopectin) for wheat starch (279 g kg(-1) amylopectin) resulted in bread that was not significantly different from regular wheat bread when assessed in the fresh state. However, upon aging, the waxy barley starch-containing bread staled at a significantly (P < 0.05) faster rate than regular wheat bread. Breads made with waxy barley starch cross-linked with 50, 200 or 500 ppm phosphorus oxychloride showed higher enthalpy of melting (delta H) upon aging and staled faster than the bread formulated with waxy barley starch. These findings suggest that amylopectin retrogradation is one of the determinants of Arabic bread staling and that cross-linking promotes recrystallisation of amylopectin, possibly by keeping the polymer chains in close proximity. The rate of staling in breads formulated with cross-linked waxy barley starch decreased with increasing levels of cross-linking, possibly owing to restrictions in the degree of starch swelling. 3aenthalpy 3arice 3abarley 3acorn starch 3achemical reactions 3awheat flour 3aoats 3abreadmaking 3awheat 3apotato starch 3abaking quality 3aamylopectin 3astorage 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3abreads 0apita bread 0astarch cross linking 0astarch 0afood quality 0athermodynamics1 aHabbal, Y.1 aShadarevian, S.1 aOlabi, A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Oct., v. 79, no. 13 p.1855-1860x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1855::AID-JSFA446>3.0.CO;2-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03631naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001500185245007300200300001800273500001500291520172700306650002102033650001602054650001002070650000902080650002102089650001802110650001302128650002602141650002202167650001902189650001102208650002102219650001402240650001402254650001602268650000902284650002302293650001902316650002502335650001002360650001302370650002302383650002002406650001302426651001202439653001602451653001702467653001502484653002702499653001402526700001702540700002002557700001602577700001902593700001702612700001802629773010702647852000902754856012502763930003302888945001302921946001102934655001202945IND2204504620221118023541.0000511e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220450462DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1865::AID-JSFA449>3.0.CO;2-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, F.J.10aResponses of breadmaking quality to sulphur in three wheat varieties  ap. 1865-1874.  a2019-12-04  aField experiments were carried out at three sites in England to investigate the effects of S fertilisation on breadmaking quality of three winter wheat varieties (Hereward, Rialto and Spark) in the 1996-1997 season. The soils at the three sites differed in extractable S contents. Depending on site, either 180 and 230 kg ha(-1) N or 230 and 280 kg ha(-1) N treatments were factorially combined with three S treatments (0, 20 and 100 kg ha(-1) S). Addition of S increased loaf volume significantly at two sites where grain S concentration was also significantly increased and grain N:S ratio decreased. Application of the extra 50 kg ha(-1) N increased grain protein concentration but did not increase loaf volume at any of the sites. Loaf volume was found to correlate more closely with grain S than with grain protein concentration. Addition of S generally decreased the elastic modulus of gel protein and dough resistance but increased dough extensibility. Despite considerable differences in their dough rheology, the responses in rheology and loaf volume to S were similar in all three varieties. Selected flour samples of Rialto from the Bridgets site were also analysed for the glutenin subunit distribution, showing that S addition increased the relative proportion of low-molecular-weight subunits at the expense of high-molecular-weight subunits of glutenin. This study therefore shows that the beneficial effects of S on breadmaking quality are associated with decreased dough elasticity and increased extensibility resulting from effects on the amount and composition of the glutenin polymers. The results also indicate that S fertilisation is required in some areas of England to maintain breadmaking quality. 3anutrient content 3awheat flour 3awheat 3agels 3aapplication rate 3aextensibility 3asulfates 3amodulus of elasticity 3aTriticum aestivum 3asoil fertility 3abreads 3amolecular weight 3acultivars 3aglutenins 3abreadmaking 3aheat 3aammonium compounds 3abaking quality 3anitrogen fertilizers 3adough 3arheology 3asulfur fertilizers 3aprotein content 3anitrates 3aEngland 0aloaf volume 0afood quality 0aelasticity 0arheological properties 0an s ratio1 aSalmon, S.E.1 aWithers, P.J.A.1 aEvans, E.J.1 aMonoghan, J.M.1 aShewry, P.R.1 aMcGrath, S.P.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Oct., v. 79, no. 13 p.1865-1874x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1865::AID-JSFA449>3.0.CO;2-R3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01817naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001800185245009000203300001800293520061100311650002000922650002700942650001700969650002600986650001801012650001401030650002201044650000901066650001401075650000901089650002001098700001501118773010701133852000901240856012501249930003301374945001301407946001101420655001201431IND2204506420221118023507.0000511e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220450642DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1936::AID-JSFA455>3.0.CO;2-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFadiloglu, S.10aLipase production by Rhizopus oryzae growing on different carbon and nitrogen sources  ap. 1936-1938.  aNitrogen and carbon sources influencing the growth and production of lipase by Rhizopus oryzae were studied.

The analyses were carried out on samples of two different types of Italian red wines, 'Merlot' and 'Cabernet', at different stages of aging during the period 1987-1996. The quantitative determination was performed using an RP-HPLC apparatus equipped with a diode array detector. Marfey's reagent, (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-5-L-alanine amide (FDAA), was used for the derivatisation, and the obtained diastereomers were separated on a Supelcosil LC-18 analytical column (25 cm x 0.4 cm id), adopting a gradient procedure and making use of water/acetonitrile buffer as the mobile phase. L-Norluecine was used as the internal standard for quantitative determination, and the detection of the derivatised components was made at a fixed wavelength of 340 nm. The data obtained show an interesting correlation between the age of the sample and the presence of the D-proline isomer, due to a racemisation process that can be described as a first-order kinetic reaction. The values of the kinetic constants obtained for the two wines are very similar but differ significantly from those observed for wines aged for more than 10 years. This is probably due to enzymatic degradation processes, which can occur in wine after longer periods of time. 3awines 3aproline 3aisomers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aItaly 0aage differences 0al-proline 0ad-proline1 aStancher, B.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Aug., v. 79, no. 11 p.1357-1360x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199908)79:11<1357::AID-JSFA371>3.0.CO;2-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02260naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001600183245008200199300001600281500001500297520079100312650001501103650002301118650000901141650002301150650001701173650001301190650001801203650001201221650002101233650001001254650001201264653001101276653001701287653002001304653000901324653001901333700001601352700001601368700001601384700001801400700001601418700001501434773010401449852000901553856012301562930003301685945001301718946001101731655001201742IND2062389320221118023357.0980312e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206238932DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199611)72:3<353::AID-JSFA665>3.0.CO;2-T2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIcekson, I.10aProlonging shelf-life of cap by combined ionising radiation and refrigeration  ap. 353-358.  a2019-12-04  aExperiments were performed using ionisating radiation in order to prolong the shelf-life of two groups of refrigerated fish (Cyprinus carpio).

No difference was found between shelf-life of whole or eviscerated fish. If fish were immediately cooled to 0 degrees C after death, their shelf-life was prolonged considerably. From this study it is clear that chemical tests of freshness such as TVB-N and K value determination are not appropriate for the study of irradiated fish.

We hypothesized that the role of positive plant-plant interactions will increase with the environmental stress imposed by long-term pollution. We studied the effects of top-canopy plants on two deciduous (Vaccinium myrtillus, V. uliginosum) and two evergreen (V. vitis-idaea, Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum) dwarf shrubs by comparing their growth and reproduction under trees and in gaps in industrial barrens and in unpolluted forests in the Kola Peninsula (NW Russia). 2. Interactions between habitat type and tree proximity on berry yield and reproductive effort were significant for four species combined. In forest habitats both berry yield and reproductive effort were higher in dwarf shrub patches growing in gaps than under tree canopies, but in barren habitats Vaccinium species reproduced better under tree canopies. 3. The interaction of habitat type and tree proximity was also significant for vegetative biomass, mostly due to evergreen species benefiting from neighbouring trees in barren habitats. 4. Overall, all four dwarf shrub species reproduced better in barren habitats than in forests, mostly due to increased reproduction observed under tree canopies in barren sites. 5. Values of the relative neighbour effect indicated that the impact of top-canopy plants on dwarf shrubs shifted from negative in forest habitats to generally positive in barren habitats. 3aair pollution 3aboreal forests 3aforest trees 3aoverstory 3ashrubs 3ainterspecific competition 3aforest habitats 3aplant reproduction 3aRussia 0aplant-plant interaction 0afacilitation1 aKozlov, M.V.0 tJournal of ecology.g2004 Apr., v. 92, no. 2 p.288-296x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00854.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050804b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02043naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001600183245013300199300001600332500001500348520079000363650001501153650001901168650001801187650001001205650001201215651001201227651001401239651001101253651001401264653001101278653001601289653001801305700001701323773010401340852000901444856012301453930003301576945001301609946001101622655001201633IND2151414220221118023253.0980813e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215141422DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199703)73:3<301::AID-JSFA726>3.0.CO;2-Z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmeny, M.A.10aRelationship between Hunter color values and beta-carotene contents in white-fleshed African sweetpotatoes (Ipomoea batatas Lam)  ap. 301-306.  a2019-12-04  aWhite-fleshed sweetpotatoes (Ipomoea batatas (L) Lam) are a major food crop in Uganda. This study was done to evaluate carotenoid content in sweetpotatoes and to relate the color of the sweetpotatoes to the beta-carotene present. A Hunter Color Tristimulus Meter was used to determine the color and the beta-carotene was determined by reverse-phase HPLC. Regression analysis was carried out on the color values L, a, b, b/a and tan-1 b/a to determine which color value could be used to express the content of beta-carotene in white-fleshed sweetpotatoes. The 'b' color value appeared to be the best estimation for correlation at 0.74 in this study for raw roots and 0.09 for puree. The 'a' value was 0.39 for raw roots and 0.16 for puree, L was -0.74 for raw roots and -0.45 for puree. 3aestimation 3asweet potatoes 3abeta-carotene 3acolor 3acooking 3aVietnam 3aIndonesia 3aUganda 3aAustralia 0apurees 0acarotenoids 0arelationships1 aWilson, P.W.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1997 Mar., v. 73, no. 3 p.301-306x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199703)73:3<301::AID-JSFA726>3.0.CO;2-Z3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02299naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001500183245011200198300001600310500001500326520106900341650001301410650001001423650002501433650001601458650001801474650001001492650002001502653001301522653001501535700002201550700001301572700002201585773010501607852000901712856012301721930003301844945001301877946001101890655001201901IND2054234420221118023241.0961127e199609  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205423442DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199609)72:1<120::AID-JSFA630>3.0.CO;2-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCone, J.W.10aPrediction of in situ rumen escape protein from in vitro incubation with protease from Streptomyces griseus  ap. 120-126.  a2019-12-04  aResearch was performed to determine in vitro the amount of rumen escape protein in mainly concentrate feedstuffs by incubation with a proteolytic enzyme preparation of Streptomyces griseus, with 24 feed samples with known in situ crude protein degradation characteristics. A close correlation (R2 = 0.75) was found between the percentage of escape protein, calculated from the in situ and the in vitro methods. However, the percentage escape protein in situ could be estimated with a greater accuracy (R2 = 0.80) using the undegraded fraction determined in vitro after 24 h incubation. Expressing escape protein as g kg-1 DM instead of a percentage, further improved the correlation with the amount of escape protein in situ (R2 = 0.95). The amount of escape protein in situ could be estimated with similar accuracy from the undegraded crude protein fraction determined in vitro after 24 h incubation (R2 = 0 92). Estimation of the amount of escape protein in situ did not improve with pre-incubation of the samples with amylase and carbohydrate degrading enzymes. 3aproteins 3arumen 3aStreptomyces griseus 3aproteinases 3acrude protein 3anylon 3aenzyme activity 0ain vitro 0aincubation1 aGelder, A.H. van.1 aSteg, A.1 aVuuren, A.M. van.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 Sept., v. 72, no. 1 p.120-126x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199609)72:1<120::AID-JSFA630>3.0.CO;2-33Available from publisher's Web site  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02616naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001300183245011600196300001600312520112200328650001401450650002001464650002001484650001601504650002301520650001801543650002701561650002201588650001701610650001501627650000901642650002101651650002101672650002601693650001301719653003401732653001901766700001701785700002101802700001801823773010401841852000901945856012301954930003302077945001302110946001102123655001202134IND2061925520221118023204.0980219e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206192552DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<455::AID-JSFA679>3.0.CO;2-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkai, Y.10aDetection of immunomodulating activities in an extract of Japanese edible seaweed, Laminaria japonica (Makonbu)  ap. 455-460.  aA significant immunomodulating activity was found in the hot-water-soluble extract of the most popular edible seaweed in Japan, Laminaria japonica (Makonbu in Japanese) which showed an enhancing activity for DNA synthesis of spleen cells from endotoxin-nonresponder, C3H/HeJ mice. This activity was divided into polysaccharide and non-polysaccharide fractions and the former fraction exhibited much higher activity than that of the latter fraction. The polysaccharide fraction caused stimulatory effects on the ingestive activity of mouse phagocytic cells against Staphylococcus aureus and the release of cytokines, interleukin-1 alpha and tumour necrosis factor alpha from the same cells. Furthermore, the polysaccharide fraction exhibited enhancing effects on polyclonal antibody (IgM and IgG) production in spleen cells. These immunomodulating activities were associated with polysaccharides themselves, but not contaminating endotoxins in the fraction judged by comparative experiments. The significance of this finding is discussed from the viewpoint of the immunopotentiation by edible seaweeds in host animals. 3aLaminaria 3apolysaccharides 3aDNA replication 3asplenocytes 3aantibody formation 3ainterleukin-1 3atumor necrosis factors 3aprotein secretion 3aphagocytosis 3aphagocytes 3amice 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aextracts 0anonspecific immunostimulation 0abrown seaweeds1 aIshizaka, S.1 aHigashi-Okai, K.1 aYamashita, U.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 Dec., v. 72, no. 4 p.455-460x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<455::AID-JSFA679>3.0.CO;2-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02135naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001400183245009200197300001600289520069900305650002201004650001701026650002001043650001101063650000901074650002501083650001601108650001401124650001601138650001801154650001301172650001301185650001601198650000801214650001101222650001001233650001001243650001101253650003601264653001101300700001101311700001401322773010401336852000901440856012301449930003301572945001301605946001101618655001201629IND2061924920221118023153.0980219e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206192492DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<411::AID-JSFA672>3.0.CO;2-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Y.10aEffect of gibberellins on chemical composition and quality of tea (Camellia sinensis L)  ap. 411-414.  aThe effect of gibberellins on tea leaf chemical composition and quality was investigated.

It was also revealed that tea plant response to gibberellins was dependent not only on genetics, but also on shoot development stage. 3aCamellia sinensis 3agibberellins 3afoliar spraying 3aleaves 3abuds 3achemical composition 3apolyphenols 3aflavonols 3aamino acids 3aascorbic acid 3acaffeine 3acatechin 3agallic acid 3atea 3aflavor 3aodors 3acolor 3ashoots 3achemical constituents of plants 0atastes1 aLu, J.1 aShang, S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 Dec., v. 72, no. 4 p.411-414x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<411::AID-JSFA672>3.0.CO;2-93Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02657naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001400183245009200197300001600289500001500305520111700320650001701437650001001454650001801464650002601482650002601508650000901534650000701543650001101550650002001561650001301581653001401594653001001608653001601618653001301634653002001647700001401667700001401681700001801695700002001713700001601733700001701749700001501766700002501781700001601806773010401822852000901926856012301935930003302058945001302091946001102104655001202115IND2061925020221118023330.0980219e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206192502DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<415::AID-JSFA675>3.0.CO;2-X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuten, J.10aInterlaboratory trial on the determination of the in vitro iron dialysability from food  ap. 415-424.  a2019-12-04  aAn in vitro method for the estimation of iron bioavailability was subjected to an interlaboratory trial. The method involved a simulated gastrointestinal digestion using pepsin for the gastric stage followed by pancreatin and bile salts for the intestinal stage. The proportion of iron diffused through a semipermeable membrane (molecular mass cut-off 10 kDa) was used to measure the iron dialysability. An interlaboratory trial between nine laboratories was conducted to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the agreed method. The reproducibility of the method among the participating laboratories was 20-30% and depended on the content of dialysable iron. Several factors contributing to the variation in the in vitro dialysability among laboratories are discussed. The pH adjustment in the intestinal digestion was identified as one of the critical parameters. The present in vitro method was used to evaluate the iron dialysability from three meals. The dialysability data were in reasonable agreement with human absorption data. The usefulness of the in vitro dialysability method is discussed. 3alaboratories 3afoods 3afood analysis 3alaboratory techniques 3anutrient availability 3airon 3apH 3ashrimp 3amineral content 3adialysis 0amembranes 0ameals 0acomparisons 0ain vitro 0abioavailability1 aCrews, H.1 aFlynn, A.1 aDael, P. van.1 aKastenmayer, P.1 aHurrell, R.1 aDeelstra, H.1 aShen, L.H.1 aFairweather-Tait, S.1 aHickson, K.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 Dec., v. 72, no. 4 p.415-424x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<415::AID-JSFA675>3.0.CO;2-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01996naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100002100183245012600204300001600330520076100346650001101107650001901118650002001137650001601157650001601173650001901189650001401208650002501222653001101247653001501258653001701273700002701290773010401317852000901421856012301430930003301553945001301586946001101599655001201610IND2062386720221118023335.0980312e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206238672DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199611)72:3<291::AID-JSFA654>3.0.CO;2-O2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandul-Rojas, B.10aChlorophyllase activity in olive fruits and its relationship with the loss of chlorophyll pigments in the fruits and oils  ap. 291-294.  aChlorophyllase activity in fruit and chlorophyll pigment content in both fruits and their corresponding oils were studied in ripe olives of Arbequina and Picual varieties. It was demonstrated that the process of extraction of the virgin oil, as well as propitiating the pheophytinisation of chlorophylls initially present in the fresh fruit, also leads to marked losses of the chlorophyllic pigments. These losses were more acute in the Picual variety than in the Arbequina variety. Given that the levels of chlorophyllase activity measured in the fruits of the Arbequina variety were 100 times greater than those in the Picual variety, it is not possible to attribute the loss of chlorophyll pigments to activation of chlorophyllase during oil processing. 3aolives 3achlorophyllase 3aenzyme activity 3adegradation 3achlorophyll 3aplant pigments 3aolive oil 3achemical composition 0alosses 0apheophytin 0apheophorbide1 aMinguez-Mosquera, M.I.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 Nov., v. 72, no. 3 p.291-294x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199611)72:3<291::AID-JSFA654>3.0.CO;2-O3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03368naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245016000169300001600329520214400345650001502489650002202504650002302526650001402549650002202563650003002585650002502615650001802640650001902658650002102677651001002698700001402708700001402722773007602736852000902812856009202821930003302913945001302946946001102959655001202970IND2333527920221118023238.0030711e200302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233352792DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00745.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, R.O.10aSpatial and temporal variations in mortality of the biennial plant, Lysimachia rubida: effects of intraspecific competition and environmental heterogeneity  ap. 114-125.  a1. We studied mortality, growth and spatial distribution of individuals of Lysimachia rubida to elucidate causes and consequences of temporal and spatial variations in mortality. This short-lived monocarpic biennial grows in open dry habitats on rocky coastal cliffs of the subtropical Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, Japan. 2. All individuals of two successive cohorts that appeared in a 8 x 8-m quadrat were mapped, and their fate and size were recorded at 2-3 month intervals from March 1998 to July 2000. We analysed spatial and temporal changes in the relative importance of plant size, local densities of neighbouring plants and ground surface conditions to determine plant mortality. We also examined spatially non-random mortality and its spatial scales. 3. Patchy seed dispersal from scattered mother plants resulted in a clumped distribution of seedlings. During the growth cycle of L. rubida, we recognized two growth stages that differed in the relative importance of the factors affecting plant mortality. 4. At the earlier growth stage, after germination in March until July, mortality was caused mainly by local density. Smaller plants within areas of high local densities were more likely to die. The spatial patterns of surviving and dead plants tended to be regular and aggregated, respectively, in comparison with those expected from random mortality. The spatial scale of aggregation of the dead plants was 5-25 cm, corresponding to the distance of direct interactions between neighbours. 5. At the later growth stages, in October until May of the following year, mortality was affected mainly by ground surface conditions. Both surviving and dead plants were spatially aggregated at spatial scales of 20-100 cm. Plants tended to survive in micro-habitats of smaller gravel, which had a greater water-holding capacity. 6. This study also showed the consequence of spatial variations in mortality on population structures of L. rubida. Patchy seed dispersal and subsequent temporal and spatial variations in mortality are likely to contribute to the scattered distribution of L. rubida individuals observed at the study site. 3aLysimachia 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3amortality 3aplant competition 3aintraspecific competition 3aspatial distribution 3aplant density 3aseed dispersal 3aseed germination 3aJapan1 aKudoh, H.1 aKachi, N.0 tJournal of ecology.g2003 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.114-125x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00745.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03134naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001500183245011400198300001600312520169700328650001902025650002102044650001102065650001202076650001402088650001402102650002002116650001102136650001002147650001802157650002102175650002002196650001402216650001502230650001902245650002702264650003602291653002302327700002102350773010402371852000902475856012302484930003302607945001302640946001102653655001202664IND2061927220221118023142.0980219e199612  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206192722DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<501::AID-JSFA688>3.0.CO;2-T2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiy, P.C.10aEffects of sodium fertiliser on the chemical composition of grass and clover leaves, stems and inflorescences  ap. 501-510.  aSodium fertiliser was applied to dairy cow pasture to investigate the effects on the chemical composition of grass and clover leaves, stems and inflorescences. The effect of sodium fertiliser varied between fractions, with grass leaves and stems generally being more responsive than grass inflorescences or clover fractions. The sodium content of all fractions was already high in the control treatment, and was increased to an excessive level by sodium fertiliser in all fractions except grass stems. Grass leaves were most affected. Potassium content was reduced in grass leaves and stems, but not in other fractions. The effects on calcium and magnesium varied between fractions but the K : (Ca + Mg) ratio, the most sensitive index of susceptibility to hypomagnesaemia, was reduced in grass leaves, but increased in other fractions. DM digestibility was decreased in grass and clover leaves by sodium, probably because of the high sodium content. MAD fibre content was also increased in these fractions. Crude protein content was decreased by sodium fertiliser in grass leaves, in particular. Therefore, when applied to pasture which is naturally high in sodium, sodium fertiliser had detrimental effects on pasture macronutrient content. However, beneficial effects were still observed on mineral ratios for plant and animal nutrition. It is concluded that if sodium fertiliser increases herbage sodium concentrations above 5 g kg-1 DM, improvements in mineral ratios that could affect ruminant health may be offset by reductions in the nutritive value of the herbage. It is therefore recommended that the herbage sodium concentration should be known before sodium fertiliser is applied. 3aLolium perenne 3aTrifolium repens 3asodium 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3aleaves 3astems 3afiber content 3anutrient content 3amineral content 3achlorides 3aphosphorus 3ainflorescences 3ain vitro digestibility 3achemical constituents of plants 0asodium fertilizers1 aPhillips, C.J.C.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 Dec., v. 72, no. 4 p.501-510x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199612)72:4<501::AID-JSFA688>3.0.CO;2-T3Available from publisher's Web site  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02671naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245012500170300001600295500001500311520125100326650001301577650002101590650002001611650002101631650001301652650001301665650001201678650001001690650002001700650001401720650001101734650002001745650001001765650001001775651001501785653002301800653001901823653002201842653001101864700001401875700001601889700001401905773007601919852000901995856009202004930003302096945001302129946001102142655001202153IND2333528120221118023327.0030711e200302  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233352812DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00747.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, R.C.10aDo ants feed plants?

Nutrient fluxes play a significant role in the interaction of myrmecophytic plants and their symbiotic ants. There is a clear flux from plants to ants via nectar or food bodies but nutrient fluxes from ants to plants are less obvious. 2. We report on a nitrogen flux from ants to plants in the association between Pheidole bicornis (Formicidae-Myrmicinae) and two myrmecophytic Piper species (P. fimbriulatum and P. obliquum, Piperaceae). Pulse experiments were performed by feeding ants with 15N-labelled glycine supplied in sucrose solution. Workers passed ingested label on to other ants and the brood by trophallaxis. 3. The distribution of label within the colony showed highest incorporation rates in larvae and in the working caste, while the reproductive caste received only a small amount of the 15N-labelled food. 4. Nutrient transfer from ants to plants occurred remarkably fast. Within 6 days, up to 25% of the nitrogen ingested by the ants was incorporated by the plants. 5. However, ant distribution within P. fimbriulatum plants did not correlate with the intra-plant uptake pattern of 15N, and ant-mediated nitrogen uptake by myrmecophytic P. fimbriulatum accounted for less than 1% of the plants' above-ground nitrogen demand. 3aPheidole 3anitrogen content 3aplant nutrition 3aisotope labeling 3apetioles 3anitrogen 3asucrose 3astems 3anutrient uptake 3amutualism 3alarvae 3astable isotopes 3aroots 3aPiper 3aCosta Rica 0apiper fimbriulatum 0apiper obliquum 0apheidole bicornis 0aleaves1 aWanek, W.1 aRichter, A.1 aMayer, V.0 tJournal of ecology.g2003 Feb., v. 91, no. 1 p.126-134x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00747.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02878naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001700183245011400200300001600314520176200330650002202092650001902114650001902133650002302152653001802175700001702193700001902210700001802229773010402247852000902351856012302360930003302483945001302516946001102529655001202540IND2052992920221118023228.0960912e199606  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205299292DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199606)71:2<237::AID-JSFA574>3.0.CO;2-P2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa, E.A.S.10aChanges in glucosinolate concentrations in Brassica crops (B oleracea and B napus) throughout growing seasons  ap. 237-244.  aIn the Iberian Peninsula, Brassica crops are grown throughout the year and may be consumed at immature stages or leaves may be harvested by 'picking-over' during plant growth. Consumption of Brassicas in Portugal is high but there is no information on the levels of glucosinolates in such material. Changes in the total and individual glucosinolate concentrations of four Brassica oleracea types (two cultivars of Portuguese cabbage, one Portuguese kale type and one hybrid white cabbage) and one Portuguese Brassica napus type were monitored throughout two growing seasons, spring/summer (SS) and summer/ winter (SW). Glucosinolates were determined between sowing and maturity corresponding to nine sampling dates in the leaves and five harvests in the heads. The main glucosinolates in B oleracea types were 3-methylsulphinylpropyl-, allyl- and indol-3-ylmethyl- whereas in the B napus type pent-4-enyl-, 2-hydroxybut-3-enyl- and but-3-enylglucosinolate predominated. In the leaves of B oleracea types, the highest concentration of total glucosinolates and of most of the individual glucosinolates was observed at 14 days after sowing whilst, in the heads the highest levels were noted at the start of head formation. In the B napus, the highest total and individual glucosinolate concentration was generally observed at the end of the growing season. Both for the total and for the main individual glucosinolates there were significant differences (P < 0.001) between the nine harvest dates and between growing seasons. Between the two seasons, the glucosinolate levels in SS were generally higher than in SW. A comparison of cultivars showed the hybrid cabbage to have generally higher glucosinolate levels than the Portuguese types, except for B napus. 3aBrassica oleracea 3aBrassica napus 3aglucosinolates 3aseasonal variation 0agrowth period1 aHeaney, R.K.1 aPortas, C.A.M.1 aFenwick, G.R.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 June, v. 71, no. 2 p.237-244x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199606)71:2<237::AID-JSFA574>3.0.CO;2-P3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02459naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001600183245008600199300001600285520133500301650001401636650001701650650001601667650002301683650001301706650001601719653001001735700002101745700001901766700001901785773010401804852000901908856012301917930003302040945001302073946001102086655001202097IND2053151520221118023235.0960920e199607  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205315152DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199607)71:3<345::AID-JSFA590>3.0.CO;2-T2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMousa, Y.M.10aEffect of altitude on fruit and oil quality characteristics of 'Mastoides' olives  ap. 345-350.  aOlive fruit of cv 'Mastoides' grown on two locations at altitudes of 100 and 800 m were harvested at three data and used for determination of average weight, fruit oil and moisture contents and the following oil quality characteristics: titratable acidity, peroxide value, K232,270 coefficients, total phenol, tocopherol and chlorophyll content as well as fatty acid and phenol composition. Towards maturation, fruit moisture content decreased but oil content increased. Titratable acidity of oil of both altitudes was low, with higher the oil obtained from fruits from 100 m. Oil peroxide value was higher in the oil of fruits from 800 m at all harvest times and it showed an increase towards maturation in both locations. Total phenol content was higher in oil from 100 m elevation and showed a gradual decrease towards maturation at both altitudes. The ratio unsaturated saturated fatty acids was higher in oil of fruits from 800 m at the first two harvest dates but did not differ significantly at the third harvest. Only alpha-tocopherol was found in the oil from both elevations. Some phenolic compounds were detected in the first harvest but disappeared with fruit maturation, while other compounds not detected in the first harvest appeared later. Elevation influenced not only the phenol content but also its composition. 3aolive oil 3afood quality 3afatty acids 3aphenolic compounds 3aaltitude 3afruit trees 0afruit1 aGerasopoulos, D.1 aMetzidakis, I.1 aKiritsakis, A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 July, v. 71, no. 3 p.345-350x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199607)71:3<345::AID-JSFA590>3.0.CO;2-T3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle03423naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169072001700186100001500203245014300218300001600361520210000377650001502477650002102492650001802513650002202531650001502553650002002568650001802588650002402606650002002630650003002650650000902680651001002689700001502699700001702714773007602731852000902807856009202816930003302908945002502941946001102966655001202977IND4364574220221118023007.0040920e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436457422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00875.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKubota, Y.10aEffects of topographic heterogeneity on tree species richness and stand dynamics in a subtropical forest in Okinawa Island, southern Japan  ap. 230-240.  a1. We used a structural equation model (SEM) to clarify the relationship between productivity and species richness across a topographic gradient in a subtropical forest in southern Japan and to quantify the direct and indirect effects of topographic position and soil properties on community attributes. 2. Higher soil nitrogen on ridges was associated with low soil pH and high soil organic matter, but differences in soil chemistry were small compared with those observed in tropical forests. 3. Species richness increased from the valley, via slopes, to ridges. Understorey and microphyllous species, both of which are typically found in gaps or in windy sites, were more abundant on slopes and ridges than in the valley. Habitat preferences of the species, reflecting shade/drought tolerance rather than soil fertility, may be a primary cause of differences in species richness between the topographic types. 4. The total effect of species richness on biomass increment was greater than that of tree density, and biomass increment increased linearly with species richness. This, together with the fact that combined effects of topography, soil properties and ground flora on biomass increment were comparable with that of tree density, indicates that the relationship was caused by habitat heterogeneity rather than a density effect. 5. Frequent disturbances and chronic wind stress resulted in higher mortality and a greater loss of biomass, especially on the ridges, and probably prevented species with different functional traits (e.g. maximum height) from competing for light. 6. Topographic variation therefore appears to lead to structural/compositional heterogeneity within this subtropical forest, enabling the occurrence of a wider range of species. The growth and survival of a variety of species with different functional traits are diversified by environmental conditions along the topographic position. This causes variation in productivity between the topographic types, and suggests that functional resilience associated with species richness contributes to high productivity. 3asubtropics 3atropical forests 3aforest stands 3aspecies diversity 3atopography 3astand structure 3astand density 3apopulation dynamics 3asoil properties 3ainterspecific competition 3awind 3aJapan1 aMurata, H.1 aKikuzawa, K.0 tJournal of ecology.g2004 Apr., v. 92, no. 2 p.230-240x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-0477.2004.00875.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20050804b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02894naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001500183245013100198300001600329500001500345520145400360650000901814650002101823650001601844650001601860650002401876650001101900650002001911650001001931650001601941650001601957650001101973650000901984650001501993650001402008653001302022653000902035700001702044700001602061700001302077700001702090773010402107852000902211856012302220930003302343945001302376946001102389655001202400IND2053919420221118023041.0961106e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205391942DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199608)71:4<415::AID-JSFA599>3.0.CO;2-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, T.10aRice protein isolates produced by the two different methods lower serum cholesterol concentration in rats compared with casein  ap. 415-424.  a2019-12-04  aHighly purified rice protein isolates (RPI) were prepared by an alkaline extraction-acid precipitation method (E-RPI) and by an alpha-amylase treatment to remove starch (T-RPI). Biological values of these RPI were significantly lower than that of casein. Serum cholesterol concentrations were compared among groups of rats fed (per kg diet) 200, 300 or 400 g E-RPI, 400 g T-RPI, 250 or 400 g casein kg-1 or 400 g soya bean protein isolate (SPI). With all the diets containing 400 g protein kg-1 diet, growth rates of rats were the same. At this level, E-RPI, T-RPI and SPI diets produced significantly lower serum cholesterol concentrations than the casein diet. Faecal bile acid plus neutral steroid excretion was significantly higher in rats fed the 400 g kg-1 T-RPI or 400 g kg-1 SPI diets compared with rats fed the 400 g kg-1 casein diet. On the other hand, the 400 g kg-1 E-RPI diet did not increase steroid excretion. Plasma cholesterol concentrations in rats fed diets with amino acid mixtures simulating SPI and E-RPI were also significantly lower than that of rats fed the diet with an amino acid mixture simulating casein even though the faecal excretions of total bile acids were the same amongst groups. These results support the view that RPI are hypocholesterolaemic relative to casein and at least the hypocholesterolaemic effects of E-RPI would be independent of interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of endogenous steroids. 3arice 3aprotein isolates 3ablood serum 3asoy protein 3ahypocholesterolemia 3astarch 3anutritive value 3afeces 3acholesterol 3aamino acids 3acasein 3arats 3abile acids 3aexcretion 0asteroids 0adiet1 aOh-Hashi, A.1 aKasaoka, S.1 aIkai, M.1 aKiriyama, S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1996 Aug., v. 71, no. 4 p.415-424x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199608)71:4<415::AID-JSFA599>3.0.CO;2-63Available from publisher's Web site  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001700183245022900200300001600429520101000445650001101455650001901466650001401485650001101499650001101510650002201521650003001543650001901573650002501592650003401617700001801651700001501669700001501684773010401699852000901803856012301812930003301935945001301968946001101981655001201992IND2053920120221118023143.0961106e199608  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205392012DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199608)71:4<475::AID-JSFA603>3.0.CO;2-C2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoning, B.10aApple allergy: the cDNA sequence of the major allergen of apple, determined by performing PCR with a primer based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence, is highly homologous to the sequence of the major birch pollen allergen  ap. 475-482.  aConsidering the known N-terminal amino acid sequence of the major apple allergen, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer was selected to amplify cDNA encoding this protein. A single PCR product was obtained, cloned into Escherichia coli and subsequently sequenced. The missing 5'-end of the apple cDNA sequence was obtained by a 5'-RACE method. The cDNA sequence showed 72% identity with the coding region of one of the known isoforms of Bet v 1, the major allergen of birch pollen. The deduced amino acid sequence resulted in a 158-residue protein with a calculated molecular mass of 17.5 kDa and 63% amino acid sequence identity to Bet v 1. In addition, further protein alignments showed a high degree of identity with allergens from other tree pollens and some 'pathogenesis-related proteins' from food plants.

The aim of this work was to verify existence in quinoa of the distinctive cell wall features identified in other Chenopodiaceae, ie presence of pectin-bound ferulic acid and dehydrodiferulic acids. Alcohol-insoluble solids (AIS) were prepared from leaves, stems and roots of mature quinoa plants, representing 0.10, 0.20 and 0.47g g(-1) respectively of the fresh weight. Ferulic acid and dehydrodiferulic acid derivatives were present in all the organs, with the highest concentrations in the leaves with 2.1 and 0.5 mg g(-1) AIS respectively. The ratio of dehydrodiferulic acid to ferulic acid was highest in the roots. Pectins extracted by hot HCl from AIS of leaves were rich in ferulic acid (3.4 mg g(-1)), but also highly acetylated (DAc 20), and rich in rhamnose, two characteristics encountered in other Chenopodiaceae. 3astems 3apectins 3arhamnose 3acell wall components 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aferulic acid 3aroots 3aleaves 0asugars 0acoumaric acids 0adehydrodiferulic acids 0aacetylated pectins1 aWende, G.1 aBooth, E.J.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Nov., v. 79, no. 14 p.2029-2034x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199911)79:14<2029::AID-JSFA483>3.0.CO;2-B3Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001400185245011500199300001800314520147200332650001501804650001801819650001601837650001501853650001401868650002301882650001801905650001401923650002501937650001801962650001501980650002301995650001602018650002102034650001302055653001402068653001402082653001502096653002602111700001702137700001202154700001702166700001402183773010702197852000902304856012502313930003302438945001302471946001102484655001202495IND2205642120221118022023.0000710e199911  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220564212DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199911)79:14<2010::AID-JSFA471>3.0.CO;2-U2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzuma, K.10aEvaluation of antioxidative activity of vegetable extracts in linoleic acid emulsion and phospholipid bilayers  ap. 2010-2016.  aThe antioxidative effects of vegetable extracts were evaluated using linoleic acid emulsion and liposomal phospholipid suspension systems. First, the antioxidative activities of water, ethanol and 2% metaphosphoric acid extracts of the vegetables were investigated by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption in the peroxidation of linoleic acid mitiated by a radical generator, 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), with a Clark electrode in the absence of metal chelators. Ethanol extracts of moroheiya and perilla exhibited the highest antioxidative activities. Without metal chelators, 12 ethanol extracts and one water extract acted as prooxidants, and this phenomenon could be attributed to the prooxidant action of ascorbic acid in the presence of free transition metal ions. Next, peroxyl radical-scavenging activities of vegetable extracts were examined by adding a metal chelator, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), to the linoleic acid emulsion system. The results were compared with their antioxidative activities in phospholipid bilayers by measuring the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in large unilamellar vesicles composed of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC). A good correlation was observed between the antioxidative activities obtained from these two systems. The antioxidative activities in the liposomal phospholipid suspension system correlated with total contents of ascorbic acid and polyphenols in vegetable extracts. 3avegetables 3aascorbic acid 3apolyphenols 3aflavonoids 3aoxidation 3alipid peroxidation 3alinoleic acid 3aemulsions 3aphosphatidylcholines 3afree radicals 3aelectrodes 3aoxygen consumption 3ameasurement 3achelating agents 3aextracts 0amembranes 0aliposomes 0ainhibition 0aunilamellar liposomes1 aIppoushi, K.1 aIto, H.1 aHigashio, H.1 aTerao, J.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Nov., v. 79, no. 14 p.2010-2016x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199911)79:14<2010::AID-JSFA471>3.0.CO;2-U3Available from publisher's Web site  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02421naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001300185245005800198300001800256500001500274520105300289650001401342650001701356650000901373650001601382650001501398650001101413650001301424650001501437650001901452650001101471653002001482653001601502653002001518653003201538653001701570653003401587700001401621700001801635773010701653852000901760856012501769930003301894945001301927946001101940655001201951IND2204507720221118021855.0000511e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220450772DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1958::AID-JSFA468>3.0.CO;2-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeth, A.10aIron solubilisation by chicken muscle protein digests  ap. 1958-1963.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this work was to compare the solubilisation of iron by in vitro digests of soluble and insoluble protein fractions from chicken muscle. Chicken breast muscle was extracted to provide dilute salt-soluble protein (DSSP) and dilute salt-insoluble protein (DSIP) fractions. These fractions together with casein and ovalbumin were subjected to in vitro digestion in the presence of ferric iron. After proteolytic digestion, soluble iron increased fourfold for DSSP, 20-fold for DSIP, twofold for casein and 0.5-fold for ovalbumin. 64% of the soluble iron in the DSSP digest and 30% of the soluble iron in the DSIP digest were ferrous; in the casein and ovalbumin digests, less than 6% was ferrous. Dialysable iron was less than 5% of the soluble iron for all proteins and was mostly ferric iron. DSIP solubilised twice as much iron as DSSP but much less than casein or ovalbumin digests. It was concluded that muscle proteins solubilise iron by reduction and chelation to mostly large (non-dialysable) peptides resulting from digestion. 3aovalbumin 3achicken meat 3airon 3aproteolysis 3apancreatin 3acasein 3aextracts 3asolubility 3asolubilization 3apepsin 0adialyzable iron 0aferric ions 0aanimal proteins 0adilute salt soluble protein 0aferrous ions 0adilute salt insoluble protein1 aDíaz, M.1 aMahoney, R.R.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Oct., v. 79, no. 13 p.1958-1963x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1958::AID-JSFA468>3.0.CO;2-R3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02269naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007500092040001800167100001500185245014400200300001800344520077200362650001701134650002301151650001701174650001901191650002601210650003301236650002601269650001901295650000901314650002301323653004101346653003701387653003101424700001901455700001701474700001701491700001701508773010701525852000901632856012501641930003301766945001301799946001101812655001201823IND2204507320221118022020.0000511e199910  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220450732DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199910)79:13<1949::AID-JSFA462>3.0.CO;2-A2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaw, P.E.10aDiscriminant and principal component analyses to classify commercial orange juices based on relative amounts of volatile juice constituents  ap. 1949-1953.  aPasteurised orange juices and two types of commercial orange juice from frozen concentrate were differentiated based on the combined levels of 15-25 volatile constituents monitored in each of 44 juice samples.

The content of total extractable proanthocyanidins, catechins ((+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epicatechin gallate), procyanidin dimers B1 to B8 and trimer C1 in skin and grape seeds were further determined. The quantitative determination was performed through Fractogel TSK chromatography followed by HPLC analysis. The highest concentration of procyanidins is present in the grapes in the early stages of development. (+)-Catechin was the major constituent of flavan-3-ols in skin and grape seeds. Procyanidin dimers B1, B4 and B6 represent the majority of dimers in the early stage of grape seeds development, while in the last stage of maturation dimers B2 and B4 were predominant. Curiously, the decrease in the procyanidins concentration goes along with a corresponding increase of dimer B2 synthesis during grape ripening. Dimer B1 was always the major dimer in skin. The differences between the two seasons were more significant than those between the Ugni blanc and Semillon varieties. However, Semillon contains a higher concentration of total proanthocyanidins. 3aepicatechin 3achemical composition 3aproanthocyanidins 3achemical constituents of plants 3agrape seeds 3awine cultivars 3aVitis vinifera 3acatechin 3aseed development 0apolyphenols 0aflavans 0aepicatechin gallate 0afruits 0agrape skins 0aripening stage 0aflavanols1 aGlories, Y.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g1999 Sept., v. 79, no. 12 p.1601-1606x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(199909)79:12<1601::AID-JSFA407>3.0.CO;2-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02547naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003600112245018700148300001400335520109700349650001901446650002101465650002501486650001101511650002101522650001401543650002001557650001401577650001601591650002001607650001401627650002101641651001101662700003001673700003001703700002201733700002101755700003201776700002601808700002501834700003001859773011701889856006502006961000902071852000902080655001202089IND60748221120221118022008.0210823e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074822112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Lucas Mateus Riverio14aThe alarming vulnerability of Coffea canephora varieties and germplasm to a virulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae, the cause of bacterial halo blight of coffee in Brazil  ap. 45-49.  aBacterial halo blight caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae is a limiting disease to the coffee crop due to difficulty and low efficiency of the chemical control on field conditions. The simultaneous use of windbreaks and resistant cultivars seem to be the most appropriate measure of disease management. Although the bacterial halo blight resistance has been extensively studied in Coffea arabica, information about the reaction of C. canephora germplasm is not available. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify resistance sources to the bacterial halo blight in C. canephora germplasm, for use in breeding programs. Several commercial cultivars, botanical varieties, clones and hybrids of C. canephora were tested against a highly virulent P. syringae pv. garcae strain through artificial inoculations in greenhouse conditions. Only 1.4% of 2.421 evaluated plants were considered resistant to the disease. Our results showed the alarming vulnerability of Coffea canephora crop and germplasm to the bacterial halo blight from Brazil and the need to select resistant cultivars. 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3aPseudomonas syringae 3ablight 3achemical control 3acultivars 3adisease control 3agermplasm 3agreenhouses 3aplant pathology 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aBrazil1 aAndrade, Vincius Teixeira1 aCarneiro, Murilo Galhardo1 aAparecida, Suzete1 aDestefano, Lanza1 aBeriam, Luis Otavio Saggion1 aBraghini, Masako Toma1 aFazuoli, Luis Carlos1 aFilho, Oliveiro Guerreiro0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2021 Feb., v. 103, no. 1 p.45-49dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42161-020-00715-y  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle00747naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245008500131300001600216520009200232650002800324651001300352773007700365852000900442939003300451945000800484946001300492655001200505991625752140742620221118021806.0831205e198301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830104742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStone, W.B.10aIntestinal obstruction in raccoons caused by the ascarid Baylisascaris procyonis  ap. 117-118.  aBaylisascaris procyonis, 2 cases in raccoons, cause of intestinal obstruction and death 3aBaylisascaris procyonis 3aNew York0 tNew York fish and game journal.g1983 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.117-1187nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831205c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02540naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014800128300001400276520154200290650002501832650001201857650001401869650001201883650001501895650001801910650002301928650002601951653002401977653001402001653002202015700001702037773005802054852000902112930003302121945001302154946001102167655001202178IND2040285720221118022057.0940615s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204028572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteinberg, G.12aA quantitative analysis of the interspecific plasmodesmata in the non-division walls of the plant chimera Laburnocytisus adamii (Poit.)

(i) In several independent transformant lines, PFP expression was decreased by 70-90% in growing tubers and by 88-99% in stored tubers. (ii) The plants did not show any visual phenotype, reduction of growth or decrease in total tuber yield. However, the tubers contained 20-40% less starch than the wild type. Sucrose levels were slightly increased in growing tubers, but not at other stages. The rates of accumulation of sucrose and free hexoses when tubers were stored at 4 degrees C and the final amount accumulated were the same in antisense and wild-type tubers. (iii) Metabolites were investigated at four different stages in tuber life history; growing (sink) tubers, mature tubers, cold-sweetening tubers and sprouting (source) tubers. At all stages, compared to the wild type, antisense tubers contained slightly more hexose-phosphates, two- to threefold less glycerate-3-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate and up to four- to fivefold more fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. (iv) There was no accumulation or depletion of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), or of UDP-glucose relative to the hexose-phosphates. (v) The pyruvate content was unaltered or only marginally decreased. and the ATP/ADP ratio did not change. (vi) Labelling experiments on intact tubers did not reveal any significant decrease in the unidirectional rate of metabolism of [U-14C]sucrose to starch, organic acids or amino acids. Stored tubers with an extreme (90%) reduction of PFP showed a 25% decrease in the metabolism of [U14-C] sucrose. (vii) Metabolism cycling) of [U-14C]glucose to sucrose increased 15-fold in discs from growing antisense tubers, compared with growing wild-type tubers. Resynthesis of sucrose was increased by 10-20% when discs from antisense and wild-type tubers stored at 4 degrees C (cold sweetening) were compared. The conversion of [U-14C]glucose to starch was decreased by about 300,& and 50%, respectively. (viii) The randomisation of [1-13C]glucose in the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties of sucrose was decreased from 13.8 and 15.7% in the wild type to 3.6 and 3.9% in an antisense transformant. Simultaneously, randomisation in glucosyl residues isolated from starch was reduced from 14.4 to 4.1%. (ix) These results provide evidence that PFP catalyses a readily reversible reaction in tubers, which is responsible for the recycling of label from triose-phosphates to hexose-phosphates. but with the net reaction in the glycolytic direction. The results do not support the notion that PFP is involved in regulating the cytosolic PPi concentration. They also demonstrate that PFP does not control the rate of glycolysis, and that tubers contain exessive capacity, to phosphorylate fructose-6-phosphate. The decreased concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate and glycerate-3-phosphate compensates for the decrease of PFP protein stimulating ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase, and by stimulating fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase to increase the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate concentration and activate the residual PFP. The decreased starch accumulation is explained as an indirect effect, caused by the increased rate of resynthesis (cycling) of sucrose in the antisense tubers. 3aphenotype 3agenetic code 3achemical constituents of plants 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3asucrose 3aSolanum tuberosum 3agene expression 3atubers 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3apyrophosphates 3aglycolysis 3afructose 3acatalytic activity 3ametabolites 0ametabolism 0asubstrates 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aSonnewald, U.1 aViola, R.1 aCarlisle, S.1 aDennis, D.1 aStitt, M.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 192, no. 1 p.16-30x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04176naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011600124300001600240500001500256520309600271650001903367650001703386650002603403650002003429650002203449650002703471650002203498650001403520650001803534650001603552653000903568653001903577653001003596700002003606700001403626773006003640852000903700930003303709945001303742946001103755655001203766IND2041974220221118022021.0940913s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204197422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerst, U.10aATP and NADPH as the driving force of carbon reduction in leaves in relation to thylakoid energization by light  ap. 421-429.  a2019-12-05  aCarbon assimilation of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves was measured in the presence of 2000 microliter 1-1 CO2 and 2% O2 in the gas phase to suppress photorespiratory reactions and to reduce stomatal diffusion resistance. Simultaneously, membrane parameters such as modulated chlorophyll fluorescence, oxidation of P700 in the reaction centre of photosystem I, and apparent changes in absorbance at 535 nm were recorded. After light-regulated enzymes were activated at a high irradiance, illumination was changed. About 3 min later (to maintain the previous activation state of enzymes), leaves were shock-frozen and freeze-dried. Chloroplasts were isolated nonaqueously and analysed for ATP, ADP, inorganic phosphate, NADPH and NADP. Observations made under the chosen conditions differed in some important aspects from those commonly observed when leaves are illuminated in air. (i) Not only assimilation, but also the phosphorylation potential [ATP]/([ADP].[PI]) increased hyperbolically with irradiance towards saturation. In contrast, the ratio of NADPH to NADP did not change much as irradiances increased from low to high photon flux densities. When ATP, the phosphorylation potential and the assimilatory force, F(A) (the product of phosphorylation potential and NADPH/NADP ratio), were plotted against assimilation, ATP increased relatively less than assimilation, whereas the phosphorylation potential increased somewhat more steeply than assimilation did. A linear relationship existed between assimilation and F(A) at lower irradiances. The assimilatory force F(A) increased more than assimilation did when irradiances were very high. Differences from previous observations, where F(A) was under some conditions higher at low than at high rates of carbon assimilation, are explained by differences in flux resistances caused not only by stomatal diffusion resistance but also by differences in the activity of light-regulated enzymes. (ii) The relationship between P700 oxidation and a fast absorption change with a maximum close to 520 nm on one hand and carbon assimilation on the other hand was largely linear under the specific conditions of the experiments. A similar linear relationship existed also between the quantum efficiency of electron flow through photosystem II and the quantum efficiency of photosystem I electron transport. (iii) Whereas the increase in non-photochemical fluorescence quenching, qN, was similar to the increase in assimilation, the relationship between light scattering and assimilation was distinctly sigmoidal. Light scattering appeared to be a better indicator of control of photosystem II activity under excessive irradiation than qN. (iv) The results are discussed in relation to the relative significance of chloroplast levels of ATP and NADPH and of the assimilatory force FA in driving carbon assimilation. From the observations, the proton/electron (H+/e-) ratio of linear electron transport is suggested to be 3 and the H+/ATP ratio to be 4 in leaves. An H+/e- ratio of 3 implies the existence of an obligatory Q-cycle in leaves. 3aplant pigments 3afluorescence 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aelectron transfer 3aoxidation 3aphotosystem I 3achlorophyll 0ap700 0aphotosynthesis 0alight1 aSchonknecht, G.1 aHeber, U.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 193, no. 3 p.421-429x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03283naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010400123300001600227500001500243520221900258650002702477650003002504650001602534650002202550650002202572650002802594650002502622650002002647650001802667653001702685653002402702653003002726700001502756773006002771852000902831930003302840945001302873946001102886655001202897IND2041974320221118022030.0940913s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204197432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeil, M.10aAcid invertase in Nicotiana tabacum crown-gall cells: molecular properties of the cell-wall isoform  ap. 430-437.  a2019-12-05  aCell-wall invertase (CWI:EC 3.2.1.26) was salt-eluted from non-disrupted Agrobacterium tumefaciens-transformed Nicotiana tabacum L. cells and purified to homogeneity. More than 90% of total cellular invertase activity (measured at pH 4.8) was recovered in the NaCl-eluted fraction whereas for the cytoplasmic marker glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 96% of total activity could be extracted from the tissue after salt-elution, indicating absence of appreciable stress-induced cell disruption. Likewise, appreciable contamination of CWI with vacuolar acid invertase could be excluded. Tobacco CWI cross-reacted with an antiserum directed against deglycosylated carrot CWI: however, during some purification steps CWI enzyme activity did not correlate with CWI immunosignal. In fractions of low CWI activity and strong immunosignal, a putative inhibitor peptide with an apparent Mr of 17 kDa was detected after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining (Weil et al. 1994, Planta 193, 438-445). The CWI of transformed tobacco cells has an apparent Mr of 69 kDa (SDS-PAGE) and is a basic (pI 9.5) glycoprotein. Gel-permeation chromatography indicated that enzymatically active CWI is a monomer. Deglycosylation glycosylation of the denatured CWI by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, peptide-N-glycosidase F and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid indicated the presence of two high-mannose and two complex glycans. In partially purified CWI fractions the carrot CWI antiserum cross-reacted with one other tobacco cell-wall peptide (Mr 28 kDa). To address the possibility of a second invertase isoenzyme cross-reacting with the carrot antiserum, intact CWI and the 28-kDa peptide were digested in vitro with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and cyanogen bromide. A comparison of the resulting peptide patterns identified the 18-kDa polypeptide as a cleavage product of (CWI). Running electroeluted CWI (69 kDa) on a second SDS-polyacrylamide gel led to substantial formation of the 28-kDa peptide. This suggests that the intrinsic 28-kDa cleavage product us the result of an intrinic lability of tobacco CWI, rather than being a proteolytic degradation product. 3agenetic transformation 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3acrown galls 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aNicotiana tabacum 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acell wall components 3aenzyme activity 3aglycoproteins 0apurification 0acell wall invertase 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aRausch, T.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 193, no. 3 p.430-437x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02563naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011200127300001300239500001500252520147700267650002701744650002201771650002501793650002201818650001501840650002001855650001701875650001001892650001901902653001701921700002101938700001701959700001901976700001801995700001702013773005702030852000902087930003302096945001302129946001102142655001202153IND2041990620221118021927.0940914s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204199062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalton, N.J.10aPurification and properties of putrescine N-methyltransferase from transformed roots of Datura stramonium L  ap. 9-15.  a2019-12-05  aPutrescine-N-methyltransferase (PMT; EC 2.1.1.53), the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway leading from putrescine to tropane and pyrrolidine alkaloids, has been purified about 700-fold from root cultures of Datura stramonium established following genetic transformation with Agrabacterium rhizogenes. The native enzyme had a molecular weight estimated by gel-permeation chromatography on Superose-6 of 40 kDa; sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the peak fractions from Superose-6 chromatography revealed a band of 36 kDa molecular weight. Kinetic studies of the purified enzyme gave Km values for putrescine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine of 0.31 mM and 0.10 mM. respectively, and Ki values for S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and N-methylputrescine of 0.01 mM and 0.15 mM, respectively. The enzyme was active with some derivatives and analogous of putrescine, including 1,4-diamino-2-hydroxybutane and 1,4-diamino-trans-but-2-ene. Little activity was observed with 1,4-diamino-cis-but-2-ene and none with 1,3-diaminopropane or 1,5-diaminopentane (cadaverine), indicating a requirement for substrate activity of two amino groups in a trans conformation, separated by four carbon atoms. A large number of monoamines were inhibitors of the enzyme. Though not a substrate, cadaverine was a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, with a Ki of 0.04 mM: the significance of this in relation to the biosynthesis of cadaverine-derived alkaloids is discussed. 3agenetic transformation 3aDatura stramonium 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aputrescine 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 3aroots 3atissue culture 0apurification1 aPeerless, A.C.J.1 aRobins, R.J.1 aRhodes, M.J.C.1 aBoswell, H.D.1 aRobins, D.J.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 193, no. 1 p.9-15x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02439naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013600126300001600262520134400278650002201622650002601644650001001670650001901680650001701699650002201716650002301738650002301761650002501784650001101809650003401820653001501854700001701869700001401886700001501900773006001915852000901975930003301984945001302017946001102030655001202041IND2041969020221118022034.0940913s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204196902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYalpani, N.10aUltraviolet light and ozone stimulate accumulation of salicylic acid, pathogenesis-related proteins and virus resistance in tobacco  ap. 372-376.  aIn tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthinc), salicylic acid (SA) levels increase in leaves inoculated by necrotizing pathogens and in healthy leaves located above the inoculated site. Systemic SA increase may trigger disease resistance and synthesis of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR proteins), Here we report that ultraviolet (UV)-C light or ozone induced biochemical responses similar to those induced by necrotizing pathogens. Exposure of leaves to UV-C light or ozone resulted in a transient ninefold increase in SA compared to controls. In addition, in UV-light-irradiated plants. SA increased nearly fourfold to 0.77 microgram.g-1 fresh weight in leaves that were shielded from UV light. Increased SA levels were accompanied by accumulation of an SA conjugate and by an increase in the activity of benzoic acid 2-hydroxylase which catalyzes SA biosynthesis.In irradiated and in unirradiated leaves of plants treated with UV light, as well as in plants fumigated with ozone, PR proteins 1a and 1b accumulated. This was paralleled by the appearance of induced resistance to a subsequent challenge with tobacco mosaic virus. The results suggest that UV light. ozone fumigation and tobacco mosaic virus can activate a common signal-transduction pathway that leads to SA and PR-protein accumulation and increased disease resistance. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aultraviolet radiation 3aozone 3asalicylic acid 3abiosynthesis 3aprotein synthesis 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease resistance 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aleaves 3apathogenesis-related proteins 0aregulation1 aEnyedi, A.J.1 aLeón, J.1 aRaskin, I.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 193, no. 3 p.372-376x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03754naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015100128300001600279500001500295520253400310650003202844650001502876650001402891650001702905650003102922650001402953650001802967650002502985650001703010653001903027653002003046653001103066653001103077653002003088700001803108700001703126700002103143700001803164773006003182852000903242930003303251945001303284946001103297655001203308IND2042073320221118022006.0940916s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204207332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHackney, J.M.10aInfluence of hydrodynamic environment on composition and macromolecular organization of structural polysaccharides in Egregia menziesii cell walls  ap. 461-472.  a2019-12-05  aTo test whether secondary and tertiary structures of marine-algal structural polysaccharides may be altered during adaptive responses to hydrodynamic stresses, juvenile Egregia menziesii (Turn.) Aresch. sporophytes were cultured under three different regimes: (i) low-energy (LE) specimens were subjected to water motion produced by standard bubbling and circulation of tank water; (ii) high-energy (HE) specimens received additional movement in pumped streams of water: and (iii) stretched (STR) specimens were grown under low-energy conditions but also were subjected to constant, longitudinal tension (0.7 N). After 6-10 weeks growth, cell-wall structural polysaccharides from specimen blades were isolated by solubilizing less-ordered matrix polysaccharides. Neutral-sugar and uronic acid contents of these isolates were measured, and samples were analyzed by x-ray diffraction and by Raman and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. On average, structural polysaccharides formed about 7.2% of dry-weight biomass. The portion of isolated mass accountable to neutral sugars ranged from an average of 85% for STR sporophytes to 94% for both LE and HE specimens. For all specimens, glucose composed an average of 99% of this fraction. Uronic acids could not be detected in isolates from any treatment group. Cellulose dominance in each isolate was indicated clearly in x-ray diffraction patterns and in Raman and 13C-NMR spectra. These data further demonstrated that both the cellulose I allomorph and the disordered form of the polymer were present in each isolate and that the STR isolate contained small quantities of the cellulose II allomorph. In general, the LE and HE samples had very similar crystallinity; lateral order was slightly more developed in LE samples. However, the STR treatment produced cellulose with lowest crystallinity and least lateral order. Results suggest that mechanical stress modified cellulose crystallinity in these kelps by altering levels of disordered cellulose and lateral dimensions of cellulose crystallites and, in one instance, changed the crystallinity qualitatively. Physical disturbances to cell plasma membranes may have instigated these trends. In the STR specimens in particular, such disturbances might have been supplemented by fundamental changes to kelp physiology, affecting both substantial decreases in crystallinity and production of the cellulose II allomorph. Changes in the nature of the cellulose cannot, however, account for changes in the elastic moduli. 3aprotein secondary structure 3acell walls 3aalginates 3aPhaeophyceae 3aprotein tertiary structure 3acellulose 3ahydrodynamics 3acell wall components 3auronic acids 0aneutral sygars 0apolysaccharides 0asugars 0astress 0aPhaeophycophyta1 aKraemer, G.P.1 aAtalla, R.H.1 aVanderHart, D.L.1 aChapman, D.J.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 192, no. 4 p.461-472x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03225naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010200145300001600247500001500263520155800278650001301836650004101849650001501890650001801905650002201923650002001945650001301965650002001978650002401998650004302022650005402065650002402119650002702143650002502170650002302195650002102218650002202239650002502261650002802286650003502314650002702349653001102376653002302387653001502410700001902425700001502444700001802459700001702477700001502494773006002509852000902569930003302578945001302611946001102624655001202635IND2042073120221118022108.0940916s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204207312DNAL7 a77646172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRombaldi, C.10aImmunocytolocalization of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase in tomato and apple fruit  ap. 453-460.  a2019-12-05  aThe subcellular localization of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase (ACC oxidase), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene, has been studied in ripening fruits of tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.). Two types of antibody have been raised against (i) a synthetic peptide derived from the reconstructed pTOM13 clone (pRC13), a tomato cDNA encoding ACC oxidase, and considered as a suitable epitope by secondary-structure predictions; and (ii) a fusion protein overproduced in Escherichia coli expressing the pRC13 cDNA. Immunoblot analysis showed that, when purified by antigen affinity chromatography, both types of antibody recognized a single band corresponding to ACC oxidase. Superimposition of Calcofluor white with immunofluorescence labeling, analysed by optical microscopy, indicated that ACC oxidase is located at the cell wall in the pericarp of breaker tomato and climacteric apple (Malus X domestica Borkh.) fruit. The apoplasmic location of the enzyme was also demonstrated by the observation of immunogold-labeled antibodies in this region by both optical and electron microscopy. Transgenic tomato fruits in which ACC-oxidase gene expression was inhibited by an antisense gene exhibited a considerable reduction of labeling. Immunocytological controls made with pre-immune serum or with antibodies pre-absorbed on their corresponding antigens gave no staining. The discrepancy between these findings and the targeting of the protein predicted from sequences of ACC-oxidase cDNA clones isolated so far is discussed. 3apericarp 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3acell walls 3aantisense DNA 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 3aripening 3aMalus domestica 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAmino Acid Oxidoreductasesxanalysisximmunology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntibodiesximmunology 2aAntibody Specificity 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia coli 2aFruitxenzymology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Proteinsxanalysis 2aVegetablesxenzymology 0afruits 0agenetic regulation 0aoxygenases1 aLelievre, J.M.1 aLatche, A.1 aPetitprez, M.1 aBouzayen, M.1 aPech, J.C.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 192, no. 4 p.453-460x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02635naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014400124300001400268520164800282650002301930650002001953650002101973650001401994650001102008650001202019650001002031650002102041650001902062650001302081650001202094653001502106700001602121773005802137852000902195930003302204945001302237946001102250655001202261IND2042724620221118021954.0941020s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204272462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, H.10aSpatial distribution of solutes, K, Na, Ca and their deposition rates in the growth zone of primary cotton roots: Effects of NaCl and CaCl2  ap. 34-41.  aCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Acala SJ-2) seedlings were grown in modified Hoagland nutrient solution with or without 150 mM NaCl and supplemental 10 mM CaCl2. The spatial distribution of bulk-tissue osmotic potential and total osmotica, K, Na and Ca contents were determined in the growth zone of the primary root. This information was combined with the growth-velocity data from an earlier study (Zhong and Lauchli 1993) to estimate net deposition rates of osmoticum, water, K, Na and Ca by using the continuity equation. The osmotic potential was essentially uniform along the growth region for all treatments and considerably lowered by 150 mM NaCl in the medium. Total osmotica deposition was well synchronized with growth and deposition rates were enhanced by 150 mM NaCl. Osmoregulation in the treatments with 150 mM NaCl was indicated by an apparent solute accumulation which appeared to be due to the enhancement of osmoticum deposition rates. The presence of 150 mM NaCl greatly reduced the deposition rates of K and Ca throughout the growth zone; 10 mM Ca mitigated this effect only on K deposition in the apical 2.5-mm region. The deposition rate of Na was increased greatly by 150 mM NaCl; the increase was reduced by 10 mM Ca. At 150 mM NaCl, selectivity of K versus Na of the root was enhanced greatly in the apical 2 mm region by the presence of 10 mM Ca; this mitigating effect by Ca declined rapidly with distance from the root tip. We conclude that one possible mechanism by which supplemental Ca alleviates the inhibitory effects of NaCl on cotton root growth is by maintaining plasma-membrane selectivity of K over Na. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3asodium chloride 3acalcium chloride 3apotassium 3asodium 3acalcium 3aroots 3aosmotic pressure 3aosmoregulation 3asalinity 3asolutes 0adeposition1 aLauchli, A.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 194, no. 1 p.34-41x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01984naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007700127300001400204500001500218520094900233650001901182650001301201650002401214650001401238650003201252650001901284650001801303653001601321653001101337653001101348700001701359700001501376700001901391700002201410700001801432773005801450852000901508930003301517945001301550946001101563655001201574IND2042726720221118021923.0941020s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204272672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, L.D.14aThe relation between plant growth and respiration: a thermodynamic model  ap. 77-85.  a2019-12-05  aA thermodynamic model describing the relation between plant growth and respiration rates is derived from mass- and enthalpy-balance equations. The specific growth rate and the substrate carbon conversion efficiency are described as functions of the metabolic heat rate, the rate of CO2 production, the mean oxidation state of the substrate carbon produced by photosynthesis, and enthalpy changes for conversion of photosynthate to biomass and CO2. The relation of this new model to previous models based only on mass-balance equations is explored. Metabolic heat rate is shown to be a useful additional measure of respiration rates in plant tissues because it leads to a more explicit description of energy relations. Preliminary data on three Zea mays (L.) cultivars are reported. The model suggests new rationales for plant selection, breeding and genetic engineering that could lead to development of plants with more desirable growth rates. 3acarbon dioxide 3aZea mays 3amathematical models 3aequations 3agas production (biological) 3athermodynamics 3agrowth models 0arespiration 0aplants 0agrowth1 aHopkin, M.S.1 aRank, D.R.1 aAnekonda, T.S.1 aBreidenbach, R.W.1 aCriddle, R.S.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 194, no. 1 p.77-85x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03645naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245016700124300001600291500001500307520260500322650001502927650001902942650002202961650001502983650002002998650000703018650001803025650002003043650001703063650001003080653000903090653001703099700001703116773006003133852000903193930003303202945001303235946001103248655001203259IND2042076620221118021921.0940916s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204207662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHager, A.10aLocalization of the xanthophyll-cycle enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase within the thylakoid lumen and abolition of its mobility by a (light-dependent) pH decrease  ap. 581-589.  a2019-12-05  aThe formation of zeaxanthin (Zea) from violaxanthin (Vio) in chloroplasts of leaves and algae upon strong illumination is currently suggested to play a role in the photoprotection of plants. Properties and location of the enzyme Vio de-epoxidase, which is responsible for the transformation of Vio to Zea, were studied using thylakoid membrane vesicles isolated from leaves of Spinacia oleracea L. Without using detergents a repeated freeze-thaw treatment of thylakoid vesicles was sufficient to release the enzyme into the medium. With the same procedure the mobile electron carrier plastocyanin, known to occur in the thylakoid lumen, was also released. The enzyme was demonstrated by its activity in the supernatant of the pelleted thylakoid vesicles in the presence of the added substrates Vio and ascorbic acid, as well as by staining of the released proteins after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The release of the deepoxidase from the vesicles was pH-dependent, declined below pH 6.5 and ceased in the pH range around 5, which corresponds to the pH optimum of the enzyme activity. By using thylakoid vesicles isolated from pre-illuminated and therefore Zea-containing leaves the release by freeze-thaw cycles of both the de-epoxidase and plastocyanin was diminished compared with the dark control. However, the reason for this effect was not the Zea content but an unknown effect of the illumination on the thylakoid membrane properties. The de-epoxidase collected at pH 7 was able to re-bind to thylakoid membranes at pH 5.5 and to transform intrinsic Vio to Zea in the presence of ascorbate. The isolated de-epoxidase, as well as the endogenous membrane-bound de-epoxidase, was inhibited by dithiothreitol. From these results it is concluded that Vio de-epoxidase, like plastocyanin, is mobile within the thylakoid lumen at neutral pH values which occur under in-vivo conditions in the dark. However, upon strong illumination, when the lumen pH drops (pH < 6.5) due to the formation of a proton gradient, the properties of the de-epoxidase are altered and the enzyme becomes tightly bound to the membrane (in contrast to plastocyanin) thus gaining access to its substrate Vio. These findings corroborate the assumption of a transmembrane opposite location of the two enzymes of the xanthophyll cycle, the ascorbate-dependent Vio deepoxidase at the lumenal side and the NADPH-dependent Zea epoxidase at the stromal side. Indications in favour of a location of Vio within the lipid bilayer of the thylakoid membrane and of a binding of the active deepoxidase to these areas are discussed. 3athylakoids 3aantheraxanthin 3aSpinacia oleracea 3azeaxanthin 3aoxidoreductases 3apH 3acytochemistry 3aenzyme activity 3aviolaxanthin 3alight 0adark 0axanthophylls1 aHolocher, K.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 192, no. 4 p.581-589x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010900125300001600234520208400250650002302334650002102357650001502378650001802393650001702411650002502428650001302453650001302466650001902479650002002498653001202518653003502530700001702565773006002582852000902642930003302651945001302684946001102697655001202708IND2050151020221118021926.0960304s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205015102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJetter, R.10aEpicuticular crystals of nonacosan-10-ol: in-vitro reconstitution and factors influencing crystal habits  ap. 257-270.  aThe primary aerial surfaces of plant species from many families (e.g. Pinaceae, Liliaceae, Ranunculaceae, Papaveraceae) are covered by epicuticular tubules 5-20 micrometers long and 0.5 micrometers in diameter. The composition, mechanism of growth and molecular structure of this type of epicuticular aggregates have been studied. Pure nonacosan-10-ol extracted from Picea pungens needle surfaces formed, in vitro, tubular crystals like those occurring in vivo. This crystal habit was obtained irrespective of the type of solvent or substratum, if the solvent was evaporated within minutes. This shows that tubules of nonacosan-10-ol are formed in the kinetic regime of crystallization (limited by the diffusion of molecules from the solution to the crystal surface). Slow evaporation of the solvent or crystallization from the melt resulted in rhombic scales. These planar crystals represent the thermodynamic, stable modification of native nonacosan-10-ol. Homologous impurities in natural nonacosan-10-ol (3-14%) had no effect on the formation of the tubules. However, racemic nonacosan-10-ol invariably crystallized in scales. The phase behaviour of mixtures of natural nonacosan-10-ol and its synthetic racemate as well as synthetic (S)-nonacosan-10-ol provided evidence for the presence of the pure (S)-enantiomer on plant surfaces. The findings are discussed in terms of the mechanisms leading to epicuticular tubules consisting of nonacosan-10-ol and their molecular structure. Crystal structures for the pure enantiomer and the racemate of nonacosan-10-ol are proposed. It is concluded that the principles responsible for the formation of tubules are both the special molecular geometry of the naturally occurring (S)-nonacosan-10-ol and the mobility barrier of the plant cuticle. Further specific biological processes are not necessary for the formation of (S)-nonacosan-10-ol tubules. The alterations of epicuticular structures during ageing or the impact of pollutants are explained as spontaneous transitions between two crystal modifications of (S)-nonacosan-10-ol. 3aPapaver somniferum 3aNelumbo nucifera 3aThalictrum 3aPicea pungens 3awax coatings 3achemical composition 3aalcohols 3acrystals 3aultrastructure 3acrystallization 0acuticle 0athalictrum flavum ssp. glaucum1 aRiederer, M.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 195, no. 2 p.257-270x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01866naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012100128300001600249520092800265650002501193650001901218650001601237650002001253650001801273650001501291650002901306650001601335653003601351700001501387773006001402852000901462930003301471945001301504946001101517655001201528IND2050150820221118021950.0960304s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205015082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalters, R.G.10aAcclimation of Arabidopsis thaliana to the light environment: changes in composition of the photosynthetic apparatus  ap. 248-256.  aAcclimation to changes in the light environment was investigated in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

Plants grown under four light regimes showed differences in their development, morphology, photosynthetic performance and in the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus. Plants grown under high light showed higher maximum rates of oxygen evolution and lower levels of light-harvesting complexes than their low light-grown counterparts; plants transferred to low light showed rapid changes in maximum photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll-a/b ratio as they became acclimated to the new environment. In contrast, plants grown under lights of differing spectral quality showed significant differences in the ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I.

Heynh., FUD-1 and FUD-2, were identified by screening M2 populations of ethylmethane-sulfonate-mutagenized seeds. The resistance was found to be due to single, recessive, nuclear gene mutations. Genetic complementation tests indicated that these two mutations were in the same gene locus, which was designated fur1, and mapped to linkage group four of Arabidopsis. Enzyme assays indicated that the mutants were not defective in thymidine-kinase activity. Greatly reduced concentrations of intracellular 3H were detected in fur1/fur1 plants compared with the wild type after incubation of wild-type and resistant plants in a medium with [3H]FUdR, indicating that either reduced uptake of FUdR or enhanced efflux of FUdR metabolites was the major reason for FUdR-resistance. fur1/fur1 plants also had significantly decreased uptake of thymidine and uridine compared with the wild type but no difference was found in the uptake of adenosine, guanosine, thymine, uracil or amino acids. It is suggested that the transport system affected in the fur1/fur1 mutants is one specific to pyrimidine nucleosides. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3auridine 3aorganofluorine compounds 3arecessive genes 3amutagenesis 3aloci 3acell membranes 3achromosome mapping 0auptake 0aresistance 0aderivatives 0afur1 locus1 aKing, J.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 194, no. 1 p.117-122x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01834naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245015200126300001600278520092500294650001801219650001301237650002701250650002101277650002001298650001801318653001501336700001301351700001801364773006001382852000901442930003301451945001301484946001101497655001201508IND2036613720221118021928.0940107s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203661372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, I.R.10aEvidence for G-protein-linked receptors in higher plants: stimulation of GTP-gamma-S binding to membrane fractions by the mastoparan analogue mas 7  ap. 285-288.  aStimulation of G-protein activity by the amphipathic tetradecapeptide mastoparan is well documented in animal systems and occurs via mimickry of the third cytoplasmic domain of the cognate seven-transmembrane-span (7TMS) receptor. Binding of guanosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate to microsomal and plasma-membrane fractions from Pisum sativum L. and Zea mays L. was stimulated by the tetradecapeptide mastoparan analogue mas 7 over a narrow concentration range, with maximal effect exerted at 10 micromolars peptide, while the nonamphipathic analogue, mas CP, which differed from mas 7 by only one amino acid, was ineffective at promoting binding. This stimulation could be completely abolished by inclusion of low concentrations of the non-ionic detergents nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide and Lubrol PX. Taken together, these data provide good evidence for the existence of G-protein-linked 7TMS receptors in higher plant systems. 3aPisum sativum 3aZea mays 3aguanosine triphosphate 3abinding proteins 3aplasma membrane 3abinding sites 0aregulation1 aWise, A.1 aMillner, P.A.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 191, no. 2 p.285-288x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02510naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011100126300001600237500001500253520157900268650001301847650001501860650002101875650003301896650002201929653001101951653001301962653002401975700001701999700001802016773006002034852000902094930003302103945001302136946001102149655001202160IND2036612720221118021806.0940107s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203661272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, H.Q.10aFertilization in Nicotiana tabacum: ultrastructural organization of propane-jet-frozen embryo sacs in vivo  ap. 256-264.  a2019-12-05  aOvules of Nicotiana tabacum L. were cryofixed with a propane-jet freezer and freeze-substituted in acetone to examine technique-dependent changes in pre- and post-fertilization embryo sacs using rapidly frozen material. Freezing quality was acceptable in 10% of the embryo sacs in the partially dissected ovules, with ice-crystal damage frequently evident in vacuoles and nuclei. One of the two synergids begins to degenerate before pollen-tube arrival in cryofixed material, with breakdown of the plasma membrane and large chalazal vacuole delayed until the penetration of the pollen tube. Early synergid degeneration involved characteristic increases in cytoplasmic electron density and the generation of cytoplasmic bodies to the intercellular space through "pinching-off". Upon pollen-tube arrival, the male gametes are released through a terminal aperture into the degenerate synergid. Sperm cells undergo morphological alteration before gametic fusion: their mitochondrial electron density increases, the endoplasmic reticulum dilates, cytoplasm becomes finely vacuolated and the surrounding pollen plasma membrane is lost, causing the sperm cells and vegetative nucleus to dissociate. Discharge of the pollen tube results in the formation of numerous enucleated cytoplasmic bodies which are either stripped or shed from sperm cells and pollen-tube cytoplasm. Two so-called X-bodies are found in the degenerate synergid after pollen-tube penetration: the presumed vegetative nucleus occurs at the chalazal end and the presumed synergid nucleus near the micropylar end. 3afreezing 3aembryo sac 3acryopreservation 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aNicotiana tabacum 0aovules 0afixation 0acell ultrastructure1 aStrout, G.W.1 aRussell, S.D.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 191, no. 2 p.256-264x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02194naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011400126300001600240520125700256650001801513650001401531650001701545650001201562650002001574650001801594650001601612650003701628650001401665653001601679653002301695773006001718852000901778930003301787945001301820946001101833655001201844IND2036607320221118021658.0940107s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203660732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, V.A.10aGibberellin translocation in Pisum sativum L.

Although the percentage uptake of these compounds from the site of application on the 3 degrees stipules was low and most of the applied GA remained unmetabolised in situ, the quantitative relationship between GA translocation and GA dosage was found to be linear for GA1 but saturating for GA20. The movement of the GAs and their subsequently produced metabolites was mainly acropetal. They accumulated in greatest quantity in the apical extremities of the shoot. Overall, the extent to which GA20 was metabolished in le seedlings was considerably less than in Le pea seedlings. Although all le tissues contained significantly less [3H]GA1 than their Le counterparts, phenotypic effects of the le mutation were apparent only on internode and tendril development. Increased tissue growth, consequent upon GA treatment, was also apparent only in the internodes and tendrils of le plants. For internodes, GA1 content determined the mid-logarithmic-phase growth rate and, consequently, final length. For tendrils, GA20 rather than GA1 may be the primary stimulatory agent. 3aPisum sativum 3aseedlings 3agibberellins 3amutants 3agene expression 3adose response 3ametabolites 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aphenotype 0agrowth rate 0agenetic regulation0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 191, no. 2 p.158-165x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02045naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014000126300001600266500001500282520100900297650001201306650002501318650001701343650002001360650003601380650002801416650001101444653002101455653001701476653001801493700001801511700001601529773006001545852000901605930003301614945001301647946001101660655001201671IND2038146420221118021632.0940323s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203814642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaporte, K.10aInteraction of tubulin with the plasma membrane: tubulin is present in purified plasmalemma and behaves as an integral membrane protein  ap. 413-416.  a2019-12-05  aUsing monoclonal antibodies we have studied the interaction of tubulin with the plasma membrane of leaves of Nicotiana sylvestris (Speg. et Comes) and tobacco suspension-culture cells. The results show that isolated plasma membranes contain tightly bound alpha-tubulins. Their association with the plasma membrane is resistant to non-ionic detergent and to low and high ionic strength. Only extraction with sodium dodecyl sulfate is capable of dissociating these cytoskeletal proteins. It is unlikely that this membrane-bound tubulin is present in its polymeric form because electron-microscopical analysis does not reveal the presence of filaments, whereas treatment of membranes with oryzalin (which has been shown to destabilize microtubules in vitro) does not remove the tubulins from isolated plasma membrane. When living cells are treated with oryzalin, the amount of membrane-associated tubulin is drastically reduced, which could mean that its presence is related to in-vivo microtubule dynamics. 3atubulin 3aNicotiana sylvestris 3amicrotubules 3aplasma membrane 3achemical constituents of plants 3acell suspension culture 3aleaves 0aprotein analysis 0ainteractions 0aplant anatomy1 aRossignol, M.1 aTraas, J.A.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 191, no. 3 p.413-416x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02339naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008000129300001600209520151600225650002101741650001501762650002001777650001001797650001801807650001901825650001101844650001701855700001501872773006001887852000901947930003301956945001301989946001102002655001202013IND2038136020221118021758.0940322s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203813602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTschiersch, H.10aPhotoinhibition in Euglena gracilis: Involvement of reactive oxygen species  ap. 316-323.  aPhotoinhibition of isolated Euglena gracilis thylakoids was characterised by a drastic decline in PSII photochemistry, chlorophyll-a fluorescence and an enhanced degradation of the 32-kDa protein. The process of protein degradation, as shown by studies of [14C] atrazine binding, was clearly slower than the other events. The activity of PSI was not affected. Decrease of electron-transport activity and loss of herbicide binding were prevented in the presence of various antioxidants and enzymes which protect against free radicals; however, the protection was not total. The strongest effect was observed by addition of dimethylsulfoxide, a potent hydroxyl-radical (OH*) quencher. Furthermore, combinations of various protective substances were even more effective in reducing photoinhibition. Different reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, superoxide radicals and OH* radicals were obviously involved in photoinhibition. These results were confirmed by the addition of potential OH*-radical-generating substances. Simultaneous enhancement of OH*-radical formation and photoinhibitory damage were observed in these cases. The involvement of this highly toxic species could be shown directly by a colorimetric test, thus enabling its light-mediated formation during photoinhibition to be quantified for the first time. In all, the data indicate that a site in PSII is the origin of radical formation involved in photoinhibition and that H2O2 is an important precursor in the formation of hydroxyl-radicals. 3aEuglena gracilis 3athylakoids 3aphotoinhibition 3alight 3afree radicals 3aphotosystem II 3aoxygen 3agas exchange1 aOhmann, E.0 tPlanta.g1993, v. 191, no. 3 p.316-323x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02760naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013200125300001600257520179700273650001802070650001902088650002602107650002402133650002402157653002402181653001102205700001802216700002002234700001602254700001402270773006002284852000902344930003302353945001302386946001102399655001202410IND2038437520221118021521.0940401s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203843752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasuda, K.10aResidual structure and constituent proteins of the peripheral framework of cell nucleus in somatic embryos from Daucus carota L  ap. 532-540.  aNuclei were isolated from somatic embryos of carrot (Daucus carota L.) using a buffer system containing non-ionic detergent. To prepare nuclear matrices, the purified membrane-depleted nuclei were digested with DNase I in combination with RNase A, followed by extraction with 1 M NaCl. The DNA residue in the final insoluble fraction was less than 4% of that in isolated nuclei, and most of the residual nuclei retained their sphericity. Electron microscopy revealed that the nuclear matrix was composed of a distinct peripheral layer, an internal matrix structure and some fibrils; residual nucleoli were observed when exogeneous RNase was not incorporated. The proteins extracted from the nuclei and nuclear subfractions were compared by gel electrophoresis, which showed that the residual fraction contained many minor proteins. To identify proteins showing specific localization at the nuclear periphery, we prepared monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against an ion-exchange chromatography fraction extracted from carrot nuclear matrices. Immunofluorescence microscopy with one of the MAbs, CML-1, showed exclusive staining of the nuclear periphery. The MAb recognized several spots showing microheterogeneity, with a narrow range of pI and molecular mass upon immunoblotting. A complete set of these spots was shown to be conserved in nuclear matrices. On the other hand, MAb CML-13 appeared to react with the nuclear interior as well as the periphery, recognizing a 96-kDa polypeptide of the nuclear matrix. These proteins were thus demonstrated to lie at the nuclear periphery, and to constitute the nuclear matrices in carrot. The 96-kDa polypeptide is suggested to be similar to the 92-kDa nuclear protein reported by Beven et al. in carrot (Beven et al., 1991, J.

Dur. et Schinz (Velloziaceae). During desiccation there was a complete breakdown of chlorophylls whereas the total carotenoid content of air-dried leaves was reduced to about 22% of that of functional leaves. The prerequisites for the resynthesis of photosynthetic pigments and functional thylakoids were the reappearance of turgor and maximum leaf water content at 2 and 10 h after rehydration, respectively. The period of increased initial respiration after rewetting leaves (rehydration respiration) lasted up to 30 h and was thus 6 to 10 times longer than in homoiochlorophyllous desiccation-tolerant plants (HDTs) in which chlorophylls are retained during desiccation. Accumulation of chlorophylls a + b and total carotenoids (xanthophylls and beta-carotene) started 10 h after rehydration. Normal levels of chlorophyll and carotenoids were obtained 72 h after rehydration. Values for the variable-fluorescence decrease ratio (Rfd690 values), an indicator of photochemical activity, showed that photochemical function started 10 h after rehydration, but normal values of 2.7 were reached only 72 h after rehydration. Net CO2 assimilation started 24 h after rewetting and normal rates were reached after 72 h, at the same time as normal values of stomatal conductance were obtained. The increasing rates of net CO2 assimilation were paralleled by decreasing values of the intercellular CO2 concentration. All photosynthetic parameters investigated showed values normal for functional chloroplasts by 72 h after the onset of rehydration. Fully regreened leaves of the presumed C3 plant X. scabrida exhibited a net CO2 assimilation rate which was in the same range as that of other C3 plants and higher than that of recovered HDT plants. The fundamental difference between air-dried PDT plants, such as X. scabrida, which have to resynthesize the photosynthetic pigment apparatus, and air-dried HDT plants, which only undergo a functional recovery, is discussed. 3aVelloziaceae 3axerophytes 3aleaves 3arehydration 3achlorophyll 3aphotosynthesis 3anet assimilation rate 3athylakoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3astress response 0adesiccation1 aLichtenthaler, H.K.1 aCsintalan, Z.1 aNagy, Z.1 aSzente, K.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 192, no. 3 p.414-420x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02610naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014100125300001600266500001500282520161500297650002001912650002401932650002201956650001201978650003601990650001402026650002102040653001402061653001502075700001602090700001602106773006002122852000902182930003302191945001302224946001102237655001202248IND2039882720221118021442.0940527s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203988272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFricke, W.10aConcentrations of inorganic and organic solutes in extracts from individual epidermal, mesophyll and bundle-sheat cells of barley leaves  ap. 310-316.  a2019-12-05  aThe distribution of solutes between epidermal mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv.

Activity of the cytoplasmic marker enzyme, malate dehydrogenase, revealed that epidermal cell extracts were completely vacuolar in origin, but extracts from mesophyll cells also contained cytoplasmic constituents. The extracts were analysed for osmolality and the concentrations of K, Na, Ca, Cl, P, S, NO3-, sugars and total amino acids. Epidermal and mesophyll cell extracts had similar osmolalities but these varied between 420 and 565 mosmol.kg-1 depending on the leaf developmental stage; the osmolality of bundle-sheath extracts was approximately 100 mosmol.kg-1 lower. Under the growth conditions used, K and NO3- were found in all three cell types and their concentrations generally ranged between 180 and 230 mM. In contrast, Ca was almost restricted to epidermal cells, where it increased to 70 mM during leaf ageing. Phosphorus was only detectable greater than or equal to 5 mM) in extracts from mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells, while Cl concentrations were highest in epidermal and lowest in mesophyll cell extracts. The concentrations of sugars and amino acids were close to the detection limit (approx. 2 mM) in epidermal cells but mesophyll cells contained total sugar (glucose, fructose and sucrose) of up to 78 mM and total amino-acid concentrations of up to 13.5 mM. Concentrations in bundle-sheath cells were intermediate between those in the epidermis and mesophyll. 3aHordeum vulgare 3ainorganic compounds 3aorganic compounds 3asolutes 3achemical constituents of plants 3amesophyll 3avascular bundles 0aepidermis 0aparenchyma1 aLeigh, R.A.1 aTomos, A.D.0 tPlanta.g1994, v. 192, no. 3 p.310-316x0032-09357nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03267naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012700174300001600301520167800317650002601995650000902021650002602030650000902056650001002065650001002075650001502085650001402100650001102114650001502125650001802140650002702158650003702185650001702222651001502239651001302254651001402267651001102281651001402292700002302306700001502329700002202344700002002366700002302386700002502409700002202434700001902456700001902475773017102494856005102665852000902716655001202725IND60580654820221118021652.0170925e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058065482DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-11-3092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Benjamin D.10aUse of Traceback Methods To Confirm the Source of a Multistate Escherichia coli O157:H7 Outbreak Due to In-Shell Hazelnuts  ap. 320-327.  aTraceback methods by state regulatory agencies were used to complement traditional epidemiological cluster investigation methods and confirmed hazelnuts (also referred to as filberts) as the vehicle in a multistate outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections. Bulk in-shell hazelnut and mixed-nut purchase locations were identified during the initial epidemiological interviews. Based on purchase dates and case onset dates, regulators in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin traced product back through the supply chain. Six (86%) retail locations received the suspect hazelnut or mixed-nut shipments from a Minnesota distributor, with one retailer (14%) receiving products from a Wisconsin distributor. Both distributors received 100% of their bulk in-shell hazelnuts and mixed nuts from a distributor in California. The California distributor received 99% of their hazelnuts from a packing company in Oregon. The California distributor received the hazelnuts in 50-lb (22.7-kg) bags and either resold them without opening the bags or used the in-shell hazelnuts in the manufacture of their in-shell mixed nuts. Records at the packing company in Oregon were incomplete or lacked sufficient detail needed to identify a suspect farm or group of suspect farms. Laboratory samples collected from human cases and subsequently recalled product matched the outbreak pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtype of E. coli O157:H7. Hazelnut harvesting practices create a plausible route of contamination from fecal matter from domestic ruminants or wild deer. This outbreak investigation demonstrates the use of product traceback data to rapidly test an epidemiological hypothesis. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abags 3acluster investigation 3adeer

a2019-12-05  aExtract: Balanced diets have been suggested by the Indian Council of Medical Research for meeting the nutrient needs of different physiological groups. The cost of a typical diet (for the sedentary worker), with special reference to seasonal changes, was computed on the basis of the prevalent prices of foodstuffs. The yearly increase in the cost of balanced diet ranged from 9-13% from January 1977 to December 1979. Possible alterations in the balanced diet have been suggested for coping with the increasing prices of foodstuffs.

Maternal heart disease and foetal congenital malformations were responsible for IUGR in 8 per cent infants each. In 28 per cent of IUGR infants etiology was multifactorial, and no cause could be identified in 13 per cent infants.

To investigate these questions, Vmax for nitrate uptake (high-affinity range), and nitrate reductase (NR) mRNA and activity, were measured in roots of N-limited barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Golf) grown under conditions of constant relative addition of nitrate, with the seminal roots split between two culture compartments. The total amount of nitrate added per unit time (0.09 d-1) was distributed between the two root parts (subroots) in ratios of 100: 0, 98: 2, 95: 5, 90: 10, 80: 20, and 50:50. These nitrate-addition ratios resulted in nitrate fluxes ranging from 0 to 23 micromoles nitrate get DW root.h-1, while the external nitrate concentrations varied between 0 and 1.2 micromolar. The apparent Vmax for net nitrate uptake showed saturation-type responses to nitrate flux maintained during preceding growth. The flux resulting in half-maximal "induction" of nitrate uptake was approximately 4 micromoles nitrate g-1 DW root h-1, corresponding to an external nitrate concentration of 0.7 micromolar. The activity of NR and levels of NR mRNA did not saturate within the range of nitrate fluxes studied. None of the parameters studied saturated with respect to the steady-state external nitrate concentration. At the zero nitrate addition--the 0%-root--initial uptake activity as determined in short-term 15N-labelling experiments was insignificant, and NR activity and NR mRNA were not detectable. However nitrate uptake was rapidly induced, showing that the 0%-root had retained the capacity to respond to nitrate.

However, the role of acetylation in CIC activity is elusive. We show that CIC is acetylated in activated primary human macrophages and U937 cells and the level of acetylation is higher in glucose-deprived compared to normal glucose medium. Acetylation enhances CIC transport activity, leading to a higher citrate efflux from mitochondria in exchange with malate. Cytosolic citrate levels do not increase upon activation of cells grown in deprived compared to normal glucose media, indicating that citrate, transported from mitochondria at higher rates from acetylated CIC, is consumed at higher rates. Malate levels in the cytosol are lower in activated cells grown in glucose-deprived compared to normal glucose medium, indicating that this TCA intermediate is rapidly recycled back into the cytosol where it is used by the malic enzyme. Additionally, in activated cells CIC inhibition increases the NADP+/NADPH ratio in glucose-deprived cells; this ratio is unchanged in glucose-rich grown cells due to the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway. Consistently, the NADPH-producing isocitrate dehydrogenase level is higher in activated glucose-deprived as compared to glucose rich cells. These results demonstrate that, in the absence of glucose, activated macrophages increase CIC acetylation to enhance citrate efflux from mitochondria not only to produce inflammatory mediators but also to meet the NADPH demand through the actions of isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aacetylation 3acitrates 3acytosol 3aglucose 3ahumans 3aisocitrate dehydrogenase 3amacrophage activation 3amacrophages 3amalates 3amalic enzyme 3amitochondria 3apentose phosphate cycle 0aCIC 0aMCF 0aPPP 0aIDH1 0aCNSB 0aPMS 0aNAM 0aAcCIC 0aCitrate 0aMitochondrial citrate carrier 0aAcetylation 0aPost-translational modification 0aInflammation 0aMacrophage1 aSpera, Iolanda1 aMenga, Alessio1 aInfantino, Vittoria1 aPorcelli, Vito1 aIacobazzi, Vito1 aPierri, Ciro L.1 aHooper, Douglas C.1 aPalmieri, F.q(Ferdinando),1 aCastegna, Alessandra0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Aug., v. 1847, no. 8 p.729-738dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245007500203500002200278520137400300592002801674650003701702650002201739650001401761650001101775650001501786650002101801650002201822650001201844650001501856650001901871650001101890650001201901650001901913653002001932653001901952653002501971653001401996653002302010653002602033700006002059773005902119856008402178852000902262655001202271IND60558401620221120070625.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055840162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2729-974610aSilica scaling in forward osmosis: From solution to membrane interface  aPre-press version  aMembrane silica scaling hinders sustainable water production. Understanding silica scaling mechanisms provides options for better membrane process management. In this study, we elucidated silica scaling mechanisms on an asymmetric cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane and polyamide thin-film composite (TFC) membrane. Scaling filtration showed that TFC membrane was subjected to more severe water flux decline in comparison with the CTA membrane, together with different scaling layer morphology. To elucidate the silica scaling mechanisms, silica species in the aqueous solution were characterised by mass spectrometry as well as light scattering. Key thermodynamic parameters of silica surface nucleation on the CTA and TFC membranes were estimated to compare the surface nucleation energy barrier. In addition, high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy resolved the chemical origin of the silica-membrane interaction via identifying the specific silicon bonds. These results strongly support that silica scaling in the CTA membrane was driven by the aggregation of mono-silicic acid into large silica aggregates, followed by the deposition from bulk solution onto the membrane surface; by contrast, silica polymerised on the TFC membrane surface where mono-silicic acid interacted with TFC membrane surface, which was followed by silica surface polymerisation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3aenergy 3afiltration 3alight scattering 3amass spectrometry 3aosmosis 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3asilica 3asilicon 3athermodynamics 0aForward osmosis 0aSilica scaling 0aCellulose triacetate 0aPolyamide 0aSilica aggregation 0aSilica polymerisation1 aGray, Stephen R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8748-27480 tWater research.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.10.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245008600164300001600250500002000266520158900286592002801875650001801903650001901921650001201940650001601952650001901968650001601987650001002003650002602013650001302039650002002052650001902072650002302091650001002114650003202124650001502156650001702171650002602188650001502214650002102229650001502250650001602265650001402281650001302295650001402308650001202322650001602334700002202350700002002372773012902392856007802521852000902599655001202608IND60595544320221120171317.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059554432DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2017006632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Da‐Cheng14aThe first Taxus rhizosphere microbiome revealed by shotgun metagenomic sequencing  ap. 501-512.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the present study, the shotgun high throughput metagenomic sequencing was implemented to globally capture the features of Taxus rhizosphere microbiome. Total reads could be assigned to 6925 species belonging to 113 bacteria phyla and 301 species of nine fungi phyla. For archaea and virus, 263 and 134 species were for the first time identified, respectively. More than 720,000 Unigenes were identified by clean reads assembly. The top five assigned phyla were Actinobacteria (363,941 Unigenes), Proteobacteria (182,053), Acidobacteria (44,527), Ascomycota (fungi; 18,267), and Chloroflexi (15,539). KEGG analysis predicted numerous functional genes; 7101 Unigenes belong to “Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism.” A total of 12,040 Unigenes involved in defense mechanisms (e.g., xenobiotic metabolism) were annotated by eggNOG. Talaromyces addition could influence not only the diversity and structure of microbial communities of Taxus rhizosphere, but also the relative abundance of functional genes, including metabolic genes, antibiotic resistant genes, and genes involved in pathogen‐host interaction, bacterial virulence, and bacterial secretion system. The structure and function of rhizosphere microbiome could be sensitive to non‐native microbe addition, which could impact on the pollutant degradation. This study, complementary to the amplicon sequencing, more objectively reflects the native microbiome of Taxus rhizosphere and its response to environmental pressure, and lays a foundation for potential combination of phytoremediation and bioaugmentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aArchaea 3aChloroflexi 3aProteobacteria 3aTalaromyces 3aTaxus 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abioaugmentation 3abiodegradation 3adefense mechanisms 3afungi 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3arhizosphere 3asecretion 3aunigenes 3avirulence 3aviruses 3axenobiotics1 aZhang, Cai‐Rong1 aXiao, Pei‐Gen0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2018 June, v. 58, no. 6 p.501-512dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2017006633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245010100170300001300271520230800284592002802592650001202620650002202632650001002654650001302664650001802677653001802695653002002713653002802733653002402761653002602785653002602811773012902837856008402966852000903050655001203059IND60606228320221119175924.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060622832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Charles A.10aTide, time and space: Scales of variation and influences on structuring and sampling beach clams  ap. 1-10.  aScales of spatio-temporal variability in the densities and sizes of organisms need to be quantified so that the relative importance of different ecological processes that structure assemblages can be determined and future sampling strategies optimized. This study examined variability in the densities and size compositions of the beach clam, Donax deltoides, across tide stages and various hierarchical scales of time (day, week, month, season) and space (patch, area, beach). Densities of clams in the swash zone were most often least at high tide, which may be a consequence of their restricted shoreward movements and upper beach distributions. Regardless, the size compositions of sampled clams were the same across all tide stages. Future quantitative population sampling could be done across a six-hour window around low tide, providing ample time to access and sequentially sample many locations along a beach. The components of variation in densities of clams were in all but a couple of cases, greatest at the smallest temporal and spatial scales examined; among days and among replicate samples within a patch. Variation in size compositions was also greatest at the smallest spatial scale examined (among patches), but this was not the case for time. Size compositions were relatively stable across days and the influences of other temporal scales were inconsistent, suggesting that ecological processes influencing size compositions operate at different scales to those influencing densities. Nevertheless, the general predominance of small-scale variation was probably a consequence of fine-tuned, local-scale responses of clams to the variable and dynamic physical and biogenic features of the swash zone habitat. These results concur with studies in other habitats that show small-scale temporal and spatial variability is a dominant feature of aquatic benthic organisms and challenges the paradigm that ocean beach ecology is primarily driven by large-scale hydrodynamic forces. Small-scale patchiness of clams in time and space needs to be taken into consideration in future sampling strategies for population and impact assessments. Moreover, the ecological processes that drive small-scale temporal and spatial structuring of organisms on ocean beaches require greater investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3abenthic organisms 3aclams 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 0aBeach ecology 0aBivalve mollusk 0aComponents of variation 0aDynamic environment 0aExperimental strategy 0aHabitat heterogeneity0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 Jan., v. 474 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01150naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245015900204300001600363500002200379520008600401592002800487650001500515650002500530650001600555700001800571700002300589700001700612773012800629856008200757852000900839655001200848IND60666675620221122052457.0190917e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066667562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-019-09712-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodge, Simon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6933-525310aCorrection to: Aphid-induction of defence-related metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana is dependent upon density, aphid species and duration of infestation  ap. 805-806.  aPublished Erratum  aThe authors would like to include the following changes in the published article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ametabolites1 aBennett, Mark1 aMansfield, John W.1 aPowell, Glen0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2019 Oct., v. 13, no. 5 p.805-806dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4130426x1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-019-09712-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013400164520199300298592002802291650003402319650001702353650002302370650001902393650001602412650001802428650001502446650001802461650001102479650000902490650001102499650002302510650001302533650001702546650002202563700002002585700002102605700002102626700002002647700002202667773012102689856007902810852000902889655001202898IND60787857420221119184605.0220811e20220808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078785742DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111520662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiniso, Tabisa 10aPolyphenolic Contents, Free Radical Scavenging and Cholinesterase Inhibitory Activities of Dalbergiella welwitschii Leaf Extracts  aA decoction of Dalbergiella welwitschii leaves has been used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of mental illness and inflammatory diseases amongst other diseases. In this study, the leaf methanol extract of D. welwitschii and its partition fractions: n-hexane, ethyl acetate and aqueous, were tested and evaluated for their polyphenolic contents, free radical scavenging and cholinesterase inhibitory activities. The total phenolic (TPC), flavonoid (TFC) and proanthocyanidin (TPA) contents were determined using standard colorimetric methods. The anti-radical activity of the extracts against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric ion and nitric oxide (NO) radicals as well as their effects on lipid peroxidation were monitored spectrophotometrically. The cholinesterase enzyme (AChE and BuChE) inhibitions by the extracts were determined by a modified method of Ellman. The result showed a concentration-dependent increase in inhibition of the free radicals and the cholinesterase enzymes, except for that of lipid peroxidation. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction exhibited the highest polyphenolic contents among the fractions, with a TPC of 1.08 mgGAE/g, TFC of 0.38 mgQuE/g and TPA of 0.21 mgGAE/g. It also demonstrated the highest free radical scavenging activities with 72.63% and 65.43% inhibitions of DPPH and NO, respectively. The EtOAc fraction inhibited AChE and BuChE enzymes with IC₅₀ values of 0.94 and 8.49 mg/mL, respectively. Our findings show that the plant may have polyphenol contents, in particular in the methanol extract and EtOAc fraction. These extracts showed considerable free radical scavenging and cholinesterase inhibitory properties. Thus, the observed bioactivities may serve as a justification for its folkloric use as a remedy for mental illness. The study also provides relevant information that could help in the search for lead cholinesterase inhibitors from medicinal plants that can be exploited against neurodegenerative disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aDalbergiella 3abehavior disorders 3acholinesterase 3acolorimetry 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3afree radicals 3ahexane 3alead 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amethanol 3anitric oxide 3aproanthocyanidins1 aAdeyemi, Jerry 1 aOriola, Ayodeji 1 aElufioye, Taiwo 1 aGondwe, Mavuto 1 aOyedeji, Adebola 0 tPlants.g2022 Aug. 08, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111520663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010000168300001600268520152600284592002801810650001401838650001301852650001801865650001101883650001001894650001201904650001701916650002001933653002401953653002001977653001501997653001702012653002102029700005802050773013402108856008602242852000902328655001202337IND60552858420221119201938.0161021e20150305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055285842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoo, Hansol10aExperimental studies on formation, spreading and drying of inkjet drop of colloidal suspensions  ap. 234-245.  aIn this study the dynamic characteristics of inkjet drops from generation to drying are investigated experimentally. The inkjet drops were made from suspensions of 2μm polystyrene spheres dispersed in octanol or heptanol. The particle loading was 5–25vol%. Bare glass surfaces and aldehyde coated surfaces were used as solid substrates. The result shows that the presence of particles in the liquid is insensitive to the drop generation characteristics and the particles are uniformly distributed within the drop. At the impact stage, the spreading characteristics are practically the same regardless of Weber number considered here and presence particles. At the capillary spreading stage, the drop of suspension in octanol shows the same behavior as the drop of pure octanol. The drying characteristics are quite different depending on the presence of particles and/or the wetting characteristics of the solid substrate. Especially, the drying stage is closely related with the spreading stage in the case of suspensions. On the small contact angle surface, particles are arranged parallel to the contact line during the capillary spreading stage. They become fully arranged in the crystalline form over the whole surface at the last stage of drying by the attractive surface tension force between partially immersed particles. On the large contact angle surface, particles move toward the rim by the outward flow. It is demonstrated that a crystalline monolayer of particles can be obtained by the inkjet technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3acolloids 3acontact angle 3adrying 3aglass 3aoctanol 3apolystyrenes 3asurface tension 0aPrinted electronics 0aInkjet printing 0aSuspension 0aContact line 0aDrying mechanism1 aKim, Chongyoup1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8261-08110 tColloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects.g2015 Mar. 05, v. 468 p.234-245dElsevier B.V.x0927-77577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245007500167300001800242520140000260592002801660650002101688650001601709650001101725650001501736650001601751650001001767650000901777650001701786650001801803651001601821651002201837700001801859700002701877773008201904856004801986852000902034655001202043IND4479760620221121154257.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447976062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-012-0729-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantini, Nadia S.10aVariation in wood density and anatomy in a widespread mangrove species  ap. 1555-1563.  aWood density is an important plant trait that influences a range of ecological processes, including resistance to damage and growth rates. Wood density is highly dependent on anatomical characteristics associated with the conductive tissue of trees (xylem and phloem) and the fibre matrix in which they occur. Here, we investigated variation in the wood density of the widespread mangrove species Avicennia marina in the Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia and in the Firth of Thames in New Zealand. We assessed how variation in xylem vessel size, fibre wall thickness and proportion of phloem within the wood contributed to variation in wood density and how these characteristics were linked to growth rates. We found the wood density of A. marina to be higher in Western Australia than in New Zealand and to be higher in taller seaward fringing trees than in scrub trees growing high in the intertidal. At the cellular level, high wood density was associated with large xylem vessels and thick fibre walls. Additionally, wood density increased with decreasing proportions of phloem per growth layer of wood. Tree growth rates were positively correlated with xylem vessel size and wood density. We conclude that A. marina can have large xylem vessel sizes and high growth rates while still maintaining high wood density because of the abundance and thickness of fibres in which vessels are found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia marina 3acorrelation 3aphloem 3ashrublands 3atree growth 3atrees 3awood 3awood density 3axylem vessels 3aNew Zealand 3aWestern Australia1 aSchmitz, Nele1 aLovelock, Catherine E.0 tTrees.g2012 Oct., v. 26, no. 5 p.1555-1563dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-012-0729-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245008400168300001600252520108700268592002801355650001801383650001601401650001401417650001101431650001101442650002001453650002201473650001901495650001101514650001401525650002901539650002001568700002101588700002201609700001501631773009101646856008801737852000901825655001201834IND60085217920221121221821.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008521792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu10aBioreactor technology in marine microbiology: From design to future application  ap. 312-321.  aMarine micro-organisms have been playing highly diverse roles over evolutionary time: they have defined the chemistry of the oceans and atmosphere. During the last decades, the bioreactors with novel designs have become an important tool to study marine microbiology and ecology in terms of: marine microorganism cultivation and deep-sea bioprocess characterization; unique bio-chemical product formation and intensification; marine waste treatment and clean energy generation. In this review we briefly summarize the current status of the bioreactor technology applied in marine microbiology and the critical parameters to take into account during the reactor design. Furthermore, when we look at the growing population, as well as, the pollution in the coastal areas of the world, it is urgent to find sustainable practices that beneficially stimulate both the economy and the natural environment. Here we outlook a few possibilities where innovative bioreactor technology can be applied to enhance energy generation and food production without harming the local marine ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprocessing 3abioreactors 3achemistry 3acoasts 3aenergy 3afood production 3amarine ecosystems 3amicroorganisms 3aoceans 3apollution 3arenewable energy sources 3awaste treatment1 aArends, Jan B.A.1 aVan de Wiele, Tom1 aBoon, Nico0 tBiotechnology Advances.g2011 , v. 29, no. 3 p.312-321dElsevier Inc.x0734-97507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245011800199300001600317500001900333500002000352520226000372592002802632650002202660650001802682650001502700650001002715650001402725650001202739650000902751650001702760650002002777650001002797650001402807650002502821700005702846700002302903773010702926856007303033852000903106655001203115IND60730223120221119202022.0210305e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073022312DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.128782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurmacki, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9875-647910aOccurrence and function of melanin‐based grey coloration in Western Palaearctic songbirds (Aves: Passeriformes)  ap. 390-406.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMelanin is the most common pigment in avian plumage and has various functions, including signalling individual condition, social status, aiding in camouflage and strengthening feathers. To date, most research focusing on melanin‐based colours has focused on eumelanin black and pheomelanin rusty traits. The occurrence and function of grey melanin‐based coloration, however, remains largely unstudied. Using colour plates from a bird identification guide and a comparative phylogenetic approach, we analysed the occurrence and relative patch size of grey plumage regions in 239 passerine species belonging to 36 families occurring in the Western Palaearctic. We proposed four hypotheses to explain the evolution of grey plumage: (1) protection from visually oriented predators, (2) badges of social information, (3) sexually selected ornaments, and (4) visual enhancement of badges and ornamental colour patches via high between‐colour contrast. We tested these hypotheses by analysing the occurrence and relative size of grey patches in relation to ecological and life‐history traits and the occurrence of other colours. Moreover, we surveyed the distribution of grey over avian body regions and its adjacency to other plumage colours. Grey coloration was present in 97 species from 25 families (40.5% of all species and 69.4% of all families sampled, respectively). Our results support the idea that grey plumage evolved to provide cryptic coloration and/or as a sexual signal used in female mate choice. Grey colour occurrence was associated with less concealed nest structure and open habitats, and this effect was especially pronounced in species in which males incubate. In both sexes, grey was more abundant on the head and back regions, which are the most visible body parts during incubation. The occurrence of grey was related to a greater dichromatism and was slightly higher in males than in females, which suggests that it could have evolved in response to female mate choice. No evidence suggests that grey plumage enhances ornamental colours or acts as a competitive signal. The study provides the first insight into potential functions of grey plumage in birds. Further studies at the species level are needed to test our findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPalearctic region 3aPasseriformes 3acamouflage 3acolor 3aeumelanin 3afemales 3ahead 3alife history 3amating behavior 3anests 3aphylogeny 3asocioeconomic status1 aMinias, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7742-67501 aKudelska, Karolina0 tIbis.g2021 Apr., v. 163, no. 2 p.390-406dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.128783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009100169300001400260520100400274592002801278650001401306650002401320650001001344650001101354650001201365650001001377650001101387650000901398650001201407650001601419650001201435653001201447653001001459653002201469653002301491653001701514653000901531653000901540653000901549653000901558653000901567653000901576653000801585653000901593653000701602653001001609700002401619700002301643700002001666700001701686773011101703856008101814852000901895655001201904IND60529794320221123042840.0161020e20160305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052979432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2015.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohlen, Tabata M.10aFatness rather than leptin sensitivity determines the timing of puberty in female mice  ap. 11-21.  aLeptin is a permissive factor for the onset of puberty. However, changes in adiposity frequently influence leptin sensitivity. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate how changes in body weight, fatness, leptin levels and leptin sensitivity interact to control the timing of puberty in female mice. Pre-pubertal obesity, induced by raising C57BL/6 mice in small litters, led to an early puberty onset. Inactivation of Socs3 gene in the brain or exclusively in leptin receptor-expressing cells reduced the body weight and leptin levels at pubertal onset, and increased leptin sensitivity. Notably, these female mice exhibited significant delays in vaginal opening, first estrus and onset of estrus cyclicity. In conclusion, our findings suggest that increased leptin sensitivity did not play an important role in favoring pubertal onset in female mice. Rather, changes in pubertal body weight, fatness and/or leptin levels were more important in influencing the timing of puberty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3abody weight changes 3abrain 3aestrus 3afemales 3agenes 3aleptin 3amice 3aobesity 3aperiodicity 3apuberty 0aObesity 0aSOCS3 0aLeptin resistance 0aPrecocious puberty 0aReproduction 0aAgRP 0aCART 0aERα 0aGnRH 0aLepR 0anNOS 0aNPY 0aPOMC 0aRP 0aSOCS31 aSilveira, Marina A.1 aZampieri, Thais T.1 aFrazão, Renata1 aDonato, Jose0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 Mar. 05, v. 423 p.11-21dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010100168300001600269520175300285592002802038650001402066650002402080650001602104650002002120650002202140650002602162650001502188650001702203650001502220650001402235650001302249650001902262650001302281650002302294650002302317650002102340650001202361650002202373650002002395650001102415650001002426650001602436650000902452651001102461700002402472700001802496700002302514773010802537856008102645852000902726655001202735IND60555476920221119102231.0161028e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055547692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11829-016-9455-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudek, Krzysztof10aInvasive Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.) as a preferred foraging habitat for spiders  ap. 377-381.  aInvasions of alien species are a great threat to biodiversity and native species communities. There are many examples in the literature on how the invasive plants affect the natural environment. Beside reports on negative effects of these invasions, there are also several studies indicating a positive impact of the invaders. Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis) is one of the most invasive plant species all over Europe. Earlier studies showed that the goldenrod affects natural plant communities and has a negative impact on many animals, both vertebrates and arthropods. However, all the studies were conducted during goldenrod flowering. In contrast, this study has tested the novel hypothesis that Canadian goldenrod has a positive effect on native spider hunting success and increases spider abundance in farmland outside the growing season. Observations were made during spring on 13 meadows: 7 invaded and 6 non-invaded by goldenrod. All tall plants from experimental plots (1 m² each) were examined for the presence of spiders, their nets and prey. Prey items were counted only in spider webs. The results support the hypothesis that S. canadensis is a favourable foraging habitat for spiders: 14.6 spiders/m² on invaded plots versus 2.2 on non-invaded ones. Many spiders of the families Theridiidae and Araneidae were found on goldenrod plants, but on native plants only the Araneidae were found. Moreover, on invaded plots, much more prey items/m² were present in spiders webs than on non-invaded plots (155.3 vs. 13.8). The study is a rare example of a positive influence of invasive plants on the native arthropod community. This is also a novel approach that shows the importance of dry goldenrod stems in invaded ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneidae 3aSolidago canadensis 3aTheridiidae 3aadverse effects 3aagricultural land 3aarthropod communities 3aarthropods 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aflowering 3aforaging 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3ameadows 3aplant communities 3aplants (botany) 3aspring 3astems 3avertebrates 3awebs 3aEurope1 aMichlewicz, Michał1 aDudek, Monika1 aTryjanowski, Piotr0 tArthropod-plant interactions.g2016 Oct., v. 10, no. 5 p.377-381dSpringer Netherlandsx1872-88557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11829-016-9455-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009000168300001400258506002800272520077100300592002801071506003701099650001101136650001301147650002001160650001601180650001501196650000901211650001701220650001601237650001701253650002101270650001501291773014601306856008001452852000901532655001201541IND60774380220221207100931.0170417e199412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077438022DNAL7 a10.20543/mkkp.v9i18.4212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukaeni, Irene Sri10aPenelitian korelasi plasticizer dop dan filler serbuk kayu meranti untuk acuan sepatu  ap. 43-51.  aResource is Open Access  aThis research is to find out correlation of using DOP plasticier and Shorea Parvifolis Dyer wood flour filler to physical properties of PVC compound for shoe lasting.

The soils tested were five gravel soils from urban locations, one soil from the embankment of a railway track, and finally an agricultural soil as a control. The mineralization experiments were performed with a concentration of MCPA of 5Â mg/kg and incubated at 10Â Â°C for a period of 60 days. With Kd values ranging from 0.04 to 0.41Â lÂ kgâ»Â¹ the sorption experiments revealed that binding of MCPA to the six gravel soils was lower compared to the control soil which had a Kd value of 0.91Â lÂ kgâ»Â¹. The potential for MCPA mineralization varied from less than 5 to over 55% mineralized in 60 days. The most rapid MCPA mineralization was observed in the soil from the Danish railway tracks with 55% mineralized after only 18 days. The mineralization data was fitted to degradation kinetic models, which indicated that growth occurred as a response to MCPA degradation in most of the soils. Soil DNA was extracted and tfdA genes responsible for the first step in MCPA degradation were quantified by real-time PCR (qPCR) at appropriate time points throughout the mineralization experiments. Indicating growth of specific MCPA degraders, the abundance of class III tfdA genes showed an increase during MCPA mineralization in those soils able to mineralize MCPA. These findings emphasize the importance of the presence of microorganisms that are able to readily degrade MCPA, to avoid groundwater leaching following use on urban gravel areas that possess low binding ability of the compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aMCPA (herbicide) 3aacids 3aagricultural soils 3agenes 3agravel 3agroundwater 3amicroorganisms 3amineralization 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arailroads 3asoil analysis 3asorption 3aurban areas 3aurban soils1 aBÃ¦lum, Jacob1 aJensen, Malene B.1 aJacobsen, Carsten S.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2011 May, v. 43, no. 5 p.984-990dElsevier Ltdx0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245018200179300001600361520131300377592002801690650001301718650001801731650002801749650001801777650001201795650001301807650001201820650001101832650001301843650002401856650002601880650000901906650001101915650001401926650001401940650001101954650001401965650001301979650003301992650001102025650001302036650001502049650001402064650000902078651001102087651000902098651001102107653001202118653002602130653001802156653001402174653001902188653001302207653002202220700002102242700003202263773012102295856008502416852000902501655001202510IND60477625020221118043703.0151231e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047762502DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2015.11088062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahlangeni, Nomfundo T.14aThe distribution of macronutrients, anti-nutrients and essential elements in nettles, Laportea peduncularis susp. peduncularis (River nettle) and Urtica dioica (Stinging nettle)  ap. 160-169.  aLaportea peduncularis and Urtica dioica , which are popularly known as “Nettles” belong to the plant family Urticaceae and are consumed as green vegetables or used for their medicinal benefit in many countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and America.

The results showed a decrease in the crude fat, ash, carbohydrate and vitamin C content with cooking, but an increase in the vitamin E content. The anti-nutrient content (cyanides, phytates and saponins) increased slightly with cooking, while the oxalate content has decreased. The concentration of essential elements in cooked L. peduncularis leaves were found to be in decreasing order of Ca > Mg > Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Co. Both raw and cooked leaves of nettles were found to be rich sources of macronutrients and essential elements and may be used as alternatives to commercially available nutrient supplements. Statistical analyses (principal component analysis and correlations) indicated that certain elements taken up by these plants were from common sources.

Intense agriculture and ever-increasing population growth have created stress on the limited water resources of the country. Therefore, use of industrial discharge effluent and sewage water for irrigation is a common practice. Realizing the situation of safe disposal of wastewater in Pattoki to minimize the public risks of indiscriminate disposal of wastewater, Punjab government and Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) constructed a wastewater treatment plant at Pattoki district Kasur. The purpose of this study is to check the efficiency of wastewater being treated by the treatment plant in compliance with the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) and to check the efficiency of functional components of treatment plant. Water samples were collected from various points of the treatment plant in order to perform various onsite and laboratory test (DO, BOD5, COD, Chloride, TSS, and PH) to check the efficiency of the wastewater treatment plant. The results obtained for each water quality parameters (physical, chemical, and biological) were compared with National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS). The recommended value of DO was greater than 2 mg/liter, BOD5, COD, Chlorides, TSS and PH by PEQS were less than 80 mg/liter, 150 mg/liter, 1000 mg/liter, 150 mg/liter and 6.5-9 respectively. The measured values of DO, BOD5, COD, Chlorides, TSS and PH were 0.3 mg/liter, 310 mg/liter, 48 mg/liter, 1760 mg/liter, 204 mg/liter and 8.3 respectively. The values of DO, BOD5 and TSS are not within PEQS recommended range. More facultative and anaerobic ponds should be constructed in order to treat total wastewater generated in Pattoki, as present plant is treating almost one fourth of total wastewater generated in Pattoki. Aerators should be provided at the aerobic ponds for improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment plant. Effluent from the treatment plant can be used for floriculture conjunctively with fresh water. Moreover, the concentration of physio-chemical parameters in the effluent also decreases after mixing the water available in drain. To some extent it also reduces the infiltration of dangerous components (as drain is not lined with concrete) present in wastewater that may contaminate the ground water or may have hazardous effects on quality of soil present in field. However, further studies are required to evaluate chemical parameters or heavy metals like arsenic, fluorides, chromium, zinc etc.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarsenic 3acase studies 3achlorides 3achromium 3acompliance 3aconcrete 3afloriculture 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ainternational cooperation 3airrigation water 3alaboratory experimentation 3amunicipal wastewater 3apopulation growth 3asoil 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3azinc 3aKorean Peninsula 3aPakistan 0aBiological Wastewater treatment 0aIndustrial Effluent 0aKOICA 0aWastewater1 aHamid, Shanawar1 aNiaz, Yasir1 aAshraf, Muhammad1 aYasir, Umair1 aChaudhary, Amna1 aArsalan, Ali1 aDaud, Mian Waqar0 tEarth sciences Pakistan.g2019 Oct., v. 3, no. 2 p.01-04dZibeline InternationalwJournal:27885x2521-29077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.26480/esp.02.2019.01.043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015500172300001600327500001500343520125600358592002801614650001401642650001901656650001601675650001101691650001101702650002001713650002201733650002401755650002501779650005201804650003401856650001201890650001301902650000801915650001001923653001501933653002801948700002201976700001801998700001802016700002002034700001502054773010602069856008602175852000902261655001202270IND60087726220221120191639.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008772622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNäslund, Jonas10aDetection of Puumala and Rift Valley Fever virus by quantitative RT-PCR and virus viability tests in samples of blood dried and stored on filter paper  ap. 186-190.  a2019-12-06  aHaemorrhagic fever viruses cause emerging infections worldwide, and blood or serum is the main sample used for diagnosis. However, storage and transportation of such samples from remote areas to regional laboratories may be complicated and expensive. In this study, a novel approach was evaluated for the detection of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) RNA and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) RNA. Whole-blood samples spiked with viable virus particles were tested in parallel with clinical samples from patients with acute haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (nephropathia epidemica). Individual blood samples were spotted on filter paper, dried, and used for RNA extraction at later time points. PUUV RNA was detected by RT-PCR after storage at room temperature for up to six weeks. In contrast, only low copy numbers of RVFV RNA were detected after 1–2 days even though viable RVFV was eluted from the dried filter papers after the same time. The use of filter paper to collect and store blood samples for PUUV RNA detection is therefore a simple and reliable procedure. This approach might facilitate sampling and analysis of other RNA viruses from human or animal sources and could be used for field studies in remote areas or in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aviability 3atransportation 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3avirion 3aOrthohantavirus 3aemerging diseases 3aambient temperature 3adeveloping countries 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aRift Valley fever phlebovirus 3aviruses 3apatients 3aRNA 3afever 0aHantavirus 0aRift Valley fever virus1 aKerner, Alexander1 aDrobni, Peter1 aBucht, Göran1 aEvander, Magnus1 aAhlm, Clas0 tJournal of virological methods.g2011 Dec., v. 178, no. 1-2 p.186-190dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245007700172300001600249520063900265592002800904650002800932650001100960650001300971650001800984650001101002650001701013700001901030700002501049700001501074700001501089773009101104856008801195852000901283655001201292IND60085218020221121221946.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008521802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayakumar, R.10aBiomaterials based on chitin and chitosan in wound dressing applications  ap. 322-337.  aWound dressing is one of the most promising medical applications for chitin and chitosan.

The alfalfa symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti utilizes eight chemoreceptors (McpT to McpZ and IcpA) to mediate chemotaxis. Using a modified hydrogel capillary chemotaxis assay that allows data quantification and larger throughput screening, we defined the role of S. meliloti chemoreceptors in sensing its host, Medicago sativa, and a closely related nonhost, Medicago arabica. S. meliloti wild type and most single-deletion strains displayed comparable chemotaxis responses to host or nonhost seed exudate. However, while the mcpZ mutant responded like wild type to M. sativa exudate, its reaction to M. arabica exudate was reduced by 80%. Even though the amino acid (AA) amounts released by both plant species were similar, synthetic AA mixtures that matched exudate profiles contributed differentially to the S. meliloti wild-type response to M. sativa (23%) and M. arabica (37%) exudates, with McpU identified as the most important chemoreceptor for AA. Our results show that S. meliloti is equally attracted to host and nonhost legumes; however, AA play a greater role in attraction to M. arabica than to M. sativa, with McpZ being specifically important in sensing M. arabica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3achemoreceptors 3achemotaxis 3ahydrocolloids 3amutants 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3ascreening 3aseeds 3asoil 3asymbionts1 aHelm, Richard F.1 aScharf, Birgit E.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2016 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.231-239dMolecular Plant-Microbe InteractionswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-12-15-0264-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245008500181520216200266592002802428650001202456650001802468650002302486650002902509650002202538650001702560650001102577650001802588650002202606650002202628650003302650650001502683650002302698650001702721651001402738653002802752653001702780653002702797653002502824700002302849700002902872700002202901773011802923856008603041852000903127655001203136IND60720003320221121003728.0210506e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072000332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinelli, Maria Victoria10aLandscape service flow dynamics in the metropolitan area of Córdoba (Argentina)  aHuman decisions, policies, and management strategies play an important role in structuring landscape patterns in a metropolitan area. Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes can be considered probably the most important factor affecting the environment and the maintenance of landscape service flow. In particular, processes such as agricultural intensification, deforestation, urbanization and industrialization affect landscape heterogeneity in terms of composition and configuration. However, the multifunctional aspect of LULC as well as traditional agricultural practices can contribute to the maintenance of landscape service flow. This research aims to analyze and assess: (1) LULC dynamics and change from 1988 to 2019 within the metropolitan area of Córdoba (Argentina); (2) the effect of this change on landscape composition and configuration; (3) the flow of landscape services from 1988 to 2019, with the identification of hot-spots of landscape service provision. To analyze LULC dynamics and change within the study area, three Landsat images were utilized, while change detection analysis has been performed to identify the areas most affected by changes, the spatial distribution of change and the change trajectories of LULC classes in terms of landscape composition and configuration. Finally, the valuation of landscape service flow has been carried out by placing an economic value on the LULC classes, through the use of proxies. LULC pattern change has resulted in the expansion of extensive agriculture. The total variation from 1988 to 2019 has highlighted a significant reduction of Horticulture, Forests, and Grasslands, which have been converted into other classes (Urban and Extensive Agriculture). This conversion of LULC classes has had profound effects on landscape service flow, which guarantees the well-being of local communities. This research has contributed to the knowledge of where the hot-spots of landscape service’ provision are located by helping landscape managers to identify suitable local policies able to preserve them, thus avoiding their loss, and enhancing landscape integrity, functionality, and resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3adeforestation 3aeconomic valuation 3aenvironmental management 3aextensive farming 3ahorticulture 3ahumans 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustrialization 3aintensive farming 3aland use and land cover maps 3alandscapes 3ametropolitan areas 3aurbanization 3aArgentina 0aTraditional agriculture 0aHorticulture 0aLandscape service flow 0aLandscape resilience1 aValente, Donatella1 aScavuzzo, Carlos Marcelo1 aPetrosillo, Irene0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 280 p.111714-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001500167245013300182300001600315520165600331592002801987650002802015650002402043650004302067650001302110650001902123650002402142650000902166650001402175650002202189650001102211650005202222650001202274650003202286650006702318650007702385650001802462650000902480650002902489650003802518650002202556650001402578650003102592650001402623650004202637650002402679651002702703700001502730700001702745700001502762700001402777700001402791700001502805773010202820856008402922852000903006655001203015IND4449753820221122145543.0141111e20110324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444975382DNAL7 a208636312pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMietze, A.10aCombined MLST and AFLP typing of Bartonella henselae isolated from cats reveals new sequence types and suggests clonal evolution  ap. 238-245.  aBartonella species are Gram-negative, fastidious bacteria. Bartonella henselae is found in cats and transmitted to humans via cat scratches or bites causing cat-scratch disease, characterized by clinical symptoms with varying severity. The prevalence of bartonellosis among humans in Germany appears to be high, and severe clinical cases have been described. However, epidemiological data of B. henselae in cats are rare. In this study we determined the detection rates of Bartonella ssp. in cats by culture and real-time PCR. Furthermore, B. henselae isolates were genetically characterized by highly discriminatory amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Bartonella spp. were isolated by culture from 11 (2.2%) of 507 blood samples. Out of 169 blood samples additionally analyzed by PCR, 28 (16.6%) were found positive for Bartonella spp., illustrating the advantage of PCR in Bartonella spp. detection. PCR-REA identified B. henselae in 27 cats and Bartonella clarridgeiae in one cat. B. henselae isolates from different geographical regions in Germany were genetically characterized by AFLP and MLST. Both methods confirmed genetic diversity of B. henselae on the strain level. MLST identified 11 new sequence types, all of them assigned to three clonal complexes as determined by eBURST. AFLP typing revealed genetic relation among the B. henselae isolates from the same geographical region. Combining AFLP typing and MLST/eBURST analyses revealed that B. henselae of the same AFLP subcluster belonged to the same clonal complex. Altogether these results indicate that B. henselae may evolve clonally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBartonella clarridgeiae 3aBartonella henselae 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abacteria 3ablood sampling 3acat scratch disease 3acats 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 2aAmplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBartonella Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aBartonella henselaexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBase Sequence 2aCats 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aMultilocus Sequence Typing 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSpecies Specificity 0aGermanyxepidemiology.1 aMorick, D.1 aKöhler, H.,1 aHarrus, S.1 aDehio, C.1 aNolte, I.1 aGoethe, R.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2011 Mar. 24, v. 148, no. 2-4 p.238-245dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011900173300001600292520142600308592002801734650001301762650001901775650001201794650001201806650002201818650001101840650001401851650000701865650001101872650001201883650001301895653000701908653000901915653000801924653000801932653000901940653000801949653000801957653000901965653001001974653003301984653002102017653002002038653002002058653002202078653002002100700006002120700003902180773013402219856008602353852000902439655001202448IND60552857020221119201801.0161021e20150305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055285702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvadiar, Lavanya10aPhysicochemical behaviors of kaolin slurries with and without cations—Contributions of alumina and silica sheets  ap. 103-113.  aNumerous studies on the surface charge-pH and yield stress-pH behaviors of kaolin slurries with respect to the pH-dependency of alumina (Al) sheets, silica (Si) sheets and edges in kaolin particles have been carried out. There is, however, still a paucity of studies that explain if the alumina sheets or the silica sheets in kaolin particles contribute in greater extents to the surface charges of kaolin particles that will consequently affect the kaolin particle interactions and yield stresses. In this study, the contributions of the alumina and the silica sheets to the zeta potential-pH and yield stress-pH behaviors of Riedel kaolin particles, which display no isoelectric points (IEPs), are analyzed by comparing these behaviors of Riedel kaolin slurries to that of alumina and silica slurries with and without Mg2+ and Ca2+ cations. With and without cations, the behaviors of Riedel kaolin slurries were more similar to the behaviors of silica compared to alumina slurries. The principal reason for this similarity is due to the high concentrations of negative charges on both silica and Riedel kaolin particles at all pH compared to the lower concentrations of negative charges on alumina particles. This explains that the permanently negatively charged silica sheets contribute in greater extents to the surface charge-pH and yield stress-pH behaviors of Riedel kaolin slurries compared to the alumina sheets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcium 3acations 3aisoelectric point 3akaolin 3amagnesium 3apH 3asilica 3asilicon 3aslurries 0aCR 0aIEPs 0aBET 0aSEM 0aPSDs 0awt% 0aESA 0adwb% 0aHRTEM 0aCationic hydrolysed products 0aAlumina slurries 0aSilica slurries 0aKaolin slurries 0aZeta potential-pH 0aYield stress-pH1 aLeong, Yee-Kwong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5616-16181 aFourie, A.

Objetivou-se pelo presente estudo avaliar as características morfológicas e produtivas da Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu em função de doses de fósforo empregando o fosfato natural reativo Bayóvar (29% de P2O5). O experimento foi realizado em casa de vegetação na Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso - Campus Universitário de Rondonópolis. O solo utilizado foi o Latossolo Vermelho, coletado na camada de 0-20 cm. Os tratamentos consistiram de seis doses de fósforo (0;50; 100; 150; 200 e 250 mg dm-3) e cinco repetições utilizando o delineamento experimental inteiramente casualizado. Foram realizados dois cortes (aos 48 dias após a semeadura e 28 dias após o primeiro corte) e as variáveis analisadas foram: altura de planta, número de folhas, número de perfilhos, produção de massa seca da parte aérea e raiz. Todos os resultados foram submetidos à análise de variância e de regressão a 5% de probabilidade por meio do programa estatístico Sisvar. As doses de fósforo, adicionadas por meio do fosfato natural reativo, promoveram alterações significativas nas características morfológicas e produtivas do capim-marandu no primeiro corte proporcionando maiores produções no segundo corte. Para o capim-marandu as doses de fósforo que proporcionaram as maiores alturas correspondem ao intervalo de 162,9 e 203,4 mg dm-3 , sendo as demais variáveis ajustadas ao modelo de regressão linear.Phosphorus is important for plant development, and is indispensable for metabolic processes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphological and productive characteristics of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu depending on the doses of P in natural reactive phosphate Bayóvar. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse at Federal University of Mato Grosso - Campus Rondonópolis. The soil used was a Oxisol which was collected from the layers 0,00-0,20 m. The treatments used were six doses of phosphorus (0; 50; 100; 150; 200 and 250 mg dm-3) and five replications using a randomized experimental design. Two cuts (at 48 days after the sowing and 28 days thereafter) were made and the evaluated variables were: plant height, number of leafs, number of tillers, dry mass of shoot and root. All results were subjected to variance analysis and regression at 5% probability using the statistical program Sisvar. The active phosphate fertilization promoted significant changes in the morphological and productive characteristics of marandu grass at the first cut providing highest yields in the second cut. For marandu grass the doses of phosphorus that provided the greatest heights correspond to the range of 162.9 and 203.4 mg dm-3, and the other variables were adjusted by linear regression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOxisols 3aUrochloa brizantha 3acerrado 3acerrado soils 3aexperimental design 3agrasses 3agreenhouses 3aorthophosphates 3aphosphorus 3aplant development 3aplant height 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3avariance 3aBrazil 0aBrachiaria brizantha 0aFolhas 0aLatossolo.

At least two types of quinone cofactors in PSII are redox-linked: QA, and QB. Here, we for the first time apply 257-nm ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy to acquire the molecular vibrations of plastoquinone (PQ) in PSII membranes. Owing to the resonance enhancement effect, the vibrational signal of PQ in PSII membranes is prominent. A strong band at 1661cm−1 is assigned to ring CC/CO symmetric stretch mode (ν8a mode) of PQ, and a weak band at 469cm−1 to ring stretch mode. By using a pump-probe difference UVRR method and a sample jet technique, the signals of QA and QB can be distinguished. A frequency difference of 1.4cm−1 in ν8a vibrational mode between QA and QB is observed, corresponding to ~86mV redox potential difference imposed by their protein environment. In addition, there are other PQs in the PSII membranes. A negligible anharmonicity effect on their combination band at 2130cm−1 suggests that the ‘other PQs’ are situated in a hydrophobic environment. The detection of the ‘other PQs’ might be consistent with the view that another functional PQ cofactor (not QA or QB) exists in PSII. This UVRR approach will be useful to the study of quinone molecules in photosynthesis or other biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrophobicity 3aphotosystem II 3aquinones 3aredox potential 3asolar radiation 0aUVRR 0aPSII 0aSDS-PAGE 0aTris–HCl 0aEDTA 0aMES 0aDCMU 0aPQ 0adecyl-PQ 0aOTG 0aLHC 0aFTIR 0aHPLC 0aCarbonyl bond 0aPhotosynthesis 0aProton transfer 0aElectron transfer 0aLipid membrane 0aProtein dynamics1 aYao, Mingdong1 aPagba, Cynthia V.1 aZheng, Yang1 aFei, Liping1 aFeng, Zhaochi1 aBarry, Bridgette A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 June,  July, v. 1847, no. 6-7 p.558-564dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010200157300001600259500002000275520097400295592002801269650001801297650001201315650001001327650001201337650002001349650001401369650001501383650002101398650001301419650002301432650003501455650001501490650001101505700001801516700002001534773011501554856007301669852000901742655001201751IND60595543320221121102408.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059554332DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.125792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHöft, Nadine10aSequence variation in the bolting time regulator BTC1 changes the life cycle regime in sugar beet  ap. 412-422.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn beet production, flowering is an undesirable trait which drastically reduces yield. BOLTING TIME CONTROL 1 (BTC1) and BvBBX19 are major floral regulators in beet. Their proteins have been suggested to interact to jointly regulate their downstream targets BvFT1 and BvFT2. Annual and biennial BTC1 haplotypes differ by six non‐synonymous SNPs and a large insertion in the promoter of the biennial btc1 allele. We describe a new BTC1 allele which displays three nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding sequence and an 8‐bp insertion in the promoter region compared to the annual BTC1d allele. The protein lacks a low‐complexity region, which likely alters its suggested ability to bind BvBBX19. Our findings demonstrate that little sequence variation in BTC1 is sufficient to turn an annual into a biennial genotype. Our results shed new light on the evolution of cultivated beets, and the identified btc1ₗ allele offers new possibilities to breed winter beets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aalleles 3abeets 3abolting 3acrop production 3aevolution 3ahaplotypes 3apromoter regions 3aproteins 3asequence diversity 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asugar beet 3awinter1 aDally, Nadine1 aJung, Christian0 tPlant breeding.g2018 June, v. 137, no. 3 p.412-422dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl40712x0179-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.125793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04099naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245007800160506002800238520271300266592002802979506003703007650001103044650001703055650001003072650001003082650001503092650000903107650001303116650000903129650001903138650000903157650001803166650001403184650001803198650001303216650001003229653000903239653001603248653000903264653002003273653002303293700001403316700002303330700001803353773013403371856007903505852000903584655001203593IND60774898620221207093105.0180420e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077489862DNAL7 a10.15673/fst.v12i1.8442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenkina, N.10aBasic ingredients and their analysis during the formation of beer quality  aResource is Open Access  a<p>The analysis and comparative description are carried out of varieties of brewing barley light malt and type 90 hops from domestic and foreign producers, as the main plant raw material that forms the quality of beer. The quality indexes of malt samples and hop pellets have been tested for compliance with applicable standards.</p><p>The obtained results indicate that the varieties of barley malt are homogeneous grain mass, do not contain moldy and damaged grains, weed impurities, have a color from light yellow to gray to yellow. Ten samples of malt of various grades for beer production have been studied in terms of mass fraction of moisture (3.2–3.7%), mass fraction of extract in dry matter of fine malt (82.4–87.5%), degree (0 9–1.2%), the mass fraction of protein substances in dry matter of malt (9.1–10.1%), the Kolbach index (39.1–40.2%), the amount of nitrogenous substances (0.70–0, 74%). It has been established that the quantitative content of β-glucans significantly differs in different varieties: the minimum amount is contained in the malt Château Wien, the maximum is Pilsner Weyermann and Munich.</p><p>According to the research results, it has been established that barley malt varieties have a pronounced malt aroma and sufficient fermentative activity and can serve as the base in the mash in the production of beer. It is proved that malt samples have an acceptable amount of toxic substances and radionuclides that will not affect the quality of the finished product. In assessing the quality of varieties of hop pellets by organoleptic indicators, the mass fraction of moisture and α-acids, it is established that the samples have the values of the indicators within the permissible limits. The samples have a cylindrical shape of different hues and approximately the same size; pure hop aroma, without an off-aroma; the color on the surface and at the boundary of the pellets meets the requirements of the standard. The mass fraction of α-acids is in the range from 3.0 to 12.7 %. It is revealed that bitter and aromatic hops are used for pellet production. The samples Magnym and Hallertau Perle are classified as bitter varieties. Hop pellets of the varieties Premiant and Sladek are bitter and aromatic.</p><p>According to the results of the determination of quality indicators, the following ones have been identified as the best: malt – Munich, Pilsner, Carabohemian, hop pellets – Bramling Cross, Mandarina Bavaria and Magnym. The proposed varieties of malt and hops allow obtaining beer with high organoleptic characteristics, colloidal stability and expand the range of the industry by creating new varieties to meet the needs of the consumer.</p>  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abarley 3abeer quality 3abeers 3acolor 3acompliance 3ahops 3aindustry 3amalt 3amalting barley 3amash 3amolds (fungi) 3aoff odors 3araw materials 3atoxicity 3aweeds 0abeer 0amalt barley 0ahops 0abrewer’s yeas 0aquality indicators1 aTatar, L.1 aОdаrchеnco, А.1 aDemchenko, V.0 tHarčova nauka ì tehnologìâ.g2018 Apr., v. 12, no. 1dOdesa National University of TechnologywJournal:27799x2409-70047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15673/fst.v12i1.8443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011400159300001600273520207100289592002802360650001202388650002002400650001202420650002202432650001902454650002202473651001702495651001702512700002702529700002102556700002802577700002802605700003302633773011602666856004002782852000902822655001202831IND50072040720221117103457.0140118e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007204072DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.122012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeske, Peter R.10aMitonuclear discordance in genetic structure across the Atlantic/Indian Ocean biogeographical transition zone  ap. 392-401.  aAim: Based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data, many organisms with ranges spanning multiple biogeographical regions exhibit genetic structure across the transition zones between these regions, while others appear to be genetically homogenous. No clear link has been found between the presence or absence of such spatial genetic discontinuities and species' dispersal potential, confounding the formulation of general predictions concerning genetic structure. The fact that discrepancies between mtDNA and nuclear markers are common across semi-permeable barriers suggests that a lack of structure could be attributable to mtDNA-specific properties of inheritance. We re-examined genetic structure in the coastal crab Hymenosoma orbiculare, a species that is represented by a single mtDNA lineage across the Atlantic/Indian Ocean biogeographical transition zone, by comparing mtDNA data with nuclear DNA data. Location: South Africa's cool-temperate and warm-temperate marine biogeographical provinces. Methods: DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene and the intron of the nuclear ANT gene were generated for 150 individuals of H. orbiculare. For each locus, we determined whether the sharing of alleles between provinces was the result of either the retention of ancestral polymorphism or of secondary contact. Results: We recovered two nuclear intron lineages whose spatial genetic structure reflects contemporary biogeographical and oceanographical conditions, indicating that the existence of a single mtDNA lineage is not a function of unexpectedly high levels of dispersal. Main conclusions: MtDNA-based genetic homogeneity is increasingly being reported in coastal organisms with ranges spanning biogeographical transition zones that define distinct evolutionary lineages in other species. Our results stress the importance of revisiting single-locus data sets by means of multilocus genetic approaches before any conclusions can be drawn about the role of biogeographical transition zones in driving genetic structure. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3adata collection 3aintrons 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3asecondary contact 3aIndian Ocean 3aSouth Africa1 aPapadopoulos, Isabelle1 aBarker, Nigel P.1 aMcQuaid, Christopher D.1 aBeheregaray, Luciano B.1 aCrame, J.

However, potato production is highly constrained by biotic stress interference, such as Myzus persicae Sulzer, which causes serious yield losses and thus minimizing production income. The current study aims to investigate the effect of different formulations prepared as an invert emulsion with different concentrations of fungal culture filtrates derived from three endophytic fungi (genus Cladosporium) against Myzus persicae. All formulations have demonstrated an aphicidal activity, which increases with the increasing concentration of fungal filtrates. Furthermore, it has been noted that chitinolytic activity recorded for 12 days is important in Cladosporium sp. BEL21 isolated from dwarf mistletoe Arceuthobium oxycedri. The study of demographic and embryonic parameters of aphids settled on potato plants previously treated with formulations revealed a significant reduction in the numbers of colonizing aphids and a relative increase in the numbers of winged adults, especially in plants treated with BEL21-derived emulsion. The pre-treatment of plants may interfere with and negatively influence embryonic development and early maturity of the embryo and thus affect the fertility of parthenogenetic aphids. BEL21-derived emulsion can ensure effective and an inexpensive control of M. persicae for potato spring cropping systems.

In the evaluated groups, minor but statistically significant changes were noted in selected serum biochemical parameters, including glucose, total cholesterol, ALT, AST, AP, total bilirubin, Pin, Fe, K and Cl, and in hematological parameters, including WBC, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, Ht, Hb, MCHC, HDW and PLT. A statistical analysis of the results revealed significant differences between groups in the values of WBC, eosinophils, basophils, Hb, Ht, PLT, glucose, ALT, AP, total bilirubin, Fe and K. Change trends were noted mainly in weeks II and V-VI. An analysis of the metabolic profile of pre-pubertal gilts exposed to ZEN + DON indicates that homeostasis and biotransformation of ZEN + DON can be toned down at the expense of the animals' energy reserves. Body weight gains were lower in group E, and BW gains were not observed in weeks II and VI. The activity levels of gilts decreased in the first weeks of exposure (I and II), but the drop was minimized by a compensatory effect, or in the last two weeks of exposure due to nutrient deficiency or insufficient supply of protein and energy with feed and feed additives, which decreased BW gains. Low doses of mycotoxins induce completely different changes in the metabolic test than higher doses. The above can probably be attributed to: (i) a negative compensatory effect, (ii) initiation of adaptive mechanisms and stimulation of the immune system, probably due to the allergizing properties of mycotoxins, (iii) excessive loss of energy and protein due to more effective feed utilization, or (iv) involvement in detoxification processes which leads to fatigue. Depending on the body's energy stores, the above processes tend to tone down the biotransformation of low doses of the examined mycotoxins but in the present study, the BW of gilts did not increase under exposure to a combination of ZEN + DON.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abasophils 3abilirubin 3abiotransformation 3ablood chemistry 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3adeoxynivalenol 3aenergy 3aeosinophils 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3agilts 3aglucose 3ahematologic tests 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3amonocytes 3anutrient deficiencies 3astatistical analysis 3aweight gain 3azearalenone 0aZEN 0aDON 0aLow doses 0aBlood biochemistry 0aHematology 0aBW 0aPre-pubertal gilts 0aALT 0aAP 0aAST 0aBUN 0aBW 0aCl 0aDON 0aFe 0aHb 0aHDW 0aHPLC 0aHt 0aIUPAC 0aK 0aK2-EDTA 0aMCH 0aMCHC 0aMCV 0aMPV 0aNa 0aNO 0aNOS 0aNOAEL 0aPin 0aPLT 0aRBC 0aRDW 0aSD 0aTregs 0aUV 0aWBC 0aZEN1 aTarasiuk, Michał1 aZielonka, Łukasz1 aDąbrowski, Michał1 aNicpoń, Jakub1 aBaranowski, Mirosław1 aGajęcki, Maciej Tadeusz0 tToxicon.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008200169300001600251520111800267592002801385650002701413650002601440650001001466650002701476650002001503650001801523650001601541650001301557650001901570650002101589650001301610650001801623653002301641653001401664653003401678653001801712700002301730773010801753856008601861852000901947655001201956IND60540813020221120182034.0190318e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054081302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Tin Wui10aCarboxymethylcellulose film for bacterial wound infection control and healing  ap. 367-375.  aInfection control and wound healing profiles of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (SCMC) films were investigated as a function of their anti-bacterial action, physical structures, polymer molecular weights and carboxymethyl substitution degrees. The films were prepared with in vitro polymer/film and in vivo microbe-colonized wound healing/systemic infection profiles examined. Adhesive high carboxymethyl substituted SCMC films aided healing via attaching to microbes and removing them from wound. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was removed via encapsulating in gelling low molecular weight SCMC film, whereas Staphylococcus aureus was trapped in tight folds of high molecular weight SCMC film. Incomplete microbe removal from wound did not necessary translate to inability to heal as microbe remnant at wound induced fibroblast migration and aided tissue reconstruction. Using no film nonetheless will cause systemic blood infection. SCMC films negate infection and promote wound healing via specific polymer-microbe adhesion, and removal of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa requires films of different polymer characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3ablood 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3adisease control 3aencapsulation 3afibroblasts 3agelation 3amicroorganisms 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3atissue repair 0aBacterial adhesion 0aInfection 0aSodium carboxymethylcellulose 0aWound healing1 aRamli, Nor Amlizan0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 112 p.367-375dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010100171300001600272520154600288592002801834650001901862650001301881650001201894650002501906650003001931650001601961650001101977650001201988650002202000650002302022650002302045650001502068650000902083650001302092650001202105650003002117650002802147650004002175650002402215650002002239650001302259653000902272653002002281653002302301653001202324653000802336653001102344653000802355653000802363653000702371653000802378653000902386653000802395700002502403700002102428773011302449856008102562852000902643655001202652IND60529793220221123032551.0161020e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052979322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2015.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarnagarin, Revathy10aPEDF attenuates insulin-dependent molecular pathways of glucose homeostasis in skeletal myocytes  ap. 115-124.  aPigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an anti-angiogenic serpin associated with insulin resistance in metabolic disorders such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome. While the mechanism of PEDF induced-insulin resistance of metabolic disorders has been attributed to its inflammatory and lipolytic effects, little evidence exists to support a direct role of PEDF in mediating insulin resistance. Here, we seminally provide evidence that PEDF can inhibit insulin signal transduction governing glucose homeostasis from the receptor to the effector phosphorylation through Akt/PKB-dependent and -independent pathways in mouse and human skeletal muscle cell lines. PEDF attenuates the insulin-dependent molecular axes of glucose metabolism. Exposure of skeletal myocytes to PEDF attenuates insulin-dependent insulin receptor autophosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1, and dual loop phosphorylation-activation of Akt. PEDF significantly inhibits the downstream effector - glycogen synthase kinase (and thereby the glycogenic axis of insulin signalling). PEDF turned off both the molecular switches of GLUT4 translocation: IRS-Akt/PKB-AS160 mediated and IR-pCbl-dependent GLUT4 translocation (the molecular axis of glucose uptake). These findings implicate a direct effect of PEDF on multiple insulin-dependent molecular mechanisms of glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells, thereby enabling it to contribute to peripheral insulin resistance at the cellular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3aglycogen synthase kinases 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3amice 3amyotubes 3aobesity 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3aprotein phosphorylation 3asignal transducing adaptor proteins 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle 3atyrosine 0aPEDF 0aSkeletal muscle 0aInsulin resistance 0aGlucose 0aAkt 0aAS-160 0aCbl 0aGSK 0aIR 0aIRS 0aPEDF 0aPKB1 aDharmarajan, Arun M.1 aDass, Crispin R.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 422 p.115-124dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008300166300001600249520095900265592002801224650002601252650002501278650001201303650002101315650002301336650002201359650000901381650001801390650001901408650001301427700001801440773010001458856008101558852000901639655001201648IND4473273220221121192229.0141110e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447327322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2012.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarati, Mohammad10aGenetic diversity revealed by EST-SSR markers in cultivated and wild safflower  ap. 117-123.  aSafflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is mainly grown as oilseed crop in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world.

MARS encodes cytosolic methionyl‐tRNA synthetase (MetRS), an essential translation factor. The multisystemic effects observed in patients with this form of PAP are consistent with a loss‐of‐function defect in an ubiquitously expressed enzyme. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MARS‐related PAP are currently unknown. In this work, we analyzed the effect of the PAP‐related mutations in MARS on the thermal stability and on the catalytic parameters of the MetRS mutants, relative to wild‐type. The effect of these mutations on the structural integrity of the enzyme as a member of the cytosolic multisynthetase complex was also investigated. Our results establish that the PAP‐related substitutions in MetRS impact the tRNAᴹᵉᵗ‐aminoacylation reaction especially at the level of methionine recognition, and suggest a direct link between the loss of activity of the enzyme and the pathological disorders in PAP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amethionine 3amethionine-tRNA ligase 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3apatients 3athermal stability1 aHadchouel, Alice1 ade Blic, Jacques1 aMirande, Marc0 tFEBS journal.g2018 July, v. 285, no. 14 p.2654-2661dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.145103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014500161300001600306500002000322520118200342592002801524650002101552650002201573650001401595650001701609650001701626650001301643650001201656650000901668650001301677700001701690700002001707700002401727700002201751773011501773856007301888852000901961655001201970IND60595543420221121060437.0180605e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059554342DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.125812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurasch, Alena K.10aAnalysis of tofu‐related traits by a bench‐scale tofu production method and their relationship with agronomic traits in European soybean  ap. 271-282.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEuropean tofu manufacturers are becoming more and more interested in locally grown soybeans. A prerequisite for the development of European tofu cultivars is to improve our understanding of how the environment and genetics affect soymilk and tofu quality, as well as how quality and agronomic traits are correlated. This study was based on 215 recombinant inbred lines derived from two populations and grown at three locations that were evaluated for tofu traits in a bench‐scale tofu laboratory. The heritabilities of most of the evaluated tofu traits were moderately high with h² > 0.6. We observed significant genotypic variance components, but an even stronger contribution of the location. The network analysis of the evaluated traits was population‐dependent; however, the tofu traits were not associated with any of the agronomic traits. Collectively, our results indicate the potential to improve tofu‐related traits in European soybean. The bench‐scale tofu production method provides a valuable tool to test soybean lines in breeding programmes; however, the method needs to be further improved and automated to minimize errors due to the laboratory staff.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomic traits 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3aheritability 3ainbred lines 3asoybeans 3asoymilk 3atofu 3avariance1 aHahn, Volker1 aMiersch, Martin1 aBachteler, Kristina1 aWürschum, Tobias0 tPlant breeding.g2018 June, v. 137, no. 3 p.271-282dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl40712x0179-95417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbr.125813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01856naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245004900164300001600213520092100229592002801150650002501178650001101203650002601214651001201240651001201252651001001264700002301274700001801297773011601315856007801431961001201509852000901521655001201530IND60219790220221117024110.0160303e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6021979022DNAL7 a10.1656/058.014.02062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHibbitts, Toby J.10aResolving the Identity of Texas Desmognathus  ap. 213-220.  aDusky salamanders in Texas have long been identified as Desmognathus auriculatus (Southern Dusky Salamander). However, recent taxonomic work has challenged this notion, restricting D. auriculatus to areas east of the Apalachicola River in Florida and Georgia, while all Texas populations are now considered D. conanti. Regrettably, Texas specimens were not included in the studies upon which these proposed taxonomic changes were based. Dusky salamanders have become increasingly difficult to find in Texas and have only been observed in the state 3 times since 1980. We surveyed 18 sites of which 6 were historical localities. We found 4 extant populations of dusky salamanders at new locations in Texas, one of which was a county record. We were unable to find dusky salamanders at some historically robust populations. We also used mtDNA sequence data to verify that Texas dusky salamanders are indeed D. conanti.  aPublisher supplied data 3anucleotide sequences 3arivers 3asalamanders and newts 3aFlorida 3aGeorgia 3aTexas1 aWahlberg, Scott A.1 aVoelker, Gary0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2015 June, v. 14, no. 2 p.213-220dHumboldt Field Research Institutex1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656%2F058.014.02063Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02040naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008800171300001400259520109800273592002801371653002001399653002101419653001201440653001401452653002101466653000901487700002401496773012501520856008401645852000901729655001201738IND60125479420221122155242.0151103e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012547942DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745.115.1.612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavydov, Evgeny A.10aRare and noteworthy boreal lichens from the Altai Mountains (South Siberia, Russia)  ap. 61-73.  aBased on field trips between 1995–2007, rare and noteworthy lichens from the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia are described.

They participate in energy transduction by activating and stabilizing the components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Experimental evidence shows that they are synthesized by two different mechanisms which indicate that both pathways evolved convergently. Former studies on the lipid composition of archaeal membranes showed the absence of CL in these organisms, consequently, restricting it to the Eukarya and Bacteria domains. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that both CL and PG are present as constitutive components of membranes of the haloarchaea group. However, this scenario complicates the analysis of the evolutionary origin of this biosynthetic pathway. Here I suggest that a phospholipid biosynthetic pathway in Eukarya probably arose from a chimeric event between bacterial and archaeal enzymes during the endosymbiosis event. Phylogenetic analyses support the different evolutionary origin of the enzymes comprising this pathway in bacteria and Eukarya. Based on protein domain analyses, orthologous proteins in the Archaea domain were identified. An integrative analysis of the proteins found demonstrates that CL biosynthesis in major clades of the Eukarya domain originated by chimerism between the bacteria and archaea pathways. Moreover, primary and secondary endosymbiontic events in plants and chromoalveolata respectively, reshaped this pathway again. The implications and advantages that these new enzymatic orders conferred to the Eukarya domain are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acardiolipins 3achimerism 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3alipid composition 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3asymbiosis 0aCardiolipin 0aEukarya 0aArchaea 0aBacteria 0aChimerism 0aEvolution0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 June,  July, v. 1847, no. 6-7 p.599-606dElsevier B.V.wJournal:1927x0005-27287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbabio.2015.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010200162300001600264520122600280592002801506650001401534650001001548650002201558650000901580650001601589650001701605650002101622650001101643650001401654650001301668650001301681650001201694650000901706650001601715700001801731700001401749700001401763700001901777700001501796700001501811700001801826773011301844856008101957852000902038655001202047IND60555475620221119102038.0161028e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055547562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-016-0047-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tao12aA novel method for primary neuronal culture and characterization under different high temperature  ap. 823-828.  aHeatstroke is a big threat to human health; however, the characteristic of pathological changes of neurons during heatstroke development remains unclear. Here, using an in vitro model of primary cultured neurons from newborn Wistar rats, we investigated the effects of the different combinations of high temperature (37, 39, 41, 43, 45, and 47°C) and exposure time (45 min and 1 h) on the neurons. We found that, under the treatment of 45 min-heat, the neurons could resist high temperature up to 45°C, and under the treatment of 1 h-heat, the mortality of neurons increased as the temperature rises. After heating for 1 h, only a small minority of the neurons died under 41 and 43°C, which primarily occurred in the form of apoptosis. Up to 45°C for 1 h, most neurons occurred to necrosis. Meaningfully, some necrotic neurons expressed specific fried egg-like morphology. Our findings suggest that different high temperatures and exposure times were two key factors influencing the death of neurons. Under the high temperature (below 43°C for 1 h) similar to heatstroke, it just led a small percentage of neurons to apoptosis, and anti-apoptosis controls for preventing and treating heatstroke are promising.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3adeath 3aexposure duration 3aheat 3aheat stroke 3ahuman health 3ain vitro studies 3amodels 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aneonates 3aneurons 3arats 3atemperature1 aHu, Huaiqiang1 aTao, Zhen1 aNiu, Bing1 aJiao, Shusheng1 aZhang, Jun1 aLi, Yiyang1 aCao, Bingzhen0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2016 Sept., v. 52, no. 8 p.823-828dSpringer USx1071-26907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-016-0047-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001900183245012700202506007600329520155300405592002801958506003701986650001302023650002002036650001302056650001502069650001302084650001402097650003502111653002902146653002402175653002902199653001302228653002502241700002002266773010702286856007802393852000902471655001202480IND60219790320221207054656.0151031e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6021979032DNAL7 a10.3732/apps.15000142doi7 aPMC44677582pmcid7 a260828772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, James B.10aNext-Generation Sampling: Pairing Genomics with Herbarium Specimens Provides Species-Level Signal in Solidago (Asteraceae)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPremise of the study: The ability to conduct species delimitation and phylogeny reconstruction with genomic data sets obtained exclusively from herbarium specimens would rapidly enhance our knowledge of large, taxonomically contentious plant genera. In this study, the utility of genotyping by sequencing is assessed in the notoriously difficult genus Solidago (Asteraceae) by attempting to obtain an informative single-nucleotide polymorphism data set from a set of specimens collected between 1970 and 2010. Methods: Reduced representation libraries were prepared and Illumina-sequenced from 95 Solidago herbarium specimen DNAs, and resulting reads were processed with the nonreference Universal Network-Enabled Analysis Kit (UNEAK) pipeline. Multidimensional clustering was used to assess the correspondence between genetic groups and morphologically defined species. Results: Library construction and sequencing were successful in 93 of 95 samples. The UNEAK pipeline identified 8470 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and a filtered data set was analyzed for each of three Solidago subsections. Although results varied, clustering identified genomic groups that often corresponded to currently recognized species or groups of closely related species. Discussion: These results suggest that genotyping by sequencing is broadly applicable to DNAs obtained from herbarium specimens. The data obtained and their biological signal suggest that pairing genomics with large-scale herbarium sampling is a promising strategy in species-rich plant groups.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolidago 3adata collection 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3aherbaria 3aphylogeny 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0agenotyping by sequencing 0aherbarium specimens 0anext-generation sampling 0aSolidago 0aspecies delimitation1 aSemple, John C.0 tApplications in plant sciences.g2015 June, v. 3, no. 6dBotanical Society of Americax2168-04507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732%2Fapps.15000143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01338naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009200157300001400249520043400263592002800697650002400725650002600749650001300775700001600788700001600804700001700820773012700837856007500964852000901039655001201048IND60538474420221119215636.0160815e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053847442DNAL7 a10.1021/ja20927452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Ling-Shu10aOrdered Microporous Membranes Templated by Breath Figures for Size-Selective Separation  ap. 95-98.  aMembranes with highly uniform pore size are important in various fields.

Decyclization of creatinine at basic pH has been monitored in vitro by time series surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) using a silver island film. NH₂ scissoring, CN and CO stretching modes of creatinine serve as Raman markers for monitoring the decyclization reaction. Transition state calculations using DFT have revealed the path of the formation of creatine by the cleavage of the endocyclic CN bond of creatinine. The Raman signatures of ring opening are clearly observed after 120 min at pH 8, and further increasing the pH increases the reaction rate even more, as the signatures are observed after 60 and 30 min at pH 10 and 12, respectively; however, the reversibility of the reaction is more prominent at higher pH. Therefore, pH 8 is the most favorable among the three pH values for the decyclization reaction to be stable at room temperature. The proper understanding of this reaction where a toxic substance is converted to a beneficial compound is expected to open the scope for further extensive research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3acreatine 3acreatinine 3amonitoring 3apH 3atime series analysis1 aSharma, Poornima1 aSingh, Sachin Kumar1 aSingh, Pushkar1 aDeckert, Volker1 aPopp, Jürgen,1 aSingh, Ranjan K.0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 21, v. 6, no. 64 p.58943-58949dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03674k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04044naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008400198300001600282500001900298500001100317520273100328592002803059596010103087650002803188650001503216650002303231650000903254650001903263650001103282650001903293650001003312650001403322650001403336650001303350650002503363700005703388773010703445856007303552852000903625655001203634IND60730221920221119201822.0210305e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073022192DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.128712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdney, Alice J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1021-153310aApplications of digital imaging and analysis in seabird monitoring and research  ap. 317-337.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aRapid advances in digital imaging technology offer efficient and cost‐effective methods for measuring seabird abundance, breeding success, phenology, survival and diet. These methods can facilitate understanding of long‐term population trends, and the design and implementation of successful conservation strategies. This paper reviews the suitability of satellites, manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and fixed‐position, handheld and animal‐borne cameras for recording digital photographs and videos used to measure seabird demographic and behavioural parameters. It considers the disturbance impacts, accuracy of results obtained, cost‐effectiveness and scale of monitoring possible compared with ‘traditional’ fieldworker methods. Given the ease of collecting large amounts of imagery, image processing is an important step in realizing the potential of this technology. The effectiveness of manual, semi‐automated and automated image processing is also reviewed. Satellites, manned aircraft and UAVs have most commonly been used for population counts. Spatial resolution is lowest in satellites, limiting monitoring to large species and those with obvious signs of presence, such as penguins. Conversely, UAVs have the highest spatial resolution, which has allowed fine‐scale measurements of foraging behaviour. Time‐lapse cameras are more cost‐effective for collecting time‐series data such as breeding success and phenology, as human visits are only required infrequently for maintenance. However, the colony of interest must be observable from a single vantage point. Handheld, animal‐borne and motion‐triggered cameras have fewer cost‐effective uses but have provided information on seabird diet, foraging behaviour and nest predation. The last of these has been important for understanding the impact of invasive mammals on seabird breeding success. Advances in automated image analysis are increasing the suitability of digital photography and videography to facilitate and/or replace traditional seabird monitoring methods. Machine‐learning algorithms, such as Pengbot, have allowed rapid identification of birds, although training requires thousands of pre‐annotated photographs. Digital imaging has considerable potential in seabird monitoring, provided that appropriate choices are available for both image capture technology and image processing. These technologies offer opportunities to collect data in remote locations and increase the number of sites monitored. The potential to include such solutions in seabird monitoring and research will develop as the technology evolves, which will be of benefit given funding challenges in monitoring and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Gloucestershire Environmental Dynamics and Governance (EDG) research priority area 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomation 3acost effectiveness 3adiet 3adigital images 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3anests 3aphenology 3apredation 3aseabirds 3atime series analysis1 aWood, Matt J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0920-83960 tIbis.g2021 Apr., v. 163, no. 2 p.317-337dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.128713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05425naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001100145245014100156300001400297506002800311520410200339592002804441506003704469650001304506650002404519650002404543650001104567650001404578650001604592650003204608650001804640650001104658650001904669700001504688700002004703700001904723700002104742700001304763700002104776773010504797856008004902852000904982655001204991IND60774898920221207082411.0161227e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077489892DNAL7 a10.22146/agritech.106872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarwin10aAPLIKASI THERMAL PRE-TREATMENT LIMBAH TANAMAN JAGUNG (Zea mays) SEBAGAI CO·SUBSTRAT PADA PROSES ANAEROBIK DIGESTI UNTUK PRODUKSI BIOGAS  ap. 79-88.  aResource is Open Access  aThermal pre-treatment was given on corn stover in the purpose of breaking the lignin content; thus, it may help anaerobic microorganisms to convert polymer including cellulose and hemicelluloses into biogas. This study aimed to investigate the effects of thermal pre-treatment on corn stover in anaerobic digestion process related to the production of biogas as well as digestion process efficiency. This research was carried out by utilizing batch reactors where the temperature was maintained at mesophilic conditions above room temperature (33 ± 2 oC). Based on the result, it was known that thermal pre-treatment given on the corn stover may enhance anaerobic digestion process for biogas production at the first 10 days. This condition reduced the time of lag phase during anaerobic digestion. The biogas production of corn stover given thermal pre-treatment was slow at 26 days where their average total production were 12,412.5 mL,12,310 mL at 15 and 25 minutes thermal pre-treatment, respectively while biogas production of non pre-treated corn stover was 12,557 mL. The highest daily biogas production was accomplished by corn stover that was given thermal pre-treatment at 25 minutes (915 mL). Corn stover given with 15 minutes thermal pre-treatment also generated higher daily biogas production at day 9 (772.5 mL) compared with corn stover that was not pre-treated (405 mL). This research also revealed that corn stover given thermal pre-treatment reached higher biogas yield compared with non pre-treated corn stover where their biogas yield were 670.39, 690.65 mL/g volatile solids added at 15 and 25 minutes thermal pre- treatment respectively, and 456.37 mL/g volatile solids added of non pre-treated corn stover.

Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk melakukan kajian mengenai penerapan thermal pre-treatment pada limbah tanaman jagung terhadap proses anaerobik digesi yang meliputi efisiensi proses digesi dan produksi biogas yang dihasilkan. Penelitian ini dilakukan dengan menggunakan reaktor tipe batch yang suhunya dipertahankan pada kondisi mesophilic atau di atas rata-rata suhu kamar (33 ± 2 oC). Hasil penelitian diperoleh bahwa thermal pre-treatment yang diberikan pada limbah tanaman jagung mampu mempercepat proses produksi biogas pada 10 hari pertama sehingga dapat mengurangi lag-phase pada proses anaerobik digesi. Limbah tanaman jagung yang diberikan thermal pre-treatment mengalami perlambatan produksi biogas pada hari ke 26 dengan rata-rata total produksi 12.412,5 mL untuk limbah tanaman jagung yang diberikan thermal pre- treatment selama 15 menit, dan 12.310 mL untuk limbah tanaman jagung yang diberikan thermal pre-treatment selama 25 menit, sedangkan limbah tanaman jagung yang tidak diberikan pre-treatment menghasilkan produksi biogas sebesar 12.557 mL pada hari ke 26. Produksi biogas harian tertinggi terjadi pada substrat yang diberikan thermal pre-treatment 25 menit, dengan produksi biogas tertinggi pada hari ke 9 dengan rata-rata produksi sebesar 915 mL. Substrat yang diberikan thermal pre-treatment 15 menit juga memproduksi biogas jauh lebih tinggi (772,5 mL) pada hari ke 9 jika dibandingkan dengan substrat tanpa diberikan pre-treatment yang hanya memproduksi biogas sebesar 405 mL. Data hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa limbah tanaman jagung yang diberikan thermal pre-treatment memperoleh biogas yield lebih tinggi dari pada yang tidak diberikan pre-treatment dimana 670,39 mL/g volatile solids untuk thermal pre- treatment 15 menit, 690,65 mL/g volatile solids untuk thermal pre-treatment 25 menit dan 456,37 mL/g volatile solids untuk limbah tanaman jagung yang tidak diberikan pre-treatment.

The performance of hybrid processes was evaluated with the removal efficiencies of turbidity, ammonia and organic matter. The results indicated that more than 99% of particle count was removed by both hybrid processes and ozonation had no significant effect on its removal. BAC filtration greatly improved the removal of ammonia. Increasing the dissolved oxygen to 30.0 mg/L could lead to a removal of ammonia with concentrations as high as 7.80 mg/L and 8.69 mg/L for Processes A and B, respectively. The average removal efficiencies of total organic carbon and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254, a parameter indicating organic matter with aromatic structure) were 49% and 52% for Process A, 51% and 48% for Process B, respectively. Some organic matter was oxidized by ozone and this resulted in reduced membrane fouling and increased membrane flux by 25%–30%. However, pre-ozonation altered the components of the raw water and affected the microorganisms in the BAC, which may impact the removals of organic matter and nitrite negatively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aactivated carbon 3aammonia 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aceramics 3adissolved oxygen 3afiltration 3afouling 3amicroorganisms 3anitrites 3aorganic matter 3aozonation 3aozone 3aturbidity 0abiological activated carbon 0aceramic membrane 0ahybrid process 0aozone1 aHu, Jiangyong1 aTao, Yi1 aZhu, Jia1 aZhang, Xihui0 tJournal of Environmental Sciences.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 26 p.783-791dElsevier B.V.aThe Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciencesx1001-07427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(13)60477-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010700173300001600280520117700296592002801473650002201501650001401523650002701537650001401564650001201578650001601590653001601606653002301622653001301645653002401658653001201682653001701694700002301711700001901734700002001753773010801773856008601881852000901967655001201976IND60540813220221120185124.0190318e20141104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054081322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.05.0942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamshidian, Majid10aStretching properties of xanthan and hydroxypropyl guar in aqueous solutions and in cosmetic emulsions  ap. 334-341.  aFilament stretchability of xanthan gum (XG) and hydroxypropyl guar (HPG) was investigated in aqueous solutions (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.2 and 1.5% w/w) and in O/W emulsions using a texture analyzer.

XG solutions exhibited a solid-like behavior with rheological parameters much higher than for HPG one whatever the concentration. Filament stretching values of XG solutions were superior to HPG for concentration below 1% w/w and then became comparable for higher concentrations. No meaningful relationship was found between rheological and stretching values. Synergy was observed for all XG/HPG mixtures at 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5% influencing both the rheological and the filament stretching values. The 25/75 XG/HPG ratio showed the maximum synergistic effect at all concentrations while the filament stretchability was enhanced in a wider range of ratios. XG and HPG did not present the same behavior in emulsions. No clear synergistic effect was observed and XG markedly influenced the emulsion filament stretching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aemulsions 3arheological properties 3asynergism 3atexture 3axanthan gum 0aXanthan gum 0aHydroxypropyl guar 0aRheology 0aFilament stretching 0aSynergy 0aO/W emulsion1 aSavary, Géraldine1 aGrisel, Michel1 aPicard, Céline0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Nov. 04, v. 112 p.334-341dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.05.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03929naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011800165300001400283500001500297520217500312592002802487650002002515650003102535650001402566650001402580650002102594650001402615650001902629650001402648650001502662650003202677650000902709650001602718650002202734650003502756650000902791650001302800650001902813650001702832650002002849650001802869650001702887653001302904653002202917653002802939653003902967700001603006700001403022700001603036700001503052700001803067700001803085700002003103700001503123773007103138856008503209852000903294655001203303IND60558400820221117212819.0170606e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055840082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2016.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin10aIntra-articular injection of Botulinum toxin A reduces neurogenic inflammation in CFA-induced arthritic rat model  ap. 70-78.  a2019-12-06  aCurrently, administration of Botulinum toxin Type A (BoNT/A) to treat arthritic pain has promising efficacy in clinical research. However, the mechanisms underlying anti-neurogenic inflammation mediated by BoNT/A remains unclear. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness in macro and micro levels and to explore the causal mechanism of BoNT/A.Wistar rats (n = 60) were injected with 50ul complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the left ankle joint capsule to establish a model of chronic monoarthritis. Pain behaviour (Evoked pain assessment) and infrared thermal imaging testing were performed at the macroscopic level to assess the effectiveness of analgesia and anti-inflammation. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used at the microscopic level in an attempt to determine the mechanisms of anti-nociceptive or anti-inflammatory effects of BoNT/A. Additionally, hematoxylin-eosin staining was also used to visualise the cartilage and the synovial degenerative conditions of arthritis. By comparing the outcome of the evoked pain test and immunofluorescence staining, there was a significant improvement in BoNT/A compared with the normal saline (NS) injected control group. In addition, thermal variations showed that the temperature of ipsilateral ankle joint increased between 1 and 2 weeks following injection of CFA, but decreased after 3 weeks (still above the contralateral side). However, the temperature showed no difference between the BoNT/A group and NS group after treatment. The expression of IL-1β or TNF-α in the ankle synovial tissue was significantly decreased in the BoNT/A group compared to the NS group (p < 0.05). Based on the HE assessment, cartilage degeneration and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the BoNT/A group was alleviated compared to the NS group after treatment. In conclusion, we proposed the hypothesis that intra-articular BoNT/A administration does play an important role in anti-neurogenic inflammation. The possible mechanisms might be that BoNT/A prevents the release of nociceptive nerve peptides at the injection site and then suppresses the expression of inflammatory cytokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3abotulinum toxin 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aadjuvants 3aarthritis 3aWestern blotting 3aanalgesia 3aimage analysis 3acartilage 3apain tests 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3arats 3atemperature 3ainterleukin-1beta 3afluorescent antibody technique 3apain 3astaining 3ainjection site 3ainflammation 3apain assessment 3aanimal models 3anerve tissue 0apeptides 0aBotulinum toxin A 0aNeurogenic inflammation 0aRat model of chronic monoarthritis1 aWang, Kaile1 aChu, Xiao1 aLi, Tieshan1 aShen, Nana1 aFan, Chenglei1 aNiu, Zhenyuan1 aZhang, Xiaochen1 aHu, Luoman0 tToxicon.g2017 Feb., v. 126 p.70-78dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2016.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03976naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010700165520258700272592002802859650002202887650002002909650001502929650001802944650001302962650002602975650001703001650001303018650001303031650001303044650001203057650002903069653003203098653001803130653001003148653005103158700001803209700002003227700001903247700001603266700001803282700002103300773009403321856008203415852000903497655001203506IND60725296320221119152343.0210223e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072529632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubens, W.H.G10aAqueous humor proteome of primary open angle glaucoma: A combined dataset of mass spectrometry studies  aAnalysis of the proteins of the aqueous humor can help to elucidate the complex pathogenesis of primary open angle glaucoma. Thanks to advances in liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) it is now possible to identify hundreds of proteins in individual aqueous humor samples without the need to pool samples. We performed a systematic literature search to find publications that performed LC-MS/MS on aqueous humor samples of glaucoma patients and of non-glaucomatous controls. Of the seven publications that we found, we obtained the raw data of three publications. These three studies used glaucoma patients that were clinically similar (i.e. undergoing glaucoma filtration surgery) which prompted us to reanalyse and combine their data. Raw data of each study were analysed separately with the latest version of MaxQuant (version v1.6.11.0). Outcome files were exported to Microsoft Excel. Samples belonging to the same patient were averaged to obtain peptide expression values per individual. We compared the overlap of identified proteins using the VLOOKUP function of Excel and a publicly available Venn diagram software. For the peptide sequences that can belong to multiple proteins (usually of the same protein family), we initially included all possibly identified proteins. This ensured that we would not miss a potential overlap between the studies due to differences in identified peptide counts. Next, of those peptides of which we compared multiple proteins, only one unique protein was included in our analysis i.e. either the protein overlapping between studies or in case of no overlap, the protein that had the highest identified peptide count. This yielded 639 unique proteins detected in aqueous humor of either glaucoma patients or non-glaucomatous controls. In our manuscript entitled “The aqueous humor proteome of primary open angle glaucoma: An extensive review” [1], we further analysed this dataset. The dataset was exported to Perseus (version 1.6.5.0). We removed contaminants and filtered for proteins detected with high confidence, i.e. in more than 70% of the samples of at least one study. This yielded 248 proteins of which we compared the expression in glaucoma patients against control patients. Gene ontology enrichment analysis and pathway analysis was used to interpret the results. The unfiltered dataset reported in this data article and the approach reported here to reanalyse and combine raw data of different studies can be applied by other glaucoma researchers to gain more insight in the pathogenesis of glaucoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3afiltration 3agene ontology 3aglaucoma 3aliquid chromatography 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apeptides 3aproteome 3asurgery 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPrimary open angle glaucoma 0aAqueous humor 0aHuman 0aLiquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry1 aMohren, R.J.C1 aLiesenborghs, I1 aEijssen, L.M.T1 aRamdas, W.D1 aWebers, C.A.B1 aGorgels, T.G.M.F0 tData in Brief.g2020 Oct., v. 32 p.106327-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009900172520144600271592002801717650003501745650003401780650003201814650001601846650001101862650001501873650001101888650002001899650000901919650001401928650001801942650000901960650001101969650001301980650002301993650000902016653003202025653002502057653001602082653001902098653004302117700002102160700001902181700005802200700002102258700002102279700002502300700002502325700001802350700002202368773011802390856008602508852000902594655001202603IND60720003620221121003823.0210506e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072000362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKremser, Klemens10aLeachability of metals from waste incineration residues by iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria  aHazardous waste disposal via incineration generates a substantial amount of ashes and slags which pose an environmental risk due to their toxicity. Currently, these residues are deposited in landfills with loss of potentially recyclable raw material. In this study, the use of acidophilic bioleaching bacteria (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans) as an environmentally friendly, efficient strategy for the recovery of valuable metals from incineration residues was investigated. Zinc, Cobalt, Copper, and Manganese from three different incineration residues were bio-extracted up to 100% using A. ferrooxidans under ferrous iron oxidation. The other metals showed lower leaching efficiencies based on the type of culture used. Sulfur-oxidizing cultures A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans, containing sulfur as the sole substrate, expressed a significantly lower leaching efficiency (up to 50%). According to ICP-MS, ashes and slags contained Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Cd, and Ni in economically attractive concentrations between 0.2 and 75 mg g⁻¹. Compared to conventional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes, our biological approach provides many advantages such as: the use of a limited amount of used strong acids (H₂SO₄ or HCl), recycling operations at lower temperatures (~30 °C) and no emission of toxic gases during combustion (i.e., dioxins and furans).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidithiobacillus ferrooxidans 3aAcidithiobacillus thiooxidans 3aLeptospirillum ferrooxidans 3abioleaching 3acobalt 3acombustion 3afurans 3ahazardous waste 3airon 3amanganese 3araw materials 3arisk 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3awaste incineration 3azinc 0aWaste incineration residues 0aArtificial metal ore 0aBioleaching 0aMetal recovery 0aIron- and sulfur-oxidizing acidophiles1 aThallner, Sophie1 aStrbik, Dorina1 aSpiess, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1404-54641 aKučera, Jiří,1 aVaculovic, Tomas1 aVšianský, Dalibor,1 aHaberbauer, Marianne1 aMandl, Martin1 aGuebitz, Georg M.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 280 p.111734-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100003200147245011300179300001600292500001500308520175300323592002802076650003502104650002402139650001602163650003102179650001302210650001502223650001502238653001302253653001502266700002202281773012002303852000902423856008402432655001202516IND4425128320221117025116.0181002e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442512832DNAL7 a10.1097/SS.0b013e3181b216962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarathanasis, Anastasios D.10aPreferential Sorption and Desorption of Organic and Inorganic Phospates by Soil Hydroxyinterlayered Minerals  ap. 417-423.  a2019-12-04  aThe purpose of this study was to assess the potential of soil clays rich in hydroxyinterlayered vermiculite (HIV) and smectite (HIS) minerals to adsorb and release P after interaction with a mixture of inorganic and organic P forms as compared with geologic reference gibbsite and goethite minerals. One, 3-, and 7-day P adsorption/desorption experiments were conducted with six soil clays containing greater than 40% HIV, two soil clays containing greater than 55% HIS, and two reference goethite and gibbsite clays equilibrated with a P pool consisting of equal amounts (5 mg P g clay) of KH2PO4 and inositol hexaphosphate. The results indicated a strong tendency for HIV and HIS minerals to sorb P at amounts equivalent or higher than those sorbed by gibbsite or goethite minerals. Organic P was sorbed at higher quantities and was retained with greater energy than inorganic P forms. Ammonium oxalate-treated clays produced a clearer picture of the net contribution of hydroxyinterlayered minerals to P sorption capacity compared with free aluminum/iron (oxy)hydroxide components, but the degree of aluminum hydroxyinterlayering somewhat obscured P sorption mineral quantity correlations. Longer equilibration times mainly increased the sorption of organic P loads of the ammonium oxalate- treated samples, suggesting that inositol hexaphosphate molecules interacted with progressively less accessible higher energy interlayer sites. Reaction times had little effect on P desorption characteristics, and most of the released P was associated with the inorganic fraction. The findings suggest a potentially lower risk for P contamination from organic waste amendments applied to watersheds associated with soils abundant in HIV and HIS minerals.  aPublisher supplied data 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3ainositol phosphates 3avermiculite 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3asmectite 3adesorption 3aadsorption 0asorption 0aphosphates1 aShumaker, Paul D.0 tSoil science.g2009 Aug., v. 174, no. 8 p.417-423dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e3181b216963Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02445naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012300155300002000278520140600298592002801704650001401732650001401746650000901760650001201769650000901781650001901790650002001809650001601829650001401845700001401859700001601873773012301889856007402012852000902086655001202095IND60618585220221120172842.0181030e20180522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061858522DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra03144d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chen10aFluorinated anionic fenugreek gum: their self-assembly behaviors and use as a novel thickening agent in fracturing gel  ap. 18734-18744.  aA novel fluorinated anionic fenugreek gum (FAFG) was obtained with excellent solution, gel, and broken-gel liquid properties in tertiary oil recovery, which were studied in detail and fenugreek gum (FG) and anionic fenugreek gum (AFG) were used as contrast samples. The results show that, compared to the FG and AFG solution properties, FAFG shows self-assembly properties, and inclusion of more fluorinated groups further reduced the critical associating concentration, yielding better associating properties. Compared to the FG and AFG gels, the FAFG gels exhibit good temperature resistance, shear resistance, rheological behaviors, and excellent salt tolerance. These improvements are attributed to the introduction of fluorinated groups and sulfonic groups. Compared to the FG and AFG broken-gel solutions, the FAFG broken-gel solutions presented slightly higher apparent viscosities. Moreover, the FAFG broken-gel solutions had profoundly lower surface tension and interfacial tension and extremely lower formation damage rates. They can hence serve as clean-up additives themselves after gel breaking. This automatically improves the flowback efficiency and reduces the formation damage. The residue rates of the FAFG broken-gel liquids were lower than those of the AFG and FG broken-gel liquids. Combined with its other excellent properties, FAFG would be an ideal component in fracturing gel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3afenugreek 3agels 3aliquids 3aoils 3asalt tolerance 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aWang, Xia1 aQiu, Liewei0 tRSC advances.g2018 May 22, v. 8, no. 33 p.18734-18744dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra03144d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245010300175300001600278520047500294592002800769650001300797650001400810650002000824650001100844650001200855650001200867651002300879651001200902653001500914653001100929653002200940653001700962653002100979700001901000773013101019856008501150852000901235655001201244IND60125479720221122121901.0151103e20120925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012547972DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-115.3.3752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Christopher J.10aLecanora carlottiana, a new saxicolous lichen species from the Great Lakes region of North America  ap. 375-381.  aA species of Lecanora in the L. dispersa group, with a well-developed pale thallus and a heavily pruinose apothecia, resembling superficially among others L. poeltiana, is found on shaded vertical calcareous cliff faces and is described here as Lecanora carlottiana sp. nov.

Thus, a major biomedical goal is to identify and therapeutically manipulate those inherent programs that protect against mitochondrial dysfunction to promote cell survival and organismal health. The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is such a protective transcriptional response mediated by mitochondrial-to-nuclear signaling that includes mitochondrial proteostasis genes to stabilize mitochondrial function, metabolic adaptations, as well as an innate immunity program. Here, we review the UPRmt and its role during a variety of forms of mitochondrial dysfunction including those caused by mutations in respiratory chain genes as well as upon exposure to pathogens that produce mitochondrial toxins. We also review recent data in support of and against the emerging role of the UPRmt during aging and longevity.

Individuals were collected using a shrimp boat, and the environmental parameters were obtained from the water column using a multiparameter probe and from the sediment using a Petersen grab. Spatially, the mean values of the temperature and chlorophyll a concentration were higher in the estuary than in the ocean, and the greatest part of the substrate was composed of fine sediment, with Phi size (granulometry of sediment) tending to have higher mean in the ocean. Therefore, we observed a dynamic estuary and conservative adjacent coastal area where shrimp were more influenced by variations in salinity, preferably in the ocean stations, but we also observe the presence of Litopenaeus schmitti and Rimapenaeus constrictus in estuarine stations (meso and polyhaline areas).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus schmitti 3aboats 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3amarine science 3asalinity 3asediments 3ashrimp 3atemperature 3aBrazil 0aCananéia–Iguape 0aPenaeoidea 0aEcology 0aEnvironmental factors1 aLopes, A.E.B.1 aSilvestre, A.K.C.1 aGrabowski, R.C.1 aBarioto, J.G.1 aCosta, R.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1342-73401 aCastilho, A.L.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2018 Mar., v. 19 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2018.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014200168500002200310520050700332592002800839650002200867650002500889650002100914650001700935650000900952650001700961650001600978650002000994653005901014653001701073653001801090700001901108700001701127700002101144700002301165700002601188700005901214773005201273856008501325852000901410655001201419IND60558400920221117213027.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055840092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2016.11.2452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatone, Hina10aTetrodotoxin and tributyltin-binding abilities of recombinant pufferfish saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin binding proteins of Takifugu rubripes  aPre-press version  aWe investigated the ability of recombinant pufferfish saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin binding protein types 1 and 2 of Takifugu rubripes (rTrub.PSTBP1 and rTrub.PSTBP2) to bind to tetrodotoxin (TTX) and tributyltin.

A. I.10aImplementing and Monitoring the Use of Artificial Canopy Bridges by Mammals and Birds in an Indonesian Agroforestry Environment  aDeforestation is a major threat to biodiversity, particularly within tropical forest habitats. Some of the fastest diminishing tropical forest habitats in the world occur in Indonesia, where fragmentation is severely impacting biodiversity, including on the island of Java, which holds many endemic species. Extreme fragmentation on the western part of the island, especially due to small-scale agriculture, impacts animal movement and increases mortality risk for mainly arboreal taxa. To mitigate this risk in an agroforest environment in Garut District, West Java, we installed 10 canopy bridges and monitored them through camera trapping between 2017 and 2019. Five of the monitored bridges were made of waterlines and five of rubber hose. We recorded Javan palm civets using the waterline bridges 938 times, while Javan slow lorises used the waterlines 1079 times and the rubber bridges 358 times. At least 19 other species used the bridges for crossing or perching. Our results demonstrate that relatively simple and cost-effective materials can be used to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation. We also recommend the use of camera traps to monitor the effectiveness of these interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLorisidae 3aViverridae 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3abridges (infrastructure) 3acamera trapping 3acameras 3acanopy 3acost effectiveness 3adeforestation 3aforest habitats 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aindigenous species 3amammals 3amortality 3arisk 3asmall-scale farming 3atropical forests 3aIndonesia1 aHandby, Victoria 1 aCampera, Marco 1 aBirot, Hélène 1 aHedger, Katherine 1 aEaton, James 1 aImron, Muhammad  Ali0 tDiversity.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d121003993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012600170300001400296520169400310592002802004650001902032650002502051650001202076650000802088650001902096650002602115650001402141650001202155650000902167650001302176650002102189651001102210653002002221653001102241653001902252653001802271653002002289653001402309700001502323700002102338700002702359700002202386773013002408856008402538852000902622655001202631IND60606227720221119180233.0190318e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060622772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortez, Michelle10aDevelopment of an altricial mammal at sea: I. Activity budgets of female sea otters and their pups in Simpson Bay, Alaska  ap. 71-80.  aParental care is necessary for the survival of most mammalian offspring. However, this is especially true for neonatal sea otters (Enhydra lutris), which are the most altricial of marine mammals born at sea. The female not only feeds the pup but also protects it from environmental and predatory threats while maintaining the insulating properties of its fur for thermoregulation. We studied the behavior of female sea otters and their pups during the first three months postpartum in Simpson Bay, Alaska. Six behaviors for females and seven behaviors for pups were recorded to produce 24-h activity budgets. Pups were classified into three behavioral/size categories: Category 1 (C1) 0 – <4 wks old; Category 2 (C2) 4 – <8 wks old; Category 3 (C3) 8–12 wks. The percentage of time females spent feeding increased from 9% (C1) to 32% (C3) reflecting the increased nutritional requirements of the maturing pups. C1 females spent 21% of their time swimming in a meandering manner, possibly to protect young pups from predation, which decreased to 8% for females with C3 pups. The time spent resting by females (ca. 50%) was independent of pup category. C1 pups spent 83% of their day resting which decreased to 48% for C3 pups. Time spent nursing remained constant (ca. 8%) for all pup categories, but feeding on solid food provided mainly by the female increased to 17% (C3 pups). The percentage of time that pups spent swimming increased to 17% (C3 pups) as they developed strength and coordination. Our results provide a quantitative picture of the changes in female and pup behavior and activity patterns during the early and critical developmental stages of altricial pups at sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnhydra lutris 3adevelopmental stages 3afemales 3afur 3amarine mammals 3anutrient requirements 3apredation 3aprogeny 3apups 3aswimming 3athermoregulation 3aAlaska 0aActivity budget 0aAlaska 0aEnhydra lutris 0aMaternal care 0aPup development 0aSea otter1 aWolt, Ryan1 aGelwick, Frances1 aOsterrieder, Sylvia K.1 aDavis, Randall W.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2016 Aug., v. 481 p.71-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245003300174300001300207520080300220592002801023650001401051650003601065650001301101700002201114773008001136856008401216852000901300655001201309IND60553984720221119181746.0161023e20150402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055398472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer, Matthias P.10aHsp90: Breaking the Symmetry  ap. 8-20.  aHsp90 chaperones receive much attention due to their role in cancer and other pathological conditions, and a tremendous effort of many laboratories has contributed in the past decades to considerable progress in the understanding of their functions. Hsp90 chaperones exist as dimers and, with the help of cochaperones, promote the folding of numerous client proteins. Although the original view of these interactions suggested that these dimeric complexes were symmetrical, it is now clear that many features are asymmetrical. In this review we discuss several recent advances that highlight how asymmetric interactions with cochaperones as well as asymmetric posttranslational modifications provide mechanisms to regulate client interactions and the progression through Hsp90’s chaperone cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneoplasms 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins1 aLe Breton, Laura0 tMolecular cell.g2015 Apr. 02, v. 58 p.8-20dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245021600161300001600377520124400393592002801637650002401665650001301689650002301702650001401725650004401739650001501783650002001798700002401818700002701842773012901869856007501998852000902073655001202082IND60538474620221119215629.0160815e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053847462DNAL7 a10.1021/ja209424z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProutiere, Fabien10aReactivity and Stability of Dinuclear Pd(I) Complexes: Studies on the Active Catalytic Species, Insights into Precatalyst Activation and Deactivation, and Application in Highly Selective Cross-Coupling Reactions  ap. 606-612.  aThe catalysis derived from the dinuclear Pd(I)–Pd(I) complex, {[PtBu₃]PdBr}₂, has been studied with experimental, computational, and spectroscopic techniques. Experimental selectivity studies were performed, and the reactivity was subsequently investigated with density functional theory (B3LYP-D and M06L) to deduce information on the likely active catalytic species. The reactivity with aryl chlorides and bromides was found to be inconsistent with direct catalytic involvement of the Pd(I) dimer but consistent with mononuclear Pd(0) catalysis. Computational studies suggest that precatalyst transformation to the active catalytic species does not proceed via a direct disproportionation mechanism; a reductive pathway is the most likely scenario instead. Through ³¹P NMR investigations it was identified that the combination of ArB(OH)₂, KF, and water triggers the conversion of the precatalyst to Pd(PtBu₃)₂ and, most likely, Pd-black as a competing side process, explaining the incomplete conversions of aryl chlorides in Suzuki cross-coupling reactions under Pd(I) dimer conditions. New applications in highly regio- and chemoselective transformations in short reaction times at room temperature are also demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abromides 3acatalytic activity 3achlorides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes1 aAufiero, Marialuisa1 aSchoenebeck, Franziska0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Jan. 11, v. 134, no. 1 p.606-612dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja209424z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245009600129300001600225500001900241520082700260592002801087650001701115650001501132650001201147650001601159653002101175653000901196653002601205653002401231653002701255700001701282700001401299700001701313700001701330773014701347852000901494655001201503IND60716691820221122202504.0201107e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071669182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, M.M.10aClinical studies on therapeutic ultrasound and diathermy in dogs with hind quarter weakness  ap. 136-139.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClinical studies were conducted in dogs suffering from hind quarter weakness and subjected to conventional drug therapy CDT (n=8) alone and in combination with therapeutic ultrasound (n=8) or short wave diathermy (n=8).

The most commonly reported species are C. amethystina, C. cinerea, C. coralloides, and C. rugosa, which are part of a species complex in temperate ecosystems. In this work, we describe two new species, C. mahiscolorata and C. parvispora, from temperate forests of central Mexico. We also present a geographical range redistribution of C. reae, which displays great macromorphological variation regarding basidiome branching rank, colors, and tip shape. We provide macromorphological, micromorphological, and habitat data for each species, as well as nuclear rDNA ITS, rDNA LSU, and RPB2 sequences. Our findings highlight an underestimation of species richness in temperate ecosystems, as a consequence of assigning existing epithets to taxa without proper morphological and molecular analyses. The designation of neotypes for temperate species of Clavulina is urgent to delimit species concepts for the genus.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN-223114cPAPIIT  a239266cCONACYT  a420208cCONACYT 3aAbies religiosa 3aClavulina 3abasidiomata 3acolor 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3ahabitats 3aneotypes 3anew species 3aribosomal DNA 3aspecies richness 3atemperate forests 3aMexico1 aMargarita, Villegas-Ríos1 aRoberto, Garibay-Orijel1 aRodolfo, Salas-Lizana0 tMycological progress.g2019 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.1187-1200dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000124x1617-416X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-019-01516-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245009000168300001600258506002800274520146300302592002801765506003701793650000901830650001901839650002201858650000901880650002201889650001201911650002301923650001401946650000901960650001301969653002301982653003002005653002202035653001802057700001702075700001302092700003502105773011502140856009102255852000902346655001202355IND60774378920221207125101.0191128e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077437892DNAL7 a10.15294/biosaintifika.v11i1.166882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinardi10aPotential of Soil Bacteria as Mercury Bioremediation Agent in Traditional Gold Mining  ap. 108-116.  aResource is Open Access  aMandor Village has developed as a tradisional gold mining area since years ago. It involved activities that have led to extreme land condition and the release of mining residues, i.e., mercury, to the soils. The study examined the potential of soil bacteria as mercury bioremediation agent based on their population and activity in former mines with different ages. The bacterial population was measured by isolating soil bacteria on solid media using the pour plate method, and the colonies were enumerated during the incubation. The Nutrient Agar (NA) medium was used to obtain the total population, whereas the Salt Base Solution (SBS) was to determine the presence of mercury-tolerant bacteria. The addition of HgCl2 affected the number of the colonies. The colony only grew until the concentration of HgCl2 reached 5 mg/l, and the total colony was larger in older mines. The observation of bacterial activity showed that biotransformation performance was lower when the concentration of mercury was the same as its natural presence in soils (0.1-0.5 mg/l) compared with higher mercury level (1 mg/l). The research showed that lower mercury concentrations in nature reduced the natural ability of bacteria to transform pollutants. This study provides information that can assist the development of a technological approach to control mercury pollution in former traditional gold mines in an environmentally friendly manner using indigenous soil bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagar 3abioremediation 3abiotransformation 3agold 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3amicrobial activity 3apollution 3asoil 3avillages 0abacterial colonies 0amercury-tolerant bacteria 0apour plate method 0asoil bacteria1 aHaryono, Eko1 aSudrajat1 aSoetarto, Endang Sutariningsih0 tBiosaintifika.g2019 Apr., v. 11, no. 1 p.108-116dUniversitas Negeri SemarangwJournal:27802x2338-76107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15294/biosaintifika.v11i1.166883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166520107400261592002801335650001201363650001001375650002001385650001401405653000801419653001901427653001301446653002801459653001901487700002701506700002001533773009401553856008201647852000901729655001201738IND60725296620221119152448.0210223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072529662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1063222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrando, Lara12aA neuroimaging data set on problem solving in the case of the reversal error: Putamen data  aStructural Magnetic Resonance Images (sMRI) for a sample of university students were recorded.

This study presents novel results with advanced biochar application by integrating biochar with biofilter for the removal of bisphenol A (BPA) from stormwater. Biochars derived from wood dust (BC0) at different pyrolytic temperatures (300, 500, and 700 °C, referred as, BC300, BC500, and BC700, respectively) were characterized and investigated for their adsorption of BPA under different pH levels and humic acid (HA) concentrations by batch sorption and fixed-bed column experiments. Microcosm biofilters vegetated with phragmites australis and amended with different biochars were constructed and used for BPA removal under different hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). Compared with other biochars, BC700 showed a high adsorption rate and capacity due to high specific surface area and pore volume. As a consequence, fixed-bed columns amended with BC700 can remove BPA more efficiently than columns with BC0, BC300, and BC500 from synthetic stormwater, though the treatment performance was affected relatively by pH change and HA concentration. A high correlation (r² = 0.899) between the breakthrough time and the product of adsorption rate (k₂) and capacity (Qₘₐₓ) was found, which suggests that batch sorption experiments could be an efficient tool for prediction of breakthrough time. The BPA removal efficiency of microcosm biofilters amended with BC0, BC300, BC500 and BC700 for real stormwater containing 200 μg/L BPA at HLR of 40 cm/h averaged 4.1, 10.8, 80.3, and 98.4%, which were about 6, 15, 115, and 141 times, respectively, compared to bilfitlers without biochar amendment. Moreover, biochar amendment not only enhanced the BPA removal but also promoted phragmites australis growth, elevated nutrients and increased the E. coli removal efficiency. Hence, biochar-amended biofilters could be a promising approach for enhancing the elimination of endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as BPA from aqueous environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPhragmites australis 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiofilters 3abisphenol A 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3ahumic acids 3anutrients 3apH 3aprediction 3aremediation 3astormwater 3asurface area 3atemperature 3awood dust 0aBiochars 0aBisphenol A 0aAdsorption 0aFixed-bed column 0aMicrocosm biofilter1 aChen, Baoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8196-081X0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2018 Dec., v. 243 p.1539-1549dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2018.09.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01521naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245009700162520041200259592002800671650002600699650001700725650001300742651001000755653002600765653001600791653001500807653001100822653001500833700001800848700002200866700002200888700001900910700002200929773011200951856007501063852000901138655001201147IND60645114720221121030610.0190523e20180629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064511472DNAL7 a10.4081/fe.2018.2882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLABADESSA, Rocco10aFirst records of Eyprepocnemis plorans plorans in southeastern Italy (Orthoptera: Acrididae)  aNew populations of Eyprepocnemis plorans plorans (Charpentier, 1825) are first reported for southeastern Italy.

SmRhO3 with GdFeO3-type perovskite structure is found to be the only ternary phase. Solid-state electrochemical cells, containing calcia-stabilized zirconia as an electrolyte, are used to measure the thermodynamic properties of SmRhO3 formed from their binary component oxides Rh2O3 (ortho) and Sm2O3 (C-type and B-type) in two different temperature ranges. Results suggest that C-type Sm2O3 with cubic structure transforms to B-type Sm2O3 with monoclinic structure at 1110 K. The standard Gibbs energy of transformation is Δ tr G o (±87)/Jmol −1 =3763−3.39(T/K) . Standard Gibbs energy of formation of SmRhO3 from binary component oxides Rh2O3 and Sm2O3 with B-type rare earth oxide structure can be expressed as Δ f(ox) G o (±75)/Jmol −1 =−64230+6.97(T/K) . The decomposition temperature of SmRhO3 estimated from the extrapolation of electrochemical data is 1665 (±2) K in air and 1773 (±3) K in pure oxygen. Temperature-composition diagrams at constant oxygen pressures are constructed for the system Sm–Rh–O. Employing the thermodynamic data for SmRhO3 from emf measurement and auxiliary data for other phases from the literature, oxygen potential-composition phase diagram and 3-D chemical potential diagram for the system Sm–Rh–O at 1273 K are developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aoxides 3aoxygen 3atemperature1 aGupta, Preeti1 aHan, Donglin1 aUda, Tetsuya0 tJournal of materials science.g2014 Apr., v. 49, no. 8 p.3135-3145dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-014-8014-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002300172245008800195300001600283520118500299592002801484650001101512650001401523650001401537650001401551650001901565650001101584650003001595650001501625650001801640650001601658650001701674650001501691650002001706650002901726650002701755650003401782650002001816650004001836650002401876650004101900650005901941651001702000651001502017651001302032651001502045651001302060700001602073700001702089700002202106773008302128856008902211852000902300655001202309IND4466420820221121192231.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446642082DNAL7 a214212502pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodenburg, Lisa A.10aSource apportionment of polychlorinated biphenyls in the New York/New Jersey Harbor  ap. 792-798.  aThe New York/New Jersey Harbor (also known as the Hudson River Estuary) is heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) arising in part from inputs from the Upper Hudson River, which is a Superfund site containing historical PCB contamination, and also due to inputs from the New York City metropolitan area. The Contamination Assessment and Reduction Project (CARP) measured PCBs and other contaminants in ambient water samples collected throughout the Harbor region during 1998–2001. In order to investigate the sources of PCBs to the NY/NJ Harbor, this data base of PCB concentrations was analyzed using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). This analysis resolved seven factors that are thought to be associated with sources such as the Upper Hudson River, storm water runoff, combined sewer overflows (CSOs), and wastewater effluents. The PMF model also produced a factor that appears to be related to sites contaminated with Aroclor 1260. To the extent that the NY/NJ Harbor is typical of urbanized estuaries throughout the United States, these results suggest that storm water runoff is probably a significant source of PCBs to surface waters in urban areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adatabases 3aeffluents 3aestuaries 3ahistoric sites 3amodels 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3astormwater 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awastewater 3awater pollution 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aOceans and Seas 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysis 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aHudson River 3aNew Jersey 3aNew York 0aNew Jersey 0aNew York1 aDu, Songyan1 aXiao, Baohua1 aFennell, Donna E.0 tChemosphere.g2011 Apr., v. 83, no. 6 p.792-798dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245006300168300001600231520029600247592002800543650001200571650001500583650001100598650001600609650001500625651001000640653001400650653001600664653001800680653001300698700001900711700002400730773012900754856008500883852000900968655001200977IND60125480020221120153322.0151103e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012548002DNAL7 a10.1639/0007-2745-115.3.4022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Santosh10aStictis palniense (Stictidaceae), a new species from India  ap. 402-405.  aStictis palniense is described as new to science from sub-tropical region of Western Ghats in southern India.

Hemiscorpius lepturus envenomation is recognized as a serious health concern in tropical regions. So far, there is no preventive procedure, and the main focus is on treatment of victims with an antiserum purified from hyper-immunized horses. Although antisera can neutralize the venom, they, in some cases, lead to anaphylactic shock and even death. Selection of peptides mimicking antigenic and immunogenic epitopes of toxins from random peptide libraries is a novel approach for the development of recombinant toxins and poly-epitopic vaccine. To achieve this aim, a phage display peptide library and three rounds of biopanning were performed on immobilized antibodies (IgGs) purified from the sera of hyper-immunized horses. The results show that the highest binding of the phage to immobilized horse antibodies occurred in the third round of biopanning. Over 125 individual clones carrying mimotopes of Hemiscorpius lepturus toxins were selected and subjected for sequencing. The sequencing results identified unique peptides mimicking the antigenic and immunogenic epitopes of Hemiscorpius lepturus toxins. The results of this study provide a basis for further studies and the development of a putative epitopic vaccine and a recombinant toxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScorpiones 3aanaphylaxis 3aantibodies 3aantiserum 3abacteriophages 3abioactive compounds 3aclones 3adeath 3aepitopes 3ahorses 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aneutralization 3apeptide libraries 3arecombinant vaccines 3atoxins 3atropics 3avenoms 0aHemiscorpius lepturus 0aEpitope mapping 0aPhage display peptide library 0aEpitopic vaccine 0aEDTA 0aEthylenediaminetetraacetic acid 0aIgG 0aimmunoglobulin G 0aPh.D 0aphage display 0aELISA 0aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 0aPEG 0aPolyethylene glycol1 aJamnani, Fatemeh Rahimi1 aBehdani, Mahdi1 aHabibi-Anbouhi, Mahdi1 aYardehnavi, Najmeh1 aShahbazzadeh, Delavar1 aKazemi-Lomedasht, Fatemeh0 tToxicon.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2016.11.2473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008800173300001600261520120000277592002801477650000801505650002301513650002201536650002501558650001501583650000901598650002601607700002101633700002301654700001601677700002001693700002501713700003101738700002001769700002401789700002201813773012901835856008401964990002302048852000902071655001202080IND60090021120221120101636.0141110e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009002112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbamcr.2010.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaxter, Shannon A.10aRegulation of the lymphatic endothelial cell cycle by the PROX1 homeodomain protein  ap. 201-212.  aThe homeobox transcription factor PROX1 is essential for the development and maintenance of lymphatic vasculature. How PROX1 regulates lymphatic endothelial cell fate remains undefined. PROX1 has been shown to upregulate the expression of Cyclin E, which mediates the G₁ to S transition of the cell cycle. Here we demonstrate that PROX1 activates the mouse Cyclin E1 (Ccne1) promoter via two proximal E2F-binding sites. We have determined that the N-terminal region of PROX1 is sufficient to activate a 1-kb Ccne1 promoter, whereas the homeodomain is dispensable for activation. We have identified that the Prospero domain 1 (PD1) is required for the nuclear localization of PROX1. Our comparison of two DNA-binding-deficient constructs of PROX1 showed a cell-type-specific difference between these two proteins in both their localization and function. We demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of PROX1 in lymphatic endothelial cells decreases progression from G₁ to S phase of the cell cycle. We conclude that PROX1 activates the Ccne1 promoter independent of DNA binding, and our results illustrate a novel role for PROX1 in the regulation of lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acell proliferation 3aendothelial cells 3ahomeodomain proteins 3ainterphase 3amice 3atranscription factors1 aCheung, David Y.1 aBocangel, Patricia1 aKim, Hae K.1 aHerbert, Krista1 aDouville, Josette M.1 aJangamreddy, Jaganmohan R.1 aZhang, Shunzhen1 aEisenstat, David D.1 aWigle, Jeffrey T.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.

In agreement with the NMR studies, the present electrospray ionization mass spectrometric experiments, as well as supporting electrical conductivity measurements, indicate that LiCuMe₂·LiCN reacts with a series of alkyl halides RX. The resulting Li⁺Me₂CuR(CN)⁻ intermediates then afford the observable Me₃CuR– tetraalkylcuprate anions upon Me/CN exchanges with added MeLi. In contrast, the reactions of LiCuMe₂·LiCN with neopentyl iodide and various aryl halides give rise to halogen–copper exchanges. Concentration- and solvent-dependent studies suggest that lithium tetraalkylcuprates are not fully dissociated in ethereal solvents, but partly form Li⁺Me₃CuR– contact ion pairs and presumably also triple ions LiMe₆Cu₂R₂–. According to theoretical calculations, these triple ions consist of two square-planar Me₃CuR– subunits binding to a central Li⁺ ion. Upon fragmentation in the gas phase, the mass-selected Me₃CuR– anions undergo reductive elimination, yielding both the cross-coupling products MeR and the homocoupling product Me₂. The branching between these two fragmentation channels markedly depends on the nature of the alkyl substituent R. The triple ions LiMe₆Cu₂R₂– (as well as their mixed analogues LiMe₆Cu₂R(R′)⁻) also afford both cross-coupling and homocoupling products upon fragmentation, but strongly favor the former. On the basis of theoretical calculations, we rationalize this prevalence of cross-coupling by the preferential interaction of the central Li⁺ ion of the triple ions with two Me groups of each Me₃CuR– subunit, which thereby effectively blocks the homocoupling channel. Our results thus show how a Li⁺ counterion can alter the reactivity of an organocopper species at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aelectrical conductivity 3agases 3aiodides 3aionization 3alithium 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents1 aBrand, Harald1 aKoszinowski, Konrad0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Jan. 11, v. 134, no. 1 p.613-622dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja209433j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245014200209300001600351506007600367520110000443592002801543506003701571650000801608650001501616650001801631650002101649650000901670650002801679650002101707700002401728700001701752700002201769700001701791700001301808700001901821700002401840700001401864700001701878700001201895700001401907773008301921856008402004852000902088655001202097IND60553984920221207104249.0161023e20150402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055398492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2015.02.0242doi7 aPMC44151112pmcid7 a258186482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Wenxia10aDifferential Phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs Regulates the Interplay between End-Processing and End-Ligation during Nonhomologous End-Joining  ap. 172-185.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a major DNA double-strand break repair pathway that is conserved in eukaryotes. In vertebrates, NHEJ further acquires end-processing capacities (e.g., hairpin opening) in addition to direct end-ligation. The catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) is a vertebrate-specific NHEJ factor that can be autophosphorylated or transphosphorylated by ATM kinase. Using a mouse model expressing a kinase-dead (KD) DNA-PKcs protein, we show that ATM-mediated transphosphorylation of DNA-PKcs regulates end-processing at the level of Artemis recruitment, while strict autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is necessary to relieve the physical blockage on end-ligation imposed by the DNA-PKcs protein itself. Accordingly, DNA-PKcsKD/KD mice and cells show severe end-ligation defects and p53- and Ku-dependent embryonic lethality, but open hairpin-sealed ends normally in the presence of ATM kinase activity. Together, our findings identify DNA-PKcs as the molecular switch that coordinates end-processing and end-ligation at the DNA ends through differential phosphorylations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aanimal models 3aeukaryotic cells 3amice 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aprotein subunits1 aCrowe, Jennifer L.1 aLiu, Xiangyu1 aNakajima, Satoshi1 aWang, Yunyue1 aLi, Chen1 aLee, Brian J.,1 aDuBois, Richard L.,1 aLiu, Chao1 aYu, Xiaochun1 aLan, Li1 aZha, Shan0 tMolecular cell.g2015 Apr. 02, v. 58 p.172-185dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2015.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245011300180300001800293500001900311520220200330592002802532650001502560650001302575650000902588650001002597650001602607650001702623650001402640650000702654650001402661650001902675650002902694650002402723650002102747650001902768650002302787650001402810650001302824650001902837700002502856700003002881700002302911773013902934856008203073852000903155655001203164IND60710482420221119014049.0200910e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071048242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-020-02677-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzewczuk-Karpisz, Katarzyna10aChromium(VI) reduction and accumulation on the kaolinite surface in the presence of cationic soil flocculant  ap. 3688-3697.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: Heavy metal soluble forms pose a threat to plants, soil microflora, and microfauna. To limit their toxicity and mobility, various immobilizing additives are being developed. The main aim of the study was to determine the influence of soil flocculant (cationic polyacrylamide (CtPAM)) on the hexavalent chromium ion reduction and accumulation on the kaolinite surface. In this way, the efficiency of the selected polymer conditioner in the soil remediation was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The adsorbed amounts of Cr(VI) and CtPAM on the kaolinite surface was determined spectrophotometrically (spectrophotometer UV/Vis) using specific indicators. The structure of electrical double layer formed on the kaolinite surface in the mixed system of cationic polyacrylamide and Cr(VI) ions was described based on the adsorptive measurements, zeta potential measurements, as well as potentiometric titration. The kaolinite aggregation in the presence of CtPAM and/or Cr(VI) ions was determined spectrophotometrically and proved using SEM microscopy. The reduction process of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) occurring in the adsorption layer was determined by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The obtained results indicated that cationic polyacrylamide contributes to Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) form in the kaolinite suspension. This heavy metal ions are strongly adsorbed by the applied clay mineral, especially at pH 5 (then the Cr(VI)-adsorbed amount equals 5.42 mg/g). The CtPAM addition favors the Cr(VI) ion immobilization on the kaolinite surface. In the conditioner presence, the heavy metal-adsorbed amount is even at 7.34 mg/g. The adsorption of CtPAM and chromium(VI) ions induces changes in the kaolinite surface charge density and electrokinetic potential. What is more, both substances favors the kaolinite aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: Cationic polyacrylamide may be considered a substance reducing the toxicity of chromium(VI) ions in the natural environment and decreasing their availability for soil organisms. It can improve the soil structure (by stimulating aggregation) and reduce environment pollution with heavy metals simultaneously.

The enzyme is stable in the pH range between 8.0 and 11.0 and thus alkali-stable and moderately thermostable with T₁/₂ values of 40 ± 1, 15 ± 1, and 8 ± 0.5 min at 60, 70, and 80 °C, respectively. Activation energy for irreversible inactivation “E d ” of carbonic anhydrase is 67.119 kJ mol⁻¹. The enzyme is stable in the presence of various flue gas contaminants such as SO₃ ²⁻,SO₄ ²⁻, and NO₃ ⁻ and cations Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, Ca²⁺, and Ba²⁺. Fluorescence studies in the presence of N-bromosuccinimide and fluorescence quenching using KI and acrylamide revealed the importance of tryptophan residues in maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme. ApCA is more efficient than the commercially available bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) in CO₂ sequestration. The enzyme was successfully used in biomineralization of CO₂ from flue gas. Replacement of active site Zn²⁺ with Mn²⁺ enabled ApCA to function as a peroxidase which exhibited alkali-stability and moderate thermostability like ApCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aactivation energy 3aactive sites 3abacteria 3abarium 3abiocatalysts 3abiomimetics 3abiomineralization 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acations 3acattle 3aflue gas 3afluorescence 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amolecular weight 3anitrates 3apH 3aperoxidase 3athermal stability 3atryptophan 3azinc1 aSatyanarayana, T.,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Apr., v. 24, no. 11 p.10869-10884dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8739-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245007800156300001400234520104100248592002801289650001401317650001101331650001501342650002901357650002201386650001501408650001201423650002501435650001601460651001001476653003001486653001201516653001501528653003301543700001201576700001201588700001301600773013201613856007701745852000901822655001201831IND60480954020221119114943.0200226e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048095402DNAL7 a10.3920/WMJ2011.13362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, L.10aRapid determination of patulin in medicinal hawthorn fruits by HPLC-MS/MS  ap. 31-36.  aAn HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the determination of patulin (PAT) in dried medicinal hawthorn fruit, a well-known traditional medicine in China. Liquid-liquid extraction was applied in the sample preparation. Multiple reaction monitoring was performed at m/z 153/109 for PAT and m/z 317/273 for internal standard zearalenone in the negative ion mode with electrospray ionisation source. Good linearity was achieved when spiked PAT concentrations were in the range of 10-500 μg/kg, with coefficient being 0.9993. The limit of quantitation was 10 μg/kg. The extraction recoveries for the spiked PAT at concentrations of 20, 100 and 400 μg/kg were 64.5%, 64.6% and 63.9%, respectively, with relative standard deviations of 1.25%, 2.82% and 2.61%. The intra-day and inter-day precision were in the range of 2.2-9.6% and 5.9-6.4%. This rapid, sensitive and reliable method was applied in 25 batches of medicinal hawthorn fruit, in which PAT was detected in 8 batches, including those that were baked or charred.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrataegus 3afruits 3aionization 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3apatulin 3atraditional medicine 3azearalenone 3aChina 0amedicinal hawthorn fruits 0apatulin 0aHPLC-MS/MS 0atraditional Chinese medicine1 aGao, Y.1 aLiu, D.1 aYang, M.0 tWorld mycotoxin journal.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 5, no. 1 p.31-36dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:jnl4395724x1875-07967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3920/WMJ2011.13363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013300169500001900302520099600321592002801317650002801345650002501373650002001398650001901418650001601437650001701453650001601470650001601486650001701502650002101519650002201540653002401562653002901586653002501615653003201640653000801672653000801680653001101688653000901699653000701708653000801715653000901723653001101732653000801743653001801751653000701769653000701776653000801783653001301791653000801804653000801812653000801820653000701828653000901835653001001844700002701854700002501881700002401906700006501930773011201995856008202107852000902189655001202198IND60705686120221119055431.0201108e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070568612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2020.1041372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotue, Prapassorn10aCratoxylum Formosum extract exhibits antihypertensive effects via suppressing the renin-angiotensin cascade in hypertensive rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of Cratoxylum Formosum (CF) extract on blood pressure and changes in vascular structure and function in hypertensive rats was studied.

Historical movement of the disease suggests that temperature has been a critical factor in driving the susceptibility of lobsters to this disease. Here, juvenile lobsters were held in the laboratory at 10°C, 15°C, or 20°C for up to 1,021 days. Survival, growth, and shell disease were tracked throughout, and a separate experiment was conducted to assess the rate at which dietary white lobsters deposited pigment to the cuticle at the different temperatures. In the laboratory, shell disease was tracked as an initial “spot,” the melanization of the cuticle in response to the bacterial ingress, or, as it progressed, a lesion, which was a visible erosion of the shell. The length of the molt cycle (number of days from one molt to the next consecutive molt) was inversely associated with temperature. Average growth (increase in weight and carapace length per molt) at 10°C and 15°C was equivalent and higher than at 20°C, whereas shell disease was greatest at the intermediate temperature. The amount of initial melanization responses to bacteria (spots) was similar across temperatures, but the number of lesions was greatest at 15°C. This is likely a result of the conditions that allow for a combination of longer molt cycles and active bacterial growth, which allowed the disease to progress to the more advanced lesioned state. At the highest temperature, lobsters molted the compromised shell before severe lesion formation could occur. No gross differences in shell structure were observed at the different temperatures. The lack of a linear relationship between shell disease and temperature does not discount temperature as a critical factor in the onset of this disease in lobsters, but signifies that additional factors are important and the disease is complicated and multifactorial in nature. The continued use of a laboratory model system to study this disease further is important to be able to control the multitude of complicating factors appropriately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHomarus americanus 3abacteria 3aepizootic diseases 3afisheries 3ajuveniles 3alobsters 3amelanization 3amicrobial growth 3amolting 3atemperature 0aAmerican lobster 0aHomarus americanus 0aastaxanthin 0aAquimarina 0abacteria 0ahost susceptibility 0alaboratory model 0ashell disease 0astress1 aMetzler, Anita0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2012 June, v. 31, no. 2 p.533-541dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.031.02133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245010900173520184300282592002802125650002502153650002002178650001802198650001902216650002302235650002502258650001502283650001702298650002002315650001102335650002302346650001402369650001402383650001402397650003902411650001302450650001302463650001602476650001102492651001102503651001302514653001302527653001502540653000902555653001602564653002002580700001902600700002002619700002102639700002502660773012102685856008202806852000902888655001202897IND60690699920221120065318.0200427e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069069992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.1087432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aModahl, Cassandra M.10aInterspecific and intraspecific venom enzymatic variation among cobras (Naja sp. and Ophiophagus hannah)  aThe genera Ophiophagus and Naja comprise part of a clade of snakes referred to as cobras, dangerously venomous front-fanged snakes in the family Elapidae responsible for significant human mortality and morbidity throughout Asia and Africa. We evaluated venom enzyme variation for eleven cobra species and three N. kaouthia populations using SDS-PAGE venom fingerprinting and numerous enzyme assays. Acetylcholinesterase and PLA₂ activities were the most variable between species, and PLA₂ activity was significantly different between Malaysian and Thailand N. kaouthia populations. Venom metalloproteinase activity was low and significantly different among most species, but levels were identical for N. kaouthia populations; minor variation in venom L-amino acid oxidase and phosphodiesterase activities were seen between cobra species. Naja siamensis venom lacked the α-fibrinogenolytic activity common to other cobra venoms. In addition, venom from N. siamensis had no detectable metalloproteinase activity and exhibited an SDS-PAGE profile with reduced abundance of higher mass proteins. Venom profiles from spitting cobras (N. siamensis, N. pallida, and N. mossambica) exhibited similar reductions in higher mass proteins, suggesting the evolution of venoms of reduced complexity and decreased enzymatic activity among spitting cobras. Generally, the venom proteomes of cobras show highly abundant three-finger toxin diversity, followed by large quantities of PLA₂s. However, PLA₂ bands and activity were very reduced for N. haje, N. annulifera and N. nivea. Venom compositionalenzy analysis provides insight into the evolution, diversification and distribution of different venom phenotypes that complements venomic data, and this information is critical for the development of effective antivenoms and snakebite treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-amino-acid oxidase 3aNaja annulifera 3aNaja kaouthia 3aNaja siamensis 3aOphiophagus hannah 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aantivenoms 3acobra venoms 3aenzyme activity 3ahumans 3ametalloproteinases 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aphenotype 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3asnake bites 3asnakes 3aAfrica 3aThailand 0aElapidae 0aEnzymology 0aNaja 0aOphiophagus 0aVenom variation1 aRoointan, Amir1 aRogers, Jessica1 aCurrier, Katelyn1 aMackessy, Stephen P.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2020 June, v. 232 p.108743-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.1087433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011400162300001800276520107900294592002801373650001101401650002301412650002801435650001101463650002201474650001301496700001501509700002301524773011801547856007501665852000901740655001201749IND60550513120221123042106.0160911e20150220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055051312DNAL7 a10.1021/jo502693b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamanta, Debabrata10aNonstatistical Dynamics in the Thermal C2–C6/Diels–Alder Cyclization of Enyne-Allenes: Effect of Topology  ap. 2174-2181.  aThe thermal C²–C⁶ (Schmittel) cyclization of an enyne-allene with two aryl rings at the allene terminus experimentally leads to three formal Diels–Alder (DA) cycloaddition products, two of which (involving the dimethylamino phenyl unit) are shown to form in a nonstatistical process. DFT computations on the reaction paths reveal that the two aryl rings (Ph vs PhNMe₂) do not interact in a dynamic manner as their minimum energy pathways (MEPs) are separated by a large barrier. The preferential formation of the more-hindered DA product 8 (ortho to the dimethylamino group) over the less-hindered product 9 (para to the dimethylamino group), despite the higher energy TS for 8, suggests the occurrence of nonstatistical dynamics in the cyclization onto the dimethylamino phenyl unit, though. Potential energy surface (PES) computations indicate that the large amount of nonstatistical dynamics (97%) arises from facile IRC dynamics (left picture) that is compared with the non-IRC dynamics of a related system (∼76%, right picture, J.

However, if the ductus arteriosus is not closed and maintained as the open state even after 72 h of the birth, this is called a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Intravenous indomethacin is the conventional treatment for PDA in immature infants, but remains controversial in mature infants. The purpose of this study was to compare intravenous indomethacin and oral ibuprofen with regard to efficacy and safety for treatment of PDA. 78 neonates treated for PDA were included and classified into immature (n = 49) and mature (n = 29) groups. Ductal closure occurred in immature infants treated with indomethacin (74.1%) and ibuprofen (90.9%). Ductal closure occurred in mature infants treated with indomethacin (66.7%) and ibuprofen (92.9%). Platelet counts were increased in immature infants treated with ibuprofen (p = 0.027). Hyponatremia occurred in immature infants treated with ibuprofen (p = 0.002) and in both groups of mature infants (p = 0.001 for both groups). Serum creatinine values were lowered in mature infants treated with ibuprofen (p = 0.032). Bleeding occurred in 5 immature infants treated with indomethacin. Administration of furosemide for urine output was more frequent in the mature groups than in the immature group. In conclusion, oral ibuprofen was as effective as intravenous indomethacin in the immature groups and more effective in the mature groups. Adverse effects of oral ibuprofen were less severe than intravenous indomethacin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKoreans 3aadverse effects 3aaorta 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3aductus arteriosus 3afurosemide 3ahemorrhage 3ahyponatremia 3aibuprofen 3aindomethacin 3aintravenous injection 3aneonates 3apatent ductus arteriosus 3apulmonary artery 3aurine1 aLee, Ok Sang1 aLim, Sung Cil0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2012 Sept., v. 35, no. 9 p.1673-1683dSpringer-Verlagx0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12272-012-0919-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245007700179300001400256520076000270592002801030650001701058650002401075650001901099650001301118650002501131650001701156650001901173650003101192650002201223700002401245773010901269856008801378852000901466655001201475IND60085373220221123022923.0141101e20120801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008537322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2012.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrusova, Valeriya M.10aFluorescence study on aggregated lysozyme and lipid bilayer interactions  ap. 51-55.  aFluorescent probes 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), pyrene, 4-dimethylaminochalcone (DMC) and 4-p-(dimethylaminostyryl)-1-dodecylpyridinium (DSP-12) have been utilized to monitor the impact of lysozyme (Lz) oligomers on physicochemical properties of phosphatidylcholine/cardiolipin (PC/CL) membranes.

Hydrophobic interactions were found to control the binding of Lz oligomers to the lipid bilayer.

Ten pregnancies were examined every 2 weeks from 120 to 300 days of gestation, then weekly until parturition. Five more pregnancies were evaluated weekly during the last 4 weeks prepartum. Maternal weight and heart rate were recorded. Indicators of fetal well-being (mean, minimum, and maximum fetal heart rate, fetal movement, and tone), development (size of the aorta, thorax, abdomen, stomach, kidney, head, eye orbit, radius, and umbilical vessels), and uterine environment (combined thickness of the uterus and placenta, depth and character of allantoic and amnionic fluids) were assessed using transabdominal ultrasound. Reference values and fetal growth curves were created. Weights of the cria, fetal membranes, and dam at parturition were associated with parameters of fetal growth. Mean (R2 = 0.65), minimum (R2 = 0.57), and maximum (R2 = 0.64) fetal heart rate decreased from midgestation to term (P < 0.0001). Fetal activity also decreased as pregnancy advanced (P < 0.0001). Fetal presentation was anterior in all fetuses by 10 months. Increases in depth of allantoic (R2 = 0.11) and amniotic (R2 = 0.02) fluid, combined thickness of the uterus and placenta (R2 = 0.31), and maternal weight (R2 = 0.09) were significantly but poorly associated with gestation length. All parameters of fetal development were positively associated with gestational age (P < 0.0001). Size of the aorta (R2 = 0.88), abdomen (R2 = 0.87), kidney (R2 = 0.83), and thorax (R2 = 0.82) provided the best estimates of gestational age. Birth weight was associated with the size of the aorta (R2 = 0.71), kidney (R2 = 0.61), and radius (R2 = 0.73) (P < 0.05). This information might be of value in the assessment of fetal well-being and development in alpacas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3aalpacas 3aaorta 3abirth weight 3aextraembryonic membranes 3aeyes 3afetal development 3agestational age 3ahead 3aheart rate 3akidneys 3anormal values 3aparturition 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3astomach 3athorax 3aultrasonography 3auterus 2aAnimals 2aCamelids, New Worldxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFetal Development 2aPregnancy 2aUltrasonography, Prenatalxveterinary 0aAlpaca 0aFetus 0aFetal well-being 0aDevelopment 0aGrowth 0aUltrasound1 aJones, M.1 aAnderson, D.E.1 aLarson, R.0 tTheriogenology.g2013 June, v. 79, no. 9 p.1236-1246dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2013.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245006400171300001400235520124300249592002801492650001301520650001401533650005001547650001501597650001101612650002501623651002201648651002501670653001401695653003801709653002201747653003701769653001001806700001701816700002001833700001601853700002001869773010301889856008601992852000902078655001202087IND60606831020221120033856.0180730e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060683102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2015.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProestakis, E.10aLightning activity and aerosols in the Mediterranean region  ap. 66-75.  aIn the framework of this study, the effect of aerosols on lightning activity has been investigated for the first time over the broader Mediterranean Sea. Atmospheric optical depth data retrieved by MODIS on board Aqua satellite and cloud to ground lightning activity data provided by ZEUS network operated by the National Observatory of Athens were analyzed for a time period spanning from 01/01/2005 up to 31/12/2013. The results indicate the importance of aerosols in lightning modulation. The mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) values of the days with lightning activity were found to be higher than the mean seasonal AOD in 90% of the under study domain. Furthermore, the increasing rate of lightning activity with increasing aerosol loading was found to be more pronounced during summertime and for AOD values up to 0.4. Additionally, the spatial analysis showed that the percentage of days with lightning activity during summertime is increasing with increasing AOD. Finally, time series showed similar temporal behavior between AOD seasonal anomalies and days with lightning activity differences. Both the spatial and temporal analysis showed that lightning activity is correlated to AOD, a characteristic consistent for all seasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3alightning 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3asatellites 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3aMediterranean Sea 3aMediterranean region 0aLightning 0aAerosol atmospheric optical depth 0aMediterranean Sea 0aZEUS lightning detection network 0aMODIS1 aKazadzis, S.1 aLagouvardos, K.1 aKotroni, V.1 aKazantzidis, A.0 tAtmospheric research.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 170 p.66-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2015.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015100165300001800316500001900334520178400353592002802137650001802165650001202183650002902195650001502224650001602239650001902255650001702274650001702291650001702308650001502325650002602340700002202366700006102388773013902449856008202588852000902670655001202679IND60710482720221119014147.0200910e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071048272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-020-02687-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolkin, Shai10aHumic acid, dextran, and valeric acid representing macromolecules similar to compounds prevailing in treated wastewater induce soil hydrophobicity  ap. 3548-3556.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPURPOSE: Organic compounds originating from treated wastewater and soil texture have been reported to be the dominant factors influencing soil hydrophobicity. It is the aim of this investigation to elaborate the role of humic acid, dextran, and valeric acid, representing dissolved organic matter, polysaccharides, and fatty acids, respectively, as well as imitating their activity in inducing soil sub-critical water repellency induced by treated wastewater irrigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The relationships between three model compounds imitating fractions of dissolved organic matter commonly found in treated wastewater, soil texture in relation to water repellency, were investigated. Three types of organic molecules, five soil mixtures with different specific surface areas, and three different organic compounds, as well as a mixture of the three, were tested. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: After 14–15 of wetting and drying cycles, low levels (sub-critical hydrophobicity) of water repellency developed in all soil mixtures were subjected to applications of several solutions of organic compounds, in comparison with a freshwater control. The highest degree of water repellency was exhibited by the soil with the lowest clay content (lowest specific surface area) and it decreased with increasing clay content (increasing specific surface area). CONCLUSIONS: The order of intensity of sub-critical water repellency levels induced by the organic compounds was consistent, yet independent of soil texture. However, soil texture exhibited large influence on soil hydrophobicity in response to the various organic chemicals. Humic acid, the closest in structure to organic matter prevailing in treated wastewater, exhibited the largest effect in inducing soil hydrophobicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3adextran 3adissolved organic matter 3afreshwater 3ahumic acids 3ahydrophobicity 3asoil texture 3asurface area 3avaleric acid 3awastewater 3awastewater irrigation1 aChen, Y.q(Yona),1 aTarchitzky, Jorge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6885-05760 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2020 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.3548-3556dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02687-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014400175300001600319520205300335592002802388650002102416650002102437650001302458650002102471650002502492650001202517650002602529650001302555650001302568650001302581650001402594650001902608650001302627650001502640653002102655653002802676653003802704653002702742653002202769700005902791700002402850700001902874700002502893773009702918856008503015852000903100655001203109IND60621644820221120175656.0210121e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062164482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.10.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorsino, Santo Fabio10aComparison between kinetics of autochthonous marine bacteria in activated sludge and granular sludge systems at different salinity and SRTs  ap. 425-437.  aBiological nutrient removal performances and kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass in forms of activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge were investigated under different salinity and sludge retention time (SRT). Both the biomasses, cultivated from a fish-canning wastewater, were subjected to stepwise increases in salinity (+2 gNaCl L⁻¹), from 30 gNaCl L⁻¹ up to 50 gNaCl L⁻¹ with the aim to evaluate the maximum potential in withstanding salinity by the autochthonous marine biomass. Microbial marine species belonging to the genus of Cryomorphaceae and of Rhodobacteraceae were found dominant in both the systems at the maximum salinity tested (50 gNaCl L⁻¹). The organic carbon was removed with a yield of approximately 98%, irrespective of the salinity. Similarly, nitrogen removal occurred via nitritation-denitritation and was not affected by salinity. The ammonium utilization rate and the nitrite utilization rate were approximately of 3.60 mgNH₄-N gVSS⁻¹h⁻¹ and 10.0 mgNO₂-N gVSS⁻¹h⁻¹, respectively, indicating a high activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. The granulation process did not provide significant improvements in the nutrients removal process likely due to the stepwise salinity increase strategy. Biomass activity and performances resulted affected by long SRT (27 days) due to salt accumulation within the activated sludge flocs and granules. In contrast, a lower SRT (14 days) favoured the discharge of the granules and flocs with higher inert content, thereby enhancing the biomass renewing.The obtained results demonstrated that the use of autochthonous-halophilic bacteria represents a valuable solution for the treatment of high-strength carbon and nitrogen saline wastewater in a wide range of salinity. Besides, the stepwise increase in salinity and the operation at low SRT enabled high metabolic activity and to avoid excessive accumulation of salt within the biomass aggregates, limiting their physical destructuration due to the increase in loosely-bound exopolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacteraceae 3aactivated sludge 3aammonium 3aaquatic bacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomass 3adenitrifying bacteria 3agranules 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic carbon 3asalinity 3awastewater 0aActivated sludge 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aAutochthonous-halophilic bacteria 0aShortcut nitrification 0aSaline wastewater1 aCapodici, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0027-61921 aDi Pippo, Francesca1 aTandoi, Valter1 aTorregrossa, Michele0 tWater research.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 148 p.425-437dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.10.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245012500176520088500301592002801186650001301214650001901227650001901246653002001265653002401285653002201309653002601331700002801357773009401385856008201479852000901561655001201570IND60731339820221119124754.0210423e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073133982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1320832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosseini, Mahdiyeh-Sadat10aPhenyl sulfonic acid functionalized graphene-based materials: Synthetic approaches and applications in organic reactions  aCatalysts are one of the essential elements in the synthesis of organic chemicals.

The aim of the present study was to test the effect of a 2-week functional food intervention on the gut microbiota composition in prediabetic individuals. A randomized double-blind, cross-over trial was conducted on prediabetic subjects. Fifteen volunteers were provided products made of: (i) 50% taro flour + 50% wheat flour; (ii) these products and the probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506; or (iii) these products with beetroot adsorbed for a period of 2 weeks with 2 weeks wash-out in between. Stool and blood samples were taken at each baseline and after each of the interventions. The gut microbiota composition was evaluated by sequencing the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and anthropometric measures were recorded. The total weight loss over the entire period ranged from 0.5 to 11 kg. The next-generation sequencing showed a highly personalized microbiota composition. In the principal coordinate analyses, the samples of each individual clustered closer together than the samples of each treatment. For six individuals, the samples clustered closely together, indicating a stable microbiota. For nine individuals, the microbiota was less resilient and, depending on the intervention, the beta-diversity transiently differed greatly only to return to the composition close to the baseline during the wash-out. The statistical analyses showed that 202 of the total 304 taxa were significantly different between the participants. Only Butyricimonas could be correlated with taro ingestion. The results of the study show that the highly variable interindividual variation observed in the gut microbiota of the participants clouded any gut microbiota modulation that might be present due to the functional food interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeets 3ablood 3across-over studies 3afunctional foods 3agenes 3aingestion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aprobiotics 3aspecies diversity 3ataro 3aweight loss 3awheat flour1 aSimatupang, Abraham 1 aKusumo, Pratiwi D.1 aWaspodo, Priyo 1 aVerbruggen, Sanne 1 aVerhoeven, Jessica 1 aVenema, Koen 0 tNutrients.g2022 Feb. 13, v. 14, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu140407813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245015400204300001800358500002000376520191200396592002802308596005102336596005902387596005902446596005302505650002502558650001402583650002002597650002902617650003302646650001302679700001502692700001202707700001302719700001402732700006002746773011202806856008002918852000902998655001203007IND60781787920221118042836.0220702e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078178792DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.134372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Xiao‐yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6646-825310aProtein–protein interaction network of E. coli K‐12 has significant high‐dimensional cavities: new insights from algebraic topological studies  ap. 1406-1418.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs a model system, Escherichia coli has been used to study various life processes. A dramatic paradigm shift has occurred in recent years, with the study of single proteins moving toward the study of dynamically interacting proteins, especially protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, despite the importance of PPI networks, little is known about the intrinsic nature of the network structure, especially high‐dimensional topological properties. By introducing general hypergeometric distribution, we reconstruct a statistically reliable combined PPI network of E. coli (E. coli‐PPI‐Network) from several datasets. Unlike traditional graph analysis, algebraic topology was introduced to analyze the topological structures of the E. coli‐PPI‐Network, including high‐dimensional cavities and cycles. Random networks with the same node and edge number (RandomNet) or scale‐free networks with the same degree distribution (RandomNet‐SameDD) were produced as controls. We discovered that the E. coli‐PPI‐Network had special algebraic typological structures, exhibiting more high‐dimensional cavities and cycles, compared to RandomNets or, importantly, RandomNet‐SameDD. Based on these results, we defined degree of involved q‐dimensional cycles of proteins (q‐DCₚᵣₒₜₑᵢₙ) in the network, a novel concept that relies on the integral structure of the network and is different from traditional node degree or hubs. Finally, top proteins ranked by their 1‐DCₚᵣₒₜₑᵢₙ were identified (such as gmhB, rpoA, rplB, rpsF and yfgB). In conclusion, by introducing mathematical and computer technologies, we discovered novel algebraic topological properties of the E. coli‐PPI‐Network, which has special high‐dimensional cavities and cycles, and thereby revealed certain intrinsic rules of information flow underlining bacteria biology.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018JSTS05cFourth Military Medical University  a81972359cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a82002187cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2022JQ‐813cShaanxi Natural Science Foundation 3aEscherichia coli K12 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aprobability distribution 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atopology1 aChen, Zhou1 aHu, Yue1 aNie, Dan1 aZhao, Hui1 aMao, Xing‐gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8505-19040 tFEBS Open Bio.g2022 July, v. 12, no. 7 p.1406-1418dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.134373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009900169300001600268520180100284592002802085650001302113650001502126650001202141650001502153650001302168650001902181650001302200650002402213650001302237650001702250650001502267650002302282650001302305650001702318651001002335653001902345653001202364653002502376653001002401653001502411700002102426700001602447700001302463700001202476773010502488856008602593852000902679655001202688IND60606831120221120033908.0180730e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060683112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2015.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qianshan10aSpatial distribution of aerosol hygroscopicity and its effect on PM2.5 retrieval in East China  ap. 161-167.  aThe hygroscopic properties of aerosol particles have strong impact on climate as well as visibility in polluted areas. Understanding of the scattering enhancement due to water uptake is of great importance in linking dry aerosol measurements with relevant ambient measurements, especially for satellite retrievals. In this study, an observation-based algorithm combining meteorological data with the particulate matter (PM) measurement was introduced to estimate spatial distribution of indicators describing the integrated humidity effect in East China and the main factors impacting the hygroscopicity were explored. Investigation of 1year data indicates that the larger mass extinction efficiency αext values (>9.0m²/g) located in middle and northern Jiangsu Province, which might be caused by particulate organic material (POM) and sulfate aerosol from industries and human activities. The high level of POM in Jiangsu Province might also be responsible for the lower growth coefficient γ value in this region. For the inland junction provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui, a considerable higher hygroscopic growth region in East China might be attributed to more hygroscopic particles mainly comprised of inorganic salts (e.g., sulfates and nitrates) from several large-scale industrial districts distributed in this region. Validation shows good agreement of calculated PM2.5 mass concentrations with in situ measurements in most stations with correlative coefficients of over 0.85, even if several defective stations induced by station location or seasonal variation of aerosol properties in this region. This algorithm can be used for more accurate surface level PM2.5 retrieval from satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) with combination of the vertical correction for aerosol profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3aextinction 3ahumidity 3ahygroscopicity 3aindustry 3ameteorological data 3anitrates 3aparticulates 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asulfates 3awater uptake 3aChina 0aHygroscopicity 0aAerosol 0aSpatial distribution 0aPM2.5 0aEast China1 aZhou, Guangqiang1 aGeng, Fuhai1 aGao, Wei1 aYu, Wei0 tAtmospheric research.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 170 p.161-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2015.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245013300185300001800318520115300336592002801489650002601517650002301543650001101566650001401577650001101591650001101602650001901613650001101632650001801643650002001661650001501681650001001696650002901706650000901735650002101744650001101765650002201776650002301798650004101821651001901862651002201881651001901903651001001922700002801932700002301960700001801983700001802001773013602019856004802155852000902203655001202212IND50069972820221119205030.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006997282DNAL7 a235892392pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-1634-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNieto, Jose M.10aAcid mine drainage in the Iberian Pyrite Belt: 1. Hydrochemical characteristics and pollutant load of the Tinto and Odiel rivers  ap. 7509-7519.  aAcid mine drainage in the Iberian Pyrite Belt is probably the worst case in the world of surface water pollution associated with mining of sulphide mineral deposits. The Iberian Pyrite Belt is located in SW Iberian Peninsula, and it has been mined during the last 4,500 years. The central and eastern part of the Iberian Pyrite Belt is drained by the Tinto and Odiel rivers, which receive most of the acidic leachates from the mining areas. As a result, the main channels of the Tinto and Odiel rivers are very rich in metals and highly acidic until reaching the Atlantic Ocean. A significant amount of the pollutant load transported by these two rivers is delivered during the rainy season, as is usual in rivers of Mediterranean climate regions. Therefore, in order to have an accurate estimation of the pollutant loads transported by the Tinto and Odiel rivers, a systematic sampling on a weekly basis and a high temporal resolution sampling of floods events were both performed. Results obtained show that metal fluxes are strongly dependent on the study period, highlighting the importance of inter-annual studies involving dry and wet years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aacid mine drainage 3afloods 3aleachates 3ametals 3amining 3apollution load 3arivers 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3awet season 2aAcids 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aIron 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aMining 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSulfidesxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aIberian Peninsula 0aAtlantic Ocean 0aSpain1 aSarmiento, Aguasanta M.1 aCanovas, Carlos R.1 aOlias, Manuel1 aAyora, Carlos0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.7509-7519dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1634-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245019900177520103000376592002801406650001201434650001601446650001701462650001201479650001501491650002601506650001101532650001601543650001501559650001401574650001401588650001101602653002101613653002501634653002201659653002401681653001601705700002501721700002601746700002601772700002601798700002201824700003201846773009401878856008201972852000902054655001202063IND60731339920221119124249.0210423e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073133992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1320862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallinas-Indilí, Ricardo10aOne-pot synthesis of dihydropyridine carboxylic acids via functionalization of 3-((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)pyridines and an unusual hydration of alkynes: Molecular docking and antifungal activity  aActivation of 3-((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)pyridine with triflic anhydride followed by nucleophilic addition of bis(trimethylsili) ketene acetals and a unusual alkyne hydration allowed to obtain new series of 3-acetylated dihydropyridine acids 3a-h in a single step.

However, identifying these species and assessing their effects on the ecosystem (as a primary step for assigning to them an “engineering efficiency” property) is a challenging subject. Taking this into account, we present a methodology that enables assessing the effects of different organisms from the flora and insecta classes on arid ecosystems (characterized by patch-matrix pattern). Specifically, this methodology is based on allocating per each of the organisms (or group of them), a representative patch area in relation to their effect. Using this technique one can also estimate the effects of a given organism on its patch neighbors—the so called “hospitality value.” Organisms with low value are most likely to appear alone in their respective patches, whereas the ones with high values will encourage other species to settle inside their patches. The methodology described in this study was tested under different climates and grazing regimes in arid shrubland (Chiran area, northern Negev, Israel). We found that in addition to the shrubs, the ants (mainly of Messor sp.) have a high contribution to the size and the fertility of patches in these ecosystems. The methodology developed in this study could be adjusted and applied to other arid shrublands and degraded ecosystems all over the world for better understanding the relationships between them and the surrounding ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMessor 3aanalytical methods 3abiological speciation 3aclimate 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystems 3aengineering 3aflora 3agrazing 3aindigenous species 3aregrowth 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3aIsrael 0aconservation versus overgrazing 0ahospitality 0apatch area1 aLeu, Stefan1 aBudovsky, Arie0 tArid land research and management.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 28, no. 2 p.232-241dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-49907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324982.2013.8245203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012200168300001600290520146800306592002801774650001501802650001701817650002901834650002501863650001001888650001101898650001401909650001101923651001001934653002501944653003201969653002102001653003002022700001902052700001902071773010702090856008802197852000902285655001202294IND60538083920221121120807.0190319e20150624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053808392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan10aEcological network analysis of an industrial symbiosis system: A case study of the Shandong Lubei eco-industrial park  ap. 174-184.  aChina's Shandong Lubei eco-industrial park was approved for construction in 2003, just after the first national eco-industrial demonstration parks were confirmed by China's State Environmental Protection Administration in 2002. It has therefore been recognized around the world as a successful example of an industrial symbiosis system. The park's success results from the harmonious and coordinated relationships among its members. Analyzing the ecological characteristics of these relationships and identifying the resulting advantages provide a basis for improving the park's efficiency and examining other parks. In this paper, we analyzed the flows of sulfur in the Lubei park (as an example of typical flows) using ecological network analysis to describe this industrial symbiosis system. The integrated analysis of the utility resulting from direct and indirect exchanges of byproducts and wastes can reflect the ecological relationships among members within the system. Based on these ecological relationships, members can be divided into producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers; the integral flow weight for each level of the hierarchy can then be compared to reveal the system's overall ecological structure. By examining the exchanges of resources within the system, we can describe the ecological connotations of the symbiosis and how these ecological relationships influence the overall development and resource flows within the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acase studies 3aenvironmental protection 3aindustrial symbiosis 3aparks 3asulfur 3asymbiosis 3awastes 3aChina 0aIndustrial symbiosis 0aEcological network analysis 0aUtility analysis 0aLubei eco-industrial park1 aZheng, Hongmei1 aFath, Brian D.0 tEcological modelling.g2015 June 24, v. 306 p.174-184dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245007600166300001800242520117700260592002801437650004201465650003001507650001601537650001301553650001201566650001601578653001601594653002101610653001901631653002501650653001201675700002401687773011801711856008201829852000901911655001201920IND60621860120221121131959.0181121e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062186012DNAL7 a10.1177/15648265060274S5052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaas, Jere D.10aInterpopulation Variation in Height among Children 7 to 18 Years of Age  ap. S212-S223.  aThe objective of this review is to examine the degree of variation that exists in the achieved height of preadolescent and adolescent children across populations experiencing favorable conditions that support linear growth. Fifty-three population groups were identified that reported mean heights for economically privileged populations from all major continents. Graphic representation of the heights for these populations indicates that the mean height of preadolescent children differs by 3 to 5 cm, whereas population means begin to diverge from the National Center for Health Statistics/World Health Organization (NCHS/WHO) reference at puberty, with most non-European populations falling to approximately 5 cm below the reference and northern European populations exceeding the reference by a similar amount. We conclude that the evidence for limited interpopulation variation in the height of preadolescents supports consideration of a single growth reference for children up to puberty, but the uncertainty of the causes of the divergence in achieved height during puberty requires further research in order to establish an appropriate adolescent growth reference.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Center for Health Statistics 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadolescents 3achildren 3apuberty 3auncertainty 0aAdolescence 0agrowth reference 0apreadolescence 0aschool-aged children 0astature1 aCampirano, Fabricio0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 27, no. 4_suppl5 p.S212-S223dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15648265060274S5053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245007100167520133200238592002801570650001401598650001201612650001001624650002701634650002301661650002401684650001501708650002501723650001401748650002201762653002301784653002301807653002201830653004101852700001401893700001701907700005901924773010701983856008802090852000902178655001202187IND60696061620221120221241.0200712e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069606162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1091042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aMate success affects sex ratio strategies in structured population  aIn this model, we considered the population density effect based on the evolutionary maintainable strategy (EMS) for optimal sex ratio strategy analysis, instead of the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) under the population equilibrium. We used a cellular automaton model to simulate population dynamics using the birth-death process to monitor the effect of space structure on the optimal sex ratio in EMS.The simulation showed that when the whole population was a panmixia, the optimal sex ratio would be 1:1 (male/female), which conforms to the Fisher's theory prediction. However, in a structured population, the ratio favoured a female-bias sexratio, which conforms to the local mate competition theory prediction. With the decreased dispersal range, the sex ratio strategy tended towards a higher male proportion, which is similar to the local resource competition prediction.The predictions of our model partly conformed to classical theories and explained some gaps in the ESS model. However, the driving force differed from the classical sex ratio model.The sex ratio was selected by population fitness rather than mother's fitness. The optimal sex ratio strategy for a population is to guarantee mating success, indicating that population survival may provide a complementary explanation for the sex ratio evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3afemales 3amales 3amating competitiveness 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3areproductive success 3asex ratio 3asimulation models 0aCellular automaton 0aSpatially explicit 0aLimited dispersal 0aEvolutionarily maintainable strategy1 aZhao, Lan1 aWang, Rui-Wu1 aFang, Sheng-Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2051-25160 tEcological modelling.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 429 p.109104-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1091043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04069naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245010400203300001500307506007600322520069800398520183401096592002802930506003702958650002302995650001303018650001803031650001603049650001303065650001603078650001903094650001103113650000903124650001103133650001603144650001403160650001403174653002003188653002503208653002103233653002203254653001403276700002803290700002803318700002503346773008203371856007703453852000903530655001203539IND60119743620221207055353.0150101s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011974362DNAL7 a10.1093/aobpla/plu0582doi7 aPMC42164312pmcid7 a252702312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Yoichiro10aPhysiological analyses of traits associated with tolerance of long-term partial submergence in rice  ap. plu058.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLong-term stagnant flooding (SF, 50 cm water depth) greatly reduces rice yield. We assessed physiological mechanisms associated with SF tolerance in contrasting rice genotypes. SF reduced yield by 47% due to low biomass caused by reduced light interception and leaf growth above water; and reduced panicle number by 52% because of low tillering. Shoot elongation correlated positively with leaf growth and biomass production, but negatively with stem nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC). Tolerant varieties were either inherently tall or elongate moderately (<2.0 cm d−1) with rising floodwater. Optimum shoot elongation with rising floodwater is therefore a priority for future breeding work.  aFloods are major constraints to crop production worldwide. In low-lying, flood-prone areas of the tropics, longer-term partial submergence (stagnant flooding [SF]) greatly reduces rice yield. This study assesses shoot growth and several physiological mechanisms associated with SF tolerance in rice. Five rice genotypes with contrasting responses to SF were evaluated in field ponds. Following transplanting, floodwater was gradually increased at a rate of ∼2 cm day−1 to reach a final depth of 50 cm and then maintained until maturity. Although plants were not fully submerged, the yield was reduced by 47 % across genotypes compared with those grown under control conditions (6.1 vs. 3.3 t ha−1). This reduction was mainly attributed to the reduction in biomass caused by reduced light interception and leaf growth above the water. Stagnant flooding also reduced panicle number per unit area by 52 % because of reduced tillering. Shoot elongation rate kept pace with rising floodwater and correlated positively with leaf growth and biomass production. Conversely, stem non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration correlated negatively with shoot elongation rate, suggesting that fast-elongating genotypes actively consume NSCs to avoid complete submergence. Moderate shoot elongation rate strongly and positively correlated with grain yield under SF; however, elongation at rates >2.0 cm day−1 was associated with reduced harvest index due to a smaller panicle size and increased lodging. Tolerant varieties were found to be either inherently tall or elongate moderately with rising floodwater. Our studies suggest that to improve tolerance of SF an appropriate phenotype should combine both of these traits. Fine-tuning for optimum shoot elongation with rising floodwater is, therefore, a priority for future work.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass production 3abreeding 3acarbohydrates 3acorrelation 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ainflorescences 3aleaves 3arice 3ashoots 3asubmergence 3atillering 3avarieties 0aFlooding stress 0arainfed lowland rice 0ashoot elongation 0astagnant flooding 0atillering1 aCollard, Bertrand C.

It is the principle toxicant responsible for the vasoconstrictive and reproductive sequelae seen in “fescue toxicosis” in livestock which consume forage exceeding the threshold of toxicity established for this compound. A new method for extraction of ergovaline from tall fescue seed and straw was optimized and validated, on the basis of the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) method, with high-performance liquid chromatography–fluorescence detection. Fourteen extraction solvents were tested; 2.1 mM ammonium carbonate/acetonitrile (50/50, v/v) had the highest and most consistent recovery (91–101%). Linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, accuracy,and intra- and interday precisions for tall fescue seed and straw were 100–3500 μg/kg, 37 and 30 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, 98%, 3.0 and 1.6%, and 3.8 and 1.0%, respectively. When the currently used solid-phase extraction (SPE) and QuEChERS methods were applied to 17 tall fescue straw samples, there was good agreement (correlation coefficient 0.9978). The QuEChERS method achieved the goals of eliminating chlorinated solvents and developing a fast, efficient, reliable method for quantitating ergovaline in tall fescue forage that can be applied in a high-throughput food safety laboratory. 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium carbonate 3abiosafety 3acomplications (disease) 3acool season grasses 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3aendophytes 3aergot 3aergovaline 3afescue toxicosis 3afood safety 3aforage 3alivestock 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3astraw 3atoxicity1 aDuringer, Jennifer1 aCraig, A.

This study reports genetic variation for fiber quality traits in reciprocal advanced backcross populations between G. hirsutum cultivar Acala Maxxa and G. barbadense cultivar Pima S6. Micronaire (MIC), elongation (ELO), strength (STR), upper half mean length (UHM), and uniformity index (UI) showed significant genotypic variance, albeit different in the respective backgrounds for all traits except UI. Different levels of variation among genotypes for the same traits in reciprocal backgrounds suggest different levels of epistatic interactions, a hypothesis supported by a significant difference in transgressive segregants in Acala Maxxa and Pima S6 backgrounds. In Acala Maxxa background, 18, 18, 7, and 3 genotypes had significantly better MIC, ELO, STR and UHM, respectively, than Acala Maxxa. In Pima S6 background 10, 5, 8, and 11 genotypes had significantly better MIC, ELO, STR, and UHM, respectively, than Pima S6. Increased genetic variation and improved fiber quality in both backgrounds appears attainable using reciprocal introgression; however, the number of genotypes with simultaneous improvement for multiple fiber quality traits was higher in Acala Maxxa than Pima S6 background. Reciprocal populations provide a platform to study cytoplasmic effects on genetic variation and heritability of fiber quality traits, and estimate the size of base populations required to obtain genotypes with genetic gain by backcross breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium barbadense 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abackcrossing 3acultivars 3aepistasis 3agene pool 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aheritability 3aintrogression 3amicronaire 3aplant breeding 3avariance1 aZhang, Zhengsheng1 aPatel, Jinesh D.1 aAdhikari, Jeevan1 aKhanal, Sameer1 aHe, Daohua1 aBrown, Nino1 aChee, Peng W.1 aPaterson, Andrew H.0 tEuphytica.g2017 Nov., v. 213, no. 11 p.241-241dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-017-2029-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009600172300001600268520088600284592002801170650004401198650002201242650001601264650001701280650002801297650002101325650001501346650003301361650002001394653002701414653001701441653001901458700002201477700002501499700002901524773008901553856008401642852000901726655001201735IND60604534720221120035048.0180717e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060453472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJagadale, Ajay D.10aInfluence of electrodeposition modes on the supercapacitive performance of Co3O4 electrodes  ap. 234-241.  aIn the present paper, the different modes of electrodeposition such as PD (potentiodynamic), PS (potentiostatic) and GS (galvanostatic) have been successfully employed for the deposition of cobalt oxide and subsequently the effect of these modes on supercapacitive performance has been studied.

We previously found that the E7 proteins of high-risk HPVs, but not of low-risk HPVs, could bind to centromere protein-C (CENP-C). In this study, we first found that CENP-C could bind centromere α-satellite DNAs using ChIP analysis and HA-tagged CENP-C/nuc transfected 293T cells. We then investigated if HA-CENP-C/nuc binding to α-satellite DNAs was affected by the E7 proteins of high- or low-risk HPVs. We found that transfection of the FLAG tagged HPV18 E7 inhibited the binding of HA-CENP-C/nuc to α-satellite DNAs. This finding was confirmed in HeLa S3 cells transfected with siRNA targeted to HPV18 E7 expression. We therefore speculate that altered function of kinetochores as a result of inhibition of CENP-C and α-satellite DNAs binding may be associated with the chromosomal abnormalities observed in HPV18-positive cancers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPapillomaviridae 3aaneuploidy 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosome segregation 3ahumans 3akinetochores 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection 0aHPV 0aE7 0aCENP-C 0aα-Satellite DNA1 aYoshimoto, Masafumi1 aEguchi, Ayami1 aTokuda, Aoi1 aTakahashi, Shoko0 tVirus research.g2015 July 02, v. 205 p.27-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245018900174520187800363592002802241650005302269650001602322650001902338650002902357650001402386650001102400650002102411650003402432650002702466650001502493650001002508651001802518653001802536653001102554653000902565700001702574700002002591700001302611700002702624700001902651773010502670856008502775852000902860655001202869IND60654385620221118054933.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065438562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalafat, Antonia M.10aLegacy and alternative per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the U.S. general population: Paired serum-urine data from the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  aConcerns are heightened from detecting environmentally persistent man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water systems around the world. Many PFAS, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), remain in the human body for years. Since 1999–2000, assessment of exposure to PFOS, PFOA, and other select PFAS in the U.S. general population has relied on measuring PFAS serum concentrations in participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Manufacturers have replaced select chemistries (“legacy” PFAS) with PFAS with shorter biological half-lives (e.g., GenX, perfluorobutanoate [PFBA]) which may efficiently eliminate in urine. However, knowledge regarding exposure to these compounds is limited. We analyzed 2682 urine samples for 17 legacy and alternative PFAS in 2013–2014 NHANES participants ≥6 years of age. Concentrations of some of these PFAS, measured previously in paired serum samples from the same NHANES participants, suggested universal exposure to PFOS and PFOA, and infrequent or no exposure to two short-chain PFAS, perfluorobutane sulfonate and perfluoroheptanoate. Yet, in urine, PFAS were seldom detected; the frequency of not having detectable concentrations of any of the 17 PFAS was 67.5%. Only two were detected in >1.5% of the population: PFBA (13.3%) and perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA, 22.6%); the 90th percentile urine concentrations were 0.1 μg/L (PFBA), and 0.3 μg/L (PFHxA). These results suggest that exposures to short-chain PFAS are infrequent or at levels below those that would result in detectable concentrations in urine. As such, these findings do not support biomonitoring of short-chain PFAS or fluorinated alternatives in the general population using urine, and highlight the importance of selecting the adequate biomonitoring matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3ablood serum 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahalf life 3ahumans 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asulfonates 3aurine 3aUnited States 0aBiomonitoring 0aNHANES 0aPFAS1 aKato, Kayoko1 aHubbard, Kendra1 aJia, Tao1 aBotelho, Julianne Cook1 aWong, Lee-Yang0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Oct., v. 131 p.105048-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009300165300001600258520136000274592002801634596005901662596005901721596005901780596006301839596010701902650001702009650001902026650001602045650001202061650002002073650001302093650001502106650001202121650001602133650002102149650002902170700001302199700001702212700001302229700001902242700001302261773011802274856008202392852000902474655001202483IND60611332220221121225802.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061133222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10577-018-9577-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Guoliang10aChanges in the position and volume of inactive X chromosomes during the G0/G1 transition  ap. 179-189.  aIn female mammals, each cell silences one X chromosome by converting it into transcriptionally inert heterochromatin. The inactivation is concomitant with epigenetic changes including methylation of specific histone residues and incorporation of macroH2A. Such epigenetic changes may exert influence on the positioning of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) within the nucleus beyond the level of chromatin structure. However, the dynamic positioning of the inactive X chromosome during cell cycle remains unclear. Here, we show that H3K27me3 is a cell-cycle-independent marker for the inactivated X chromosomes in WI38 cells. By utilizing this marker, three types of Xi locations in the nuclei are classified, which are envelope position (associated with envelope), mid-position (between the envelope and nucleolus), and nucleolus position (associated with the nucleolus). Moreover, serial-section analysis revealed that the inactive X chromosomes in the mid-position appear to be sparser and less condensed than those associated with the nuclear envelope or nucleolus. During the transition from G0 to G1 phase, the inactive X chromosomes tend to move from the envelope position to the nucleolus position in WI38 cells. Our results imply a role of chromosome positioning in maintaining the organization of the inactive X chromosomes in different cell phases.  aPublisher supplied data  a91219101cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31471205cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31571394cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2013CB530700cNational Basic Research Program of China  a0223-0002-0002000-56cHunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study 3aX chromosome 3acell nucleolus 3aepigenetics 3afemales 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3ainterphase 3amammals 3amethylation 3anuclear membrane 3atranscription (genetics)1 aTan, Tan1 aGuan, Yiting1 aSun, Lei1 aLiang, Qianjin1 aTao, Wei0 tChromosome research.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.179-189dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53154x0967-38497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-018-9577-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011600164300002000280520195400300592002802254596005902282596005902341650002702400650001202427650001502439650000902454650001202463650001102475650001402486650001302500650001902513700001502532700001402547700001602561700001602577700001802593700001802611773015602629856008302785852000902868655001202877IND60748835220221122054701.0220126e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074883522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-11872-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhuang10aImpact of gas impurities on the Hg0 oxidation on high iron and calcium coal ash for chemical looping combustion  ap. 46130-46146.  aCoal-based mercury pollution from power plants has received increasing attention. In a previous study, high iron and calcium coal ash (HICCA) was found as a promising oxygen carrier (OC) for chemical looping combustion (CLC). The purpose of this study was to investigate the catalytic effect of HICCA on Hg⁰ removal as well as the impacts of several gas impurities, such as HCl, SO₂, and NO. Experiments on Hg⁰ removal efficiencies for different atmospheres were performed in the fixed-bed reactor at 850 °C. Based upon the characterization of BET, SEM, XRD, XPS, and EDS of reaction products, the reaction mechanisms of different gases with the HICCA samples were established. The mechanisms were further explained using the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. The experimental results showed that the Hg⁰ removal efficiency using HICCA was 11.60%, while the corresponding value in the presence of 50 ppm HCl was 90.46%. Hg⁰ removal by HICCA involving HCl is mainly attributed to homogeneous reaction between Hg⁰ and HCl as well as the formation of reactive species (Cl, Cl₂, Cl₂O, O, S, and SCl₂) through the reactions of HCl with Fe₂O₃ and CaSO₄ in HICCA. The formation of C–Cl bond is not the main pathway for the promotional effect of HCl on Hg⁰ removal. SO₂ played a negative role in Hg⁰ removal by HICCA. The inhibition of SO₂ may be attributed to its effect on the reduction of Fe₂O₃ and its bonding with C–O, COOH, and C(O)–O–C. NO enhanced Hg⁰ removal by HICCA primarily through the homogeneous reactions of Hg⁰ with N₂O and O. In addition, NO also interacted with HICCA and promoted the heterogeneous oxidation of Hg⁰ by producing more C–O, C=O, and COOH/C(O)−O−C on HICCA surface. This study proved the effectiveness of HICCA on Hg⁰ removal in iG-CLC and revealed the mechanisms of the interaction between HCl/SO₂/NO and MₓOy/CaSO₄ as well as carbon-oxygen groups.  aPublisher supplied data  a51706143cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51976129cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aash (inorganic matter) 3acalcium 3acombustion 3airon 3amercury 3aoxygen 3apollution 3aresearch 3athermodynamics1 aLiu, Dunyu1 aJin, Jing1 aFeng, Liang1 aNi, Mingguo1 aZhao, Bingtao1 aWu, Xiaojiang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Sept., v. 28, no. 34 p.46130-46146dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11872-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245014300208300001100351506007600362520149300438592002801931506003701959650001601996650002402012650001402036650001802050650001802068650004302086650002602129650001502155650001302170650002202183700001702205700001302222700001902235700001502254773008902269856008102358852000902439655001202448IND60548535120221207141120.0171010e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054853512DNAL7 a10.1186/s12937-016-0169-62doi7 aPMC48554402pmcid7 a271425202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin-liang10aAssociation between serum selenium level and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a non-linear dose–response meta-analysis of observational studies  ap. 48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The association between serum selenium levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is controversial. We performed a systematic review and non-linear dose–response meta-analysis of observational studies to investigate the association in the present study. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. A pooled odds ratio (OR) and related 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) for T2DM between the highest and lowest serum selenium categories, and a non-linear dose–response relationship between selenium and T2DM were estimated. RESULTS: A total of five studies (of 13,460 participants) were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The pooled OR indicated that there was a significantly higher prevalence of T2DM in the highest category of blood selenium compared with the lowest (OR = 1.63, 95 % CI: 1.04–2.56, P = 0.033). Moreover, a significant non-linear dose–response relationship was observed between serum selenium levels and T2DM (P < 0.001). Serum selenium levels were positively associated with T2DM in populations with relatively low serum selenium levels (<97.5 μg/l) and those with high serum selenium levels (>132.5 μg/l). CONCLUSIONS: The positive association between serum selenium levels and T2DM existed in populations with relatively low levels and high levels of serum selenium, indicating a likely U-shaped non-linear dose–response relationship between serum selenium and T2DM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adose response 3ameta-analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3aselenium 3asystematic review1 aYang, Tu-bao1 aWei, Jie1 aLei, Guang-hua1 aZeng, Chao0 tNutrition journal.g2015 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.48-48dBioMed Centralx1475-28917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-016-0169-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245011300206300001600319520138200335592002801717650001601745650001201761650001101773650001801784650000901802650002001811650001301831650001501844653001601859653002501875653002701900653001401927653002001941653003901961700001902000700002602019700002002045700002202065700002302087700002802110700002002138700002402158700001902182700002502201700001802226700002002244773011102264856008202375852000902457655001202466IND60549610020221119111546.0190401e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054961002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2016.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMertens, Birgit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8298-910410aEvaluation of the potential health risks of substances migrating from polycarbonate replacement baby bottles  ap. 108-119.  aSince the European Commission prohibited the use of bisphenol A in the production of polycarbonate (PC) baby bottles, many other materials have replaced PC for the manufacture of this type of food contact materials. In the present study, the potential migration risks associated with these alternative materials were investigated. First, all substances were evaluated for endocrine disruptive (ED) activity by using different existing lists of (suspected) ED chemicals. Next, the potential non-ED risks were assessed. A distinction was made between migrants listed in Annex I of European Regulation 10/2011 and the unlisted substances (e.g. non-intentionally added substances). For the listed substances, concentrations in the migration solutions were compared to their respective specific migration limits (SML) (when applicable). Migration of all substances was shown to be below their SML. The unlisted substances were evaluated using toxicological information from previous evaluations, or if not available, by applying the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach. In case the estimated exposure to the unlisted substance exceeded the human exposure TTC value, a more indepth risk assessment was performed. Based on the results of both parts of the study, four baby bottles were considered of high concern because of the potential toxicity of migrating compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3abottles 3ahumans 3amanufacturing 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aBisphenol A 0aEndocrine disruptors 0aFood contact materials 0aMigration 0aRisk assessment 0aThreshold of toxicological concern1 aVan Hoeck, Els1 aBlaude, Marie-Noëlle1 aSimon, Coraline1 aOnghena, Matthias1 aVandermarken, Tara1 aVan Langenhove, Kersten1 aDemaegdt, Heidi1 aVandermeiren, Karin1 aCovaci, Adrian1 aScippo, Marie-Louise1 aElskens, Marc1 aVan Loco, Joris0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2016 Nov., v. 97 p.108-119dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009700163300001600260520157300276592002801849650001701877650003101894650001101925650001901936650002501955650002601980650001502006650002202021650001702043650001602060650001202076650001902088650001202107650002702119650000902146650001302155650001502168650002702183650001302210650002502223650001002248650000902258650001102267651001002278700001802288700001602306700001602322773011502338856008102453852000902534655001202543IND60583099020221118063749.0171008e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058309902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10705-017-9873-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Caiyun10aSeeding ratios and phosphate fertilizer on ecosystem carbon exchange of common vetch and oat  ap. 149-160.  aFew studies have investigated the effect of phosphate (P) fertilizer on net ecosystem CO₂ exchange (NEE) and its components under mixed legume and grass pastures sown, which will limit our understanding about their effects on carbon (C) sequestration in soils. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a combination of legumes with grass and P fertilizer increases NEE due to greater increases in gross primary productivity (GPP) compared to increases in ecosystem respiration (Re).We measured NEE, GPP and Re under 5 different seeding ratios of oat (Avena sativa L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) according to their thousand kernel weight and germination rate (i.e., seeding rate were: M1: 0:150, M2: 150:105, M3: 300:75, M4: 450:45 and M5: 600:0) with and P unfertilized on the Tibetan Plateau from 2011 to 2013. NEE was measured at 1-week intervals from June to September each year using a transparent chamber technique (Licor-6400). Our results showed that both P fertilizer and mixed ratio had significant effect on NEE, Re and GPP, but their interactive effects were not significant during the growing season. P fertilizer primarily increased NEE due to increased GPP for the monoculture and mixtures with a higher proportion of common vetch. NEE, Re and GPP were higher for the mixed pastures only compared with legume monoculture. From the perspective of forage yield and C sequestration, planting mixed legume-grass pastures with P fertilizer is a preferable way to balance the twin objectives of forage production and C sequestration in alpine regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aVicia sativa subsp. sativa 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aforage production 3aforage yield 3agermination 3agrasses 3agrowing season 3alegumes 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aoats 3apastures 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplanting 3aprimary productivity 3aseeds 3asoil 3asowing 3aChina1 aWang, Shiping1 aZhao, Liang1 aXu, Shixiao0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2017 Nov., v. 109, no. 2 p.149-160dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-13147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-017-9873-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245019600165520176700361592002802128650001002156650001102166650000802177650001802185650001302203650001302216650002502229650001402254650001302268650002002281650000902301650001402310650001102324650001102335650001402346650001502360650000902375650003102384650001602415650000902431650002002440651001302460653003802473653001502511653001202526653000902538653001702547653001602564700001302580700002702593773010502620856008502725852000902810655001202819IND60654385720221118054753.0190801e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065438572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenhui10aOccurrence, distribution and human exposure to 20 organophosphate esters in air, soil, pine needles, river water, and dust samples collected around an airport in New York state, United States  aOrganophosphate esters (OPEs) are used in aircraft lubricating oil and hydraulic fluids, and, thus, airplane emissions are thought to be an important source of these chemicals in the environment. In this study, concentrations of 20 OPEs, comprising seven alkyl-OPEs, three chlorinated (Cl)-OPEs, seven aryl-OPEs, and three oligomeric-OPEs, were determined in outdoor air, soil, pine needles, river water, and outdoor dust samples collected around an airport in Albany, New York, in 2018. Elevated ∑OPE concentrations were found in outdoor air, soil, pine needles, outdoor dust, and river water in the ranges of 1320–20,700 pg/m3 (median: 3880), 1.16–73.1 (14.3) ng/g dry weight (dw), 23.2–534 (102) ng/g (dw), 153–2140 (824) ng/g (dw), and 174–24,600 (1250) ng/L, respectively. The total OPE concentrations in air, soil, water, and outdoor dust samples in the study area were dominated by Cl-OPEs, whereas those in pine needles were dominated by aryl-OPEs. The spatial distribution of OPEs in air, soil, and pine needles showed a gradual decreasing trend with increasing distance from the airport. A significant correlation was observed between ∑OPE concentrations in air and soil, and the fugacity ratio showed the flux of OPEs from air to soil. The spatial distribution of OPEs between air and pine needles was similar and highly correlated, suggesting that pine needles are suitable indicators of atmospheric OPE concentrations. In addition to urban activities, aircraft hydraulic/lubricant oils are a major source of OPEs in the vicinity of the airport. The average daily intake of OPEs via air inhalation and outdoor dust ingestion in the vicinity of the airport was up to 1.53 ng/kg bw/day for children and 0.73 ng/kg bw/day for adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3aadults 3aair 3aair pollution 3aaircraft 3aairports 3aaverage daily intake 3abreathing 3achildren 3aconifer needles 3adust 3aemissions 3aesters 3ahumans 3aingestion 3alubricants 3aoils 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3ariver water 3asoil 3awater pollution 3aNew York 0aOrganophosphorus flame retardants 0aAtmosphere 0aAirport 0aFlux 0aPartitioning 0aPine needle1 aWang, Yu1 aKannan, Kurunthachalam0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Oct., v. 131 p.105054-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007600168300001600244520111300260592002801373650002001401650001301421650001501434650001401449650001001463650002101473650002301494650004301517650004301560650002901603700002401632700002001656700002101676700002101697700001701718700001701735700002601752700002101778700002101799700001801820700001901838700001801857700002001875773011401895856008202009990002302091852000902114655001202123IND60091149620221121040552.0141103e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009114962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.11.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGathiaka, Symon10aDesign, development and evaluation of novel dual PPARδ/PPARγ agonists  ap. 873-879.  aType 2 diabetes is at epidemic proportions and thus development of novel pharmaceutical therapies for improving insulin sensitivity has become of paramount importance. The objectives of the current study were to develop novel dual PPARγ/δ agonists without the deleterious side effects associated with full PPARγ agonists. Docking simulations of 23 novel compounds within the ligand binding domain of PPARγ/δ were performed using AutoDock Vina which consistently reproduced experimental binding poses from known PPAR agonists. Comparisons were made and described with other docking programs AutoDock and Surflex-Dock (from SYBYL-X). Biological evaluation of compounds was accomplished by transcriptional promoter activity assays, quantitative PCR gene analysis for known PPARγ/δ targets as well as in vitro assays for lipid accumulation and mitochondrial biogenesis verses known PPAR agonists. We found one (compound 9) out of the 23 compounds evaluated, to be the most potent and selective dual PPARγ/δ agonist which did not display the deleterious side effects associated with full PPARγ agonists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aagonists 3abiogenesis 3achemistry 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics)1 aNanayakkara, Gayani1 aBoncher, Tracey1 aAcevedo, Orlando1 aWyble, Johnathon1 aPatel, Sagar1 aPatel, Akash1 aShane, Mary Elizabeth1 aBonkowski, Blake1 aWieczorek, Jason1 aRong, Yinghui1 aHuggins, Kevin1 aSmith, Forest1 aAmin, Rajesh H.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 23, no. 3 p.873-879dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.11.0603Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245012000152300001800272520077700290650004401067650004001111650001601151650002001167650003101187650000701218650001201225650001501237650003301252650001601285650002101301650002601322650002101348700001301369700002001382700001901402700001601421700001801437700001901455700001701474700001801491773016001509856004001669852000901709655001201718IND60517896220221121032241.0160406e20150506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051789622DNAL7 a10.1021/jf50550622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yao10aSynthesis, Characterization, and Application of Microbe-Triggered Controlled-Release Kasugamycin–Pectin Conjugate  ap. 4263-4268.  aThe controlled and targeted release of pesticides with high water solubility has been a challenge for integrated pest management. In this paper, kasugamycin, an antibiotic broadly used in plant disease control, was covalently conjugated to pectin to form a kasugamycin–pectin conjugate by an amide bond. The conjugate was structurally characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The results showed that the conjugate was stable over a wide range of pH and temperatures, as well as under UV irradiation. When incubated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans, the conjugate could be activated, releasing the kasugamycin, which made it a promising controlled-release formulation of pesticide. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans 3aantibiotics 3adisease control 3aintegrated pest management 3apH 3apectins 3apesticides 3aplant diseases and disorders 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater solubility1 aSun, Yan1 aDing, Guanglong1 aGeng, Qianqian1 aZhu, Juanli1 aGuo, Mincheng1 aDuan, Yongheng1 aWang, Baitao1 aCao, Yongsong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 May 6, v. 63, no. 17 p.4263-4268dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf5055062  aDNAL 7aarticle01924naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245008100173300001400254520091000268592002801178650001601206650001401222650002201236650001601258653004501274653001601319653001001335653002001345700002101365773012301386856008001509852000901589655001201598IND60573162220221122032137.0170721e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057316222DNAL7 a10.1515/prolas-2017-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoghredani, Naeimadeen10aRobust Synchronisation of Uncertain Fractional-Order Chaotic Unified Systems  ap. 69-77.  aFractional-order chaotic unified systems include a variety of fractional-order chaotic systems such as Chen, Lorenz, Lu, Liu, and financial systems. This paper describes a sliding mode controller for synchronisation of fractional-order chaotic unified systems in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances, and affirms the stability of the controller (which is composed of error dynamics). Moreover, the synchronisation of two separate fractional-order chaotic systems is studied. For this aim, fractional integral sliding surface is defined. Then the sliding mode control rule for stability of error dynamic is presented based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation results, obtained by using MATLAB, show that the proposed sliding mode has employed an appropriate approach against uncertainties and to reduce the chattering phenomenon that often occurs with sliding mode controllers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrollers 3aequations 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 0afractional-order chaotic unified systems 0auncertainty 0achaos 0asynchronisation1 aBalochian, Saeed0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2017 June 1, v. 71, no. 1-2 p.69-77dDe Gruyter Openx1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/prolas-2017-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012300166520124400289592002801533650000801561650002601569650002201595650001901617650001501636650002401651650001801675650003801693650001901731650001901750650001901769650002101788650001501809650001501824653001401839653002101853653002201874653001701896700002101913700002001934700002201954700001301976700001301989700001502002773010302017856008702120852000902207655001202216IND60766084420221122060359.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076608442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1123662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Dan10aTargeted delivery of cancer drug paclitaxel to chordomas tumor cells via an RNA nanoparticle harboring an EGFR aptamer  aPaclitaxel has been extensively used in clinics for cancer treatment. However, its limited solubility in aqueous solution and high occurrence of side effects have also been widely reported. In this study, we constructed a biocompatible RNA nanoparticle delivery system (3WJ-EGFRₐₚₜ) that includes 3WJ (3-way junction) nanoparticle with a size of 4.85 ± 0.59 nm as a backbone and an EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) aptamer for specific targeting to chordomas cells, which owns the encapsulation ability of drug paclitaxel (PTX) for cancer therapy. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry results confirmed 3WJ-EGFRₐₚₜ nanoparticle exhibited excellent specific targeting to chordomas cell U-CH2 which is an EGFR(+) cell line; while the 3WJ nanoparticle lose the targeted ability. Both of the two nanoparticles own no sensitivity to lung cancer cell H520 which is an EGFR(-) cell line. Moreover, the 3WJ-EGFRₐₚₜ nanoparticle encapsulated drug PTX could enhance the inhibition efficiency of chordomas tumor cells U-CH2 as compared to free PTX alone. This work demonstrates that RNA-3WJ constructed with a targeting aptamer provides a compromising targeted drug delivery ability on chordomas cells for therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aantineoplastic agents 3aaqueous solutions 3acancer therapy 3acell lines 3aconfocal microscopy 3aencapsulation 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3aflow cytometry 3alung neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligonucleotides 3apaclitaxel 3asolubility 0aChordomas 0aRNA nanoparticle 0aTargeted delivery 0aEGFR aptamer1 aHuang, Yongxiong1 aHuang, Shuaihao1 aZhuang, Jianxiong1 aChen, P.1 aWang, Yi1 aZhang, Lei0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Apr., v. 212 p.112366-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2022.1123663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006500171506010400236506007600340520094800416592002801364506003701392650002001429650001401449650001501463650001101478650001501489650001301504650001901517650001701536650002801553700001601581773012701597856008501724852000901809655001201818IND60773280820221207123204.0220802e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077328082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2022.1011802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, Rachel A10aDownscaling doughnut economics for sustainability governance  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe concept of ‘doughnut economics’ is attracting growing attention from policy-makers and has the potential to unify stakeholders around a holistic vision of sustainable development. The ‘safe and just’ space within the doughnut is framed at a global scale, based on human needs that represent a foundation for social wellbeing, and planetary boundaries reflecting biophysical limits. However, the geographical division of political power between and within nations means that its ability to stimulate change will depend upon its application at national and subnational scales. This paper examines the challenges facing local institutions in downscaling doughnut economics for planning, decision-making and leadership; draws on wider literature from previous efforts to localise sustainability governance to help illuminate these challenges; and outlines a future research agenda to support local governance for a safe and just space.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adecision making 3adoughnuts 3agovernance 3ahumans 3aleadership 3apolitics 3asocial welfare 3astakeholders 3asustainable development1 aWills, Jane0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2022 June, v. 56 p.101180-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2022.1011803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008600168300001400254520187800268592002802146650001602174650001402190650001802204650001602222650001202238650002002250650001002270650001302280650002002293650001202313650001602325650001602341650002102357650001202378650001002390650001402400650000902414650001602423650001502439650003102454650001002485700001702495700001902512773011702531856008402648852000902732655001202741IND60090128020221120061241.0141102e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009012802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeno, Takashi10aMetabolic contribution of hepatic autophagic proteolysis: Old wine in new bottles  ap. 51-58.  aPioneering work on autophagy was achieved soon after the discovery of lysosomes more than 50years ago. Due to its prominent lysosomal activity and technical ease of handling, the liver has been at the center of continuous and vigorous investigations into autophagy. Many important discoveries, including suppression by insulin and plasma amino acids and stimulation by glucagon, have been made through in vivo and in vitro studies using perfused liver and cultured hepatocytes. The long-term controversy about the origin and nature of the autophagosome membrane has finally led to the conclusion of “phagophore,” through extensive molecular cell biological approaches enlightened by the discovery of autophagy-essential ATG genes. Furthermore, recent studies using liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice have thrown light on the unique role of a selective substrate of autophagy, p62. The stabilized p62 accumulating in autophagy-deficient liver manipulates Nrf2-dependent transcription activation through specific binding to Keap1, which results in the elevated gene expression involved in detoxification. This is the first example of the dysregulation of gene expression under autophagy deficiency. Thus, basal liver autophagy makes a large contribution to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and health. Meanwhile, precise comparisons of wild-type and liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice under starvation conditions have revealed that amino acids released by autophagic degradation can be metabolized to produce glucose via gluconeogenesis for the maintenance of blood glucose, and can also be excreted to the circulation to supply serum amino acids. These results strongly confirm that induced liver autophagy plays a pivotal role in metabolic compensation.

CLs possess specialised lysosome-related organelles called granules which contain the granzyme family of serine proteases and perforin. Granzymes may induce apoptosis in the target cell when delivered by the pore forming protein, perforin. Here we follow the perforin-granzyme pathway from synthesis and storage in the granule, to exocytosis and finally delivery into the target cell. This review focuses on the controversial subject of perforin-mediated translocation of granzymes into the target cell cytoplasm. It remains unclear whether this occurs at the cell surface with granzymes moving through a perforin pore in the plasma membrane, or if it involves internalisation of perforin and granzymes and subsequent release from an endocytic compartment. The latter mechanism would represent an example of cross talk between the endo-lysosomal pathways of individual cells.

Subsequently, SMX removal from the poultry wastewater was investigated using a continuous-mode membrane-photocatalytic slurry reactor (MPSR). The real-time poultry wastewater was found to have an SMX concentration of 0–2.3 mg L ⁻¹. A granular activated carbon supported TiO ₂ (GAC-TiO ₂) was synthesized, characterized and used in MPSR experiments. The optimal MPSR condition, i.e., HRT ∼125 min and catalyst dosage 529.3 mg L ⁻¹, for complete SMX removal was found out using unconstrained optimization technique. Under the optimized condition, the effect of SMX concentration on MPSR performance was investigated by synthetic addition of SMX (i.e., 1, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg L ⁻¹) into the wastewater. Interestingly, complete removals of total volatile solids (TVS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and SMX were observed under all SMX concentrations investigated. However, a decline in SMX removal rate and proportionate increase in transmembrane-pressure (TMP) were observed when the SMX concentration was increased to higher levels. In the MPSR, the SMX mineralization was through one of the following degradation pathways: (i) fragmentation of the isoxazole ring and (ii) the elimination of methyl and amide moieties followed by the formation of phenyl sulfinate ion. These results show that the continuous-mode MPSR has great potential in the removal for SMX contaminated real-time poultry wastewater and similar organic micropollutants from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acatalysts 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amineralization 3apoultry 3aslurries 3asulfamethoxazole 3awastewater 0aAntibiotics 0adegradation pathway 0amembrane 0aphotocatalysis 0apoultry wastewater 0asulfamethoxazole1 aKumar, Mathava0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2015 Aug. 24, v. 50, no. 10 p.1011-1019dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2015.10381613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009900167300001600266520161400282592002801896650002201924650001301946650002001959650002301979650001102002650001502013650000902028650001402037653001402051653002302065653002602088653003902114700001702153700001402170773008902184856008402273852000902357655001202366IND60604535620221117184223.0180717e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060453562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Hongjun12aA CFD (computational fluid dynamic) simulation for oil leakage from damaged submarine pipeline  ap. 887-899.  aThe objective of the present paper is to study the oil flows from damaged submarine pipelines with different leak sizes. CFD (computational fluid dynamic) simulations with FLUENT software are carried out to investigate the process of oil spill from submarine pipeline to free surface. Effects of oil density, oil leaking rate, leak size and water velocity on the oil spill process are examined. High density, slow leaking, small leak size or fast current brings about long time for oil reaching the maximum horizontal migrate distance when it reaches surface. And this maximum horizontal migrate distance increases with the increase of leak size or water velocity, while increases with the decrease of leaking rate. Then, the dimensionless time required for oil droplets which have the longest horizontal migrate distance when they reach the sea surface and the dimensionless longest horizontal distance the droplets migrate when they reach the sea surface are analyzed and the fitting formulas are obtained. Only the formula for the dimensionless longest horizontal distance versus dimensionless density meets the polynomial, other five formulas meet the natural logarithm distribution. Using the formulas we can obtain when and where to see oil reaching the sea surface, and conduct rapid response. Finally, the maximum horizontal migration distance of oil at certain time is predicted, and a forecasting model is proposed. The using methods of fitting formulas and the forecasting model are shown in the paper by examples. These calculated results provide useful guidance to place the oil containment boom.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3adroplets 3afluid mechanics 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3aoil spills 3aoils 3apipelines 0aOil spill 0aSubmarine pipeline 0aVOF (volume of fluid) 0aCFD (computational fluid dynamics)1 aLin, Pengzhi1 aPan, Qian0 tEnergy.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 64 p.887-899dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03521naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245011500205300001500320506007600335520077400411520142601185592002802611506003702639650001602676650002202692650001802714650001502732650002002747653004102767653001702808653002202825653002802847653002602875653001102901700001902912773008202931856007703013852000903090655001203099IND60119744820221207060800.0150101s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011974482DNAL7 a10.1093/aobpla/plu0702doi7 aPMC42629402pmcid7 a253877492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Yasuhiro,10aFine-scale genetic differentiation of a temperate herb: relevance of local environments and demographic change  ap. plu070.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo examine determinants of geographical patterns in population differentiation, we quantified genetic variation of a temperate herb, Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera, across the Japanese mainland.

To examine the environment- or geography-related differentiation, we quantified genetic variation among 41 populations of a temperate herb, Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera (Brassicaceae). We analysed 19 microsatellite loci, which showed a significant population differentiation and a moderate within-population genetic diversity (global Gst = 0.42 and Hs = 0.19). Our structure analysis and phylogenetic network did not detect more than two genetic groups across the Japanese mainland but found fine-scale genetic differentiations and admixed patterns around the central area. Across the Japanese mainland, we found significant evidence for isolation-by-distance but not for isolation-by-environments. However, at least within the central area, the magnitude of genetic differentiation tended to increase with microhabitat dissimilarity under light conditions and water availability. Furthermore, most populations have been estimated to experience a recent decline in the effective population size, indicating a possibility of bottleneck effects on the pattern of genetic variation. These findings highlight a potential influence of the microhabitat conditions and demographic changes on the local-scale genetic differentiation among natural plant populations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3agenetic variation 3amicrohabitats 3apopulation 3apopulation size 0aArabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera 0aBrassicaceae 0agenetic structure 0aisolation-by-adaptation 0aisolation-by-distance 0aJapan.1 aKudoh, Hiroshi0 tAoB Plants.g2014, v. 6, no. 0 p.plu070-plu070dOxford University Press7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plu0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245015800158500001400316520170100330592002802031650002102059650001702080650002502097650001602122650002102138650001002159650002002169650000902189650001802198650001102216650002302227650001202250650001102262650001302273650001402286650001202300650002502312650001502337700001902352700001402371700001602385700001802401700001302419700001702432700001302449700002002462700002002482700001702502700001702519700001402536773012002550856007502670852000902745655001202754IND60729196620221118080907.0210228e20210129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072919662DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110203362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPu, Junning 10aEffects of Chronic Exposure to Low Levels of Dietary Aflatoxin B1 on Growth Performance, Apparent Total Tract Digestibility and Intestinal Health in Pigs  aNAL-light  aThis study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic exposure to low levels of dietary aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility and intestinal health in pigs. In a 102-day experiment, fourteen barrows (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire, initial BW = 38.21 ± 0.45 kg) were randomly divided into control (CON, basal diet) and AFB₁ groups (the basal diet supplemented with 280 μg/kg AFB₁). Results revealed that the AFB₁ exposure decreased the final BW, ADFI and ADG in pigs (p < 0.10). AFB₁ exposure also decreased the apparent total tract digestibility of dry mater and gross energy at 50 to 75 kg and 105 to 135 kg stages, and decreased the apparent total tract digestibility of ether extract at 75 to 105 kg stage (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, AFB₁ exposure increased serum diamine oxidase activity and reduced the mRNA abundance of sodium-glucose cotransporter 1, solute carrier family 7 member 1 and zonula occluden-1 in the jejunal mucosa (p < 0.05). Furthermore, AFB₁ exposure decreased superoxide dismutase activity (p < 0.05) and increased 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine content (p < 0.10) in jejunal mucosa. AFB₁ exposure also increased tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and transforming growth factor-β mRNA abundance in jejunal mucosa and upregulated Escherichia coli population in colon (p < 0.05). The data indicated that chronic exposure to low levels of dietary AFB₁ suppressed growth performance, reduced the apparent total tract digestibility and damaged intestinal barrier integrity in pigs, which could be associated with the decreased intestinal antioxidant capacity and the increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaflatoxin B1 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood serum 3achronic exposure 3acolon 3adiamine oxidase 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3agrowth performance 3ajejunum 3amucosa 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3asolutes 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asymporters1 aYuan, Qinghui 1 aYan, Hui 1 aTian, Gang 1 aChen, Daiwen 1 aHe, Jun 1 aZheng, Ping 1 aYu, Jie 1 aMao, Xiangbing 1 aHuang, Zhiqing 1 aLuo, Junqiu 1 aLuo, Yuheng 1 aYu, Bing 0 tAnimals.g2021 Jan. 29, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110203363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010600156300001800262520084200280592002801122650001401150650003601164650001401200650001201214650002101226650002201247650001301269650001801282650001901300700001501319700001601334700001701350700001801367700001201385773013301397856007401530852000901604655001201613IND60617534020221120094754.0181025e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061753402DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc03465f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Kaida10aC–H bond sulfonylation of anilines with the insertion of sulfur dioxide under metal-free conditions  ap. 7459-7462.  aC–H bond sulfonylation of anilines with the insertion of sulfur dioxide under metal-free conditions is described. 2-Sulfonylanilines are generated in moderate to good yields through a three-component reaction of anilines, DABCO·(SO₂)₂, and aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates under mild conditions. No metal catalysts or additives are needed for this transformation. This direct C–H functionalization is highly efficient, and broad functional group tolerance is observed. A radical process is believed to be involved. In the reaction process, the arylsulfonyl radical and the tertiary amine radical cation generated in situ from DABCO·(SO₂)₂, and aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborate are the key intermediates. Additionally, the tertiary amine radical cation acts as the electron carrier through a single electron transfer process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalysts 3acations 3achemical bonding 3aelectron transfer 3amoieties 3asulfonylation 3asulfur dioxide1 aZhang, Jun1 aLai, Lifang1 aCheng, Jiang1 aSun, Jiangtao1 aWu, Jie0 tChemical communications.g2018 July 3, v. 54, no. 54 p.7459-7462dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc03465f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245012000217300001100337520189900348592002802247596004602275596004602321596007002367596004002437650001002477650001802487650002302505650001202528650002202540650001602562650001402578650002002592650002402612650002102636650002502657650001502682650001002697650001402707650001302721700002602734773012202760856008302882852000902965655001202974IND60712491120221123004750.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071249112DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-020-00572-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera-Cáceres, William1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9935-826910aSelection for feed efficiency using the social effects animal model in growing Duroc pigs: evaluation by simulation  ap. 53.  aBACKGROUND: Traits recorded on animals that are raised in groups can be analysed with the social effects animal model (SAM). For multiple traits, this model specifies the genetic correlation structure more completely than the animal model (AM). Our hypothesis was that by using the SAM for genetic evaluation of average daily gain (ADG) and backfat thickness (BF), a high rate of improvement in feed conversion ratio (FCR) might be achieved, since unfavourable genetic correlations between ADG and BF reported in a Duroc pig line could be partially avoided. We estimated genetic and non-genetic correlations between BF, ADG and FCR on 1144 pigs using Bayesian methods considering the SAM; and responses to selection indexes that combine estimates of indirect (IGE) and direct (DGE) genetic effects for ADG and BF by stochastic simulation. RESULTS: Estimates of the ratio of the variance of DGE to the phenotypic variance were 0.31, 0.39 and 0.25 and those of the total genetic variance to the phenotypic variance were 0.63, 0.74 and 0.93 for ADG, BF and FCR, respectively. In spite of this, when the SAM was used to generate data and for the genetic evaluations, the average economic response was worse than that obtained when BV predictions from the AM were considered. The achieved economic response was due to a direct reduction in BF and not to an improvement in FCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that although social genetic effects play an important role in the traits studied, their proper consideration in pig breeding programs to improve FCR indirectly is still difficult. The correlations between IGE and DGE that could help to overcome the unfavourable genetic correlations between DGE did not reach sufficiently high magnitudes; also, the genetic parameters estimates from the SAM have large errors. These two factors penalize the average response under the SAM compared to the AM.  aPublisher supplied data  aRTA2014-00015-C2-01cINIA - Spain project  a63353cHorizon 2020 (Feed a Gene project)  aConvocatory 753 PhD scholarships ProgramscColciencias - Colombia  aRTI2018-097610-R-I00cSpain project 3aDuroc 3aanimal models 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3abreeding programs 3acorrelation 3aevolution 3afeed conversion 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variance 3aphenotypic variation 3aprediction 3aswine 3athickness 3avariance1 aSánchez, Juan Pablo,0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2020 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.53-53dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-020-00572-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245005000163300001800213520096800231592002801199650001301227650001601240650001101256650001801267650002201285653002101307653001901328653001101347653001701358653001801375700001801393700001301411773010201424856008501526852000901611655001201620IND60435882120221118082239.0151020e20151118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043588212DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2015.10269812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUzi, A.10aModeling and Simulation of Mono-Layer Coating  ap. 1798-1807.  aCoating simulations of nano-suspended particles are implemented using the DEM-CFD method. A new model of capillary interactions, accounting for the microscale interface deformation implicitly but allowing a rather fast calculation time, is implemented. The drying of a nano-suspension liquid layer is modeled and implemented to the DEM code, allowing transient examination of mono-layer aggregation. The effect of particle size on the coating process is investigated. The main contrast in particle size was received in terms of the transition periods to the finite structure. It was found that the non-dimensional liquid height is a correlative parameter between the cases. Aggregation appears to start at approximately the same non-dimensional liquid height. Furthermore, a firm final structure was obtained at a similar liquid level, way before the drying is complete, indicating that the liquid level has a significant control on the assembly until this point.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adeformation 3adrying 3aparticle size 3asimulation models 0aCapillary forces 0aDEM simulation 0aDrying 0aNanoparticle 0aSelf-assembly1 aOstrovski, Y.1 aLevy, A.0 tDrying technology.g2015 Nov. 18, v. 33, no. 15-16 p.1798-1807dTaylor & Francisx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2015.10269813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015800174300001600332520172500348592002802073650002202101650001702123650001902140650001302159650001702172650001802189650001702207650001502224650001502239650002102254650002302275650001402298650001902312650002502331650001702356650001802373650001802391650001402409650001102423650001702434650001102451650001502462651001302477653001402490653002902504653000802533653001302541653001902554700002002573700002202593700002702615700002402642773011002666856008402776852000902860655001202869IND60123215520221121114859.0150325e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012321552DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2013.7769352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShutsrirung, Arawan10aDiversity of endophytic actinomycetes in mandarin grown in northern Thailand, their phytohormone production potential and plant growth promoting activity  ap. 322-330.  aThe rapid expansion of mandarin (Citrus reticulata L.) production areas with high agrochemical input in the highland areas of northern Thailand has resulted in negative effects in terms of production, environment, soil quality, and public health. The use of microorganisms as plant growth promoters is an alternative method to reduce agrochemical input. Thus, we studied the diversity of endophytic actinomycetes in mandarin and their potential as plant growth promoters. A total of 252 endophytic actinomycete isolates were recovered from mandarin. Based on spore chain morphology, cell wall type, and 16S rRNA gene sequence, the isolates were classified into six genera: Streptomyces , Nocardia , Nocardiopsis , Spirillospora , Microbispora and Micromonospora . The most frequent isolates recovered were members of Streptomyces (85.3%). Selected isolates (64 isolates) from these genera were evaluated for their indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production potential in a medium with 2 mg mL ⁻¹ tryptophan, and all the selected isolates showed the potential to produce IAA, with average values of IAA production of 13.34, 3.36, 140.38, 12.55, 1.40, and 6.19 µg IAA mL ⁻¹, respectively. Isolates of genus Nocardiopsis showed a very high ability to produce IAA that was the highest among all the genera, with values ranging from 62.23 to 222.75 µg mL ⁻¹. Twelve isolates selected from these genera were inoculated onto mandarin seedlings, and the results indicated that the shoot height, fresh shoot weight and fresh root weight of the seedlings were promoted by the inoculation of endophytic actinomycetes, with values ranging from 20.2 to 49.1%, 14.9 to 53.6%, and 1.6 to 102% over the control, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus reticulata 3aMicrobispora 3aMicromonospora 3aNocardia 3aNocardiopsis 3aSpirillospora 3aStreptomyces 3acell walls 3aendophytes 3agrowth promotion 3aindole acetic acid 3amandarins 3amicroorganisms 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant growth 3apublic health 3aribosomal RNA 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil quality 3aspores 3atryptophan 3aThailand 0adiversity 0aendophytic actinomycetes 0aIAA 0amandarin 0a16S rRNA gene.1 aChromkaew, Yupa1 aPathom-Aree, Wasu1 aChoonluchanon, Somporn1 aBoonkerd, Nantakorn0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2013 June 1, v. 59, no. 3 p.322-330dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2013.7769353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05043naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245014300207520273200350592002803082650002503110650001603135650002303151650002103174650001203195650001503207650001903222650003003241650002303271650002303294650002303317650002103340650001703361650001503378650002403393650001603417650001903433650001103452650001103463650002503474650001603499650001003515650001103525651002803536651001103564653001703575653003303592653001803625653002003643653002703663653003203690700006403722700006103786700005903847700002403906700002003930700002203950700002403972700006603996700002104062700001804083700002204101773011604123856008504239852000904324655001204333IND60736093420221123023648.0210918e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073609342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1191942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlisz, Marcin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9486-698810aVariability in climate-growth reaction of Robinia pseudoacacia in Eastern Europe indicates potential for acclimatisation to future climate  aAs a consequence of native tree species decline and distribution range contraction in Europe, acclimation of the non-native tree species at the edge of their distribution is gaining importance. Although non-native tree species may provide sustainable ecosystem services, as a potentially invasive species they may be a threat to local ecosystems as well. In Europe, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) a non-native species, seems to meet the condition of acclimation as a multi-generational process. The acclimatization, however, may have consequences not only for growth performance but also for the species' invasive potential. This study investigates the spatiotemporal pattern of secondary growth and climate sensitivity among six black locust stands along continentality gradient in Eastern Europe with the respect to bioclimatic conditions of the species distribution in Europe.Despite comparable bioclimatic conditions, climate sensitivity of black locust stands is highly variable, both temporally and spatially. The winter and spring temperatures are a key climatic driver of the growth pattern in southern and western Poland. Growth response to previous winter and current summer precipitation distinguished stands in western and eastern Poland. A significant increase in the mean annual temperature during the last 70 years likely triggered temporal instability of the black locusts’ climate signal. In general, drought conditions were found to be the main limiting factor at the edge sites within the black locust gradient. Thus, the climate sensitivity of black locust stands reflects rather site-specific microclimatic conditions then bioclimatically-based clustering pattern. Despite climate-related limiting factors, black locust seems to be characterized by high potential for acclimatization to Eastern European climatic conditions, suggesting high invasive potential. Thus, the replacement of native species by black locust or the conversion of local habitats into monocultures for biomass production should not be recommended, while species management should follow proactive measures to reduce the risk of uncontrolled spread of the species. Divergent growth reaction of black locust stands implies high plasticity of secondary growth and thus high probability of acclimatization to future climate. Given the expected range expansion to the East in Europe, we call for expanding dendroclimatic studies to the areas of future species expansion in order to test its climatic and edaphic limitations. This seems to be crucial for formulating non-native species management strategies in line with sustainable forestry, preventing the uncontrolled expansion of the species that threatens vulnerable habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aacclimation 3abiomass production 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aforest ecology 3ageographical distribution 3agrowth performance 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amicroclimate 3aplasticity 3apopulation dynamics 3aprobability 3arisk reduction 3aspring 3asummer 3asustainable forestry 3atemperature 3atrees 3awinter 3aEastern European region 3aPoland 0aBlack locust 0aClimate-growth relationships 0aAlien species 0aGrowth reaction 0aBioclimatic clustering 0aInvasive species management1 aPuchałka, Radosław1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4764-07051 aNetsvetov, Maksym1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9037-35881 aProkopuk, Yulia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8844-02191 aVítková, Michaela1 aSádlo, Jiří,1 aMatisons, Roberts1 aMionskowski, Marcin1 aChakraborty, Debojyoti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7128-26881 aOlszewski, Piotr1 aWojda, Tomasz1 aKoprowski, Marcin0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 July 15, v. 492 p.119194-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1191943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011700174300001600291500002000307520125700327592002801584650001801612650001901630650001001649650001201659650001901671650001801690650003601708650003701744650002101781650001301802650002301815700003201838700002701870700002101897700003601918700002001954773011501974852000902089856008902098655001202187IND2332192520221120021550.0210417e200303  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233219252DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00682.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRepetto, Ombretta10aTargeted proteomics to identify cadmium‐induced protein modifications in Glomus mosseae‐inoculated pea roots  ap. 555-567.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a• Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) can increase plant tolerance to heavy metals. A targeted proteomic approach was used to determine the putative identity of some of the proteins induced/modulated by cadmium (Cd) and to analyse the impact of the mycorrhizal process. • The effect of Cd (100 mg Cd kg‐¹ substrate) applied either at planting or 15 d later on two pea (Pisum sativum) genotypes, differing in sensitivity to Cd inoculated or not with the AM fungus Glomus mosseae, was studied at three levels: plant biomass production, development of G. mosseae and root differential protein display with one‐ and two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis (1‐DE and 2‐DE) analyses. • Cd‐induced growth inhibition was significantly alleviated by mycorrhiza in the Cd‐sensitive genotype. The AM symbiosis modulated the expression of several proteins, identified by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, newly induced and upregulated or downregulated by Cd. • The protective effect of AM symbiosis towards Cd stress was observed in the Cd‐sensitive genotype. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of proteomics to better understand the possible role of AM symbiosis in detoxification/response mechanisms towards Cd in pea plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPisum sativum 3aGlomus mosseae 3aroots 3acadmium 3aplant proteins 3aphototoxicity 3achemical constituents of plants 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aapplication rate 3agenotype 3abiomass production1 aBestel‐Corre, Gwénäelle1 aDumas‐Gaudot, Eliane1 aBerta, Graziella1 aGianinazzi‐Pearson,  Vivienne1 aGianinazzi, S.,0 tnew phytologist.g2003 Mar., v. 157, no. 3 p.555-567dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00682.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02534naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013200169300001600301520114700317592002801464650001701492650002401509650001301533650001901546650001201565650001601577650000901593650000901602650001801611650003801629650003701667651001001704653001501714653000901729653001901738653002001757653000801777700001901785700001801804700002001822700001901842773011001861856008401971852000902055655001202064IND60123215620221123022041.0150325e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012321562DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2013.7781762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Ryu10aComparison of the frequency of visibly infected bacterial cells between the soil and the floodwater in two Japanese rice fields  ap. 331-336.  aThe frequency of visibly infected bacterial cells (FVIC) by phages was reported so far to be larger in soil environments than in aquatic environments. However, it was evaluated with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and might be biased depending on the criterion of judgment of phage infection by researchers. This study directly compared FVIC with a TEM in soils and in the overlying floodwaters in two Japanese rice fields (Oryza sativa L. Japonica). Soil and floodwater samples were collected three times from three sites in each field during the rice cultivation period. Proportions of bacterial morphology were long-bacteria > short-rod bacteria > coccoid bacteria in this order in both floodwater and soil samples. FVIC was higher in soil samples than in floodwater samples with a range from 4.2 to 11.4% (average 7.4%) and from non-detectable to 5.2% (average 1.2%), respectively. The frequency of phage-infected bacterial cells calculated from FVIC ranged from 32 to 52%, which indicates that the microbial loop mediated by phage infection seems to be far more active in soils than in the floodwaters in these rice fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aaquatic environment 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3apaddies 3aresearchers 3arice 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aJapan 0afloodwater 0aFVIC 0amicrobial loop 0arice field soil 0aTEM1 aSaka, Norikuni1 aHonjo, Hiroki1 aAsakawa, Susumu1 aKimura, Makoto0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2013 June 1, v. 59, no. 3 p.331-336dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2013.7781763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04054naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011600169300001100285520226400296592002802560596007102588596006602659596006702725596003502792650001302827650001002840650000902850650001702859650001402876650001002890650002102900650003402921650001302955650002002968650001502988650002803003650003503031650001803066650001103084700002103095700002103116700001703137700002003154700002203174700002103196700001603217700006503233773012203298856008303420852000903503655001203512IND60712491320221123004814.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071249132DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-020-00575-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTribout, Thierry10aConfirmed effects of candidate variants for milk production, udder health, and udder morphology in dairy cattle  ap. 55.  aBACKGROUND: Over the last years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on imputed whole-genome sequences (WGS) have been used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) and highlight candidate genes for important traits. However, in general this approach does not allow to validate the effects of candidate mutations or determine if they are truly causative for the trait(s) in question. To address these questions, we applied a two-step, within-breed GWAS approach on 15 traits (5 linked with milk production, 2 with udder health, and 8 with udder morphology) in Montbéliarde (MON), Normande (NOR), and Holstein (HOL) cattle. We detected the most-promising candidate variants (CV) using imputed WGS of 2515 MON, 2203 NOR, and 6321 HOL bulls, and validated their effects in three younger populations of 23,926 MON, 9400 NOR, and 51,977 HOL cows. RESULTS: Bull sequence-based GWAS detected 84 QTL: 13, 10, and 30 for milk production traits; 3, 0, and 2 for somatic cell score (SCS); and 8, 2 and 16 for udder morphology traits, in MON, NOR, and HOL respectively. Five genomic regions with effects on milk production traits were shared among the three breeds whereas six (2 for production and 4 for udder morphology and health traits) had effects in two breeds. In 80 of these QTL, 855 CV were highlighted based on the significance of their effects and functional annotation. The subsequent GWAS on MON, NOR, and HOL cows validated 8, 9, and 23 QTL for production traits; 0, 0, and 1 for SCS; and 4, 1, and 8 for udder morphology traits, respectively. In 47 of the 54 confirmed QTL, the CV identified in bulls had more significant effects than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the standard 50K chip. The best CV for each validated QTL was located in a gene that was functionally related to production (36 QTL) or udder (9 QTL) traits. CONCLUSIONS: Using this two-step GWAS approach, we identified and validated 54 QTL that included CV mostly located within functional candidate genes and explained up to 6.3% (udder traits) and 37% (production traits) of the genetic variance of economically important dairy traits. These CV are now included in the chip used to evaluate French dairy cattle and can be integrated into routine genomic evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-05-GENANIMAL-007 (CartoFine)cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aANR-08-GANI-034 (LactoScan)cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aANR-08-GENM-030-01 (Amasgen)cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aCartoFine & AmasgencAPIS-GENE 3aHolstein 3abulls 3acows 3adairy cattle 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variance 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3amilk production 3apopulation 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asomatic cells 3audders1 aCroiseau, Pascal1 aLefebvre, Rachel1 aBarbat, Anne1 aBoussaha, Mekki1 aFritz, Sébastien1 aBoichard, Didier1 aHoze, Chris1 aSanchez, Marie-Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1371-53420 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2020 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.55-55dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-020-00575-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03888naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011900173520234800292592002802640650001502668650003002683650001302713650001902726650001002745650001202755650001902767650001002786650001802796650001402814650002102828650004302849650001202892650001002904651001202914651001202926651001102938653001102949653000802960653001102968653001202979700002002991700001803011700002603029700001703055700001903072700002203091700002303113773011603136856008503252852000903337655001203346IND60736093520221123040433.0210918e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073609352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Mário,10aIncidence of the emerging pathogen Neonectria neomacrospora on Abies taxa in the National Arboreta in England (UK)  aIn 2008 a severe canker disease of firs (Abies spp.) caused by Neonectria neomacrospora was reported in Norway. In 2011, the same disease was reported in Denmark and, in 2013, it was included in EPPO (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization) Reporting Service as a new emerging disease. In 2015 the disease was detected in England causing dieback on firs. Different studies suggest different susceptibility levels of Abies species to N. neomacrospora. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the incidence of N. neomacrospora on two of the most important tree collections in England, Bedgebury National Pinetum (BNP) and Westonbirt The National Arboretum (WTNA). Surveys were carried out during January and February 2020. Visual assessment using a health scale from 0 to 10 was carried out on 780 trees comprising 46 different Abies species. Samples were collected from 290 symptomatic trees and isolations were performed in the laboratory to confirm the presence of the pathogen. Identification of the pathogen was confirmed by colony morphology and by real-time PCR. The disease was detected on 32 Abies species. In BNP, N. neomacrospora was isolated from 29% of the sampled trees on 25 different Abies spp., while at WTNA, N. neomacrospora was isolated on 44% of the sampled trees on 18 different Abies species. In total, there were 11 Abies species from which N. neomacrospora was isolated consistently in both BNP and WTNA: A. cephalonica, A. cilicica, A. concolor, A. firma, A. grandis, A. homolepis, A. nordmannniana, A. numidica, A. procera, A. vejarii and Abies × vilmorinii. Additionally, pathogenicity of N. neomacrospora was tested on 400 one-year-old seedlings of eight Abies taxa: A. alba, A. amabilis, A. concolor var. concolor, A. concolor var. lowiana, A. fraseri, A. grandis, A. nordmanniana and A. procera. Neonectria neomacrospora was pathogenic in all species. The largest lesions were detected on A. concolor, A. alba and A. amabilis and disease symptoms differed from species to species. Although N. neomacrospora is present in the tree collections studied, the damage caused by the fungus was not severe and no death of trees was recorded during this survey. However, climate change could play an important role on disease development and trees should be monitored in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeonectria 3aadministrative management 3aarboreta 3aclimate change 3adeath 3adieback 3aforest ecology 3afungi 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aplant protection 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asurveys 3atrees 3aDenmark 3aEngland 3aNorway 0aFungus 0aFir 0aCanker 0aDisease1 aReynolds, Chris1 aForster, Jack1 avan der Linde, Sietse1 aParrat, Matt1 aDvorak, Michal1 aRobertshaw, Brian1 aPérez-Sierra, Ana0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 July 15, v. 492 p.119207-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013800174300001400312520143600326592002801762650001101790650001501801650001201816650001501828650001801843650001801861650001301879650002101892650002201913650001601935651001101951653000801962653001301970653001501983653002201998653002502020653002302045700002502068700001602093700002002109700001802129700002002147773010202167856008502269852000902354655001202363IND60113366120221118234346.0160903e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011336612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAulagnier, Céline14aThe TOCATTA-χ model for assessing 14C transfers to grass: an evaluation for atmospheric operational releases from nuclear facilities  ap. 81-93.  aRadioactive 14C is formed as a by-product of nuclear power generation and from the operation of nuclear fuel reprocessing plants like AREVA-NC La Hague (North France), which releases about 15 TBq per year of 14C into the atmosphere. This article evaluates a recently improved radioecology model (TOCATTA-χ) to assess 14C transfers to grassland ecosystems under normal operating conditions. The new version of the TOCATTA model (TOCATTA-χ) includes developments that were derived from PaSiM, a pasture model for simulating grassland carbon and radiocarbon cycling. The TOCATTA-χ model has been tested against observations of 14C activity concentrations in grass samples collected monthly from six plots which are located around the periphery of the reprocessing plant. Simulated 14C activities are consistent with observations on both intensively managed and poorly managed grasslands, but an adaptation of the mean turn-over time for 14C within the plant is necessary in the model to account for different management practices. When atmospheric 14C activity concentrations are directly inferred from observations, TOCATTA-χ performs better than TOCATTA (the root mean square error is decreased by 45%), but when atmospheric 14C activity concentrations are not known and must be calculated, the uncertainty associated with the TOCATTA-χ model outcomes is estimated to be larger than the standard deviation of the observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3anuclear fuels 3anuclear power 3apastures 3apower generation 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 3aFrance 0a14C 0aTransfer 0aGrasslands 0aCompartment model 0aLong-term monitoring 0aNuclear facilities1 aLe Dizès, Séverine1 aMaro, Denis1 aHebert, Didier,1 aLardy, Romain1 aMartin, Raphael0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2013 June, v. 120 p.81-93dElsevier Ltdx0265-931X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03295naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011100175300001400286520181400300592002802114650001802142650001502160650004302175650001502218650003402233650002402267650001902291650001102310650001502321650001102336650000902347650001702356650001802373650000902391650001602400650000902416653002002425653001702445653002402462653001802486653000902504653001002513700002302523700002302546700001902569773009302588856008702681852000902768655001202777IND60585478420221121014915.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058547842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPielaat, Annemarie12aA risk based sampling design including exposure assessment linked to disease burden, uncertainty and costs  ap. 23-32.  aA methodology is presented to optimize a sampling plan for retail products to monitor the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in relation to disease burden. The optimization procedure links an exposure assessment, a quantitative measure for disease burden (i.e. Disability Adjusted Life Years), number of samples to be analyzed (based on uncertainty of the prevalence estimate) and costs for sample analysis. The methodology attributes DALY's on ‘pathogen-matrix level’ to ‘pathogen-food products’ using the exposure assessment. The subsequent procedure includes the number of samples that need to be analyzed per retail product such that the prevalences can be monitored within a preset uncertainty bound, and the costs per sample. The final optimization step sorts pathogen-product combinations using the costs per DALY criterion which results in a monitoring program with a maximum number of DALY's given a certain amount of money. An optimized sampling plan was established for four foodborne pathogens on meat products: Campylobacter in pork and poultry meat, Salmonella in pork, Toxoplasma in pork and Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 in beef, veal, and mutton/lamb. Results show that Campylobacter on poultry products and one Toxoplasma – pork combination consitute the top 10 in the proposed Dutch public health risk meat monitoring program. This optimized sampling plan monitors 98% of the total amount of DALY's attributed to the considered pathogen-animal species combinations. At the same time, the procedure gives insight in how the preset optimization criteria leads to the proposed set of pathogen-product combinations. An iterative implementation of updated model input (prevalences, DALY estimates) will lead to an up-to-date optimized risk based monitoring program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aSalmonella 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aToxoplasma 3adisability-adjusted life year 3aexposure assessment 3afood pathogens 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amutton 3apork 3apoultry meat 3apublic health 3arisk 3auncertainty 3aveal 0aRetail sampling 0aOptimization 0aExposure assessment 0aPublic health 0aDALY 0aCosts1 aChardon, Jurgen E.1 aWijnands, Lucas M.1 aEvers, Eric G.0 tFood control.g2018 Feb., v. 84 p.23-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005300140245012100193300001800314520042000332592002800752650002300780650002300803650001800826650001500844650001600859650001400875700001800889700001900907700001300926700001400939700001700953700001700970773013400987856007401121852000901195655001201204IND60617534320221120084943.0181025e20180626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061753432DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc03491e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXueThese authors contributed equally., Huan-Huan10aAsymmetrical etching of Ag nanoparticles into symmetry-reduced bi-metallic nanocups at the single-nanoparticle level  ap. 7227-7230.  aAsymmetrical etching of nanoparticles was achieved by employing interface-confined galvanic replacement reactions.

This review summarizes what is currently known about the effects of caffeine on behavior and its molecular mechanisms in invertebrates. Caffeine appears to have similar effects on locomotion and sleep in both invertebrates and mammals. Furthermore, as in mammals, caffeine appears to have complex effects on learning and memory. However, the underlying mechanisms for these effects may differ between invertebrates and vertebrates. While caffeine’s ability to cause release of intracellular calcium stores via ryanodine receptors and its actions as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor have been clearly established in invertebrates, its ability to interact with invertebrate adenosine receptors remains an important open question. Initial studies in insects and mollusks suggest an interaction between caffeine and the dopamine signaling pathway; more work needs to be done to understand the mechanisms by which caffeine influences signaling via biogenic amines. As of yet, little is known about whether other actions of caffeine in vertebrates, such as its effects on GABAAand glycine receptors, are conserved. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of caffeine remains to be elucidated. Overall behavioral responses to caffeine appear to be conserved amongst organisms; however, we are just beginning to understand the mechanisms underlying its effects across animal phyla.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acaffeine 3acalcium 3adopamine 3ainsects 3alocomotion 3amammals 3amemory 3amolluscs 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apharmacokinetics 3apollutants 3apurinergic receptors 3aryanodine receptors 3asignal transduction 3asleep0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2014 Apr., v. 71, no. 8 p.1375-1382dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-013-1497-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013200171520239100303592002802694650001602722650001802738650003002756650001102786650001102797650002002808650002302828650002102851650001902872650001202891650001202903650001102915650001102926650000902937650002402946650002202970650002002992650001403012651001603026653001603042653002803058653002103086653001703107653002703124700001903151700001903170700002303189773011603212856008503328852000903413655001203422IND60736093720221123023734.0210918e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073609372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatt, Michael S.10aUse of advanced modelling methods to predict dothistroma needle blight on Pinus radiata at a fine resolution within New Zealand  aDothistroma needle blight (DNB) is a damaging disease of many Pinaceae host taxa including the widely grown species Pinus radiata D. Don. However, little research has modelled the distribution of this disease at a fine spatial resolution from geospatial surfaces using advanced non-parametric methods. This study uses an extensive national dataset (n = 6276 observations) that describes the severity of DNB on plantation grown P. radiata with measurements expressed as a percentage of foliage within the stand affected by the disease (range 0–90%). Using these data the objectives of this research were to (i) compare the predictive precision of models of disease severity constructed using parametric and non-parametric approaches, (ii) determine whether the use of regression kriging is able to improve model fit, (iii) identify the key environmental determinants of disease severity using the most precise modelling methods and (iv) develop a fine scale map showing variation in disease severity throughout New Zealand. All predictions were made on a test dataset (n = 1883) that was not used for model fitting.Disease severity was most precisely predicted by the two non-parametric models eXtreme Gradient Boosting (RMSE = 11.37%, R² = 0.231) and random forest (RMSE = 11.28%, R² = 0.246) which both markedly outperformed the parametric multiple regression model (RMSE = 12.17%, R² = 0.120). The use of regression kriging considerably increased the precision for the multiple regression (RMSE = 11.88%, R² = 0.161) but did not improve model precision for the two non-parametric models.Random forest was the most precise model and included 14 variables, of which the time of the observation, stand age, relative humidity and solar radiation had the strongest influence on disease severity. A fine resolution map (25 m) created using random forest showed disease severity to be highest in northern and western areas of New Zealand, where relative humidity and rainfall are high. Low disease severity was predicted on the drier east coast of New Zealand and values were particularly low in the far south, where mean annual solar radiation is relatively low. This surface will assist forest managers in narrowing the search radius for the disease and prioritising areas for targeted deployment of disease resistance clones, provenances or alternative species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDothistroma 3aPinus radiata 3aadministrative management 3ablight 3acoasts 3adata collection 3adisease resistance 3adisease severity 3aforest ecology 3aforests 3akriging 3aleaves 3amodels 3arain 3aregression analysis 3arelative humidity 3asolar radiation 3astand age 3aNew Zealand 0aBiosecurity 0aDisease risk assessment 0aDisease severity 0aRadiata pine 0aRed band needle blight1 aTan, Alan Y.S.1 aFraser, Stuart1 aBulman, Lindsay S.0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 July 15, v. 492 p.119226-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03916naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245014000207300001100347520234800358592002802706596005502734650001302789650002302802650001202825650000902837650002302846650001902869650001302888650001102901650001402912650002002926650001602946650001302962650003002975650001703005650001503022650001203037650001503049650001303064650001003077650001403087700002103101700001803122700002103140700002303161773012203184856008303306852000903389655001203398IND60712491520221123004624.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071249152DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-020-00576-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAliakbari, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5213-054X14aThe impact of training on data from genetically-related lines on the accuracy of genomic predictions for feed efficiency traits in pigs  ap. 57.  aBACKGROUND: Most genomic predictions use a unique population that is split into a training and a validation set. However, genomic prediction using genetically heterogeneous training sets could provide more flexibility when constructing the training sets in small populations. The aim of our study was to investigate the potential of genomic prediction of feed efficiency related traits using training sets that combine animals from two different, but genetically-related lines. We compared realized prediction accuracy and prediction bias for different training set compositions for five production traits. RESULTS: Genomic breeding values (GEBV) were predicted using the single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction method in six scenarios applied iteratively to two genetically-related lines (i.e. 12 scenarios). The objective for all scenarios was to predict GEBV of pigs in the last three generations (~ 400 pigs, G7 to G9) of a given line. For each line, a control scenario was set up with a training set that included only animals from that line (target line). For all traits, adding more animals from the other line to the training set did not increase prediction accuracy compared to the control scenario. A small decrease in prediction accuracies was found for average daily gain, backfat thickness, and daily feed intake as the number of animals from the target line decreased in the training set. Including more animals from the other line did not decrease prediction accuracy for feed conversion ratio and residual feed intake, which were both highly affected by selection within lines. However, prediction biases were systematic for these cases and might be reduced with bivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that genomic prediction using a training set that includes animals from genetically-related lines can be as accurate as genomic prediction using a training set from the target population. With combined reference sets, accuracy increased for traits that were highly affected by selection. Our results provide insights into the design of reference populations, especially to initiate genomic selection in small-sized lines, for which the number of historical samples is small and that are developed simultaneously. This applies especially to poultry and pig breeding and to other crossbreeding schemes.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-16-CE20-0003cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aaccuracy 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3abias 3abivariate analysis 3abreeding value 3acrossing 3adesign 3aevolution 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3agenomics 3amarker-assisted selection 3apig breeding 3apopulation 3apoultry 3aprediction 3asampling 3aswine 3athickness1 aDelpuech, Emilie1 aLabrune, Yann1 aRiquet, Juliette1 aGilbert, Hélène,0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2020 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.57-57dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-020-00576-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245013000175300001300305520183700318592002802155650002502183650001702208650001402225650001602239650001402255650001302269650001402282650001402296650002002310650001002330650001902340650002502359650001702384650002302401650001202424650001002436650001402446650001702460650002102477650002202498650000902520650000902529650001802538650001802556650001602574650001402590650001302604653002202617653001302639653003602652653002102688653001402709653002702723700002302750773011202773856008302885852000902968655001202977IND60557703120221121154255.0190416e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055770312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jobaz.2016.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El-Twab, Sanaa M.10aCurcumin mitigates lithium-induced thyroid dysfunction by modulating antioxidant status, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines  ap. 7-19.  aLithium is an integral drug used in the management of acute mania, unipolar and bipolar depression and prophylaxis of bipolar disorders. It has also been shown to reduce suicidal risk and short term mortality. Few experimental studies have demonstrated the thyroid toxicity caused by lithium as well as the possible protective effect of curcumin. Twenty four male albino rats were divided into three groups; group I (control group), group II received lithium carbonate daily for 6weeks and group III received the same dose of lithium carbonate as group II concomitantly with curcumin for 6weeks. The specimens were prepared for histopathological, immunohistochemical and biochemical examination. Lithium-induced thyroid dysfunction evidenced by the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes represented by detached cells and vacuolated cytoplasm of some follicular cells and highly significant increase in positive immunostained of thyroglobulin and caspase-3 respectively. Moreover, a significant decrease in serum free triiodothyonine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) concomitant with significantly increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and thyroid lipid peroxidation (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels. Curcumin counteracted lithium-induced oxidative stress and inflammation as assessed by restoration of the antioxidant defenses and diminishing of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improvements in the degenerative changes of the thyroid gland. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that curcumin exerts thyroprotective effects against lithium carbonate mediated by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effect as indicated by caspase-3. This report also confers that the use of this drug should be justified for long treatment under direct medical supervision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3acurcumin 3acytokines 3acytoplasm 3adisease control 3adrugs 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3alithium 3amales 3amortality 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arisk 3athyroglobulin 3athyroid gland 3athyrotropin 3athyroxine 3atoxicity 0aLithium carbonate 0aCurcumin 0aHistopathology of thyroid gland 0aOxidative stress 0aApoptosis 0aInflammatory cytokines1 aAbdul-Hamid, Manal0 tJournal of Basic & Applied Zoology.g2016 Aug., v. 76 p.7-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23227x2090-98967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobaz.2016.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245010800174300001400282520078900296592002801085650001201113650001701125650003901142650001001181650001201191650001101203650002601214650003301240650001601273653001001289653002101299653002801320653003301348700002801381700001901409700001801428773009301446856008701539852000901626655001201635IND60585478720221121021949.0200509e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058547872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehretie, Solomon10aClassification of raw Ethiopian honeys using front face fluorescence spectra with multivariate analysis  ap. 83-88.  aFront face fluorescence measurements were carried out to classify raw honeys as such based on their floral origins.

Most existing dynamic freeze-drying models which predict this partial pressure describe mass transfer between the product and the condenser via a mass transfer resistance or a mass transfer coefficient. Experimental evidence suggests that such models can be significantly in error for some values of the sublimation flux, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and possibly incorrect assessment of primary drying termination, with potential risk of product damage if moving to secondary drying and increasing shelf temperature while some ice is still present. Assuming a binary gas transport model for vapor and inert gas leads to improved and consistent predictions and explains the apparent variation of the mass transfer resistance with total pressure, shelf temperature, and product sublimation area.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreeze drying 3aice 3amass transfer 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3arisk 3asublimation 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3avapors 0aConvection 0aDiffusion 0aDynamic model 0aLyophilization 0aMass transfer1 aFonseca, Fernanda1 aPassot, Stéphanie1 aFlick, Denis0 tDrying technology.g2015 Nov. 18, v. 33, no. 15-16 p.1849-1858dTaylor & Francisx1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2015.10400253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04011naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009300165300001600258500001500274520205200289592002802341650002102369650002602390650002602416650001002442650001102452650001002463650001502473650001502488650001602503650001202519650002402531650002102555650001102576650002102587650001702608650001502625650002302640650002402663650001702687650003302704650001402737650002002751650002902771650001302800650001302813650001602826650002202842650001502864650001702879651001002896653001902906653002702925653002502952653002302977653001503000653001303015700001803028700001803046700001703064700001703081773011003098856008403208852000903292655001203301IND60123216020221121114902.0150325e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012321602DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2013.7859182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Sili10aEffects of vegetation restoration types on soil quality in Yuanmou dry-hot valley, China  ap. 347-360.  a2019-12-04  aSoil erosion has resulted in serious land degradation in Yuanmou dry-hot valley, Yunnan province, China. Vegetation restoration had been widely developed in this hot and arid area. In this work we investigate the quality of rhizosphere soils under four restoration species in the towns of Zuolin (gully bed) and Yuanma (slope area). The vegetation included two trees [ Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis L.] for the slope area, one shrubland [ Dodonaea viscosa (Linn.) Jacq. Enum.] and one native, natural grassland [ Heteropogon contortus (L.) Beauv.] for gully bed. Soil physical (bulk density and soil moisture content), chemical [pH, soil organic matter, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) contents], and microbial (microbial biomass and microbe quantity) properties and soil enzyme (catalase, protease and urease) activities were determined. Compared to the soils collected from other vegetation types, the soil under Leucaena leucocephala had the highest content of soil organic matter, total N, available N, total P, available P, available K, microbial biomass carbon (C), and the highest microbe quantity and enzyme activities. Five parameters (organic matter, pH, microbial biomass N, total K and protease activity), which had the greatest weight in the principal components analysis, were selected to calculate the soil quality index (SQI). The final SQI values implied that restoring Leucaena leucocephala greatly improved the soil quality, while restoration with Eucalyptus camaldulensis decreased the soil quality of the slope area. Plant recovery with Dodonaea viscosa and Heteropogon contortus on the gully bed affected the population of soil microbial communities but didn't improve the SQI values. It can therefore be seen that types of plants used for recovery in gully-developed regions in dry-hot valleys must be chosen cautiously: Leucaena leucocephala is a good choice for soil revegetation of the slope area, but the revegetation patterns on the gully bed still need further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDodonaea viscosa 3aLeucaena leucocephala 3aHeteropogon contortus 3atrees 3acarbon 3atowns 3aphosphorus 3agrasslands 3arhizosphere 3avalleys 3asoil microorganisms 3aland restoration 3aurease 3aland degradation 3asoil density 3ashrublands 3asoil water content 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3aprincipal component analysis 3apotassium 3aenzyme activity 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3acatalase 3anitrogen 3aproteinases 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil types 3asoil erosion 3aChina 0aorganic matter 0aVegetation restoration 0amicrobial properties 0asoil quality index 0aEucalyptus 0aLeucaena1 aChen, Anqiang1 aFang, Haidong1 aWu, Junliang1 aLiu, Gangcai0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2013 June 1, v. 59, no. 3 p.347-360dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2013.7859183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245012000168520187500288592002802163650003402191650002102225650001702246650001702263650001902280650001202299650001302311650001202324650002702336650003702363700002702400700002602427700002402453700002602477700003002503700002402533773012602557856007802683852000902761655001202770IND60729197320221116232456.0210228e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072919732DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100201482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Joana  L.

For that, the synthetic strategy relied on base-promoted aldol condensation reactions of methyl betulonate, which was previously prepared from natural BA, with appropriate benzaldehydes, followed by cleavage of the methyl protecting groups with BBr₃. It is noteworthy that the HBr release during the work-up of the cleavage reactions led to the rearrangement of the lupane-type skeleton of the expected betulonic acid derivatives into oleanane-type compounds 4a–d. The synthesized compounds 4a–d were designed to have specific substitution patterns at C-2 of the triterpene scaffold, allowing the establishment of a structure-activity relationship. The radical scavenging ability of 4a–d was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH•) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS•⁺) scavenging assays. In particular, derivative 4c, bearing a catechol unit, revealed to be the most efficient scavenger against both free radicals DPPH• and ABTS•⁺. Subsequently, we designed two analogues of the hit derivative 4c in order to achieve more potent antioxidant agents: (i) the first analogue carries an additional unsaturation in its lateral chain at C-2 (analogue 5) and (ii) in the second analogue, E-ring was kept in its open form (analogue 6). It was observed that the presence of an extended π-conjugated system at C-2 contributed to an increased scavenging effect, since analogue 5 was more active than 6, α-tocopherol, and 4c in the ABTS•⁺ assay.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidants 3abenzaldehyde 3abetulinic acid 3abiomass 3acatechol 3acations 3acondensation reactions 3astructure-activity relationships1 aGonçalves, Cristiana 1 aFerreira, Ricardo  M.1 aCardoso, Susana  M.1 aFreire, Carmen  S.

After thawing the survival, fertilization, cleavage and blastocyst rates were compared with unfrozen oocytes. It can be concluded that 15% cryoprotectant (7.5% DMSO+7.5% EG), instead of the commonly used 30% (15% DMSO+15% EG), could be helpful by moderating the probable toxic effects of vitrification solution in mouse oocyte during vitrification by cryotop. 3acryopreservation 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aethylene glycol 3amice 3aoocytes 3athawing 3atoxicity 3avitrification1 aHosseini, Ahmad1 aFarrokhi, Naser1 aAmidi, Fardin1 aCarvalhais, Isabel1 aChaveiro, Antonio1 aSilva, Fernando Moreira da0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2011 Sept., v. 91, no. 3 p.385-388dCanadian Science Publishingx0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/cjas100423Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03548naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245011100204300001000315520224000325592002802565596010202593650002302695650000902718650001902727650001402746650001902760650001702779650001602796650001402812650001502826650001002841700002402851700002602875700001602901700002202917773012002939856008203059852000903141655001203150IND60712491920221123003358.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071249192DNAL7 a10.1186/s12711-020-0527-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsk, Birgitte1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6933-602914aThe predictive ability of indirect genetic models is reduced when culled animals are omitted from the data  ap. 8.  aBACKGROUND: Physical removal of individuals from groups causes reductions in group sizes and changes in group composition, which may affect the predictive ability of estimates of indirect genetic effects of animals on phenotypes of group mates. We hypothesized that including indirect genetic effects of culled animals and of animals without phenotypes in the analysis affects estimates of genetic parameters, improves predictive ability, and reduces bias of predicted breeding values. We tested this by applying different editing procedures, i.e. omission of individuals or groups from the data, and genetic models, i.e. a classical and an indirect genetic model (IGM) without or with weighting of indirect genetic effects based on the relative proportion of time spent in the pen or space allowance. Data consisted of average daily gain for 123,567 pigs in 11,111 groups, from which 3% of individuals in 25% of groups were prematurely removed from the group. RESULTS: The estimate of total heritability was higher (0.29 to 0.34) than that of direct heritability (0.23 to 0.25) regardless of the editing procedures and IGM used. Omission of individuals or groups from the data reduced the predictive ability of estimates of indirect genetic effects by 8 to 46%, and the predictive ability of estimates of the combined direct and indirect genetic effects by up to 4%. Omission of full groups introduced bias in predicted breeding values. Weighting of indirect genetic effects reduced the predictive ability of their estimates by at least 19% and of the estimates of the combined direct and indirect genetic effects by 1%. CONCLUSIONS: We identified significant indirect genetic effects for growth in pigs. Culled animals should neither be removed from the data nor accounted for by weighting their indirect genetic effects in the model based on the relative proportion of time spent in the pen or space allowance, because it will reduce predictive ability and increase bias of predicted breeding values. Information on culled animals is important for prediction of indirect genetic effects and must be accounted for in IGM analyses by including fixed regressions based on relative time spent within the pen or relative space allowance.  aPublisher supplied data  a34009-14-0849cGreen Development and Demonstration Program; Ministry of Environment and Food (DK) 3aaverage daily gain 3abias 3abreeding value 3aevolution 3agenetic models 3aheritability 3ainformation 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aswine1 aChristensen, Ole F.1 aHeidaritabar, Marzieh1 aMadsen, Per1 aNielsen, Hanne M.0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2020 Dec., v. 52, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-020-0527-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011400167300001600281506002800297520136200325592002801687506003701715650002201752650001001774650001001784650001401794651001101808700002301819700002201842700002401864700002401888700002601912700002501938773013501963856007802098852000902176655001202185IND60785148720221207125055.0161219e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078514872DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha442104882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPAVLOVIĆ, Snežana10aMorphology, Pathogenicity and Molecular Identification of Fusarium spp. Associated with Anise Seeds in Serbia  ap. 411-417.  aResource is Open Access  aAnise (Pimpinella anisum L.) is an important medicinal spice plant that belongs to the family Apiaceae. Anise seeds are rich in essential oils and this is a reason why anise production in Serbia has increased over the last decade. During a routine health inspection on anise seeds collected from three localities in the province of Vojvodina (Mošorin, Veliki Radinci and Ostojićevo) during 2012 and 2013, it was found out that Fusarium spp. were a commonly observed fungi. The presence of Fusarium fungion the seed samples ranged from 3.75-13.75%. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify the strains of Fusarium species present on anise seed samples as it is necessary that commercially used anise seeds are completely free of Fusarium. Based on morphological, microscopic characteristics and a molecular identification by sequencing of TEF gene, the presence of the following species was confirmed on the anise seeds: F. tricinctum, F. proliferatum, F. equiseti, F. oxysporum, F. sporotrichoides, F. incarnatum and F. verticillioides. According to our knowledge and research, this is the first report of F. tricinctum and F. sporotrichoides as pathogens on anise seeds in the world. All seven isolates of Fusarium species are pathogenic to the anise seedlings, while the most virulent species were F. oxysporum, F. tricinctum and F. incarnatum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPimpinella anisum 3aanise 3agenes 3avirulence 3aSerbia1 aRistić, Danijela,1 aVUČUROVIĆ, Ivan1 aSTEVANOVIĆ, Miloš1 aStojanović, Saša,1 aKUZMANOVIĆ, Slobodan1 aSTAROVIĆ, Mira Sava0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2016 Dec., v. 44, no. 2 p.411-417dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha442104883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245013700164520136100301592002801662650001501690650002101705650001601726650001301742650001801755650004101773650001901814650002001833650002801853650001401881650000901895700001801904700001501922700002101937700002201958700001801980700002401998700002202022773012602044856007802170852000902248655001202257IND60729197520221116233217.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072919752DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100202392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiura, Kouichi 10aOxidized High-Density Lipoprotein Shows a Stepwise Increase as Fibrosis Progresses in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease  aPatients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) show dyslipidemia and a high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, conventional atherosclerotic lipids are found at low levels in NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis, in whom the risk for CHD is extremely high. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of oxidized high-density lipoprotein (oxHDL), an emerging atherosclerotic biomarker, in patients with NAFLD. A total of 32 non-NAFLD subjects and 106 patients with NAFLD were enrolled. The fibrosis grades were stratified using non-invasive methods, including the Fibrosis-4 index and NAFLD fibrosis score. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels were significantly low in patients with advanced liver fibrosis. In contrast, oxHDL levels were high in NAFLD patients and showed a stepwise increase as fibrosis progressed. These oxHDL levels were independent of the HDL cholesterol levels, and statin use did not influence the oxHDL levels. Obese patients showed no increase in oxHDL levels, whereas patients with a low handgrip strength showed high oxHDL levels in NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. In conclusion, oxHDL is a potential biomarker for assessing the status of patients with NAFLD, including CHD and metabolic/nutritional disturbance, and particular cases with advanced liver fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acoronary disease 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3ahand strength 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahyperlipidemia 3aliver cirrhosis 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoxidation 3arisk1 aArai, Naoshi 1 aGoka, Rie 1 aMorimoto, Naoki 1 aWatanabe, Shunji 1 aIsoda, Norio 1 aYamamoto, Hironori 1 aKotani, Kazuhiko 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100202393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245015700214300001200371520193300383592002802316596004702344596004802391650002002439650001902459650002302478650001002501650002002511650002402531650001002555650002202565650002202587650003402609650001302643650001602656650001802672650001502690650001302705650001202718650001402730650001602744650002802760650002202788700001902810700002202829700001902851700002402870700002102894700001702915773010002932856008303032852000903115655001203124IND60712492720221120162147.0201208e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071249272DNAL7 a10.1186/s12863-020-00920-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalker-Gieske, Clemens1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9160-190910aMeta-analyses of genome wide association studies in lines of laying hens divergently selected for feather pecking using imputed sequence level genotypes  ap. 114.  aBACKGROUND: Feather pecking (FP) is damaging behavior in laying hens leading to global economic losses in the layer industry and massive impairments of animal welfare. The objective of the study was to discover genetic variants and affected genes that lead to FP behavior. To achieve that we imputed low-density genotypes from two different populations of layers divergently selected for FP to sequence level by performing whole genome sequencing on founder and half-sib individuals. In order to decipher the genetic structure of FP, genome wide association studies and meta-analyses of two resource populations were carried out by focusing on the traits ‘feather pecks delivered’ (FPD) and the ‘posterior probability of a hen to belong to the extreme feather pecking subgroup’ (pEFP). RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, we discovered numerous genes that are affected by polymorphisms significantly associated with the trait FPD. Among them SPATS2L, ZEB2, KCHN8, and MRPL13 which have been previously connected to psychiatric disorders with the latter two being responsive to nicotine treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that phosphatidylinositol signaling is affected by genes identified in the GWAS and that the Golgi apparatus as well as brain structure may be involved in the development of a FP phenotype. Further, we were able to validate a previously discovered QTL for the trait pEFP on GGA1, which contains variants affecting NIPA1, KIAA1211L, AFF3, and TSGA10. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence for the involvement of numerous genes in the propensity to exhibit FP behavior that could aid in the selection against this unwanted trait. Furthermore, we identified variants that are involved in phosphatidylinositol signaling, Golgi metabolism and cell structure and therefore propose changes in brain structure to be an influential factor in FP, as already described in human neuropsychiatric disorders.  aPublisher supplied data  aTE622/4-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aBE3703/8-2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aGolgi apparatus 3aanimal welfare 3abehavior disorders 3abrain 3afeather pecking 3afinancial economics 3agenes 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotype 3alaying hens 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolism 3anicotine 3apecking 3aphenotype 3aprobability 3aquantitative trait loci 3asequence analysis1 aIffland, Hanna1 aPreuß, Siegfried1 aBessei, Werner1 aDrögemüller, Cord1 aBennewitz, Jörn1 aTetens, Jens0 tBMC genetics.g2020 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.114-114dBioMed CentralwJournal:2166x1471-21567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-020-00920-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245009900179300001800278500002000296520169400316592002802010650001802038650001302056650002302069650001002092650002202102650001402124650001602138650001102154650002202165650001102187650002002198650002202218650001402240650001402254650002502268700001502293700001402308773013602322856008802458852000902546655001202555IND60595230420221117232723.0180530e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059523042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02576.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStireman, J. O., III10aRampant host‐ and defensive phenotype‐associated diversification in a goldenrod gall midge  ap. 1991-2004.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNatural selection can play an important role in the genetic divergence of populations and their subsequent speciation. Such adaptive diversification, or ecological speciation, might underlie the enormous diversity of plant‐feeding insects that frequently experience strong selection pressures associated with host plant use as well as from natural enemies. This view is supported by increasing documentation of host‐associated (genetic) differentiation in populations of plant‐feeding insects using alternate hosts. Here, we examine evolutionary diversification in a single nominal taxon, the gall midge Asteromyia carbonifera (O.S.), with respect to host plant use and gall phenotype. Because galls can be viewed as extended defensive phenotypes of the midges, gall morphology is likely to be a reflection of selective pressures by enemies. Using phylogenetic and comparative analyses of mtDNA and nuclear sequence data, we find evidence that A. carbonifera populations are rapidly diversifying along host plant and gall morphological lines. At a broad scale, geography explains surprisingly little genetic variation, and there is little evidence of strict co‐cladogenesis with their Solidago hosts. Gall morphology is relatively labile, distinct gall morphs have evolved repeatedly and colonized multiple hosts, and multiple genetically and morphologically distinct morphs frequently coexist on a single host plant species. These results suggest that Asteromyia carbonifera is in the midst of an adaptive radiation driven by multitrophic selective pressures. Similar complex community pressures are likely to play a role in the diversification of other herbivorous insect groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCecidomyiidae 3aSolidago 3aadaptive radiation 3agalls 3agenetic variation 3ageography 3ahost plants 3amidges 3amitochondrial DNA 3amorphs 3anatural enemies 3anatural selection 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aphytophagous insects1 aDevlin, H.1 aAbbot, P.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2012 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1991-2004dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02576.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245011800166506002800284520159500312592002801907506003701935650001701972650001701989650001602006650001602022650001502038650003102053650001002084650001002094650001602104650002902120650001202149650001902161650001702180650000902197650001602206650001502222653003302237653002802270700001802298700001802316700001902334700001702353700002402370700002002394773012002414856007802534852000902612655001202621IND60785149020221207101755.0210630s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078514902DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha492123062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNGUYEN, Khiem Minh10aTemperature-mediated shifts in chlorophyll biosynthesis in leaves of chlorophyll b-lacking rice (Oryza sativa L.)  aResource is Open Access  aExtreme temperatures have become a threat to crop yields. To maintain plant growth and yield, chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis plays a crucial role in adaptation to temperature stress. This study investigated the influence of temperature on the biosynthesis and characteristics of pigments (Chl a, Chl b, and carotenoids) in the leaves of Chl b-lacking mutant rice (Chlorina 1, ch1) and wild-type rice (Norin No.8, wt). The ch1 showed thinner stacked grana caused by a decrease in thylakoid membranes per granum at 15 °C, whereas the destacked grana were observed at 35 °C after 12 h incubation. However, the grana are stacked normally, along with the absence of Chl b, and a significantly decreased amount of Chl a in both wt and ch1 were observed after heat stress exposure, demonstrating that light-harvesting complex II proteins are involved in grana stacking. Ch1 was sensitive to 15 °C during the first 4 h of incubation but it subsequently adapted to the cold environment. In addition, there were no significant differences in the photosynthesis between wt and ch1 after 12 h incubation at 35 °C. Differentially expressed gene (DEGs) analysis revealed that GluRS expression decreased, which resulted in a decline in Chl biosynthesis in wt and ch1 at 35 °C. At 8 h and 12 h, there were no significant differences in the expression of DEGs involved in Chl biosynthesis and degradation between wt and ch1 at 15 °C. ALAD expression in wt and ch1 at 15 °C decreased until it was undetectable. These findings suggested that ch1 may adapt to temperatures ranging from 15 °C to 35 °C.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acold zones 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrana 3aheat stress 3alight harvesting complex 3amutants 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3arice 3atemperature 3athylakoids 0achlorophyll b-lacking mutant 0atemperature sensitivity1 aYANG, Zhi-Wei1 aSHIH, Tin-Han1 aLIN, Szu-Hsien1 aLIN, Jun-Wei1 aNGUYEN, Hoang Chinh1 aYang, Chi-ming,0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2021, v. 49, no. 2dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha492123063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007700163520149900240592002801739650002501767650001401792650001301806650001101819650001701830650001501847650001701862650002101879650001601900650002801916650001701944650002501961700002801986700002002014700001902034700002002053700003202073700003702105773012602142856007802268852000902346655001202355IND60729197920221116232524.0210228e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072919792DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100202432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuero, Javier 10aGrape Stem Extracts with Potential Anticancer and Antioxidant Properties  aThe application of plant extracts for therapeutic purposes has been used in traditional medicine because plants contain bioactive compounds with beneficial properties for health. Currently, the use of these compounds that are rich in polyphenols for the treatment and prevention of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, many of them related to oxidative stress, is gaining certain relevance. Polyphenols have been shown to have antimutagenic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to study the potential effect of grape stem extracts (GSE), rich in phenolic compounds, in the treatment of cancer, as well as their role in the prevention of this disease associated with its antioxidant power. For that purpose, three cancer lines (Caco-2, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231) were used, and the results showed that grape stem extracts were capable of showing an antiproliferative effect in these cells through apoptosis cell death associated with a modification of the mitochondrial potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Additionally, grape stem extracts showed an antioxidant effect on differentiated intestinal cells that could protect the intestine from diseases related to oxidative stress. Therefore, grape extracts contain bioactive principles with important biological properties and could be used as bio-functional food ingredients to prevent diseases or even to improve certain aspects of human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3adiabetes 3agrapes 3ahuman health 3aintestines 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine1 aJiménez-Moreno, Nerea 1 aEsparza, Irene 1 aOsada, Jesús 1 aCerrada, Elena 1 aAncín-Azpilicueta, Carmen 1 aRodríguez-Yoldi, María  Jesús0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 10, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100202433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002700189245012100216300001600337520142400353592002801777653002101805653002301826653002601849653000901875653001701884700003201901700002101933773014101954856008202095852000902177655001202186IND60557703920221121154236.0161103e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055770392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpha.2016.04.0072doi7 aPMC57626272pmcid7 a294039992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramaniyan, Boopathi10aIsocoreopsin: An active constituent of n-butanol extract of Butea monosperma flowers against colorectal cancer (CRC)  ap. 318-325.  aThe herb Butea monosperma constitutes several human health beneficial components, which are mostly studied for their anticancer effects. In this study, the activity of n-butanol fractions of B. monosperma floral extract was examined on inhibiting aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in azoxymethane induced Wistar albino rats. The n-butanol extracts (150mg/kg) decreased the ACF formation (per rat) by 92% and 78% in short- and long-term in vivo treatments, respectively. All the compounds in the n-butanol extract were isolated and purified using column and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their structures were characterized using UV–visible spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electrospray–ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI–MS) to determine important flavonoids, namely isocoreopsin, butrin and isobutrin. These compounds were studied for their free radical scavenging and anticancer activities. The compound isocoreopsin showed significantly greater efficacy in cell death on human colon and liver cancer cell lines (50μg/mL in HT-29 and 100μg/mL in HepG2) than butrin (100μg/mL in HT-29 and 500μg/mL in HepG2) and isobutrin (80μg/mL in HT-29 and 150μg/mL in HepG2). These results suggest that isocoreopsin, butrin and isobutrin are the important key compounds for the chemoprevention of colon cancer and isocoreopsin can be considered as a promising novel drug.  aPublisher supplied data 0aButea monosperma 0an-Butanol extracts 0aColumn chromatography 0aHPLC 0aIsocoreopsin1 aPolachi, Navaneethakrishnan1 aMathan, Ganeshan0 tJournal of Pharmaceutical Analysis.g2016 Oct., v. 6 p.318-325dElsevier B.V.aXi'an Jiaotong UniversitywJournal:23448x2095-17797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245009900171300001800270500002000288520192300308592002802231650002002259650001502279650001002294650001202304650001402316650001402330650001002344700001502354700001302369700001502382773013602397856008802533852000902621655001202630IND60595230920221117232729.0180530e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059523092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02586.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWills, M.

These worms were an important component of marine communities during the Palaeozoic, but were especially abundant and diverse in the Cambrian. Today, they comprise just seven genera in four families. Priapulids were among the first groups used to test hypotheses concerning the morphological disparity of Cambrian fossils relative to the extant fauna. A previous study sampled at the generic level, concluding that Cambrian genera embodied marginally less morphological diversity than their extant counterparts. Here, we sample predominantly at the species level and include numerous fossils and some extant forms described in the last fifteen years. Empirical morphospaces for priapulids, archaeopriapulids and palaeoscolecids are relatively insensitive to changes in the taxon or character sample: their overall form has altered little, despite the markedly improved sampling. Cambrian and post‐Cambrian genera occupy adjacent rather than broadly overlapping regions of these spaces, and Cambrian species still show lower morphological disparity than their post‐Cambrian counterparts. Crucially, the significance of this difference has increased with improved taxon sampling over research time. In contrast with empirical morphospaces, the phylogeny of priapulids, archaeopriapulids and palaeoscolecids derived from morphological characters is extremely sensitive to details of taxon sampling and the manner in which characters are weighted. However, the extant Priapulidae and Halicryptidae invariably resolve as sister families, with this entire clade subsequently being sister group to the Maccabeidae. In our most inclusive trees, the extant Tubiluchidae are separated from these other living taxa by a number of small, intervening fossil clades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambrian period 3acarnivores 3afauna 3afossils 3aphylogeny 3aproboscis 3atrees1 aGerber, S.1 aRuta, M.1 aHughes, M.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2012 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.2056-2076dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02586.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017200160300001800332520037400350592002800724650001600752650002600768650003600794650002300830650002100853650002300874650001100897650001300908650002700921650001400948650002000962700001800982700001901000700002301019700001601042773013401058856007401192852000901266655001201275IND60617535220221120074944.0181025e20180626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061753522DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc03556c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaiswal, Yogesh10aRapid synthesis of polysubstituted phenanthridines from simple aliphatic/aromatic nitriles and iodo arenes via Pd(ii) catalyzed domino C–C/C–C/C–N bond formation  ap. 7207-7210.  aAn efficient and straightforward method has been developed for the synthesis of polysubstituted phenanthridines from simple aryl iodides and alkyl/aryl nitriles via the palladium-catalyzed nucleophilic addition of aryl iodides to nitriles followed by cascade formation of C–C and C–N bonds viz. in situ generated imine directed sequential two fold C–H activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3aimines 3anitriles 3aorganoiodine compounds 3apalladium 3aphenanthridines1 aKumar, Yogesh1 aPal, Jagannath1 aSubramanian, Ranga1 aKumar, Amit0 tChemical communications.g2018 June 26, v. 54, no. 52 p.7207-7210dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc03556c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009600164300001600260500001500276520152800291592002801819650001301847650002601860650001101886650002101897650001901918650002401937650001201961650001501973650001501988650001602003650002502019650001402044650001002058650001802068650001102086650002002097651001002117653001102127653002402138653001602162653002002178653001702198700001502215700001502230773011002245856008402355852000902439655001202448IND60123216820221121184440.0150325e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012321682DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2013.7954752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, X.J.10aImpacts of soil erosion on organic carbon and nutrient dynamics in an alpine grassland soil  ap. 660-668.  a2019-12-04  aThe impact of soil erosion on the nutrient dynamics in alpine grassland soils is still an essential problem. Selecting a grass-covered hillslope in eastern Tibet Plateau, the cesium-137 (¹³⁷Cs) technique was used to determine the impacts of soil erosion on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total potassium (TK). The ¹³⁷Cs data revealed that there were distinct soil redistribution patterns in different hillslope positions because of the influences of slope runoff, plant coverage and grazing activity. For the upper slope, soil erosion first decreased downward, followed by soil deposition in its lower part. In contrast, for middle and toe slopes, there was an increasing soil erosion along a downslope transect. Across the lower slope, soil erosion showed an irregular variation. Influenced by the selective transport of water erosion, SOC, TN and TP storage decreased with increasing soil erosion in upper, middle and toe slopes. In contrast, SOC, TN and TP storage varied little with soil erosion in the lower slope. On the whole hillslope, TK storage also varied little with soil erosion due to the large amount of potassium elements derived from soil parent materials. Particularly noteworthy was the greatest storage of SOC, TN and TP in the lower slope where most obvious net soil erosion occurred, which is closely related to the humus accumulation combined with gravel separation as well as weathering and pedogenesis of parent rocks induced by soil freeze-thaw.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplateaus 3asoil parent materials 3agravel 3anitrogen content 3asoil formation 3asoil organic carbon 3agrazing 3aweathering 3aphosphorus 3aparent rock 3acarbon sequestration 3apotassium 3ahumus 3awater erosion 3arunoff 3agrassland soils 3aChina 0acarbon 0aalpine soil quality 0afreeze-thaw 0a137Cs technique 0asoil erosion1 aZhao, T.Q.1 aQiao, X.N.0 tSoil science and plant nutrition.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 59, no. 4 p.660-668dTaylor & Francisx1747-07657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2013.7954753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245006900180300001800249520123700267592002801504650002501532650001101557650002601568650002201594650001501616650001401631650001301645650002001658650001601678653001701694653001501711653003001726700002401756700001901780700001401799700002101813773009401834856008101928852000902009655001202018IND4461994820221119232138.0160323e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446199482DNAL7 a224404072pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311110004982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToro, M. A.10aAssessing the genetic diversity in small farm animal populations  ap. 1669-1683.  aGenetic variation is vital for the populations to adapt to varying environments and to respond to artificial selection; therefore, any conservation and development scheme should start from assessing the state of variation in the population. There are several marker-based and pedigree-based parameters to describe genetic variation. The most suitable ones are rate of inbreeding and effective population size, because they are not dependent on the amount of pedigree records. The acceptable level for effective population size can be considered from different angles leading to a conclusion that it should be at least 50 to 100. The estimates for the effective population size can be computed from the genealogical records or from demographic and marker information when pedigree data are not available. Marker information could also be used for paternity analysis and for estimation of coancestries. The sufficient accuracy in marker-based parameters would require typing thousands of markers. Across breeds, diversity is an important source of variation to rescue problematic populations and to introgress new variants. Consideration of adaptive variation brings new aspects to the estimation of the variation between populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial selection 3abreeds 3afarmed animal species 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding 3apaternity 3apedigree 3apopulation size 3asmall farms 0alocal breeds 0ainbreeding 0aeffective population size1 aMeuwissen, T.

On 20% of the ozone season (April–September) afternoons from 2004 to 2015, mid-afternoon 500-m back trajectories calculated from PSPNY cross New York border from the south and spend less than three hours in New York State, in this area of negligible local pollution emissions. One-hour (2p.m.–3p.m.) O3 concentrations during these inflowing conditions were 46 ± 13 ppb, and ranged from a minimum of 15 ppb to a maximum of 84 ppb. On average during 2004–2015, each year experienced 11.8 days with inflowing 1-hr O3 concentrations exceeding 50 ppb, 4.3 days with O3 > 60 ppb, and 1.5 days had O3 > 70 ppb. During the same period, 8-hr average concentrations (10a.m. to 6p.m.) exceeded 50 ppb on 10.0 days per season, while 3.9 days exceeded 60 ppb, and 70 ppb was exceeded 1.2 days per season. Two afternoons of minimal in-state emission influences with high ozone concentrations were analyzed in more detail. Synoptic and back trajectory analysis, including comparison with upwind ozone concentrations, indicated that the two periods were characterized as photo-chemically aged air containing high inflowing O3 concentrations most likely heavily influenced by pollution emissions from states upwind of New York including Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Ohio. These results suggest that New York state-level attempts to comply with National Ambient Air Quality Standards by regulating in-state O3 precursor NOx and organic emissions would be very difficult, since air frequently enters New York State very close to or in excess of Federal Air Quality Standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Ambient Air Quality Standards 3aair 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aemissions 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen oxides 3aozone 3apollution 3aNew York 3aOhio 3aPennsylvania 3aTennessee 3aWest Virginia 0aRegional ozone transport 0aBackground ozone 0aOzone standards1 aKent, John1 aWalcek, Chris0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Sept., v. 141 p.454-461dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245016200173300001600335500001100351520099600362592002801358650001701386650002901403650001101432650003001443650001201473650002501485650002001510650001601530650001901546650001501565700001801580773011901598852000901717856008901726655001201815IND2334398820221120175529.0210417e200308  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233439882DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00811.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClemens, Stephan10aSchizosaccharomyces pombe as a model for metal homeostasis in plant cells: the phytochelatin‐dependent pathway is the main cadmium detoxification mechanism  ap. 323-330.  aREVIEW  aSequestration of metal ions by phytochelatins is an important metal tolerance mechanism in a wide range of organisms including plants and certain fungi. Substantial progress in understanding phytochelatin formation at the molecular level has been made in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The genome of S. pombe has been completely sequenced and all the necessary tools of functional genomics are available. Since most other proteins implicated in plant metal tolerance and homeostasis are also present in this yeast, it represents a very powerful system to elucidate basic mechanisms of metal buffering, sequestration, and toxicity in cells that form phytochelatins. Here, we summarize the work on phytochelatin formation and metal homeostasis in S. pombe. We describe examples of molecular insights obtained from experiments with S. pombe that will be useful in guiding studies with plants. We also provide evidence for the dominance of the phytochelatin pathway in Cd detoxification in S. pombe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheavy metals 3ametabolic detoxification 3amodels 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3acadmium 3abiochemical pathways 3ametal tolerance 3ahomeostasis 3aphytochelatins 3ametal ions1 aSimm, Claudia0 tnew phytologist.g2003 Aug., v. 159, no. 2 p.323-330dBlackwell Publishing Ltd.wJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00811.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02466naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245021600178520125700394592002801651650000901679650003301688650001601721650001401737653002701751653002001778653002201798653002501820653000801845700002001853700002101873700002101894773010501915856008702020852000902107655001202116IND60766081620221122050847.0220628e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076608162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHemmat Esfe, Mohammad10aComparison of viscosity behavior of hybrid nano-lubricants containing Al2O3-MWCNT nanoparticles dispersed in SAE XWX engine oils to determine the optimal behavior of nano-lubricants based on experimental studies  aIn this study, the performance of hybrid nano-lubricants in different laboratory conditions was compared. Laboratory observations show that in different test conditions, the flow of nano-lubricants is non-Newtonian and pseudo-plastic type. It was found that the viscosity of nano-lubricant (μnf) depends on temperature, shear rate (γ̇) and solid volume fraction (SVF). The highest increase and decrease in viscosity compared to the base oil in the studied conditions belong to nano-lubricants containing 10W40 with a + 34.97% increase and 5W50 with − 9.64%, respectively. It was also found that in different cases, the rheological behavior of MWCNT-Al₂O₃/5W50 nano-lubricants has a more controlled viscosity behavior after adding nanoparticles than the other competing nano-lubricants. Also by using of response surface methodology (RSM), a three-dimensional nonlinear mathematical relationship with R-Squared= 0.9997 is presented to predict the experimental data. The Margin of Deviation (MOD) is measured in the range of − 2.37%<MOD< 2.4% that shows the high performance of designed and proposed mathematical correlation. Also, μnf sensitivity analysis showed the highest sensitivity occurred in SVF= 1% and T = 55 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoils 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aHybrid nano-lubricants 0aNew correlation 0aComparative study 0aRheological behavior 0aRSM1 aEsfandeh, Saeed1 aAlidoust, Soheyl1 aToghraie, Davood0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 May 20, v. 641 p.128446-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002000185245006500205300001200270506007600282520126000358592002801618506003701646650002001683651001601703651002801719651001101747700001901758773009401777856004501871852000901916655001201925IND50058929320221207130315.0130325e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005892932DNAL7 a229537832pmid7 aPMC34626952pmcid7 a10.1186/1742-9994-9-222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitt, Thomas10aExtra-Mediterranean refugia: The rule and not the exception?  ap. 192.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSome decades ago, biogeographers distinguished three major faunal types of high importance for Europe: (i) Mediterranean elements with exclusive glacial survival in the Mediterranean refugia, (ii) Siberian elements with glacial refugia in the eastern Palearctic and only postglacial expansion to Europe and (iii) arctic and/or alpine elements with large zonal distributions in the periglacial areas and postglacial retreat to the North and/or into the high mountain systems. Genetic analyses have unravelled numerous additional refugia both of continental and Mediterranean species, thus strongly modifying the biogeographical view of Europe. This modified notion is particularly true for the so-called Siberian species, which in many cases have not immigrated into Europe during the postglacial period, but most likely have survived the last, or even several glacial phases, in extra-Mediterranean refugia in some climatically favourable but geographically limited areas of southern Central and Eastern Europe. Recently, genetic analyses revealed that typical Mediterranean species have also survived the Last Glacial Maximum in cryptic northern refugia (e.g. in the Carpathians or even north of the Alps) in addition to their Mediterranean refuge areas.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arefuge habitats 3aAlps region 3aEastern European region 3aEurope1 aVarga, Zoltan,0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2012 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.192-192dSpringer-Verlagx1742-99947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-9-22  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010200164300001400266500001500280520132500295592002801620650001501648650001601663650001301679650001701692650000801709650002801717650002501745650002601770650002701796650001001823650001501833650001601848650001601864650001301880653001901893653002001912653001601932653003101948653001701979700002201996700006002018773010902078856008202187852000902269655001202278IND60549608020221119111546.0190401e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054960802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2016.07.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatay, Elena10aCytotoxic effects of zearalenone and its metabolites and antioxidant cell defense in CHO-K1 cells  ap. 43-49.  a2019-12-06  aZearalenone (ZEA) and its metabolites (α-zearalenol; α-ZOL, β-zearalenol; β-ZOL) are secondary metabolites of Fusarium fungi that produce cell injury. The present study explores mycotoxin-induced cell damage and cellular protection mechanisms in CHO-K1 cells. Cytotoxicity has been determined by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage. ROS production was determined using the fluorescein assay and DNA strand breakage by comet assay. Intracellular protection systems were glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results demonstrated that all mycotoxins increased the ROS levels up to 5.3-fold the control levels in CHO-K1 cells. Zearalenone metabolites, but not ZEA, increased DNA damage 43% (α-ZOL) and 28% (β-ZOL) compared to control cells. The GSH levels decreased from 18% to 36%. The GPx and SOD activities respectively increased from 26% to 62% and from 23% to 69% in CHO-K1 cells, whereas CAT activity decreased from 14% to 52%. In addition, intracellular ROS production was induced by ZEA and its metabolites. The endogenous antioxidant system components GSH, GPx and SOD were activated against ZEA and its metabolites. These antioxidant system components thus could contribute to decrease cell injury by ZEA and its metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aglutathione 3acatalase 3acytotoxicity 3aDNA 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asecondary metabolites 3aglutathione peroxidase 3afungi 3atoxicology 3azearalenone 3afluorescein 3aFusarium 0aROS production 0aZEA metabolites 0aZearalenone 0aAntioxidant defense system 0aantioxidants1 aFont, Guillermina1 aRuiz, Maria-Jose1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4174-66880 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2016 Oct., v. 96 p.43-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.07.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01764naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013100173300001800304520051300322592002800835650001400863650002300877650002300900650001200923650001600935650001400951650001100965650001400976650001300990653003401003653002101037653002701058700002701085700002201112700002701134773011201161856008401273852000901357655001201366IND60599538020221118143238.0180702e20141029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059953802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.08.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGujar, Jitendra B.10aMolecular sieves: an efficient and reusable catalyst for multi-component synthesis of dihydropyrano[2,3-C]pyrazole derivatives  ap. 6030-6033.  aAn efficient synthesis of dihydropyrano[2,3-C]pyrazole derivatives catalyzed by molecular sieves in ethanol under reflux and ultrasound irradiation has been described.

In spite of expectations and previous claims the research findings show that the hail suppression activity in Moldova leads to increase of hail incidence rate (statistically tested at the 0.05 confidence level). Active influence on the hail formation processes has also environmental implications leading to the increased pollution of the environment by the active anti-hail components in the protected areas. Given the controversial effects and missing reliable estimates of the economic benefits, as well as environmental implications, additional investments for developing of the anti hail operational programs is not recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3afinancial economics 3ahail 3apollution 3aMoldova 0aHail Frequency 0aHail Suppression 0aRepublic of Moldova1 aDaradur, M.1 aLeah, Tamara1 aPandey, R.

The aim of the study was to develop hyaluronan-based, monoclonal IgG-loaded microneedles for intradermal delivery enabling efficient penetration and rapid dissolution in the skin while preserving protein stability. Microscopic analysis showed successful preparation of sharp microneedles with the tip length of ~280μm and with up to 10% (w/w) of IgG content. The water content of the microneedles was ~12% and was not affected by the protein content. The protein distribution was uniform within microneedle tips and individual arrays but some array-to-array variation of IgG level within a single preparation batch was detected. After dissolution of microneedle arrays in PBS, >80% of protein was recovered and no conformational changes were detected by fluorescence spectroscopy. At submicron level, only weak and reversible interaction between HA and IgG was found by asymmetric flow field flow fractionation analysis after the dissolution of prepared microneedles. Although, the formation of insoluble micron-size particles was detected by flow imaging microscopy the IgG amount incorporated into these particles was negligible (<5%). Finally, microneedles were able to penetrate into the epidermis of ex vivo human skin followed by the rapid dissolution of the microneedle tips in the skin. After 10min of application, the majority of the original tip length was dissolved and IgG and hyaluronan were co-deposited until a depth of 150–200μm in the skin. In conclusion, developed hyaluronan-based dissolving microneedles allow rapid non-invasive intradermal protein delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afractionation 3ahyaluronic acid 3aimage analysis 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amicroscopy 3aprotein content 3askin (animal) 3awater content 0aHyaluronic acid 0aSodium salt (PubChem CID: 3084049) 0aDissolving microneedles 0aHyaluronan 0aProtein aggregation 0aSkin 0aProtein delivery 0aProtein-polymer complexes1 aReza Nejadnik, M.1 aBaccouche, Khalil1 aRomeijn, Stefan1 aJiskoot, Wim1 aBouwstra, Joke A.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2015 Nov. 28, v. 218 p.53-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03152naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009200165300001400257520141600271592002801687650002101715650001001736650001801746650001701764650001601781650001401797650001201811650001501823650001901838650001301857650001601870650001201886650002001898650001201918650001701930650002101947650001401968650002201982650001902004650005202023650001302075650001502088650003802103650001802141650001302159653001202172653003102184653001702215653002102232653003502253700001402288700001702302700001902319773010902338856008202447852000902529655001202538IND60549608120221119111608.0190401e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054960812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2016.07.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jinglou10aEpigallocatechin-3-gallate attenuates cadmium-induced chronic renal injury and fibrosis  ap. 70-78.  aCadmium (Cd) pollution is a serious environmental problem. Kidney is a main target organ of Cd toxicity. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential protective effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) against chronic renal injury and fibrosis induced by CdCl2. Rat model was induced by exposing to 250 mg/L CdCl2 through drinking water. The renal function was evaluated by detecting the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCR). The oxidative stress was measured by detecting the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and renal enzymatic antioxidant status. Additionally, the renal levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Smad3, phosphorylation-Smad3 (pp-Smad3), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), vimentin and E-cadherin were measured by western blot assay. Renal levels of microRNA-21 (miR-21), miR-29a/b/c and miR-192 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. It was found that EGCG ameliorated the CdCl2-induced renal injury, inhibited the level of oxidative stress, normalized renal enzymatic antioxidant status and E-cadherin level, as well as attenuated the over generation of TGF-β1, pp-Smad3, vimentin and α-SMA. EGCG also decreased the production of miR-21 and miR-192, and enhanced the levels of miR-29a/b/c. These results showed that EGCG could attenuate Cd induced chronic renal injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aactin 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acadherins 3acadmium 3acreatinine 3adrinking water 3afibrosis 3aglutathione 3akidneys 3amalondialdehyde 3amuscles 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aprotective effect 3arenal function 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3aurea nitrogen 3avimentin 0aCadmium 0aEpigallocatechin-3-gallate 0aRenal injury 0aOxidative stress 0aTransforming growth factor-β11 aDu, Lifen1 aLi, Jingjing1 aSong, Hongping0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2016 Oct., v. 96 p.70-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245013500176300001400311500001500325520116800340592002801508650001101536650001901547650001701566650002301583650003101606650002101637650001201658650003201670650001701702650002601719653001601745653004501761653001201806653001301818653001701831700002101848700002201869773009501891856008601986852000902072655001202081IND60604484820221120100308.0180717e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060448482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrunetti, Jesús E.14aThe heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is a host factor required for dengue virus and Junín virus multiplication  ap. 84-91.  a2019-12-06  aHeterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are cellular factors involved in the replication of several viruses. In this study we analyzed the expression and intracellular localization of hnRNP A2 and hnRNP K in cell cultures infected with two viruses that cause human hemorrhagic fevers: dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) and Junín virus (JUNV). We determined that DENV-2 promoted the cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNP K and to a lesser extent of hnRNP A2, meanwhile, JUNV infection induced an increase in hnRNP K cytoplasmic localization whereas hnRNP A2 remained mainly in the nucleus of infected cells. Both hnRNP K and hnRNP A2 were localized predominantly in the nucleus of JUNV persistently-infected cells even after superinfection with JUNV indicating that persistent infection does not alter nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of these hnRNPs. Total levels of hnRNP K expression were unaffected by DENV-2 or JUNV infection. In addition we determined, using small interfering RNAs, that hnRNP K knockout inhibits DENV-2 and JUNV multiplication. Our results indicate that DENV-2 and JUNV induce hnRNP K cytoplasmic translocation to favor viral multiplication.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahumans 3asuperinfection 3acell culture 3aribonucleoproteins 3aArgentinian mammarenavirus 3achronic diseases 3aviruses 3anucleocytoplasmic transport 3aDengue virus 3asmall interfering RNA 0aJunin virus 0aHeterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins 0ahnRNP K 0ahnRNP A2 0aJunín virus1 aScolaro, Luis A.1 aCastilla, Viviana0 tVirus research.g2015 May 04, v. 203 p.84-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245015600179300001600335520153700351592002801888650001501916650001501931650002101946650001501967650002201982650002202004650000902026650001302035650001302048650002302061650001302084650003702097650001502134653002902149653002702178653002602205653001302231653002302244653002202267700002102289700001702310773013702327856008502464852000902549655001202558IND60285675420221120215439.0150630e20150528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6028567542DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2015.10460572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuchekar, Shashikant R.10aSelective determination of selenium(IV) from environmental samples by UV-visible spectrophotometry using O-methoxyphenyl thiourea as a chelating ligand  ap. 618-634.  aA selective extraction–spectrophotometric method has been developed for determination of selenium(IV) using O -methoxyphenyl thiourea (OMePT) as a chelating agent. The basis of the proposed method is the spectrophotometric determination of selenium(IV)–OMePT complex obtained after extraction of selenium(IV) from 3.5 M hydrochloric acid media using OMePT in chloroform solvent. The complex shows maximum absorbance at 350 nm against the reagent blank. The Beer’s law was obeyed over the concentration range 5–60 µg mL ⁻¹ of selenium(IV). The optimum concentration range was 20–50 µg mL ⁻¹ as evaluated from Ringbom’s plot. The molar absorptivity and Sandell’s sensitivity of the selenium(IV)–OMePT complex in chloroform were 3.312 × 10 ² L mol ⁻¹cm ⁻¹ and 0.2384 µg cm ⁻², respectively. The composition of selenium(IV)–OMePT complex was 1:2 established from slope ratio method, mole ratio method and Job’s continuous variation method. The complex was stable for more than 72 h. The interfering effect of various foreign ions was studied and suitable masking agents were used wherever necessary to enhance the selectivity of the developed method. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of selenium(IV) from real samples, viz. pharmaceutical formulations, shampoo, vegetable sample, synthetic mixtures and environmental samples. Repetition of the method was checked by finding the relative standard deviation (RSD) for 10 determinations which was 0.35%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3achelating agents 3achloroform 3adrug formulations 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3aselenium 3asolvents 3aspectrophotometers 3athiourea 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3avegetables 0aO-methoxyphenyl thiourea 0apharmaceutical samples 0aenvironmental samples 0aselenium 0asolvent extraction 0aspectrophotometry1 aNaval, Ramesh M.1 aHan, Sung H.0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2015 May 28, v. 95, no. 7 p.618-634dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2015.10460573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014000163300001800303520070000321592002801021650002401049650002301073650002301096650004401119650001101163650001101174653002901185653002301214653002201237653002901259653002601288700002201314700002301336700002201359700002601381700002101407773011201428856008401540852000901624655001201633IND60599538220221118143230.0180702e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059953822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAy, Emel10aConcerning restricted rotations in pyridinyl anisoles and pyridinyl phenols bearing saturated handles, and their solid state structures  ap. 5979-5983.  aThe variable-temperature («dynamic») NMR measurements of series of pyridinyl anisoles and pyridinyl phenols each of them bearing ortho, ortho′ handles of various lengths at oxygenated ring lead to the following results: (i) at room temperature, a restricted rotation around the intercyclic bond of pyridinyl anisoles and pyridinyl phenol bearing short handles formed by 9–10 atoms is underscored, (ii) all handles at the former derivatives are blocked on one side of the oxygenated ring face, and (iii) handles of 11–12 atoms long at phenol rings are able to move freely.

The bobcat is a cryptic mesocarnivore widely exploited for pelts across North America, and a species increasingly contributing to ecotourism. Here, we report a conservative, non-consumptive economic value of US$308,105 for a single bobcat in Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming for the 2015–2016 winter season, a figure nearly 1000 times greater than exploitive values of US$315.17 per bobcat trapped or hunted in Wyoming in the same season (US$130.53 per bobcat harvested in revenue earned by the state of Wyoming in trapping license sales + US$184.64 per pelt sold by successful trappers and hunters). In 2016, tourism was the second largest industry in Wyoming and generated US$3.2 billion. Our case study emphasizes that current bobcat regulatory policies across North America do not reflect current cultural values, inclusive of both consumptive and non-consumptive use of wildlife. Therefore, we recommend range-wide regulatory changes to ensure bobcat management is not just sustainable in terms of harvest, but that all people have access to shared resources held in trust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLynx rufus 3acarnivores 3acase studies 3acultural values 3aeconomic valuation 3aecotourism 3afurs and pelts 3ahunters 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3anational parks 3asales 3atrapping 3awildlife 3awinter 3aWyoming1 aRobertson, Lisa1 aCombs, Kristin1 aFitzgerald, Jenny0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2017 Nov., v. 26, no. 12 p.2987-2992dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-017-1397-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001600257520119600273592002801469650002201497650001001519650002601529650001901555650002001574650002601594650001501620650001101635650002901646700001901675773009301694856008101787852000901868655001201877IND60520771120221118054404.0160524e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052077112DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078160301312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRusanov, A.

The results of principal-coordinates analysis show the flow velocity and biogenic load to be the major factors governing the spatial variations of periphyton structure. Mantel test shows the difference in the species structure to be correlated more closely with local variations in the environmental factors than with the distance along river channel. Therefore, the spatial distribution of periphyton in the Moskva R. agrees better with the concept of patch dynamics than the concept of river continuum. Estimation of the indicator potential of three ecological guilds of diatoms (low profile, high profile, and motile) has shown a positive response of motile diatoms to an increase in the concentration of biogenic compounds. The effect of other factors, such as light intensity in macrophyte stands and the microdistribution of diatoms in periphyton layer, can disturb the relationship between biogenic substance concentrations and the abundance of low profile and high profile diatoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aalgae 3aenvironmental factors 3aeutrophication 3alight intensity 3amultivariate analysis 3aperiphyton 3arivers 3asubmerged aquatic plants1 aKhromov, V.

However, mutualism effectiveness is highly sensitive to disturbance by environmental stressors. Allelopathy is often overlooked, yet likely important, as a potential stress on plant mutualism function. Allelochemicals can affect plant mutualisms by either directly interfering with the plant’s ability to produce resources and rewards for its mutualistic partners or by directly or indirectly altering the non-plant mutualist’s behavior. Here we explore the potential effects of allelochemicals on plant mutualisms. Since allelochemicals can reduce plant growth and carbon acquisition, we suggest that allelopathy could directly diminish: (1) carbon provisioning to mycorrhizal fungi, (2) flower, pollen, and nectar production for pollinators, and (3) fruit attractiveness to seed dispersers. Similarly, allelochemicals that directly affect mycorrhizal fungi functioning can reduce the flow of soil resources to their plant partner. Further, volatile allelochemicals or uptake of allelochemicals from the soil by the plant could alter pollen/nectar or fruit attractiveness and indirectly influence pollinator and seed disperser behavior. Finally, we explore the extent to which plant-produced chemicals could have a direct or indirect positive effect on plant mutualisms. We end using these questions to frame future avenues of research that could help to move studies of allelopathy into the broader ecological context of mutualisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallelochemicals 3aallelopathy 3acarbon 3aflowers 3amutualism 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anectar 3anectar secretion 3aplant growth 3aplant stress 3apollen 3apollinators 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoil resources 3asowing1 aKalisz, Susan0 tPlant ecology.g2012 Dec., v. 213, no. 12 p.1991-2006dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-012-0128-z  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014300167300001300310520128200323536022801605592002801833596002601861650001201887650001401899650002701913650002301940650001201963650001101975650001401986650002602000650001102026650002202037650001702059650001902076650001302095650001802108650002102126650001202147650000902159653001702168653001902185653002002204653001102224653002702235653001402262700001902276700001602295700001802311700001802329700001902347700002102366700001902387700001402406700001602420773013402436856008502570852000902655655001202664IND60595404520221118052423.0180602e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059540452DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2016.12075952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichels, E.10aLimitations for phytoextraction management on metal-polluted soils with poplar short rotation coppice—evidence from a 6-year field trial  ap. 8-15.  aPoplar clones were studied for their phytoextraction capacity in the second growth cycle (6-year growth) on a site in the Belgian Campine region, which is contaminated with Cd and Zn via historic atmospheric deposition of nearby zinc smelter activities. The field trial revealed regrowth problems for some clones that could not be predicted in the first growth cycle. Four allometric relations were assessed for their capacity to predict biomass yield in the second growth cycle. A power function based on the shoot diameter best estimates the biomass production of poplar with R² values between 0.94 and 0.98. The woody biomass yield ranged from 2.1 to 4.8 ton woody Dry Mass (DM) ha⁻¹ y⁻¹. The primary goal was to reduce soil concentrations of metals caused by phytoextraction. Nevertheless, increased metal concentrations were determined in the topsoil. This increase can partially be explained by the input of metals from deeper soil layers in the top soil through litterfall. The phytoextraction option with poplar short rotation coppice in this setup did not lead to the intended soil remediation in a reasonable time span. Therefore, harvest of the leaf biomass is put forward as a crucial part of the strategy for soil remediation through Cd/Zn phytoextraction.  aThe research project was financially supported by the European Commission within the framework of the Interreg IVb project “Accelerating Renewable Energies through valorisation of Biogenic Organic Raw Material” (ARBOR).  aPublisher supplied data  a1cInterreg IVb ARBOR 3aPopulus 3aallometry 3aatmospheric deposition 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3aclones 3acoppicing 3afield experimentation 3aleaves 3aphytoaccumulation 3aplant litter 3apolluted soils 3aregrowth 3asecond growth 3asoil remediation 3atopsoil 3azinc 0aCadmium (Cd) 0aCampine region 0aphytoextraction 0apoplar 0ashort rotation coppice 0azinc (Zn)1 aAnnicaerta, B.1 aDe Moor, S.1 aVan Nevel, L.1 aDe Fraeye, M.1 aMeiresonne, L.1 aVangronsveld, J.1 aTack, F.

By gradually decreasing the ambient RH of the insulin crystal, the content of the hydration water in the crystal was quantitatively controlled. Tyrosine (Tyr) residues were very sensitive to the micro-environmental changes, and four Raman features 828cm⁻¹, 852cm⁻¹, 1174cm⁻¹ and 1206cm⁻¹ of Tyr were employed to monitor the dehydration process. Taking advantage of the ratios I₈₅₂/I₈₂₈ at different RH values, the mole fractions of the ‘exposed’ and ‘buried’ Tyr residues were estimated. Moreover, using the ratio I₁₁₇₄/I₁₂₀₆ as an indicator of the dehydration process, three RH regions were discriminated. This is believed to imply that different types of the hydration water were lost step by step, i.e. firstly the ‘second-layer’ and ‘first-layer’ classes, then the ‘contact’ class, and finally, the ‘inside’ class. In addition, the profile of the amide I band was observed to gradually change with RH. By band fitting of the amide I region, changes in secondary structure were quantitatively determined. And the results showed that nearly 17% of α-helix converted into β-sheet with RH decreasing from 92% to 2%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acrystals 3ainsulin 3arelative humidity 3atyrosine1 aShou, Jing-Jing1 aLi, Kai-Kai1 aZhang, Yun-Hong0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2011 Dec., v. 1814, no. 12 p.1631-1640dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1878-14547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2011.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012500166520101900291592002801310650002601338650003201364650001301396650001701409650002501426650002501451650001401476650001401490650001901504650000901523650002501532653001001557653001001567653000801577653000801585653000701593653000801600653000901608653000801617653000801625653000801633653000701641653001001648653000801658653000701666653000801673653000901681653001001690653000901700653000801709653000801717653000801725653000901733653000801742653000801750653001001758653000901768653000801777653000701785653000701792653000801799653000801807653000801815653000701823653000801830653000901838653001001847653003201857653003001889653003201919653002501951653002701976700001402003700001602017700001802033700001602051700001602067700001902083700001902102773010502121856008502226852000902311655001202320IND60654383620221118053522.0190725e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065438362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Mengke10aState of the art of tertiary treatment technologies for controlling antibiotic resistance in wastewater treatment plants  aAntibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been considered as emerging contaminants of concern nowadays. There are no special technologies designed to directly remove ARGs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In order to reduce the risk of ARGs, it is vital to understand the efficiency of advanced treatment technologies in removing antibiotic resistance genes in WWTPs. This review highlights the application and efficiency of tertiary treatment technologies on the elimination of ARGs, s, based on an understanding of their occurrence and fate in WWTPs. These technologies include chemical-based processes such as chlorination, ozonation, ultraviolet, and advanced oxidation technology, as well as physical separation processes, biological processes such as constructed wetland and membrane bioreactor, and soil aquifer treatment. The merits, limitations and ameliorative measures of these processes are discussed, with the view to optimizing future treatment strategies and identifying new research directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3aaquifers 3achlorination 3aconstructed wetlands 3amembrane bioreactors 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3arisk reduction 3asoil 3awastewater treatment 0aaeMBR 0aanMBR 0aAOC 0aAOP 0aAR 0aARB 0aARGs 0aBOD 0aCOD 0aCWs 0aDO 0aeARGs 0aFAC 0aGO 0aHGT 0aHSSF 0aiARGs 0aICWs 0aIPR 0aMBR 0aMFC 0aMGEs 0aPCR 0aPFC 0aPPCPs 0aqPCR 0aSAT 0aSF 0aSS 0aSTP 0aTOC 0aTSP 0aUV 0aVGT 0aVSSF 0aWWTPs 0aWastewater treatment plants 0aChemical-based approaches 0aPhysical separation process 0aBiological processes 0aSoil aquifer treatment1 aZhang, Bo1 aHe, Yiliang1 aSu, Jianqiang1 aGin, Karina1 aLev, Ovadia1 aShen, Genxiang1 aHu, Shuangqing0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Oct., v. 131 p.105026-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245017000173520124200343592002801585650004401613650002201657650001601679650001901695650001601714650001501730650001001745650001701755650002001772650001701792650001801809650001101827650001401838650000701852650001501859650001901874650001401893653001701907653001901924653001401943653001901957653001601976653001801992700002902010700002402039700001802063773010502081856008702186852000902273655001202282IND60766082120221122060526.0220628e20220520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076608212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagaraja, Kasula10aDual responsive tamarind gum-co-poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-ethylene glycol vinyl ether) hydrogel: A promising device for colon specific anti-cancer drug delivery  aIn this study, pH and temperature-sensitive tamarind gum (TM)-based hydrogels were synthesized by free radical polymerization using a combination of acrylamide (AM), N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM), and ethylene glycol vinyl ether (EGVE) monomers with bis (2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl phosphate (BMEP) as a crosslinker (TANEB hydrogel).

The resultant transglutaminase introduces cross-links into the fibrin clot. With the development of therapeutic coagulation factors, there is a need to better understand interactions involving FXIII. Such knowledge will help predict ability to activate FXIII and thus ability to promote/hinder the generation of transglutaminase activity. Kinetic parameters have been determined for a series of thrombin species hydrolyzing the FXIII (28–41) V34X activation peptides (V34, V34L, V34F, and V34P). The V34P substitution introduces PAR4 character into the FXIII, and the V34F exhibits important similarities to the cardioprotective V34L. FXIII activation peptides containing V34, V34L, or V34P could each be accommodated by alanine mutants of thrombin lacking either the W60d or Y60a residue in the 60-insertion loop. By contrast, FXIII V34F AP could be cleaved by thrombin W60dA but not by Y60aA. FXIII V34P is highly reliant on the thrombin W215 platform for its strong substrate properties whereas FXIII V34F AP becomes the first segment that can maintain its Kₘ upon loss of the critical thrombin W215 residue. Interestingly, FXIII V34F AP could also be readily accommodated by thrombin L99A and E217A. Hydrolysis of FXIII V34F AP by thrombin W217A/E217A (WE) was similar to that of FXIII V34L AP whereas WE could not effectively cleave FXIII V34P AP. FXIII V34F and V34P AP show promise for designing FXIII activation systems that are either tolerant of or greatly hindered by the presence of anticoagulant thrombins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalanine 3aanticoagulants 3acoagulation 3acrosslinking 3afibrin 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3apeptides 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3athrombin1 aLucas, R.

SKH-1 hairless mice were topically exposed with BA (25 and 50 mg/kg b.wt) either alone or along with UVB (50 mJ/cm2) for 24 h and estimation of ROS, histopathological analysis, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, mast cell staining, immunohistochemistry for COX-2 and iNOS as well as western blotting for MAPKs, p-NF-κB, c-jun, c-fos COX-2 and iNOS were carried out. Enhanced ROS generation, increased epidermal thickness, mast cell number, MPO activity, enhanced expression of COX-2 and iNOS, MAPKs, c-jun, c-fos, NF-κB were found in BA either alone or when followed by UVB treatment, compared to the control groups. Expression of COX-2, iNOS and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were found to be more enhanced in BA and UVB- exposed group compared to BA and UVB only group, while phosphorylation of JNK1/2, p38, NF-κB and expression of c-jun and c-fos were comparable with BA and UVB only groups. In summary, we suggest that UVB exposure enhanced BA-induced SKH-1 skin inflammation possibly via oxidative stress-mediated activation of MAPKs-NF-κB/AP-1 signalling, which subsequently increased the expression of COX-2 and iNOS and led to inflammation in SKH-1 mouse skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3amast cells 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amyeloperoxidase 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atoxicology 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aBenzanthrone 0aSKH-1 hairless mice 0aDermal toxicity 0aUVB radiation1 aAlam, Shamshad1 aPal, Anu1 aKumar, Mahadeo1 aSingh, Dhirendra1 aAnsari, Kausar Mahmood0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2016 Oct., v. 96 p.183-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2016.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245008600165300001400251520094900265592002801214650003601242650001301278650001601291650002601307650001101333650001801344650000901362650002201371650001401393650002101407651001001428653004301438653001601481653001101497653001401508700001801522700001501540700001701555700001201572700002001584700001701604700001601621700001201637700001501649700001801664773009501682856008601777852000901863655001201872IND60604485020221120115529.0180717e20150504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060448502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Zhen10aNaturally occurring reassortant infectious bursal disease virus in northern China  ap. 92-95.  aInfectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a bi-segmented, double-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus of the family of Birnavirideae. The co-evolution of genome segments is a major evolutionary feature for IBDV. However, in recent years, some strains exhibited markedly different genetic relationships for segments A and B. In this study, we firstly isolated a new type of reassortment IBDV strain named IBD13HeB01 from northern China. The full-length genomes of segments A and B were cloned and identified. Sequence analysis revealed that IBD13HeB01 was a segment-reassortment strain, whose segment A was derived from very virulent strain and segment B from attenuated IBDV. In addition, the virulence of IBD13HeB01 strain was evaluated using SPF chickens. This study is not only beneficial for further understanding of the viral evolution but also suggests the potential risk of application of the live vaccines of IBDV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3achickens 3acoevolution 3agenetic relationships 3agenome 3alive vaccines 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aChina 0aInfectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) 0aReassortant 0aGenome 0aEvolution1 aZhang, Lizhou1 aWang, Nian1 aChen, Yuming1 aGao, Li1 aWang, Yongqiang1 aGao, Honglei1 aGao, Yulong1 aLi, Kai1 aQi, Xiaole1 aWang, Xiaomei0 tVirus research.g2015 May 04, v. 203 p.92-95dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245009500166300001800261520112000279650001701399650001601416650001501432650001901447650001301466650000901479650001601488650001201504650001301516650004401529650002501573650002601598650001801624700002001642700002901662700002301691700002001714700002401734700002901758773016201787856004701949852000901996655001202005IND60517894420221121043932.0160406e20150429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051789442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b009402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHohmann, Monika10aQuantitative 1H NMR Analysis of Egg Yolk, Alcohol, and Total Sugar Content in Egg Liqueurs  ap. 4112-4119.  aAnalyzing egg liqueurs for compliance with legal requirements means several different time-consuming preparations and analytical processes. In this paper, we describe the approach to use quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy as an accurate alternative technique. 1H NMR analysis comprised two different rapid sample preparations for water-soluble or nonpolar ingredients. Fifteen egg liqueurs were analyzed for alcoholic strength and content of total sugar and egg yolk (estimated by cholesterol as a marker substance) with both classical methods and quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy. The results of both methods showed excellent correlations for alcoholic strength (R = 0.996, p < 0.001) and content of total sugar (R = 0.989, p < 0.001) and cholesterol (R = 0.995, p < 0.001). Besides, NMR spectra revealed further information: a signal of phosphatidylcholine at about δ = 3.20 ppm served as a second marker for the egg yolk content, and characteristic signals of lactose at δ = 4.46 ppm and butyric acid at δ = 0.97 ppm indicated the use of milk products, which has to be declared for lactose-intolerant consumers. 3abutyric acid 3acholesterol 3acompliance 3adairy products 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aingredients 3alactose 3aliqueurs 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aquantitative analysis 3asugar content1 aKoospal, Verena1 aBauer-Christoph, Claudia1 aChristoph, Norbert1 aWachter, Helmut1 aDiehl, B.q(Bernd),1 aHolzgrabe, U.q(Ulrike),0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 29, v. 63, no. 16 p.4112-4119dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00940  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245016600159506011700325506007600442520122600518592002801744506003701772650001501809650001301824650002801837650001401865650001701879650002101896650001701917650001701934650001801951650001301969650001501982650003701997650001702034650002802051650001102079650001402090653003002104653001202134653001702146653003602163653001702199653001402216700001902230700001402249700001802263700001802281700005802299773011102357856008202468852000902550655001202559IND60773278120221207051219.0220606e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077327812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2022.1050612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPei, Yu13aAn ACE inhibitory peptide from Isochrysis zhanjiangensis exhibits antihypertensive effect via anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis in HUVEC and hypertensive rats  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroalgae are primary producers in marine ecosystems, and have been diffusely used in medicine and food. In this research, we evaluated the protective effects of polypeptides from microalgae, Isochrysis zhanjiangensis (EMFGTSSET, ETT) on endothelial injury in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The results showed that ETT inhibited the fluorescence intensity of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduces the expression of related cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, iNOS, COX-2, ET-1, AT-1, and adhesion factor. It blocks inflammation and apoptosis through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and serine/threonine kinase (Akt) signal pathways, thereby alleviating endothelial damage. Meanwhile, ETT (IC₅₀ = 15.08 μM) antagonizes Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme (ACE) in a non-competitive binding mode, and has an antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Therefore, ETT has excellent effect in regulating hypertension, can become the main component of potential functional food for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, and further improve the use value of Isochrysis Zhanjiangensis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIsochrysis 3aadhesion 3aantihypertensive effect 3aapoptosis 3afluorescence 3afunctional foods 3ahypertension 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-8 3amedicine 3amicroalgae 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apolypeptides 3areactive oxygen species 3aserine 3athreonine 0aIsochrysis Zhanjiangensis 0aPeptide 0aHypertension 0aAngiotensin-I Converting Enzyme 0aInflammation 0aApoptosis1 aCai, Shengxuan1 aRyu, Bomi1 aZhou, Chunxia1 aHong, Pengzhi1 aQian, Zhong-Ji1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9220-26000 tJournal of functional foods.g2022 May, v. 92 p.105061-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2022.1050613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245012300170300001800293520107700311650002501388650001801413650002001431650002401451650001601475650001401491650001501505650004301520650001901563650001701582650001501599650002201614650001601636650003201652650001401684650001701698650002301715650001301738700001901751700002501770700002001795700001801815773016201833856004701995852000902042655001202051IND60517894520221121032415.0160406e20150429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051789452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b005642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeleszko, Miroslawa10aAnalysis of Lipophilic and Hydrophilic Bioactive Compounds Content in Sea Buckthorn (Hippophaë rhamnoides L.)

In the experiment chromatographic analyses, GC (phytosterols and fatty acids), UPLC-PDA-FL, LC-MS (polyphenols), and HPLC (l-ascorbic acid), as well spectrophotometric method (total carotenoids) were used. The lipid fraction isolated from whole fruit contained 14 phytosterols (major compounds β-sitosterol > 24-methylenecykloartanol > squalene) and 11 fatty acids in the order MUFAs > SFAs > PUFAs. Carotenoids occurred in concentrations between 6.19 and 23.91 mg/100 g fresh weight (fw) (p < 0.05). The major polyphenol group identified in berries was flavonols (mean content of 311.55 mg/100 g fw), with the structures of isorhamnetin (six compounds), quercetin (four compounds), and kaempferol (one compound) glycosides. Examined sea buckthorn cultivars were characterized also by a high content of l-ascorbic acid in a range from 52.86 to 130.97 mg/100 g fw (p < 0.05). 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aascorbic acid 3abeta-sitosterol 3abioactive compounds 3acarotenoids 3acultivars 3aglycosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3aisorhamnetin 3akaempferol 3amass spectrometry 3apolyphenols 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aquercetin 3asmall fruits 3aspectrophotometers 3asqualene1 aWojdylo, Aneta1 aRudzinska, Magdalena1 aOszmianski, Jan1 aGolis, Tomasz0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 29, v. 63, no. 16 p.4120-4129dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00564  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245019100162520172400353592002802077650001102105650001802116650002102134650001802155650001102173650001402184650002602198650002102224650001002245650001702255650001502272651001202287653002602299653001402325653002602339653002902365653003202394653003402426700001602460700002402476700002202500700001802522700002502540700002202565700001802587700001502605700002302620700002002643700001502663773010502678856008502783852000902868655001202877IND60654384020221118053439.0200217e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065438402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Li10aExposure to ambient air pollution and the incidence of congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction: A population-based study of 5.1 million Canadian adults living in Ontario  aLong-term exposure to ambient air pollution has been linked to cardiovascular mortality, but the associations with incidence of major cardiovascular diseases are not fully understood, especially at low concentrations. We aimed to investigate the associations between exposure to fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone (O₃), redox-weighted average of NO₂ and O₃ (Oₓ) and incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Our study population included all long-term residents aged 35–85 years who lived in Ontario, Canada, from 2001 to 2015 (~5.1 million). Incidence of CHF and AMI were ascertained from validated registries. We assigned estimates of annual concentrations of pollutants to the residential postal codes of subjects for each year during follow-up. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for each pollutant separately using Cox proportional hazards models. We examined the shape of concentration-response associations using shape-constrained health impact functions. From 2001 to 2015, there were 422,625 and 197,628 incident cases of CHF and AMI, respectively. In the fully adjusted analyses, the HRs of CHF corresponding to each interquartile range increase in exposure were 1.05 (95% CI: 1.04–1.05) for PM₂.₅, 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01–1.04) for NO₂, 1.03 (95% CI: 1.02–1.03) for O₃, and 1.02 (95% CI: 1.02–1.03) for Oₓ, respectively. Similarly, exposure to PM₂.₅, O₃, and Oₓ were positively associated with AMI. The concentration-response relationships were different for individual pollutant and outcome combinations (e.g., for PM₂.₅ the relationship was supralinear with CHF, and linear with AMI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aair pollution 3achronic exposure 3aheart failure 3amodels 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aOntario 0aAmbient air pollution 0aIncidence 0aCardiovascular events 0aCongestive heart failure 0aAcute myocardial infarction 0aConcentration-response curves1 aShin, Saeha1 aBurnett, Richard T.1 aKwong, Jeffrey C.1 aHystad, Perry1 avan Donkelaar, Aaron1 aGoldberg, Mark S.1 aLavigne, Eric1 aCopes, Ray1 aMartin, Randall V.1 aKopp, Alexander1 aChen, Hong0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Nov., v. 132 p.105004-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.1050043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013200175300001500307520139600322592002801718650001201746650001901758650002501777650001401802650002501816650001701841650001901858650001101877650001901888651001001907651001801917653002901935653004501964653001302009653002802022653003702050653003002087700002002117700001802137700001202155700002002167700001502187700002002202773010202222856008402324852000902408655001202417IND60604533120221121012236.0180717e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060453312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietzcker, Robert C.10aLong-term transport energy demand and climate policy: Alternative visions on transport decarbonization in energy-economy models  ap. 95-108.  aDecarbonizing transport will be necessary to limit global warming below 2 °C. Due to persistent reliance on fossil fuels, it is posited that transport is more difficult to decarbonize than other sectors. To test this hypothesis, we compare long-term transport energy demand and emission projections for China, USA and the world from five large-scale energy-economy models. We diagnose the model's characteristics by subjecting them to three climate policies. We systematically analyze mitigation levers along the chain of causality from mobility to emissions, finding that some models lack relevant mitigation options. We partially confirm that transport is less reactive to a given carbon tax than the non-transport sectors: in the first half of the century, transport mitigation is delayed by 10–30 years compared to non-transport mitigation. At high carbon prices towards the end of the century, however, the three global models achieve deep transport emission reductions by >90% through the use of advanced vehicle technologies and low-carbon primary energy; especially biomass with CCS (carbon capture and sequestration) plays a crucial role. The extent to which earlier mitigation is possible strongly depends on implemented technologies and model structure. Compared to the global models, the two partial-equilibrium models are less flexible in their reaction to climate policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sequestration 3aemissions 3aenvironmental policy 3afossil fuels 3aglobal warming 3amodels 3aprimary energy 3aChina 3aUnited States 0aTransportation scenarios 0aCO2 (Carbon dioxide) emission mitigation 0aHydrogen 0aEnergy-economy modeling 0aBEVs (Battery electric vehicles) 0aMobility demand reduction1 aLongden, Thomas1 aChen, Wenying1 aFu, Sha1 aKriegler, Elmar1 aKyle, Page1 aLuderer, Gunnar0 tEnergy.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 64 p.95-108dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.08.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245019500164300001800359520129800377650001101675650002101686650001001707650001301717650001801730650001101748650003101759650002201790650001801812650000901830650001901839650001701858650000801875650001001883700001901893700002101912700003001933700002201963700001901985700002702004773016202031856004702193852000902240655001202249IND60517894620221121032440.0160406e20150429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051789462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b014252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerardo, Vito10aAnalysis of Oligomer Proanthocyanidins in Different Barley Genotypes Using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Fluorescence Detection–Mass Spectrometry and Near-Infrared Methodologies  ap. 4130-4137.  aProanthocyanidins are a class of polyphenols present in many foodstuffs (i.e., tea, cocoa, berries, etc.) that may reduce the risk of several chronic diseases. Barley, with sorghum, rice, and wheat, are the only cereals that contain these compounds. Because of that, two barley genotypes, named waxy and non-waxy, were analyzed by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography–fluorescence detection–mass spectrometry (NP-HPLC–FLD–MS). Total proanthocyanidin content ranged between 293.2 and 652.6 μg/g of flour. Waxy samples reported the highest content (p < 0.05) of proanthocyanidins. Dimer compounds were the principal proanthocyanidin constituents of barley samples. Moreover, the possibility to use near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy as a rapid method to discriminate between waxy and non-waxy samples and to predict quantitatively proanthocyanidins in barley samples was evaluated. Partial least squares (PLS) models were built to predict the proanthocyanidin constituent, obtaining determination coefficients (R2) ranging from 0.92 to 0.97, in test set validation. Because of that, this study highlights that NIR spectroscopy technology with multivariate calibration analysis could be successfully applied as a rapid method to determine proanthocyanidin content in barley. 3abarley 3achronic diseases 3aflour 3agenotype 3aleast squares 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aproanthocyanidins 3arapid methods 3arice 3arisk reduction 3asmall fruits 3atea 3awheat1 aCevoli, Chiara1 aPasini, Federica1 aGomez-Caravaca, Ana Maria1 aMarconi, Emanuele1 aFabbri, Angelo1 aCaboni, Maria Fiorenza0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 29, v. 63, no. 16 p.4130-4137dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b01425  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011000170520099100280592002801271650001401299650001901313650000701332650001501339653001201354653001701366653002801383700001601411700001201427700002001439700001701459700001701476700001501493773010501508856008701613852000901700655001201709IND60766082520221122060540.0220228e20220505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076608252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Xiaoqiang10aRed mud supported on reduced graphene oxide as photo-Fenton catalysts for organic contaminant degradation  aIn this study, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified red mud (RM) composite was successfully prepared and used as the highly effective heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalyst for Rhodamine B (RhB) contaminant degradation. The acid leaching and calcination treatment reduced the impurities in RM, making α-Fe₂O₃ active for H₂O₂ decomposing. The rGO modification can not only inhibit the recombination of charge carriers but also accelerate the Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ cycle during heterogenous Fenton process. Attributed to such advantages, 99.8% degradation of RhB within 20 min was achieved by the optimal RM-H/rGO composite. More importantly, the prepared RM-H/rGO showed excellent performance and high stability for various organic contaminants degradation at a wide pH range. This study not only demonstrates that rGO-modified RM can be used as an efficient, low-cost photo-Fenton catalyst for organic pollutants treatment, but also provides an effective approach for RM disposal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3agraphene oxide 3apH 3arhodamines 0aRed mud 0aPhoto-Fenton 0aContaminant degradation1 aHou, Zhiang1 aYu, Yue1 aWang, Jiangpeng1 aLan, Huachun1 aLiu, Huijuan1 aQu, Jiuhui0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 May 05, v. 640 p.128461-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01523naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245003100184300001800215520042300233592002800656650001600684650001700700650001300717650001100730650001400741650002200755653001800777653002600795653002300821653002200844653003100866700002900897700001800926773011200944856008401056852000901140655001201149IND60599538920221118143229.0180702e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059953892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Maddimsetti Venkateswara10aTotal synthesis of AI-77-B  ap. 5921-5924.  aA new stereoselective approach for the synthesis of AI-77-B has been described.

In the present study, we report for the first time a genomewide screen for microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated during the luteolin-mediated neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. We found that after luteolin treatment, the abundance of 16 miRNAs was markedly up-regulated and that of 3 miRNAs was down-regulated in PC12 cells. The induction of miR-34a by luteolin was the most pronounced among these differentially expressed miRNAs. The correlation between miR-34a down-regulation and decreased luteolin-mediated neurite outgrowth may indicate a mechanism by which miR-34a may act as a modulator of neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we found that luteolin enhanced the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, which was associated with the promotion of miR-34a transcription and neurite outgrowth. Moreover, the level of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a known miR-34a target, was reduced during luteolin-induced neurite outgrowth. In turn, the level of acetylated p53, a substrate of SIRT1, was correspondingly increased in luteolin-treated PC12 cells. In addition to p53 activation, we further identified that luteolin-induced miR-34a transcription and neurite outgrowth involved the activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. However, the inhibition of JNK and p38 MAPK activation did not block luteolin-induced p53 activation in PC12 cells.

The prepared material has discovered a tremella-like three-dimensional structure with surface ravines, which achieved the actual maximum Hg(II) adsorption capacity to be 174.7 mg g⁻¹ at 200 mg L⁻¹. The DCDA-GO demonstrated a high pH-tolerance property and high removal efficiency at the wider pH (>91.5%, 1–13) and high resistance of ionic strength (>92.86%, 2000 mg L⁻¹). Meanwhile, DCDA-GO can also complete the selective enrichment of Hg(II) in the bi-component and multi-component solution containing seven different metal ions, whose selectivity coefficient to Hg(II) was 1.7 × 10⁵ mL g⁻¹ and 3–5 orders of magnitude higher than other metal ions except for lead. And the composite can keep a high removal efficiency (85.5%) after 4 cycles. The adsorption process reached equilibrium after 100 min, which can be described as an endothermic, multilayer, and chemical interaction. The proposed adsorption mechanism was primarily ascribed to the chelation between Hg(II) and nitrogen-containing groups (imino and nitrile groups) while the contribution from electrostatic attraction was neglectable due to a positively charged surface. Moreover, the Hg(II) concentration was dramatically declined from 20 ppm to 1 ppb after column adsorption, the capacity could reach 108.17 mg g⁻¹. On the whole, the DCDA-GO could be the remarkable material for removing Hg(II) from salt-abundance, pH fluctuating, or multiple heavy metals containing wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achelation 3achlorination 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aendothermy 3agraphene oxide 3aionic strength 3amercury 3apH 3asurface area 3awastewater 0aCyanoguanidine functionalization 0aMercury removal 0aGraphene oxide 0aAdsorption mechanism 0aColumn adsorption1 aDuan, Yu1 aZhao, Bohan1 aFeng, Qingge1 aLi, Mingzhi1 aWei, Junqi1 aZhu, Yifan1 aLi, Mingen0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 May 20, v. 641 p.128467-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1284673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02034naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245012100172300001600293520095100309592002801260650001801288650001901306650003401325650003701359700002001396700001901416700002101435700002401456773011401480856008201594990002301676852000901699655001201708IND60091148120221121025544.0141103e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009114812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.11.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Michelle S.10aRegioselective synthesis of 5- and 6-methoxybenzimidazole-1,3,5-triazines as inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase  ap. 802-805.  aPhosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) hold significant therapeutic potential as novel targets for the treatment of cancer. ZSTK474 (4a) is a potent, pan-PI3K inhibitor currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of cancer. Structural studies have shown that derivatisation at the 5- or 6-position of the benzimidazole ring may influence potency and isoform selectivity. However, synthesis of these derivatives by the traditional route results in a mixture of the two regioisomers. We have developed a straightforward regioselective synthesis that gave convenient access to 5- and 6-methoxysubstituted benzimidazole derivatives of ZSTK474. While 5-methoxy substitution abolished activity at all isoforms, the 6-methoxy substitution is consistently 10-fold more potent. This synthesis will allow convenient access to further 6-position derivatives, thus allowing the full scope of the structure-activity relationships of ZSTK474 to be probed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzimidazole 3aderivatization 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3astructure-activity relationships1 aPinson, Jo-Anne1 aZheng, Zhaohua1 aJennings, Ian G.1 aThompson, Philip E.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 23, no. 3 p.802-805dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.11.0763Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170300001600284520135500300592002801655650002001683650002901703650004101732650001101773650001501784650003201799650001001831650001901841653001701860653001601877653002501893653004601918653001201964700002301976700002501999700002302024700002602047773013802073856008502211852000902296655001202305IND60285677720221120210007.0150630e20150621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6028567772DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2015.10554722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMousa, Amayreh10aFlow-assisted automated solid-phase microextraction for the determination of chloroethers in aqueous matrices  ap. 744-753.  aIn this study a method of flow-assisted automated solid-phase microextraction (FA-SPME) was developed for the determination of organic pollutants in aqueous samples. A CTC Combi-PAL autosampler coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used to automate the entire extraction process. In this method, the SPME fibre was exposed to 100 mL of sample in a direct immersion mode for 10 min. After exposure, the fibre was desorbed at the injection port of GC–MS. To demonstrate the applicability of FA-SPME, chloroethers were selected as model compounds. Good linear correlation was found over a concentration range of 0.5–100 µg/L. The detection limits of the method were determined between 0.02 and 0.05 µg/L with the coefficients of determination (R ²) from 0.9980 to 0.9996. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the FA-SPME for three sequential FA-SPME analyses were determined to be in the range between 1.2% and 6.2% (n = 3). The applicability of the method was assessed by means of recovery studies and satisfactory values for all compounds were obtained. This optimised method was used in the analysis of water and human urine samples to show the matrix effect on FA-SPME. This FA-SPME/GC–MS is substantially faster and suitable for the routine continuous flow-mode environmental monitoring applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental monitoring 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahumans 3apollutants 3asolid phase microextraction 3aurine 3awater analysis 0achloroethers 0aatomisation 0aon-site applications 0aflow-assisted solid phase microextraction 0aGC–MS1 aBasheer, Chanbasha1 aAbdulnaser, Alsharaa1 aAlhooshani, Khaled1 aAl-Arfaj, Abdulrahman0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2015 June 21, v. 95, no. 8 p.744-753dTaylor & Francisx1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2015.10554723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245010300172300001600275520095700291592002801248650001101276650002001287650002601307650001501333650001001348650001401358650001401372650002501386651001301411700002101424700002201445700001801467773008301485856008501568852000901653655001201662IND4468906820221117222654.0141111e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446890682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2011.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadiyala, Suneetha14aThe effect of prime age adult mortality on household composition and consumption in rural Ethiopia  ap. 647-655.  aUsing panel data from Ethiopia covering 1994–1997, we estimate the impact of prime age adult mortality on household composition, household expenditures and dietary diversity. We employed propensity score matching with a difference-in-difference estimator to control for endogeneity of mortality to the outcomes of interest. Households losing a productive adult did not replenish the lost labor, regardless of economic status, sex or status of the deceased adult. With the exception of non-poor households, adult mortality resulted in increased dependency ratios, but did not adversely affect households’ expenditure patterns (total, food and non-food expenditures) regardless of the sex and position of the deceased and the economic status of the households. Although food expenditures were protected, a decline in dietary diversity, especially among the poorest households, reflected increased nutrition insecurity associated with adult mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3afood purchasing 3ahousehold expenditure 3ahouseholds 3alabor 3amortality 3anutrition 3asocioeconomic status 3aEthiopia1 aRogers, Beatrice1 aQuisumbing, Agnes1 aWebb, Patrick0 tFood policy.g2011 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.647-655dElsevier Ltdx0306-91927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2011.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245013000164300001800294520109100312650003801403650001701441650001701458650001401475650003101489650001501520650001301535650001101548650004301559650002001602650002901622650001201651650002901663650002601692700001501718700001601733700001601749700001701765700001801782700001801800773016201818856004701980852000902027655001202036IND60517894920221121044036.0160406e20150429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051789492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b004732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yanjie10aAnthocyanin Accumulation and Molecular Analysis of Correlated Genes in Purple Kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea var. gongylodes L.)  ap. 4160-4169.  aKohlrabi (Brassica oleracea var. gongylodes L.) is an important dietary vegetable cultivated and consumed widely for the round swollen stem. Purple kohlrabi shows abundant anthocyanin accumulation in the leaf and swollen stem. Here, different kinds of anthocyanins were separated and identified from the purple kohlrabi cultivar (Kolibri) by high-performance liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. In order to study the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple kohlrabi, the expression of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and regulatory genes in purple kohlrabi and a green cultivar (Winner) was examined by quantitative PCR. In comparison with the colorless parts in the two cultivars, most of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and two transcription factors were drastically upregulated in the purple tissues. To study the effects of light shed on the anthocyanin accumulation of kohlrabi, total anthocyanin contents and transcripts of associated genes were analyzed in sprouts of both cultivars grown under light and dark conditions. 3aBrassica oleracea var. gongylodes 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acultivars 3agene expression regulation 3aionization 3akohlrabi 3aleaves 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulator genes 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aHu, Zongli1 aZhu, Mingku1 aZhu, Zhiguo1 aWang, Zhijin1 aTian, Shibing1 aChen, Guoping0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 29, v. 63, no. 16 p.4160-4169dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00473  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015100171300001600322520093600338592002801274650001601302650001401318650001001332650001101342650001201353650003201365650001501397650002501412650001001437650002901447700001601476700002101492700002501513700002001538700001901558773011401577856008201691990002301773852000901796655001201805IND60091148220221121025554.0141103e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009114822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2012.11.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Hiroyuki10aDevelopment of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α inhibitors: Effect of ortho-carborane substituents on HIF transcriptional activity under hypoxia  ap. 806-810.  aA series of substituted ortho-carboranylphenoxyacetanilides were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit hypoxia-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity using a cell-based reporter assay in HeLa cells expressing the HRE-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct (HRE-Luc) and constitutively expressing CMV-driven Renilla luciferase reporter, and their ability to inhibit cell growth (GI₅₀) using the MTT assay.

The model involves seven discrete decisions which are related to the selection of the type of the finned tube, number of tube rows, number of tube per row, number of passes, fins per unit length, mean fin thickness and the type of the flow regime. Each discrete decision is modeled using disjunctions, boolean variables and logical propositions. The main continuous decisions are: fan diameter, bundle width, tube length, pressure drops and velocities in both sides of the ACHE, heat transfer area, fan power consumption. Then, the resulting generalized disjunctive programming model is reformulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming, implemented in GAMS (general algebraic modeling system) and solved using a branch-and-bound method. The proposed model was successfully verified by comparing the obtained output results with different designs taken from the literature. Then, the model is solved to obtain the optimal designs corresponding to the following optimization criteria: a) minimization the total annual cost which includes investment (heat transfer area) and operating cost (fan power consumption), b) minimization the heat transfer area and c) minimization the fan power consumption. Obtained optimal and sub-optimal designs are compared in detail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aenergy use and consumption 3afins 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3aoperating costs 0aAir cooled heat exchangers 0aOptimization 0aGeneralized disjunctive programming 0aMathematical programming1 aScenna, Nicolás J.1 aMussati, Sergio F.0 tEnergy.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 64 p.734-746dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.09.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245017600209300001600385506007600401520173300477592002802210506003702238650002302275650001502298650001102313650001002324650001002334650002502344650001402369650002602383650002102409650001702430650001902447650001102466650004202477650002902519650001902548650000902567650001202576700002002588700001702608700002002625700001802645700001902663700002002682700001902702700002002721700001602741700002102757773009102778856008502869852000902954655001202963IND60285678420221207085619.0150630e20150704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6028567842DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2015.10296372doi7 aPMC44866342pmcid7 a258691122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjuric, Zora10aEffects of a Mediterranean Diet Intervention on Anti- and Pro-Inflammatory Eicosanoids, Epithelial Proliferation, and Nuclear Morphology in Biopsies of Normal Colon Tissue  ap. 721-729.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis randomized trial evaluated the effects of intervention with either a Healthy Eating or a Mediterranean diet on colon biomarkers in 120 healthy individuals at increased colon cancer risk. The hypothesis was that eicosanoids and markers of proliferation would be favorably affected by the Mediterranean diet. Colon epithelial biopsy tissues and blood samples were obtained at baseline and after 6 mo of intervention. Colonic eicosanoid concentrations were evaluated by HPLC-MS-MS, and measures of epithelial proliferation and nuclear morphology were evaluated by image analysis of biopsy sections. There was little change in proinflammatory eicosanoids and in plasma cytokine concentrations with either dietary intervention. There was, however, a 50% increase in colonic prostaglandin E ₃ (PGE ₃), which is formed from eicosapentanoic acid, in the Mediterranean arm. Unlike PGE ₂, PGE ₃, was not significantly affected by regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at baseline, and normal weight subjects had significantly higher colon PGE ₃ than overweight or obese subjects. Increased proliferation in the colon at baseline, by Ki67 labeling, was associated with morphological features that defined smaller nuclei in the epithelial cells, lower colon leukotriene concentrations and higher plasma cytokine concentrations. Dietary intervention had little effect on measures of epithelial proliferation or of nuclear morphology. The increase in PGE ₃ with a Mediterranean diet indicates that in normal colon, diet might affect protective pathways to a greater extent than proinflammatory and proliferative pathways. Hence, biomarkers from cancer models might not be relevant in a true prevention setting.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean diet 3abiomarkers 3abiopsy 3ablood 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytokines 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aepithelial cells 3ahealthy diet 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3anutritional intervention 3aprostaglandins 3arisk 3atissues1 aTurgeon, D.

Several factors have contributed to the current lack of effective vaccines, including the high rate of viral mutation, low immunogenicity of recombinant viral antigens, instability of viral antigenic proteins administered in vivo, sophisticated mechanisms of viral immune evasion, and inefficient induction of mucosal immunity by vaccine models studied to date. Some of these obstacles could be partially overcome by the use of vaccine adjuvants. Nanoparticles have been intensively investigated as vaccine adjuvants because they possess chemical and structural properties that improve immunogenicity. The use of nanotechnology in the construction of immunization systems has developed into the field of viral nanovaccinology. The purpose of this paper is to review and correlate recent discoveries concerning nanoparticles and specific properties that contribute to the immunogenicity of viral nanoparticle vaccines, bio-nano interaction, design of nanoparticle vaccines for clinically relevant viruses, and future prospects for viral nanoparticle vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aOrthopneumovirus 3aZika virus 3aimmune evasion 3aimmunogenicity 3amodels 3amucosal immunity 3amutation 3ananoparticles 3aproteins 3avaccination 3avaccine adjuvants 3avaccines 3aviral antigens 3aviruses1 aLiszbinski, Raquel B.1 aRomão, Pedro R.

Micrococcus varians) primarily acting on putrescine. Data from MALDI-TOF MS/MS and the identification of Δ1-pyrroline as degradation product from putrescine indicate that the enzyme is a flavin-dependent putrescine oxidase (PuO). Properties of partially purified enzyme have been determined. The enzyme oxidizes diamines, putrescine and cadaverine, and, to a lesser extent, polyamines, such as spermidine, but not monoamines. The kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) for the two major substrates were 94 ± 10 μM and 2.3 ± 0.1 μmol/min·mg for putrescine and 75 ± 5 μM and 0.15 ± 0.02 μmol/min·mg for cadaverine. Optimal temperature and pH were 45 °C and 8.5, respectively. Enzyme was stable until 50 °C. K. varians PuO is sensitive to human flavin-dependent amine oxidase inhibitors and carboxyl-modifying compounds. The new enzyme has been isolated from a bacterial starter used in the manufacture of fermented meat. One of the problems of fermented foods or beverages is the presence of toxic biogenic amines produced by bacteria. The importance of this works lies in the description of a new enzyme able to degrade two of the most abundant biogenic amines (putrescine and cadaverine), the use of which could be envisaged to diminish biogenic amines content in foods in the future. 3aKocuria varians 3abacteria 3abeverages 3acadaverine 3aenzyme stability 3afermented meat 3ahumans 3amanufacturing 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amonoamines 3apH 3aputrescine 3aspermidine 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aSendra, Ramon1 aFerrer, Sergi1 aPardo, Isabel0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2015 Apr. 29, v. 63, no. 16 p.4170-4178dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf5026967  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245013900203300001600342506010400358506007600462520166400538592002802202506003702230650001902267650000902286650001002295650002802305650001502333650002602348653001102374653002102385653001302406653001802419653003202437700001702469700001802486700001902504700001302523700005402536773011802590856008202708852000902790655001202799IND60773279020221207061955.0220706e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077327902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jvc.2022.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuura, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6047-286510aNon-invasive assessment of left ventricular relaxation property using color M-mode-derived intraventricular pressure gradients in cats  ap. 236-248.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDiastolic dysfunction is an early clinical feature of feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The left ventricular filling in early diastole is facilitated by the diastolic intraventricular pressure gradient (IVPG). The study objectives were to evaluate color Doppler M-mode-derived IVPG calculation in cats as a non-invasive assessment of the left ventricular relaxation property to determine the normal ranges of peak IVPG in cats and investigate the influence of left ventricular function and heart rate (HR). One hundred and six client-owned apparently healthy cats. Prospective cross-sectional study. Quantitative analysis of color Doppler M-mode images was used to estimate total and segmental IVPGs non-invasively. The total IVPG was 0.76 mmHg (95% reference interval (RI): 0.28–1.29 mmHg), the basal IVPG 0.34 mmHg (95% RI: 0.07–0.63 mmHg), and the mid-apical IVPG 0.42 mmHg (95% RI: 0.15–0.71 mmHg). Total and segmental IVPG increased with HR (P < 0.003), while segmental percent IVPG was HR independent. A short isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and a high mitral annular velocity in early diastole were associated with an increase in total IVPG (P = 0.008 and P = 0.009, respectively) adjusted for HR. An increase in IVPG was associated with an increase in mitral inflow velocity (P < 0.001). Feline IVPGs increase with HR and a short IVRT, which was believed to be a normal physiologic adrenergic response associated with an increased sympathetic tone. Future studies of segmental IVPG changes in feline HCM are needed to evaluate the clinical applicability of color Doppler M-mode estimated IVPGs in feline cardiology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acardiomyopathy 3acats 3acolor 3across-sectional studies 3aheart rate 3aquantitative analysis 0aFeline 0aEchocardiography 0aDiastole 0aSuction force 0aHypertrophic cardiomyopathy1 aBach, M.B.T.1 aTakahashi, K.1 aWillesen, J.L.1 aKoch, J.1 aTanaka, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9948-64900 tJournal of veterinary cardiology.g2022 June, v. 41 p.236-248dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000118x1760-27347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvc.2022.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04089naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002700168245012200195300001600317520159900333592002801932650001901960650002001979650002401999650001602023650001502039650001102054650002202065650001702087650002302104650000902127650002302136650004302159650001502202650000902217650002602226650001202252650002002264650002502284650004502309650005302354650000902407650002902416650002802445650001102473650002202484650001702506650003802523650001502561650001102576650001902587650002302606650002002629650000902649650005302658650001602711650001402727650003602741650003202777650001702809650001602826650006502842700002002907700002302927700002102950700001802971700002002989700001803009700002203027700002003049773010803069856008503177852000903262655001203271IND4478460520221123012338.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447846052DNAL7 a215432002pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2010.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Catherine M.10aDietary saturated fat, gender and genetic variation at the TCF7L2 locus predict the development of metabolic syndrome  ap. 239-244.  aTranscription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the strongest genetic determinant of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and insulin-related phenotypes to date. Dietary fat is a key environmental factor which may interact with genotype to affect risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and T2DM. This study investigated the relationship between the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism, insulin sensitivity/resistance and MetS in the LIPGENE-SU.VI.MAX study of MetS cases and matched controls (n=1754) and determined potential interactions with dietary fat intake. Female minor T allele carriers of rs7903146 had increased MetS risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, confidence interval [CI] 1.02–2.70, P=.04) and displayed elevated insulin concentrations (P=.005), impaired insulin sensitivity (P=.011), increased abdominal obesity (P=.008) and body mass index (P=.001) and higher blood pressure (P<.05) compared to the CC homozygotes. Metabolic syndrome risk was also modulated by dietary saturated fat (SFA) intake (P=.035 for interaction). High dietary SFA intake (≥15.5% energy) exacerbated MetS risk (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.29–4.27, P=.005) and was associated with further impaired insulin sensitivity in the T allele carriers relative to the CC homozygotes (P=.025) and particularly to the T allele carriers with the lowest SFA intake (P=.008). No significant genotype effect on MetS risk or insulin sensitivity was evident among low-SFA consumers. In conclusion, the TCF7L2 rs7903146 polymorphism influences MetS risk, which is augmented by both gender and dietary SFA intake, suggesting novel gene–diet–gender interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3adietary fat 3afat intake 3agender 3agenetic variation 3ahomozygosity 3ainsulin resistance 3aloci 3ametabolic syndrome 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3atranscription factors 2aAlleles 2aBody Mass Index 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGenetic Loci 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHomozygote 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexbloodxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 2aTranscription Factor 7-Like 2 Proteinxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGoumidi, Louisa1 aBertrais, Sandrine1 aField, Martyn R.1 aMcManus, Ross1 aHercberg, Serge1 aLairon, Denis1 aPlanells, Richard1 aRoche, Helen M.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2012 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.239-244dElsevier Inc.x0955-28637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2010.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04107naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003800151245012600189300001400315520183600329592002802165650001702193650001502210650001502225650002602240650002202266650001102288650002102299650002602320650001102346650003302357650002002390650001602410650001402426650001102440650001302451651001102464653000702475653000702482653000902489653000802498653000802506653000802514653000802522653004202530653003702572653004202609653004202651653004302693653004202736653004202778653003602820653003702856653002402893653001502917653001702932653001302949653000902962700003502971700002003006700001903026700003003045700002503075700001903100700003903119773010803158856008603266852000903352655001203361IND60543158920221122050708.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054315892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattler, José Augusto Gasparotto10aImpact of origin on bioactive compounds and nutritional composition of bee pollen from southern Brazil: A screening study  ap. 82-91.  aBee pollen (BP) has been increasingly studied because it contains a wide variety of bioactive compounds, including vitamins. Brazilian botanical diversity, together with the potential of local beekeeping production, makes BP's capacity as a food source of bioactive compounds major focus for research. In this scenario, the objective of this study was to screen and evaluate the chemical composition, including antioxidant vitamins, of BP samples from southern Brazil, and to correlate them with their botanical origin. Analyses of nutritional composition were performed to compare them with the quality parameters established by Brazilian and international regulations. Additionally, individual sugars and vitamins (C, E and pro-vitamin A) were quantified and microscopic analysis for taxon classification was performed to correlate with vitamins and nutritional composition. The results of the chemical analysis showed that the samples were in accordance with the relevant regulations. The composition of vitamins and pollen types varied among the samples. Some BP could be classified as a source of a particular vitamin in a standard dose (25g). Lipid and protein content from Rio Grande do Sul presented higher mean values (p<0.05) compared with the other two states. Some correlations between chemical composition and botanical taxon were observed. Principal component analysis showed that the samples from the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná presented similarities in terms of composition for each location. HCA and PLSDA were not able to classify the samples based on the chemical markers used. The analysis of vitamins confirmed that BP from this region can be a good source of antioxidant vitamins and that it can provide important nutritional information to food researchers and bioactive compounds for consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapiculture 3abee pollen 3abotanical composition 3achemical analysis 3alipids 3anutrient content 3anutrition information 3apollen 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein content 3aresearchers 3ascreening 3asugars 3avitamins 3aBrazil 0aBP 0aGI 0aHPLC 0aGPS 0aPCA 0aHCA 0aDRI 0aAscorbic acid (PubChem CID: 54670067) 0aBeta-carotene (PubChem CID: 573) 0aAlpha-carotene (PubChem CID: 6419725) 0aAlpha-tocopherol (PubChem CID: 14985) 0aBeta-tocopherol (PubChem CID: 6857447) 0aGamma-tocopherol (PubChem CID: 92729) 0aDelta-tocopherol (PubChem CID: 92094) 0aGlucose (PubChem CID: 53782692) 0aFructose (PubChem CID: 53782691) 0aBioactive compounds 0aBee pollen 0aBee products 0aVitamins 0aHPLC1 ade Melo, Illana Louise Pereira1 aGranato, Daniel1 aAraujo, Elias,1 ada Silva de Freitas, Alex1 aBarth, Ortrud Monika1 aSattler, Aroni1 aAlmeida-Muradian, Ligia Bicudo de,0 tFood research international.g2015 Nov., v. 77 p.82-91dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010100157300002000258500001900278520147500297592002801772650002201800650002001822650001101842650000901853650001201862650002201874700001701896700001501913700001901928700001501947700001601962700001501978700001601993700001202009700001602021773014402037856007402181852000902255655001202264IND60717483120221119054404.0201111e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071748312DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta07887e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cai'e10aHigh-efficiency ternary nonfullerene organic solar cells with record long-term thermal stability  ap. 22907-22917.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAchieving high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) with long-term thermal stability is a major challenge toward commercialization. In the present study, a ternary blend strategy was employed to improve the thermal stability of OSCs with a novel small molecular acceptor ITC6-2F serving as the second acceptor. Compared with its parent compound ITC6-IC, the introduction of fluoro substituents at the two end groups can reduce the π–π stacking distance and enhance the intermolecular interactions in films. The PBDB-T:IDT-PDOT-C6:ITC6-2F-based ternary blend film exhibits a reduced lamellar distance and an increased crystalline coherence length, compared to the corresponding binary blend films. Photo-physics and device physics analyses demonstrate that the charge-transfer state energy is dominated by PBDB-T and IDT-PDOT-C6 in the ternary OSCs. Also, ITC6-2F can facilitate the photonic energy transfer to IDT-PDOT-C6 and promote more excitons to reach the donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces to achieve high-efficiency photoelectric conversion. More importantly, the enhanced intermolecular interactions and good miscibility between the two acceptors help to “freeze” the film morphology, leading to a significantly improved long-term thermal stability. The device efficiency remained at 80.3% of its initial value after 137 days of continuous heating at 75 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box, which is a record result for high-efficiency OSCs reported so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3aenergy transfer 3agloves 3aheat 3aphotons 3athermal stability1 aMing, Shouli1 aWu, Hongbo1 aWang, Xiaodong1 aHuang, Hao1 aXue, Wenyue1 aXu, Xinjun1 aTang, Zheng1 aMa, Wei1 aBo, Zhishan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 8, no. 43 p.22907-22917dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta07887e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010900167300001800276500000900294520166000303592002801963650002101991650001202012650002102024650001402045650001402059650001602073650001102089650000702100650002002107650001902127650001902146650001902165650001802184700002102202700002202223700002202245700002102267700002002288773021902308856008002527852000902607655001202616IND60666438720221123045324.0191028e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643872DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2015.05.02142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunolt, Alicia E.10aMultiple Applications of Sodium Bisulfate to Broiler Litter Affect Ammonia Release and Litter Properties  ap. 1903-1910.  aepub  aAmmonia (NH₃) emissions from animal manures can cause air and water quality problems. Poultry litter treatment (PLT, sodium bisulfate; Jones–Hamilton Co.) is an acidic amendment that is applied to litter in poultry houses to decrease NH₃ emissions, but currently it can only be applied once before birds are placed in the houses. This project analyzed the effect of multiple PLT applications on litter properties and NH₃ release. Volatility chambers were used to compare multiple, single, and no application of PLT to poultry litter, all with and without fresh manure applications. A field component consisted of two commercial broiler houses: one had a single, preflock PLT application, while the other received PLT reapplications during the flock using an overhead application system. In the volatility chambers, single and reapplied PLT caused greater litter moisture and lower litter pH and Escherichia coli, relative to no PLT. After 14 d, NH₃ released from litter treated with reapplied PLT was significantly less than litter with both single and no applications. Furthermore, total N in litter was greatest in litter treated with reapplied PLT, increasing its fertilizer value. In the commercial poultry houses, PLT reapplication led to a temporary decrease in litter pH and E. coli, but these effects did not last because of continued bird excretion. Although one preflock PLT application is currently used as a successful strategy to control NH₃ during early flock growth, repeat PLT application using the overhead reapplication system was not successful because of problems with the reapplication system and litter moisture concerns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aammonia 3abroiler chickens 3aemissions 3aexcretion 3afertilizers 3aflocks 3apH 3apoultry housing 3apoultry manure 3asodium sulfate 3atotal nitrogen 3awater quality1 aMaguire, Rory O.1 aOgejo, Jactone A.1 aBadgley, Brian D.1 aFrame, W.

Over the course of 53 days, the floodwaters of Harvey delivered 14 × 10⁹ m³ of freshwater to Galveston Bay. This resulted in record flooding of Houston bayous and waterways, all of which drained into the San Jacinto Estuary (SJE,) with its main tributaries being Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. The lower SJE and lower Buffalo Bayou has experienced up to 3 m of land subsidence in the past 100 years and, as a result, prior to Hurricane Harvey, up to 2 m of sediment within the upper seabed contained an archive of high concentrations of Total Hg (HgT) and other particle-bound and porewater contaminants. Within the SJE, Harvey eroded at least 48 cm of the sediment column, resulting in the transport of an estimated 16.4 × 10⁶ tons of sediment and at least 2 tons of Hg into Galveston Bay. This eroded sediment was replaced by a Harvey storm deposit of 7.73 × 10⁶ tons of sediment and 0.96 tons within the SJE, mostly sourced from Buffalo Bayou. Considering that the frequency of slow-moving tropical cyclones capable of delivering devastating rainfall may be increasing, then one can expect that delivery of Hg and other contaminants from the archived sediment within urbanized estuaries will increase and that what happened during Harvey is a harbinger of what is to come.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3ahurricanes 3arain 3arivers 3asediments 3asubsidence 3aurbanization 3aTexas 0aBB 0aHgT 0aSJE 0ang g−1 0aHurricane Harvey 0aGalveston Bay 0aSan Jacinto River 0aMercury 0aFlood deposit 0aLegacy contaminants1 aHoelscher, Christena1 aHill, Lisa1 aAl Mukaimi, Mohammad E.1 aKnap, Anthony0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 748 p.141226-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1412263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014800170300001800318520108200336592002801418596005701446650004801503650002101551650001301572650002801585650001001613650002501623650001401648650003001662650002501692650001801717650001401735700006201749700001501811700002201826700002301848773013801871856008102009852000902090655001202099IND60614161420221118011322.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061416142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-018-1061-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkimova, Galina A.10aDistribution of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase and D-cysteine desulfhydrase genes among type species of the genus Methylobacterium  ap. 1723-1734.  aThe presence of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase determines the ability of bacteria to increase the resistance of plants to various types of stress. The genes of ACC deaminase (acdS) and the closely related enzyme D-cysteine desulfhydrase (dcyD) were searched in type strains of various representatives of the genus Methylobacterium. Using PCR screening and in silico searching in the available complete genome sequences of type strains, the genes were found in 28 of 48 species of the genus. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of proteins revealed two large groups of sequences of the AcdS protein and one of the DcyD protein. The distribution of these groups correlates well with the phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of the 16S rRNA genes, which apparently indicates a different evolutionary adaptation to association with plants in the representatives of these groups. For the first time for aerobic methylotrophs it was demonstrated that the gene dcyD encodes D-cysteine desulfhydrase by cloning and recombinant protein characterization.  aPublisher supplied data  a16-04-00381_acRussian Foundation for Basic Research 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3aMethylobacterium 3abacteria 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant proteins 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening1 aFedorov, Dmitry N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7338-79291 aTani, Akio1 aDoronina, Nina V.1 aTrotsenko, Yuri A.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2018 Oct., v. 111, no. 10 p.1723-1734dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-018-1061-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010100170300001600271520147700287592002801764650002101792650001501813650001301828650001801841650001101859650000901870650002401879650001401903650001801917650001701935650001601952650001701968650001201985650001901997650001002016650001102026653002502037653001702062653002402079653002502103653002102128653002502149700005402174700002502228700001802253700001602271773009102287856008902378852000902467655001202476IND60606382120221119025818.0180725e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060638212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta, R.10aTetracycline adsorption onto activated carbons produced by KOH activation of tyre pyrolysis char  ap. 168-176.  aTyre pyrolysis char (TPC), produced when manufacturing pyrolysis oil from waste tyre, was used as raw material to prepare activated carbons (ACs) by KOH activation. KOH to TPC weight ratios (W) between 0.5 and 6, and activation temperatures from 600 to 800 °C, were used. An increase in W resulted in a more efficient development of surface area, microporosity and mesoporosity. Thus, ACs derived from TPC (TPC-ACs) with specific surface areas up to 814 m² g⁻¹ were obtained. TPC, TPC-ACs and a commercial AC (CAC) were tested for removing Tetracycline (TC) in aqueous phase, and systematic adsorption studies, including equilibrium, kinetics and thermodynamic aspects, were performed. Kinetics was well described by the pseudo-first order model for TPC, and by a pseudo second-order kinetic model for ACs. TC adsorption equilibrium data were also fitted by different isotherm models: Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, Dubinin–Radushkevich, Dubinin–Astokov, Temkin, Redlich–Peterson, Radke–Prausnitz and Toth. The thermodynamic study confirmed that TC adsorption onto TPC-ACs is a spontaneous process. TC adsorption data obtained in the present study were compared with those reported in the literature, and differences were explained in terms of textural properties and surface functionalities. TPC-ACs had similar performances to those of commercial ACs, and might significantly improve the economic balance of the production of pyrolysis oil from waste tyres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3akinetics 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aoils 3apotassium hydroxide 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atetracycline 3atexture 3athermodynamics 3atires 3awastes 0aWaste tyre recycling 0aTetracycline 0aAntibiotics removal 0aWastewater treatment 0aActivated carbon 0aAdsorption modelling1 aFierro, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7081-36971 aMartinez de Yuso, A.1 aNabarlatz, D.1 aCelzard, A.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Apr., v. 149 p.168-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02122naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012100170300001600291520088300307592002801190653002501218653002101243653003701264653003501301653002901336653002401365653003701389653003201426700005601458700005701514773011801571856008601689852000901775655001201784IND60602568520221118225011.0180711e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060256852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Eunsung10aTheoretical analysis of performance of a two-stage compression CO2 cycle with two different evaporating temperatures  ap. 164-175.  aThe performance characteristics of a two-stage CO2 system with two different evaporating temperatures have been analyzed through simulation with such variables as outdoor air temperature, outdoor air velocity, and 2nd-stage EEV opening.

The system had a maximum cooling COP for the frostless cooling capacity of −10%, or −20% when the 2nd-stage EEV opening was 56%. The maximum cooling COPs for the non-frost and the frostless cooling capacity of −30% were 1.45 and 1.003, respectively, when the 2nd-stage EEV opening was 52%.

In Hungary, this triggered the development of flood‐peak polders as a more cost‐efficient solution of defense compared to raising the dikes. The recent analysis applies Monte‐Carlo simulation‐based quantified risk calculations with a cost–benefit type comparison. Results indicate that compared to the originally planned, 100‐year return frequency flood that threats to topple the levees, lower flood levels already provide economic justification for polder use. Apart from the optimal timing of opening the floodgates, the controlled inundation of polders requires the consideration of its cost–benefit effects as well. The development of the economic decision‐support system for the controlled use of the flood‐peak polders along the Tisza River provides an insight into the efficiency gains that a more informed, quantitative economic analysis can offer in risk reduction. The analysis reveals the potential for more efficient management of flood polders. The decision support of controlled polder inundation includes all the necessary information elements for the cross‐sectoral comparability of impacts that is the foundation for any multi‐purpose land management scheme that enables nature‐based solutions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3adecision support systems 3apolders 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3aHungary1 aKis, András,0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2022 Sept., v. 15, no. 3 p.e12823-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.128233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245011000215300001600325520070700341592002801048650001801076650001301094650001601107650001501123650002001138650002201158700001701180700001801197773012501215856008301340852000901423655001201432IND60542765820221120235926.0190405e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054276582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2014.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Sarina Abdul Halim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3526-712X10aStatistical Process Control (SPC) in the food industry – A systematic review and future research agenda  ap. 137-151.  aThis paper presents a systematic review on the reported implementation of Statistical Process Control (SPC) in the food industry.

To promote the commercial applicability of these enzymes, the influence of pulp properties such as carbohydrate composition, pulp type and cellulose morphology on the enzymatic degradability of a pulp was examined. High contents of hemicelluloses and lignin were shown to impair the accessibility of the cellulose to the enzymes. Due to the elevated swelling capacity of cellulose II, conversion of the cellulose morphology from I to II upon alkaline treatments showed a large increasing effect on the cellulose accessibility, and enzymatic degradability. Reactivity measurements of softwood sulfite pulps after enzymatic degradation and acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, respectively, revealed elevated reactivity for the pulp after acid treatment. This is in contrast to effects of enzyme treatments reported for CCE treated kraft pulps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3aalkali treatment 3acarbohydrate composition 3acellulose 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic treatment 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3akraft pulp 3alignin 3apaper 3asoftwood 3aswelling (materials) 3aviscosity1 aSixta, Herbert0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Mar. 12, v. 13, no. 3 p.645-651dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm201784u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007300150245009400223300001800317520131200335592002801647650002201675650003201697650002701729650001601756650001901772650001301791650002401804651001101828653003301839653002301872653002101895653002801916700002101944700007301965700002602038700005702064773009902121856008502220852000902305655001202314IND60752559420221120050105.0211114e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.09.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadilha Campos Lopes, Mariana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2627-181610aTechnical potential of floating photovoltaic systems on artificial water bodies in Brazil  ap. 1023-1033.  aFloating photovoltaic systems (FPVs) are an emerging technology where photovoltaic solar panels are placed on the water surface. They are cost-competitive compared to ground-mounted solar farms and provide some additional and unique properties including reduced evaporation of the water from the reservoir, mitigating algae growth; higher efficiency of electricity generation compared to common PV systems because of the cooling effects of water and preventing land-use conflicts. Despite the growing interest in this technology and the opportunities that it could create, there is no systematic assessment of the technical potential of FPVs in Brazil. This work is the first study on the technical potential of FPVs in artificial water bodies applied to Brazil at country and state levels. The country's potential for this purpose was determined based on two criteria: selecting only artificial/man-made water bodies and excluding protected areas. The QGIS software was used to locate water bodies and cross georeferenced meteorological data. The results show that even if FPVs cover only 1% of the identified suitable areas this technology can produce energy equivalent to almost 12.5% of the current national electricity generation and correspond to approximately 16% of Brazil's electricity consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity generation 3aevaporation 3ageoreferencing 3aland use 3ameteorological data 3aBrazil 0aFloating photovoltaic system 0aPotential capacity 0aRenewable energy 0aArtificial water bodies1 aNogueira, Tainan1 aSantos, Alberto José Leandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2627-18161 aCastelo Branco, David1 aPouran, Hamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5233-00850 tRenewable energy.g2022 Jan., v. 181 p.1023-1033dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.09.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012200172300001400294520106100308592002801369653001701397653001201414653001701426653001701443653001801460653001501478653001201493653003001505653001701535653002201552700002201574700002201596773011601618856008601734852000901820655001201829IND60602568720221118225106.0180711e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060256872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Col, Davide10aComprehensive experimental investigation of two-phase heat transfer and pressure drop with propane in a minichannel  ap. 66-84.  aThe use of hydrocarbons as natural refrigerants inside small diameter channels allows charge minimization and therefore it may be an interesting option in the refrigerating and heat pump technology.

The generalized Improved Problem Table is proposed to locate the flowrate targets of individual and interplant hydrogen networks. The constructed limiting composite curves and optimal hydrogen supply lines are utilized to illustrate the insights of the proposed approach. The generalized Improved Problem Table incorporated with mass balance equations is applied to determine the optimal targets (i.e. the optimal flowrates of hydrogen utility and product of the purifier, optimal feed impurity of purifier) of hydrogen network with purification reuse/recycle. Two scenarios of interplant hydrogen integration with direct reuse/recycle are investigated. The case study shows that the conservation ratio of the flowrate of hydrogen utility in Scenario 2 is greater than or equal to that in Scenario 1 and that with purification reuse/recycle scheme is increased sharply. Meanwhile the optimal feed impurity of purifier is greater than or equal to the pinch impurity with direct reuse/recycle scheme. The energy performance evaluation shows that interplant hydrogen integration offers an impressive way to reduce the equivalent energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aequations 3ahydrogen 0aPinch analysis 0aProblem table 0aInterplant 0aHydrogen network 0aPurification1 aZhou, Yuhang1 aChen, Cheng-Liang1 aFeng, Xiao0 tEnergy.g2015 Oct., v. 90 p.68-88dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.05.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014000167300001600307520162900323592002801952650002201980650002002002650002402022650001502046650002002061650001602081650001202097653002202109653002802131653002502159653003302184653003802217700005402255700002902309700001302338700001302351773009702364856008502461852000902546655001202555IND60752559520221120050046.0211129e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.09.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Shuang10aNumerical simulation to study the effect of spectral division of solar irradiance on the spectral splitting photovoltaic/thermal system  ap. 634-646.  aAs a typical photo-thermal-electric multiphysics process, the energy transfer and conversion in spectral splitting photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) systems are rather complex. For a better prediction of the system performance, a fully-coupled finite volume-discrete ordinates (FV-DO) radiation model for the numerical simulation of the PV/T system was developed. However, the previously proposed models still lacked detailed discussion for the spectrum division, to improve the criteria for the “spectrum mesh”, this study applied the wavelet decomposition method and the piecewise constant fitting method for the spectrum division in the fully-coupled model and herein evaluated the initially introduced spectrum errors (the total radiation absolute error AE, root mean square error RMSE, and the correlation coefficient γ). Then the influence of spectrum division on the PV/T system performances (the absorbed radiation, PV cell temperature, energy efficiency, and merit function) were comprehensively investigated. Eventually, the relations between initially introduced spectrum indexes and the absolute errors of performance indicators comparing with benchmark results were discussed. The result of 20 bands divided by the piecewise constant fitting method, which could achieve relative errors of PV temperature, energy efficiency from the benchmark by 0.046% and 0.840%, respectively, was recommended as a compromise between the accuracy and the increasing computing resources. RSME and γ of the discrete spectrum can be used to initially estimate the accuracy of the performance of the spectral splitting PV/T system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3aenergy transfer 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3awavelet 0aSpectrum division 0aSpectral splitting PV/T 0aNumerical simulation 0aWavelet decomposition method 0aPiecewise constant fitting method1 aLi, Wenzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5257-583X1 aAbd El-Samie, Mostafa M.1 aJu, Xing1 aXu, Chao0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Jan., v. 182 p.634-646dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.09.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245006300160300001600223500001100239520094500250592002801195596005901223596005901282596005401341650001601395650003001411650002201441650002101463650001801484650002401502650000901526650002201535650001601557650001801573650002001591650001401611650001301625700001501638700001701653700001501670700005801685773013101743856007801874852000901952655001201961IND60681337920221122010019.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133792DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2019007582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Xiaowen10aMicrofluidic chip electrophoresis for biochemical analysis  ap. 258-270.  aREVIEW  aMicrofluidic chip electrophoresis has been widely employed for separation of various biochemical species owing to its advantages of low sample consumption, low cost, fast analysis, high throughput, and integration capability.

We then propose to examine the physical origin of the power-law scaling in the inertial range of turbine power outputs by experimentally exploring the spectral content of a 1:20 scaled model of a three-bladed horizontal-axis turbine positioned in a 3D turbulent flow. First, measurements confirm that the turbine power frequency spectra exhibit a power law decay proportional to −11/3 in the inertial range. Knowing that the turbine power fluctuations are linearly dependent on the incoming velocity fluctuations, PIV measurements are carried out to study the effect of the spatially integrated velocity onto its resulted spectrum. It is demonstrated that in inhomogeneous anisotropic turbulent flow, the velocity spectrum of its spatial average along N direction(s) has an inertial slope of −5/3 − 2N/3. This information is used to physically interpret the power-law scaling in the inertial range of the turbine power spectra. The previously observed f⁻¹¹/³ scaling results from a 2D-spatial average velocity field coupled with a spectral average over blades. This physical explanation confirms previous works in which a transfer function was developed between incoming turbulence and the turbine power outputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3aturbulent flow 0aWind and tidal turbines 0aPower law decay spectra 0aPower spectral density 0aTurbulence1 aGaurier, Benoît1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9860-64701 aGermain, Greg,0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Jan., v. 181 p.1062-1080dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.09.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011500156300002000271500001900291520108300310592002801393650001501421650001001436650002101446650002001467700002101487700001701508700002701525700002301552700002001575773014401595856007401739852000901813655001201822IND60717483720221119053835.0201111e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071748372DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta08117e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurns, Eric10aLaTiO₂N crystallographic orientation control significantly increases visible-light induced charge extraction  ap. 22867-22873.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPhotocharge extraction in the visible-light energy range is essential to sustain efficient photoelectrochemical processes driven by solar irradiation of photoanode materials. Recent literature has shown that crystallographic orientation can have a significant impact on the extraction of photocharges, though the difficulty of discriminating bulk and surface orientation effects on charge extraction often complicates any understanding as to the role each orientation may play. Our catalyst-decorated thin-film model system allows us to cleanly separate charge extraction limiting effects of bulk vs. surface orientation. As a result, our study reveals an anisotropic visible-light induced photocharge extraction dependence on the bulk crystallographic orientation in LaTiO₂N (LTON) photoanodes. In particular, the visible-light induced photocharge extraction is 30% higher for (011) films than (001) oriented thin films. Computational analysis of the LTON band diagram suggests that this is due to a higher potential energy and photocharge mobility along the (011) direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3alight 3apotential energy 3asolar radiation1 aAschauer, Ulrich1 aDöbeli, Max1 aSchneider, Christof W.1 aPergolesi, Daniele1 aLippert, Thomas0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 8, no. 43 p.22867-22873dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta08117e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245016600170300001800336500001900354520132700373536010101700592002801801596005901829650002101888650002401909650001201933650001201945650002401957650002001981650001602001650002102017650003102038650002002069650001102089650001902100650002102119650001702140650001402157650001002171650000902181650001302190653002902203653001702232653002702249653003202276700001702308700001502325700001302340773014102353856008502494852000902579655001202588IND60708444320221119141510.0200826e20200823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844432DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2020.17302992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hong-Rui10aHydrogen sulfide mediated alleviation of cadmium toxicity in Phlox paniculata L. and establishment of a comprehensive evaluation model for corresponding strategy  ap. 1085-1095.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA laboratory experiment was performed to evaluate the potential role of H₂S on cadmium (Cd) toxicity in Phlox paniculata L. Seeds pretreated with 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 mM NaHS as a donor of H₂S for 24 h and subsequently exposed to 100, 200, and 300 μM CdCl₂ for 26 days had significantly higher germination rate compared with Cd alone. Meanwhile, 2-year-old seedlings sprayed with 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 μM NaHS were grown in soil with 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 mg/kg CdCl₂, respectively. We observed that H₂S decreased Cd accumulation in leaves and elevated Cd concentration in roots. Cd toxicity in seedlings resulted in a substantial increase in Cd-induced overproduction of malondialdehyde (MDA), Cd accumulation, and electrolyte leakage. Meanwhile, addition of NaHS increased photosynthetic performance compared with Cd alone. Exogenous H₂S significantly elevated biomass, improved antioxidant enzyme activities, and reduced ABA content compared with Cd alone. H₂S also plays an important role in the ABA signaling pathway during stress. Notably, NaHS promoted Cd uptake by Phlox paniculate L. from soil. The prediction model of H₂S for increasing plant resistance and reducing soil Cd pollution was established by factor analysis method based on comprehensive evaluation of plant stress physiology.  aThis study was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [31870373].  aPublisher supplied data  a31870373cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPhlox paniculata 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomass 3acadmium 3aelectrolyte leakage 3afactor analysis 3agermination 3ahydrogen sulfide 3alaboratory experimentation 3amalondialdehyde 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3aplant stress 3apollution 3aseeds 3asoil 3atoxicity 0aBioconcentration factors 0acadmium (Cd) 0ahydrogen sulfide (H2S) 0aPhlox (Phlox paniculata L.)1 aChe, Yan-Hui1 aHuang, Dan1 aAo, Hong0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2020 Aug. 23, v. 22, no. 10 p.1085-1095dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl62892x1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2020.17302993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245008200214520142900296592002801725650001501753650001801768650001901786650001601805650001101821650001301832650002001845650001501865650002501880650003001905650001201935650002601947650001001973650001901983650001302002650001402015650001202029653002902041653002502070653002702095653001702122653002502139700002602164700002802190700006202218773011302280856008602393852000902479655001202488IND60752555620221120024753.0211030e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdulkareem, Mariam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0098-158510aLife cycle assessment of a low-height noise barrier for railway traffic noise  aLife cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was applied to assess five locally developed mix designs for a 20 m low-height noise barrier (LHNB) categorized as: precast Portland cement concrete (S0-baseline scenario), two precast geopolymer composites (S1; S2), and two additive-manufactured geopolymer composites (S3; S4). The objective of the study is to carry out a LCA study of the mix designs, to identify environmental hotspots and evaluate the influence of durability and service life on the LCA results. Environmental impact categories assessed are global warming potential (GWP), fossil depletion, photochemical ozone formation, and acidification. Results show that when a fixed service life of 40 years is chosen for all mix designs, S4 is the most environmentally sustainable with 73% reduced GWP when compared to S0. When sensitivity analysis was used to determine the effect of varying service life (10–40 years) on S1–S4; S4 shows equivalent to better environmental performance than S0. Carbonation was considered and result shows up to 8% of CO₂ uptake can be achieved. In conclusion, S4 depicts solutions and concepts that result in environmental improvement potentials for a LHNB from geopolymer composites. The results from this study supported decision-making and guided in the development a 20 m LHNB from 83% industrial side-streams and 0.3% alkali activator maintaining a 10 dB absorption capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacidification 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonation 3acement 3aconcrete 3adecision making 3adurability 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afossils 3alife cycle assessment 3aozone 3aphotochemistry 3apolymers 3arailroads 3atraffic 0aLow-height noise barrier 0aGeopolymer composite 0aAdditive manufacturing 0aService life 0aCompressive strength1 aIn Slaughter Natives,1 aNuortila-Jokinen, Jutta1 aHorttanainen, Mika1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3313-44970 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 323 p.129169-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245018900209300001600398520118000414592002801594650001701622650002501639650001001664650001601674650001301690650000901703650001901712650001301731650002601744650002301770650001601793650001601809650001801825653001601843653002101859653003001880653002401910653001801934700002201952700002201974700002401996700002002020700002702040700002002067700001602087773011002103856008602213852000902299655001202308IND60543156320221122034856.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054315632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambri, Milena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4330-288810aInfluence of different berry thermal treatment conditions, grape anthocyanin profile, and skin hardness on the extraction of anthocyanin compounds in the colored grape juice production  ap. 584-590.  aTo reduce the production surplus of grapes in the wine industry and, at the same time, to meet the growing demand of nutritious foods by health-conscious consumers, alternative processes with better sustainability are needed. In the production of colored grape juices for direct consumption, the application of heat on crushed grapes is a possible technology to increase extraction of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds. To achieve this aim, three different thermal treatments were performed on crushed grapes of two different red varieties with peonidin or malvidin prevalence in the anthocyanin profile. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the chemical composition and color characteristics of the juices were evaluated to pinpoint the time–temperature combination that allowed the highest extraction of anthocyanins. Furthermore, the modification of skin mechanical properties during thermal treatment and impact of the peonidin/malvidin ratio on juice color were investigated. The use of high temperatures for short times was the most profitable time–temperature combination based on the extraction efficacy, color stability and energetic requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3achemical composition 3acolor 3agrape juice 3ahardness 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3amalvidin 3amechanical properties 3aphenolic compounds 3atemperature 3awine grapes 3awine industry 0aGrape juice 0aThermomaceration 0aChromatic characteristics 0aAnthocyanin profile 0aSkin hardness1 aTorchio, Fabrizio1 aColangelo, Donato1 aRío Segade, Susana1 aGiacosa, Simone1 aDe Faveri, Dante Marco1 aGerbi, Vincenzo1 aRolle, Luca0 tFood research international.g2015 Nov., v. 77 p.584-590dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013600158300002000294500001400314520192600328592002802254650001002282650001402292650000802306650001602314650001202330650001102342650001802353650001102371650001002382650002202392650001302414650001602427650001202443650001102455650001402466650000702480650001002487650001502497650001402512700001902526700001802545700001802563700001602581700001802597700001302615700001202628700001902640773012502659856007402784852000902858655001202867IND60717480420221119053922.0201111e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071748042DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra08841b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhipeng10aFrom “S” to “O”: experimental and theoretical insights into the atmospheric degradation mechanism of dithiophosphinic acids  ap. 40035-40042.  aNAL-light  aDithiophosphinic acids (DPAHs, expressed as R₁R₂PSSH) are a type of sulfur-donor ligand that have been vastly applied in hydrometallurgy. In particular, DPAHs have shown great potential in highly efficient trivalent actinide/lanthanide separation, which is one of the most challenging tasks in separation science and is of great importance for the development of an advanced fuel cycle in nuclear industry. However, DPAHs have been found liable to undergo oxidative degradation in the air, leading to significant reduction in the selectivity of actinide/lanthanide separation. In this work, the atmospheric degradation of five representative DPAH ligands was investigated for the first time over a sufficiently long period (180 days). The oxidative degradation process of DPAHs elucidated by ESI-MS, ³¹P NMR, and FT-IR analyses is R₁R₂PSSH → R₁R₂PSOH → R₁R₂POOH → R₁R₂POO–OOPR₁R₂, R₁R₂PSSH → R₁R₂PSS–SSPR₁R₂, and R₁R₂PSSH → R₁R₂PSOH → R₁R₂POS–SOPR₁R₂. Meanwhile, the determination of pKₐ values through pH titration and oxidation product by PXRD further confirms the S → O transformation in the process of DPAH deterioration. DFT calculations suggest that the hydroxyl radical plays the dominant role in the oxidation process of DPAHs and the order in which the oxidation products formed is closely related to the reaction energy barrier. Moreover, nickel salts of DPAHs have shown much higher chemical stability than DPAHs, which was also elaborated through molecular orbital (MO) and adaptive natural density portioning (AdNDP) analyses. This work unambiguously reveals the atmospheric degradation mechanism of DPAHs through both experimental and theoretical approaches. At the application level, the results not only provide an effective way to preserve DPAHs but could also guide the design of more stable sulfur-donor ligands in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aactinides 3aair 3adegradation 3adensity 3adesign 3adeterioration 3aenergy 3afuels 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aindustry 3alanthanides 3aligands 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apH 3asalts 3aseparation 3atitration1 aZhang, Yixiang1 aLiu, Jingjing1 aSong, Lianjun1 aWang, Xueyu1 aYang, Xiuying1 aXu, Chao1 aLi, Jun1 aDing, Songdong0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 10, no. 66 p.40035-40042dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra08841b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016500165300001800330520173400348592002802082596005902110596005902169596006202228650001802290650001702308650001802325650004302343650001102386650001802397650001202415650001302427650001702440650001902457650001302476650001602489650001902505650003302524650002702557650001302584650002502597650001702622650001702639700001502656700001602671700001302687700001702700700001602717700001702733773012102750856008102871852000902952655001202961IND60614159120221118011433.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061415912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-018-3579-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Xiaomin10aDevelopment of an SPE Method Using Ionic Liquid-Based Monolithic Column for On-Line Cleanup of Human Plasma and Simultaneous Determination of Five Steroid Drugs  ap. 1391-1400.  aAn 1-vinyl-3-hexyl imidazolium bromide ionic liquid-based monolithic column was prepared via in situ free radical polymerization, which was used as the sorbent of on-line solid phase extraction. The prepared material was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption–desorption instrument and mercury intrusion porosimetry, respectively, and the results showed that the homemade monolith occupied relatively uniform porous structure and high-specific surface area of 212.53 m² g⁻¹. On-line solid phase extraction–high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantitatively analyze five steroid drugs, including betamethasone, norgestrel, halcinonide, beclomethasone dipropionate and testosterone propionate in human plasma. The determination procedure was carried out following the optimization of the mobile phase composition. Methodological validation showed that correlation coefficients of the linear regressions were in the range of 0.9989–0.9992; the values of relative standard deviation for precision were in the range of 1.39–6.15% for intra-day and 0.32–6.34% for inter-day, respectively; the values of accuracy expressed by recovery were in the range of 99.02–101.98, 93.27–102.89, 102.79–104.01, 100.04–102.61 and 100.77–102.44% for the five drugs in order, respectively; the values of relative standard deviation for repeatability calculated according to retention times and peak areas of the five drugs were in the ranges of 0.28–0.76% (n = 5) and 0.84–2.63% (n = 5), respectively. The results showed that the polymer monolithic column was feasible for an on-line solid phase extraction column, exhibiting good selectivity and high permeability.  aPublisher supplied data  a21505030cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21575033cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aH2017201075cNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province 3abetamethasone 3ablood plasma 3afree radicals 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3aionic liquids 3amercury 3anitrogen 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aporosimetry 3apropionic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3astatistical analysis 3asurface area 3atestosterone1 aBai, Ligai1 aLan, Dandan1 aGuo, Bin1 aWang, Huimin1 aLiu, Haiyan1 aMa, Zhengyue0 tChromatographia.g2018 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1391-1400dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-018-3579-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245022000160300001600380520148800396592002801884650002301912650001801935650001001953650001701963650002101980650001902001650000902020650001502029650001102044650002102055650001402076700002502090700001902115700002002134700001902154700002002173700002002193773010502213856007502318852000902393655001202402IND60532714020171127000000.0160728e20120312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271402DNAL7 a10.1021/bm20150272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffmann, Stefan10aDual Fluorescent HPMA Copolymers for Passive Tumor Targeting with pH-Sensitive Drug Release: Synthesis and Characterization of Distribution and Tumor Accumulation in Mice by Noninvasive Multispectral Optical Imaging  ap. 652-663.  aPreclinical in vivo characterization of new polymeric drug conjugate candidates is crucial for understanding the effects of certain chemical modifications on distribution and elimination of these carrier systems, which is the basis for rational drug design. In our study we synthesized dual fluorescent HPMA copolymers of different architectures and molecular weights, containing one fluorescent dye coupled via a stable hydrazide bond functioning as the carrier label and the other one modeling the drug bound to a carrier via a pH-sensitive hydrolytically cleavable hydrazone bond. Thus, it was possible to track the in vivo fate, namely distribution, elimination and tumor accumulation, of the polymer drug carrier and a cleavable model drug simultaneously and noninvasively in nude mice using multispectral optical imaging. We confirmed our in vivo results by more detailed ex vivo characterization (imaging and microscopy) of autopsied organs and tumors. There was no significant difference in relative biodistribution in the body between the 30 KDa linear and 200 KDa star-like polymer, but the star-like polymer circulated much longer. We observed a moderate accumulation of the polymeric carriers in the tumors. The accumulation of the pH-sensitive releasable model drug was even higher compared to the polymer accumulation. Additionally, we were able to follow the long-term in vivo fate and to prove a time-dependent tumor accumulation of HPMA copolymers over several days.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimage analysis 3amice 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasms1 aVystrčilová, Lucie1 aUlbrich, Karel1 aEtrych, Tomáš1 aCaysa, Henrike1 aMueller, Thomas1 aMäder, Karsten0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Mar. 12, v. 13, no. 3 p.652-663dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm20150273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245005200165300002000217500001400237520033400251592002800585650001100613650001800624650001600642650001000658700001900668700002000687700002100707773012500728856007400853852000900927655001200936IND60717480620221119053928.0201111e20201106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071748062DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra09067k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashikawa, Yoshifumi13aAn orifice design: water insertion into C₆₀  ap. 40406-40410.  aNAL-light  aUsing an open-cage C₆₀ derivative possessing an orifice designed on the basis of computational studies, we have experimentally demonstrated the quantitative encapsulation of H₂O as well as effective conversion into H₂O@C₆₀ in an overall yield remarkably higher than the previously reported methods by ca. 2–5 times.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesign 3aencapsulation 3amethodology 3awater1 aKizaki, Kazuro1 aHirose, Takashi1 aMurata, Yasujiro0 tRSC advances.g2020 Nov. 06, v. 10, no. 66 p.40406-40410dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra09067k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015000167300001800317520153000335592002801865650002901893650002601922650002301948650001301971650001801984650002002002650001002022650001602032650004302048650001302091650001402104650001702118650002602135650002502161700001902186700002102205700003402226700002302260700002502283773012102308856008102429852000902510655001202519IND60614159220221118011432.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061415922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-018-3580-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMemon, Naeem A.10aMethod Development for Determination of Antibiotic Drugs Using Newly Prepared p-Morpholinomethylcalix[4]arene Mesoporous Silica-Based HPLC Column  ap. 1373-1380.  aMesoporous materials are described by their relatively high surface areas and pore volumes. They possess uniform channels within nanometer range. These materials have numerous applications in catalysis, separation and many other fields. The qualitative and quantitative determination of antibiotic drugs, i.e., ciprofloxacin and cefixime has clinical and analytical importance due to their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and stability. Both antibiotic drugs are orally active and have excellent activity against different pathogens. It is for the first time that we have developed an analytical method for the simultaneous analyses of both drugs using a newly developed p-morpholinomethylcalix[4]arene (p-MC4) mesoporous silica-based HPLC column (15 × 3 mm I.D.). Furthermore, separation of these two components was carried out using isocratic elution of methanol and 0.1% aqueous formic acid (70:30 v/v) with flow rate of 1 ml min⁻¹ at retention time of 2.71 and 4.21 min and retention factor 1.85 and 1.19 for ciprofloxacin and cefixime, respectively; while total run time was 5 min. The developed method was repeatable with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.90–2.08% for antibiotic drugs. The limits of detection and quantification of ciprofloxacin and cefixime were obtained within the range of 0.152–0.801 and 0.40–1.23 µg mL⁻¹, respectively. The method is highly applicable, rapid, simple, very reproducible and accurate for the separation and determination of antibiotic drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial properties 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acatalytic activity 3acefixime 3aciprofloxacin 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aformic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amethanol 3apathogens 3aporous media 3aquantitative analysis 3astatistical analysis1 aMemon, Ayaz A.1 aMemon, Fakhar N.1 aSherazi, Sayed Tufail Hussain1 aMemon, Shahabuddin1 aLeghari, Muhammad K.0 tChromatographia.g2018 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.1373-1380dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl1915x0009-58937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10337-018-3580-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245014800195500002000343520116300363592002801526596005201554650001301606650001101619650001801630650001501648650002001663650001501683650001801698650000901716700006201725700002001787700002201807700002101829773013101850856007501981852000902056655001202065IND60789326320221119073017.0220819e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078932632DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.127732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lianhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0599-521412aA novel approach for determining integrated water discharge from the ground surface to trunk sewer networks for fast prediction of urban floods  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany urban flood models employ coarse grids to reduce the computational cost of real‐time forecasting. Such a coarse grid, however, may result in poor predictions of the discharge rate of surface water because of difficulties in representing the detailed features of drainage facilities. In the present study, an urban flood model that consists of a one‐dimensional (1D) river flow model, a two‐dimensional (2D) ground surface flow model, and a 1D sewer network model was developed. A coarse grid is used for the 2D ground surface flow model, and the tail networks of the sewer systems are neglected to reduce computational cost. A novel approach is proposed for determining the integrated water discharge from the ground surface to the trunk sewer network to retain the accuracy of a simplified coarse‐grid system. Numerical experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Measured water levels at manholes were employed to examine the accuracy of the model. The results show that this approach significantly improves the accuracy of the simulated water level in a sewer network with enhanced computational efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data  aJPMJMI17D5cJapan Science and Technology Agency 3adrainage 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3aprediction 3arisk management 3ariver flow 3asurface water 3atail1 aTajima, Yoshimitsu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1856-47231 aSanuki, Hiroshi1 aShibuo, Yoshihiro1 aFurumai, Hiroaki0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2022 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.e12773-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.127733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245010900154300002000263500001900283520172300302592002802025650002002053650001902073650001602092650001302108650001702121650001502138650001702153700001402170700001302184700002202197773014402219856007402363852000902437655001202446IND60717480720221119054107.0201111e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071748072DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta05563h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jie10aExploiting Hansen solubility parameters to tune porosity and function in conjugated microporous polymers  ap. 22657-22665.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHere we expand our recently reported Bristol–Xi'an Jiaotong (BXJ) approach using simple salts to fine-tune the porosity of conjugated microporous materials synthesized by various reaction approaches, including Buchwald–Hartwig (BH), Sonogashira–Hagihara, oxidative coupling and Suzuki cross-coupling. The surface area and the porosity of the produced conjugated microporous polyanilines (CMPAs) acquired from the non-salt-added BH coupling are optimized by the addition of inorganic salts. BXJ-salt addition provides a facile route to radically improve the BET surface area from 28 to 901 m² g⁻¹ for PTAPA and from 723 m² g⁻¹ to 1378 m² g⁻¹ for PAPA in a controllable manner. In addition, the surface area shows a gradual decrease with an increase in the ionic radius of salts. We furthermore show high compatibility of this approach in the synthesis of typical CMPs, further increasing the surface area from 886 to 1148 m² g⁻¹, 981 to 1263 m² g⁻¹, and 35 to 215 m² g⁻¹ for CMP-1, PTCT and p-PPF, respectively. More importantly, the BXJ approach also allows the broad PSD of the CMPs to be narrowed to the microporous range only, mimicking COFs and MOFs. With the porosity optimized, CO₂ uptakes are dramatically improved by >300% from 0.75 mmol g⁻¹ to 2.59 mmol g⁻¹ for PTAPA and from 2.41 mmol g⁻¹ to 2.93 mmol g⁻¹ for PAPA. Careful addressing of Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) of solvents and resulting polymers through salt addition has the potential to become an important design tool for the preparation of fully tuneable porous materials. We are currently exploring further methods to tune both structure and function in a wide range of organic porous materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3acarbon dioxide 3apolyaniline 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asolubility 3asurface area1 aQiu, Ting1 aYan, Wei1 aFaul, Charl F.

The reduction of air volume flow rate and local different air velocities in the segment were obtained by applying ΔP–V˙a curve and the maximum frost thickness. The local heat transfer rate was predicted by using the ɛ-NTU method and local average frost thickness. The predicted maximum frost thicknesses showed a deviation of 5.5% from the measured values. Maximum frost thicknesses immediately after each U-bend were thicker than those immediately before each U-bend. The predicted blockage ratios agreed with the measured data within 10%.

This apparently simple question resonates at the core of the biological study of human-induced global change, and we strongly believe that the answer is yes: biological invasions and natural colonisations differ in processes and mechanisms in ways that are crucial for science, management, and policy. Invasion biology has, over time, developed into the broader transdisciplinary field of invasion science. At the heart of invasion science is the realisation that biological invasions are not just a biological phenomenon: the human dimension of invasions is a fundamental component in the social-ecological systems in which invasions need to be understood and managed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological invasion 3aglobal change 3ahumans 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3asocial environment 0aInvasion science 0ainvasion biology 0adefinitions1 aGarcía Díaz, Pablo,1 aCassey, Phillip1 aRichardson, David M.1 aPyšek, Petr,1 aBlackburn, Tim M.0 tNeoBiota.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 31 p.87-98dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.31.91853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245011900160300001600279500002000295520102400315592002801339596002801367650001701395650001101412650001701423650001001440650002301450650001901473650001401492650002101506650001501527650001001542700005601552700006001608700005901668773015501727856007901882852000901961655001201970IND60681335120221122051344.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133512DNAL7 a10.1111/1541-4337.125162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zizhan10aSesquiterpenes in grapes and wines: Occurrence, biosynthesis, functionality, and influence of winemaking processes  ap. 247-281.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrapes are an important global horticultural product, and are mainly used for winemaking. Typically, grapes and wines are rich in various phytochemicals, including phenolics, terpenes, pyrazines, and benzenoids, with different compounds responsible for different nutritional and sensory properties. Among these compounds, sesquiterpenes, a subcategory of the terpenes, are attracting increasing interest as they affect aroma and have potential health benefits. The characteristics of sesquiterpenes in grapes and wines in terms of classification, biosynthesis pathway, and active functions have not been extensively reviewed. This paper summarizes 97 different sesquiterpenes reported in grapes and wines and reviews their biosynthesis pathways and relevant bio‐regulation mechanisms. This review further discusses the functionalities of these sesquiterpenes including their aroma contribution to grapes and wines and potential health benefits, as well as how winemaking processes affect sesquiterpene concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Melbourne 3abiosynthesis 3agrapes 3ahorticulture 3aodors 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytochemicals 3apyrazines 3asesquiterpenoids 3awinemaking 3awines1 aHowell, Kate1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6498-04721 aFang, Zhongxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9902-34261 aZhang, Pangzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9794-22690 tComprehensive reviews in food science and food safety.g2020 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.247-281dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000062x1541-43377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.125163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015400171300001600325520139300341592002801734650002801762650001801790650003001808650002001838650001901858650001501877650001501892650002101907650001401928650002601942650001701968650002601985650002202011650001302033650001402046650002702060650002102087650001502108650002502123653001502148653002002163653001302183653002402196653001702220653003902237700002002276700001602296700001702312700001502329700001502344700001502359700001402374773009102388856008902479852000902568655001202577IND60606380120221119025706.0180725e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060638012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrienza, M.10aUse of solar advanced oxidation processes for wastewater treatment: Follow-up on degradation products, acute toxicity, genotoxicity and estrogenicity  ap. 473-480.  aWastewater tertiary treatment by advanced oxidation processes is thought to produce a treated effluent with lower toxicity than the initial influent. Here we performed tertiary treatment of a secondary effluent collected from a Waste Water Treatment Plant via homogeneous (solar/HSO5⁻/Fe²⁺) and heterogeneous (solar/TiO2) solar advanced oxidation aiming at the assessment of their effectiveness in terms of contaminants’ and toxicity abatement in a plain solar reactor. A total of 53 organic contaminants were qualitatively identified by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry after solid phase extraction. Solar advanced oxidation totally or partially removed the major part of contaminants detected within 4.5 h. Standard toxicity tests were performed using Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Brachionus calyciflorus organisms to evaluate acute and chronic toxicity in the secondary or tertiary effluents, and the EC50% was calculated. Estrogenic and genotoxic tests were carried out in an attempt to obtain an even sharper evaluation of potential hazardous effects due to micropollutants or their degradation by-products in wastewater. Genotoxic effects were not detected in effluent before or after treatment. However, we observed relevant estrogenic activity due to the high sensitivity of the HELN ERα cell line.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachionus calyciflorus 3aDaphnia magna 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aVibrio fischeri 3aacute toxicity 3abyproducts 3acell lines 3achronic toxicity 3aeffluents 3aestrogenic properties 3agenotoxicity 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amutagens 3aoxidation 3asolid phase extraction 3atoxicity testing 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aWastewater 0aMicropollutants 0aToxicity 0aEstrogenic activity 0aGenotoxicity 0aSolar advanced oxidation processes1 aMahdi Ahmed, M.1 aEscande, A.1 aPlantard, G.1 aScrano, L.1 aChiron, S.1 aBufo, S.A.1 aGoetz, V.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Apr., v. 148 p.473-480dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245018400188300001800372500001500390520186900405592002802274650002202302650002202324650001402346650002602360650001402386650001902400650001302419650001102432650002202443650001502465650002002480650002102500650001602521650001202537650001902549650002602568650001402594650002402608650002902632650002502661651001102686653001202697700002202709700002402731700002802755700001602783773010802799856008102907852000902988655001202997IND50071142420221118154734.0140904e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007114242DNAL7 a242879462pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-013-0367-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVäisänen, Maria10aPhenolic Responses of Mountain Crowberry (Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum) to Global Climate Change are Compound Specific and Depend on Grazing by Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus)  ap. 1390-1399.  a2019-12-06  aMountain crowberry (Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum) is a keystone species in northern ecosystems and exerts important ecosystem-level effects through high concentrations of phenolic metabolites. It has not been investigated how crowberry phenolics will respond to global climate change. In the tundra, grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) affects vegetation and soil nutrient availability, but almost nothing is known about the interactions between grazing and global climate change on plant phenolics. We performed a factorial warming and fertilization experiment in a tundra ecosystem under light grazing and heavy grazing and analyzed individual foliar phenolics and crowberry abundance. Crowberry was more abundant under light grazing than heavy grazing. Although phenolic concentrations did not differ between grazing intensities, responses of crowberry abundance and phenolic concentrations to warming varied significantly depending on grazing intensity. Under light grazing, warming increased crowberry abundance and the concentration of stilbenes, but decreased e.g., the concentrations of flavonols, condensed tannins, and batatasin-III, resulting in no change in total phenolics. Under heavy grazing, warming did not affect crowberry abundance, and induced a weak but consistent decrease among the different phenolic compound groups, resulting in a net decrease in total phenolics. Our results show that the different phenolic compound groups may show varying or even opposing responses to warming in the tundra at different levels of grazing intensity. Even when plant phenolic concentrations do not directly respond to grazing, grazers may have a key control over plant responses to changes in the abiotic environment, reflecting multiple adaptive purposes of plant phenolics and complex interactions between the biotic and the abiotic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproanthocyanidins 3aRangifer tarandus 3astilbenes 3anutrient availability 3aflavonols 3aclimate change 3areindeer 3atundra 3agrazing intensity 3aecosystems 3aEmpetrum nigrum 3akeystone species 3ametabolites 2aAnimals 2aClimate Change 2aEricaceaexmetabolism 2aHerbivory 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aReindeerxphysiology 0aNorway 0agrazing1 aMartz, Françoise1 aKaarlejärvi, Elina1 aJulkunen-Tiitto, Riitta1 aStark, Sari0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2013 Dec., v. 39, no. 11-12 p.1390-1399dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-013-0367-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245018500167300001600352520131500368592002801683650001501711650001201726650001201738650001301750650002101763650001501784650001701799650001601816650001401832650001901846650001901865650002201884650001901906650001901925650001601944653001201960653001301972653003001985653001902015653002602034700001302060700001802073700001402091700001802105700001902123700001502142773012402157856008302281852000902364655001202373IND60726840620221120044256.0211114e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072684062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Xiaofeng10aMagnetically recyclable and remarkably efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic hexavalent chromium removal based on plasmonic biochar/bismuth/ferroferric oxide heterojunction  ap. 424-435.  aThe development of easily recyclable non-noble metal plasmonic photocatalysts with high performance is highly desired for the removal of Cr(VI). Herein, the in-situ growth of plasmonic-bismuth (Bi) combined with magnetic ferroferric (Fe₃O₄) nanoparticles on biochar (BC) was realized by a facile high temperature calcination. BC/Bi/Fe₃O₄ exhibits broad photoabsorption from 200 to 2000 nm. The weaker photoluminescence (PL) spectrum or stronger photocurrent density confirmed its higher separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers than that of BC or Bi/Fe₃O₄. Under visible light irradiation, BC/Bi/Fe₃O₄ exhibits excellent adsorption-photocatalytic performance for Cr(VI) (95%) in 180 min. With BC/Bi/Fe₃O₄ as a working electrode, the higher removal efficiency (97%) was achieved than that using BC/Bi (65%), BC/Fe₃O₄ (79%) or Bi/Fe₃O₄ (66%) after 160 min under visible light irradiation, rooting from wide spectral absorption and efficient separation of photogenerated carriers. BC/Bi/Fe₃O₄ can be easily recycled by magnetism with good stability. This work not only provides ideas for the preparation of surface plasma resonance (SPR) semiconductor photocatalyst for removing heavy metal, but also realizes the resource utilization of agricultural and forestry waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiochar 3abismuth 3achromium 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3aheavy metals 3airradiation 3amagnetism 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3aplant residues 3asemiconductors 3atemperature 0aBiochar 0aBi/Fe3O4 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aPhotocatalysis 0aPhotoelectrocatalysis1 aYang, Ye1 aSong, Bingtao1 aChen, Fan1 aXue, Qingquan1 aShan, Shengdao1 aLi, Shijie0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 May 15, v. 590 p.424-435dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002900142245008900171300001600260500000900276520127400285592002801559650003101587650001801618650001101636650001001647650002701657650001601684650001901700650001301719650001501732650002101747650001301768650000901781650001701790650001801807651001601825651002301841700001901864773019201883856007702075852000902152655001202161IND60666436720221122222718.0191028e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643672DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2005.00612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangiafico, Salvatore S.10aFall Fertilization Timing Effects on Nitrate Leaching and Turfgrass Color and Growth  ap. 163-171.  aepub  aFall season fertilization is a widely recommended practice for turfgrass. Fertilizer applied in the fall, however, may be subject to substantial leaching losses. A field study was conducted in Connecticut to determine the timing effects of fall fertilization on nitrate N (NO₃−N) leaching, turf color, shoot density, and root mass of a 90% Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), 10% creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) lawn. Treatments consisted of the date of fall fertilization: 15 September, 15 October, 15 November, 15 December, or control which received no fall fertilizer. Percolate water was collected weekly with soil monolith lysimeters. Mean log₁₀ NO₃−N concentrations in percolate were higher for fall fertilized treatments than for the control. Mean NO₃−N mass collected in percolate water was linearly related to the date of fertilizer application, with higher NO₃−N loss for later application dates. Applying fall fertilizer improved turf color and density but there were no differences in color or density among applications made between 15 October and 15 December. These findings suggest that the current recommendation of applying N in mid- to late November in southern New England may not be compatible with water quality goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca rubra subsp. rubra 3aPoa pratensis 3aautumn 3acolor 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3alawns and turf 3aleaching 3alysimeters 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3asoil 3aturf grasses 3awater quality 3aConnecticut 3aNew England region1 aGuillard, Karl0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2006 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.163-171dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2005.00613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007400167300001600241500001900257520135600276536009201632592002801724650002301752650001201775650001101787650001501798651001001813653003001823653002301853653002801876653002801904653002701932700001601959773013201975856008502107852000902192655001202201IND60708445220221118083102.0200826e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844522DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2020.17987682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Fugui10aResearch on Coupling Mechanism of China’s Wind Power Industry Chain  ap. 770-782.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFirstly, on the basis of literature research, sort out and summarize the critical coupling relationship among the upstream, middle, and downstream enterprises in the wind power industry chain.

The optimal condition was determined to be pH = 6, O₃ dosage = 60 mg/g VS and MnFe₂O₄@SBC dosage = 600 mg/g VS, under which the capillary suction time (CST) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of WAS declined from 98.3 ± 1.0 s and 1.1 ± 0.03 × 10¹⁴ m/kg to 18.3 ± 0.8 s and 0.32 ± 0.03 × 10¹⁴ m/kg, respectively. The water content (Wc wt.%) of sludge cake declined from 87.1 ± 0.98% to 68.1 ± 0.87%. The mechanism for enhanced dewatering performance of WAS by MnFe₂O₄@SBC was systematically clarified. Firstly, the circulation of valence states for Fe and Mn on the surface of MnFe₂O₄@SBC was found promoting the conversion of O₃ into highly active free radicals and the generation of hydroxyl radicals (·OH). Secondly, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation firstly manifested that O₃ molecules were easier to be activated and dissociated into ·OH groups on the surface of MnFe₂O₄ phase. With the above promotion of ·OH generation, the inner part of sludge flocs especially the protein in extra-cellular polymers (ECPS) was destructed strongly, with significant release of bound water and the decrease in water bound energy. The organic biopolymers with negative charges were diminished followed by the increased zeta potential and enlarged particle size, resulting in the enhanced dewatering performance of WAS. This study illustrated the rationality and validity of the new strategy for enhanced sludge dewatering in both practice and theory, shedding light on the further development of sludge dewatering technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiochar 3abiopolymers 3abound water 3adensity functional theory 3adewatering 3aenergy 3afiltration 3aozonation 3apH 3aparticle size 3azeta potential 0aSludge derived biochar 0aMnFe2O4 0aSludge dewatering 0aCatalytic ozonation1 aDai, Xiaohu1 aWang, Xiankai1 aChen, Sisi1 aDong, Bin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 323 p.129182-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015300156300001600309500001500325520203900340592002802379650001602407650001802423650000902441650001302450650002202463650001102485650001502496650001502511650001802526650001602544650001402560650001902574650001302593650001202606650001202618650001002630650002502640653002302665700002802688700001602716700002402732700002302756700001902779773012702798856007402925852000902999655001203008IND60628773720221120112136.0190131e20190129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062877372DNAL7 a10.1039/c8bm01050a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavaei, Ali14aThe influence of electrically conductive and non-conductive nanocomposite scaffolds on the maturation and excitability of engineered cardiac tissues  ap. 585-595.  a2019-12-06  aUtilization of electrically conductive nanomaterials for developing nanocomposite scaffolds has been at the center of attention for engineering functional cardiac tissues. The primary motive in the use of conductive nanomaterials has been to develop biomimetic scaffolds to recapitulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the native heart and to promote cardiac tissue maturity, excitability and electrical signal propagation. Alternatively, it is well accepted that the inclusion of nanomaterials also alters the stiffness and nano-scale topography of the scaffolds. However, what is missing in the literature is that to what extent the sole presence of nanomaterials within a scaffold, regardless of their conductivity, influences the maturation and excitability of engineered cardiac tissues. To address this knowledge gap, we developed four different classes of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels, with varied concentrations, embedded electrically conductive gold nanorods (GNRs) and non-conductive silica nanomaterials (SNPs), to assess the influence of matrix stiffness and the presence of nanomaterials on cardiac cell adhesion, protein expression (i.e. maturation), and tissue-level excitability. Our results demonstrated that either embedding nanomaterials (i.e. GNRs and SNPs) or increasing the matrix stiffness significantly promoted cellular retention and the expression of cardiac-specific markers, including sarcomeric α-actinin (SAC), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and connexin43 (Cx43) gap junctions. Notably, excitation voltage thresholds at a high frequency (i.e. 2 Hz and higher), in both coupled and uncoupled gap junctions induced by heptanol, were lower for scaffolds embedded conductive GNRs or non-conductive SNPs, independent of matrix stiffness. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the sole presence of nanomaterials within the scaffolding matrix had a more pronounced influence as compared to the scaffold stiffness on the cell–cell coupling, maturation and excitability of engineered cardiac tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3acell adhesion 3agold 3ananogold 3aprotein synthesis 3asilica 3atopography 3atroponin I 3agap junctions 3abiomimetics 3ahydrogels 3ananocomposites 3ananorods 3atissues 3agelatin 3aheart 3aextracellular matrix 0aelectric potential1 aRahmani Eliato, Kiarash1 aRos, Robert1 aMigrino, Raymond Q.1 aWillis, Brigham C.1 aNikkhah, Mehdi0 tBiomaterials science.g2019 Jan. 29, v. 7, no. 2 p.585-595dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8bm01050a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009100167300001600258500001900274520158300293536018801876592002802064596001302092596002202105650002802127650001802155650002502173650001102198650002102209650001502230650001602245650002002261650002502281653002602306653004802332653002402380700001702404700001702421700001802438773013202456856008502588852000902673655001202682IND60708445320221118083119.0200826e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844532DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2020.17987692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yongtai10aPCM thermal conductivity effect on mechanism of PV/PCM thermal control characteristics  ap. 783-792.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAccording to the structure of photovoltaic/phase change material (PV/PCM), the mechanism of internal heat transfer, transmission, storage, and temperature control is analyzed, and a two-dimensional finite element analysis model of PV/PCM structure is established. This study is carried out on the effect of PCM thermal conductivity on internal temperature distribution characteristics of PV/PCM and temperature control characteristics of solar cells. The results show that the increase in thermal conductivity of PCM can prolong the temperature control time of solar cell in PV/PCM system, for example, when the thermal conductivity is increased from 0.2 W/(m·K) to1.5 W/(m·K) under a thickness of 4 cm, the duration when PV/PCM solar cell temperature is controlled below 40°C and extended from 52 min to 184 min. In addition, PV/PCM experimental prototypes are designed with the LA-SA-EG composite PCM peak melting point of 46°C and thermal conductivity of 0.8 W/(m·K) and 1.1 W/(m·K), respectively. The results indicate that compared with PCM-free solar cells, the maximum temperature of PV/PCM prototype solar cells with thermal conductivity of 0.8 W/(m·K) and 1.1 W/(m·K) is reduced by 10.8°C and 4.6°C, respectively, with average output power increased by 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, under simulated light sources. Under natural light conditions, the average output power is increased by 6.9% and 4.3%, respectively. The results provide theoretical and experimental basis for the optimization of PV/PCM design by changing the thermal conductivity of PCM.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [51566001] and Application Basic Research Project Foundation of Yunnan Province, China [No. 2019FH001-071].  aPublisher supplied data  a51566001  aNo. 2019FH001-071 3afinite element analysis 3aheat transfer 3ainternal temperature 3amodels 3aphase transition 3aprototypes 3asolar cells 3asolar radiation 3athermal conductivity 0aPhase change material 0aPV/PCM (photovoltaic/phase change material) 0atemperature control1 aXiao, Lixian1 aYang, Yaohua1 aWang, Jingqiu0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 17, no. 12 p.783-792dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2181x1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2020.17987693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245015600210500001900366520181600385592002802201650002302229650005202252650001802304650001602322650002602338650001702364650001602381650001602397650001502413650001202428650001202440651001602452653001302468653001402481653001702495653001602512653002602528653002602554700001702580700006102597700001502658700001602673700001602689773011902705856008802824852000902912655001202921IND60705499820221119101505.0201025e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070549982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Hamesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9435-950510aImplications for air quality management of changes in air quality during lockdown in Auckland (New Zealand) in response to the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 epidemic  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe current changes in vehicle movement due to ‘lockdown’ conditions (imposed in cities worldwide in response to the COVID-19 epidemic) provide opportunities to quantify the local impact of ‘controlled interventions’ on air quality and establish baseline pollution concentrations in cities. Here, we present a case study from Auckland, New Zealand, an isolated Southern Hemisphere city, which is largely unaffected by long-range pollution transport or industrial sources of air pollution. In this city, traffic flows reduced by 60–80% as a result of a government-led initiative to contain the virus by limiting all transport to only essential services. In this paper, ambient pollutant concentrations of NO₂, O₃, BC, PM₂.₅, and PM₁₀ are compared between the lockdown period and comparable periods in the historical air pollution record, while taking into account changes in the local meteorology. We show that this ‘natural experiment’ in source emission reductions had significant but non-linear impacts on air quality. While emission inventories and receptor modelling approaches confirm the dominance of traffic sources for NOₓ (86%), and BC (72%) across the city, observations suggest a consequent reduction in NO₂ of only 34–57% and a reduction in BC of 55–75%. The observed reductions in PM₂.₅ (still likely to be dominated by traffic emissions), and PM₁₀ (dominated by sea salt, traffic emissions to a lesser extent, and affected by seasonality) were found to be significantly less (8–17% for PM₂.₅ and 7–20% for PM₁₀). The impact of this unplanned controlled intervention shows the importance of establishing accurate, local-scale emission inventories, and the potential of the local atmospheric chemistry and meteorology in limiting their accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acase studies 3aenvironment 3ameteorology 3apollutants 3atraffic 3aviruses 3aNew Zealand 0aCovid-19 0aTransport 0aBlack carbon 0aParticulate 0aAtmospheric pollution 0aEmissions inventories1 aTalbot, Nick1 aSalmond, Jennifer1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5670-77241 aDirks, Kim1 aXie, Shanju1 aDavy, Perry0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 746 p.141129-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245010100163300001800264500000900282520158900291592002801880650001301908650001401921650001701935650001901952650001901971650001001990650001902000650001102019650002502030650001702055650001302072650002502085700001402110700002402124773022002148856008002368852000902448655001202457IND60666436920221123004117.0191028e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643692DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2015.01.00582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiulan10aPore-Scale Study of Flow Rate on Colloid Attachment and Remobilization in a Saturated Micromodel  ap. 1376-1383.  aepub  aColloid attachment is an important retention mechanism. It is influenced by colloid size, pore size, and flow rate, among other factors. In this work, we studied colloid attachment experimentally under various flow rates, as well as colloid release in response to a rapid change of flow rate. Colloid transport experiments under saturated conditions and with different flow rates were conducted in a physical micromodel. The micromodel was made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is a hydrophobic polymer. Colloids were hydrophilic fluorescent carboxylate-modified polystyrene latex microspheres with a mean diameter of 300 nm. We could directly observe the movement of colloids within the pores using a confocal microscope. We also obtained concentration breakthrough curves by measuring the fluorescence intensity at the outlet of the micromodel. In addition, our experiments were simulated using a pore-network modeling, PoreFlow, based on the pore structure of the micromodel. Local colloid concentrations were calculated by solving local mass balance equations for all network elements and then averaging resulting concentrations over the whole micromodel. The measured breakthrough curves were successfully simulated using PoreFlow. Observed and calculated breakthrough curves showed that colloid attachment rate was smaller for larger flow rate. Temporally enhance colloid release (remobilization of attached colloids) was observed when the flow rate was increased by a factor of 10. But no colloid remobilization was observed when the flow rate decreased by a factor of 10.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3aequations 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alatex 3amicroparticles 3amodels 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3apolystyrenes 3aporosity 3asaturated conditions1 aRaoof, A.1 aHassanizadeh, S.

Humin (HM) is expected to improve this process because it is a neutral, insoluble, porous and green material as well as an eco-friendly adsorbent extracted from natural peat soil. However, HM has not been studied with respect to the stabilization/solidification (S/S) characteristics of potentially toxic element (PTE)-contaminated soil due to its different extraction sources and methods, as well as complex properties. To study these effects, insoluble HM was extracted for treatment of high-lead contaminated soil by cement-based S/S. The experimental results show that HM has a strong adsorption capacity for lead with a maximum adsorption capacity of 200.2 mg kg⁻¹. The negative influence of a high content of lead on the compressive strength over a 0–90-day period is weakened after adding HM to the soil, wherein a competitive mechanism between HM and a high concentration of lead is proposed. The lead leaching concentration of stabilized soil is significantly decreased under different leaching methods from 0 to 60 days and then decreases slowly. The lead speciation results for the stabilized soil determined through the Tessier sequential extraction method show that HM promotes the gradual chemical transformation of lead from exchangeable and carbonate-bound fractions to a more stable state, with respective decreases of 27.5% and 15.1%. In addition, SEM-EDS images show that HM with a high porosity and specific surface area coexists well with cement, which promotes the stabilization of lead. In conclusion, HM contributes to decreasing the mobility and bioavailability of lead and achieving environmental remediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abioavailability 3acement 3acompression strength 3ahumin 3alead 3apeat soils 3apolluted soils 3aporosity 3aremediation 3asoil stabilization 3asolidification 3asurface area 3atoxicity 0aGreen material 0aCement-based S/S 0aCompressive strength 0aLeaching 0aLead speciation 0aS/S 0aPTE 0aOM 0aHA 0aFA 0aHM 0aFTIR 0aUCS 0aTCLP 0aSPLP 0aHVLP 0aSEM-EDS1 aJiang, Wenhao1 aZheng, Lingwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0559-73391 aXie, Xinyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8582-08571 aPan, Yize0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 324 p.129184-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011600166300001600282520161200298592002801910650000801938650002701946650001201973650001701985650002802002650001402030650001902044650002002063650003102083650002402114650001002138650004202148650002202190650001302212650004302225650005202268650001802320650001402338650002002352650002002372650001102392650002602403650001802429653001502447653001902462653001202481653001202493700001902505700001502524700001702539700002002556773011002576856008602686852000902772655001202781IND60543157320221122050535.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054315732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.08.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huhu10aInsights into the transcriptome profile of mature biofilm of Salmonella Typhimurium on stainless steels surface  ap. 378-384.  aSalmonella is a worldwide food-borne pathogen, with many serotypes able to form biofilms under food processing environments; in particular the Typhimurium and Enteritidis serotypes.

Typhimurium biofilm cells were distinct from those of the planktonic counterparts, and 1515 genes were differentially expressed, with 618 genes over-expressed and 897 genes down-expressed in the biofilm cells. Among these differentially expressed transcripts, genes encoding membrane proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, curli productions, transcriptional regulators, cellulose biosynthesis and stress response proteins may play crucial roles in the maturation of Salmonella biofilm. Also, two significant pathways, carbon fixation and sulfur metabolism, were observed to be upregulated in mature biofilm. The gene expression levels obtained from RNA-seq were successfully validated using RT-qPCR assays with csgD, csrA, mgtC, fimA, marA and soxS genes. In addition, four novel non-coding small RNAs were found to be upregulated in mature biofilm. Our work may serve as a basis for further studies, examining the complex network systems that regulate Salmonella biofilm maturation and maintenance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3abiofilm 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3acellulose 3afood pathogens 3afood processing 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amembrane proteins 3aplankton 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalmonellosis 3aserotypes 3astainless steel 3astress response 3asulfur 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aSalmonella 0aMature biofilm 0aRNA-seq 0aRT-qPCR1 aZhang, Xinxiao1 aDong, Yang1 aXu, Xinglian1 aZhou, Guanghong0 tFood research international.g2015 Nov., v. 77 p.378-384dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010500157300001600262520079100278592002801069650001601097650001301113650002001126650002101146650001901167650002201186650001201208700001901220700001701239700002701256700001701283700002001300773010501320856007501425852000901500655001201509IND60532715120171127000000.0160728e20120312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271512DNAL7 a10.1021/bm201674n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarn, Florent10aStructural Properties of Colloidal Complexes between Condensed Tannins and Polysaccharide Hyaluronan  ap. 751-759.  aInteractions of plant tannins with polysaccharide hyaluronan are studied by means of light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).

The crystal growth process can be easily scaled up for catalysis applications. Bulk and surface compositions have been determined to be CuI using various characterization methods. Although larger tetrahedra show gradually decreasing band gap values, the changes are quite small. Optical facet effect should also be present for CuI by comparing the band gaps of size-tunable CuI tetrahedra to that of commercially available CuI powder. Emission band also becomes red-shifted for larger tetrahedral samples. The 56 nm CuI tetrahedra exhibit a far better catalytic performance than that of commercially available CuI powder toward click reactions of aromatic alkynes and benzyl azide for the formation of triazoles, attributed to their large surface area and exposed {111} faces. The small CuI tetrahedral nanocrystals should be explored for use in other CuI-catalyzed reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aazides 3acatalytic activity 3ageometry 3ananocrystals 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atriazoles 0aClick reaction 0aCopper iodide 0aFacet-dependent properties 0aTetrahedra1 aMadasu, Mahesh1 aWu, Min-Han1 aHsieh, Pei-Lun1 aHuang, Michael H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5648-43450 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 June, v. 591 p.1-8dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245016900165300001600334500001100350520151900361592002801880650001301908650001601921650003501937650002401972650002901996650001802025650003002043650001102073650002202084650001302106650001402119650001602133700002102149700006902170773013102239856007802370852000902448655001202457IND60681336020221122030054.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133602DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2019008572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaslavska, Jitka10aHigh‐resolution capillary zone electrophoresis and mass spectrometry for distinction of undersialylated and hypoglycosylated transferrin glycoforms in body fluids  ap. 241-257.  aREVIEW  aHigh‐resolution capillary zone electrophoresis is used to distinguish transferrin glycoforms present in human serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum treated with neuraminidase and N‐glycosidase F. The obtained data are compared to mass spectrometry data from the literature. The main focus is on the analysis of the various asialo‐transferrin, monosialo‐transferrin, and disialo‐transferrin molecules found in these samples. The features of capillary zone electrophoresis and mass spectrometry are reviewed and highlighted in the context of the analysis of undersialylated and hypoglycosylated transferrin molecules. High‐resolution capillary zone electrophoresis represents an effective tool to assess the diversity of transferrin patterns whereas mass spectrometry is the method of choice to elucidate structural identification about the glycoforms. Hypoglycosylated transferrin glycoforms present in sera of alcohol abusers and normal subjects are structurally identical to those in sera of patients with a congenital disorder of glycosylation type I. Asialo‐transferrin, monosialo‐transferrin and disialo‐transferrin observed in sera of patients with a type II congenital disorder of glycosylation or a hemolytic uremic syndrome, in cerebrospinal fluid and after treatment of serum with neuraminidase are undersialylated transferrin glycoforms with two N‐glycans of varying structure. Undersialylated disialo‐transferrin is also observed in sera with high levels of trisialo‐transferrin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3ablood serum 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3acerebrospinal fluid 3acongenital abnormalities 3aglycosylation 3ahemolytic uremic syndrome 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3asialidase 3atransferrin1 aSchild, Christof1 aThormann, W.q(Wolfgang),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9762-16090 tJournal of separation science.g2020 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.241-257dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3924049x1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2019008573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245008000167300001600247500000900263520165200272592002801924650003401952650003601986650001502022650001402037650001202051650001302063650001302076650001102089650002002100650000902120650000902129650001402138650001502152650001902167650000902186700002002195700001602215700001802231700001702249773019202266856007702458852000902535655001202544IND60666437220221123021347.0191028e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643722DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2004.02592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHettiarachchi, G.

Spatial correlations derived from elemental mapping of XRF images showed strong correlations between Fe and Cd, Cr, Pb, or Zn (r ² = 0.65–0.92) before and after removal of most of the OC. The strong correlation between Fe and Cu that was present in intact samples disappeared after OC removal, suggesting that Cu was associated with OC coatings that may have been present on Fe compounds. Except for Fe and Cr, the spatial correlations of metals with Mn were improved after treatment to remove OC, indicating that the treatment may have altered more than the OC in the system. The Fe μ-XANES spectra of the intact biosolids sample showed that every point had varying mixtures of Fe(II and III) species and no two points were identical. The lack of uniformity in Fe species in the biosolids sample illustrates the complexity of the materials and the difficulty of studying biosolids using conventional analytical tools or chemical extraction techniques. Still, these microscopic observations provide independent information supporting the previous laboratory and field hypothesis that Fe compounds play a major role in retention of environmentally important trace elements in biosolids. This could be due to co-precipitation of the metals with Fe, adsorption of metals by Fe compounds, or a combination of both mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abiosolids 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoatings 3acopper 3acoprecipitation 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amicroscopy 3aorganic carbon 3azinc1 aScheckel, K.

Electrocatalytic reactor system in improving water quality is a useful way to induce convection to enhance diffusion. This study focuses on the preparation and the characterization of Ti/SnO2–Sb tubular porous electrode for degrading pyridine wastewater. The electrode as an anode in reactor system is prepared by coating SnO2–Sb as an electro-catalyst via Pechini method on the tubular porous Ti. Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectrum, X-ray Diffraction and Pore Distribution are employed to evaluate the structure and morphology of the electrodes coatings, and Linear Sweep Voltammetry and Cyclic Voltammetry are used to illustrate the electrochemical properties of the electrodes coatings. Furthermore, the electrochemical oxidation performance of Ti/SnO2–Sb tubular porous electrode is characterized by degrading pyridine wastewater. The effects of flow and static pattern, initial pyridine concentration, supporting electrolyte concentration, current density and pH on the performance of the reactor were investigated in the electrocatalytic reactor system. The results indicated that the removal ratio of pyridine reaches maximum which is 98% under the optimal operation conditions, that are 100 mg L⁻¹ initial pyridine concentration, 10 g L⁻¹ supporting electrolyte concentration, 30 mA cm⁻² current density and pH 3. Transition state calculation based on the density function theory was combined with High Performance Liquid Chromatography, Gas Chromatography and Ionic Chromatography results to describe the pathway of pyridine degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanodes 3acoatings 3aconvection 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aoxidation 3apH 3apyridines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awastewater 3awater purification 3awater quality 0aThe induced convection 0aElectrocatalytic reactor system 0aTi/SnO2–Sb tubular porous electrode 0aPyridine 0aTransition state calculation1 aTang, Jingyan1 aZhou, Xiezhen1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aSun, Xiuyun1 aShen, Jinyou1 aWang, Lianjun1 aHan, Weiqing0 tChemosphere.g2016 Apr., v. 149 p.49-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245009800165500001900263520147300282592002801755650001501783650001601798650001201814650001101826650001201837650000901849650001501858650001601873650002501889650001701914650001001931650001101941650000901952650003301961650002401994650000902018650001202027650002202039653001302061653000902074653000902083653001902092700001802111700001202129700001702141700001802158773011902176856008802295852000902383655001202392IND60705500220221117023033.0201025e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070550022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan10aApplication of APCA-MLR receptor model for source apportionment of char and soot in sediments  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBlack carbon (char and soot) has attracted increasing attention due to its important role in the global carbon cycle, adsorption of pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals), climate effects and threats to human health. However, few studies have included source analysis of black carbon (char and soot). In this study, the levels of char, soot and PAHs in sediments of West Taihu Lake were assessed, and an absolute principal component analysis followed by multiple linear regression (APCA-MLR) receptor model was used to successfully analyze the material sources of char and soot, providing a new perspective and method for exploring the sources of char and soot. The contributions of coal combustion sources to char and soot are 62.0% and 43.2%, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of biomass combustion sources (13.7% and 19.8%). The contributions of oil combustion sources to char and soot are 24.3% and 37.0%, respectively. The contributions of coal, oil and biomass combustion to char and soot have similar spatial distributions: the coal combustion sources and biomass combustion sources are mainly affected by urban development, which is largely distributed in the northwest of the study area, whereas the oil combustion sources are mainly affected by automobile traffic and lake ports, which are mainly distributed in the west of the study area, and these effects decrease with an increase in offshore distance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aautomobiles 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenvironment 3aglobal carbon budget 3ahuman health 3alakes 3amodels 3aoils 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asoot 3atraffic 3aurban development 0aSediment 0aChar 0aPAHs 0aReceptor model1 aZhou, Shenglu1 aLiu, Ke1 aWang, Genmei1 aWang, Junxiao0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 746 p.141165-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1411653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012300155300001600278520133400294592002801628650002101656650001401677650001401691650001301705650001201718650001301730700002001743700002001763700001901783700002201802773010501824856007501929852000902004655001202013IND60532715220171127000000.0160728e20120312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271522DNAL7 a10.1021/bm201676q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArola, Suvi10aImmobilization–Stabilization of Proteins on Nanofibrillated Cellulose Derivatives and Their Bioactive Film Formation  ap. 594-603.  aIn a number of different applications for enzymes and specific binding proteins a key technology is the immobilization of these proteins to different types of supports. In this work we describe a concept for protein immobilization that is based on nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC). NFC is a form of cellulose where fibers have been disintegrated into fibrils that are only a few nanometers in diameter and have a very large aspect ratio. Proteins were conjugated through three different strategies using amine, epoxy, and carboxylic acid functionalized NFC. The conjugation chemistries were chosen according to the reactive groups on the NFC derivatives; epoxy amination, heterobifunctional modification of amino groups, and EDC/s-NHS activation of carboxylic acid groups. The conjugation reactions were performed in solution and immobilization was performed by spin coating the protein–NCF conjugates. The structure of NFC was shown to be advantageous for both protein performance and stability. The use of NFC allows all covalent chemistry to be performed in solution, while the immobilization is achieved by a simple spin coating or spreading of the protein–NFC conjugates on a support. This allows more scalable methods and better control of conditions compared to the traditional methods that depend on surface reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3acellulose 3achemistry 3acoatings 3aenzymes 3aepoxides1 aTammelin, Tekla1 aSetälä, Harri1 aTullila, Antti1 aLinder, Markus B.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Mar. 12, v. 13, no. 3 p.594-603dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm201676q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245006700165300001800232500000900250520136200259592002801621650001501649650001501664650001201679650002001691650001201711650001501723650003301738650001501771650001501786650002501801650002301826650001101849650001201860650001801872650002301890650001001913650002101923700001801944700001801962700001801980773022001998856008002218852000902298655001202307IND60666437520221123032756.0191028e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643752DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2013.04.01382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, C. F.10aSorption/Desorption of Lincomycin from Three Arid-Region Soils  ap. 1460-1465.  aepub  aThe antibiotic lincomycin is commonly found in treated municipal waste water and in waste from swine and poultry production. Environmental disposal of these wastes has the potential to introduce a significant mass of lincomycin into the ecosystem. In the present study, a series of sorption and desorption experiments were conducted to determine the potential mobility of lincomycin in soils from arid environments. Sorption and desorption isotherms were obtained for lincomycin using three different soils. Isotherms were fit to the Freundlich equation. Adsorption of lincomycin was found to have a Kf of 11.98 for a biosolid-treated soil (1.58% OC) and a Kf of 210.15 for a similar unamended soil (1.42% OC). It was also found that for a low-organic-content soil the Kf was 5.09. The differences in adsorption can be related to the soil pH and the pKa of lincomycin (7.5–7.8). When the soil solution pH is below the pKa, the cationic species of lincomycin dominates, resulting in increased water solubility. Interaction with the cation exchange complex is minimal due to a high solution cation concentration (Ca²⁺ and Na⁺). Desorption isotherms also indicate that when the solution pH is lower than the pKa, retention of lincomycin is reduced. Our results indicate that the mobility of lincomycin in these arid region soils is dependent on soil pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarid zones 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acations 3adesorption 3adry environmental conditions 3aecosystems 3alincomycin 3amunicipal wastewater 3apoultry production 3asodium 3asoil pH 3asoil solution 3asorption isotherms 3aswine 3awater solubility1 aWatson, J.

P.q(Colin P.),10aUnconfined alluvial flow processes: Recognition and interpretation of their deposits, and the significance for palaeogeographic reconstruction  ap. 199-223.  aPalaeogeographic interpretation of the sedimentary rock record depends on correct recognition from the preserved evidence of the processes responsible for transporting and depositing the sediment. This in turn depends on robust knowledge transfer from previous workers, and the successful exchange of ideas between workers requires consistent use of a well-defined vocabulary. We have identified serious breakdowns in all these interpretation steps in the case of terrestrial unconfined flow and its deposits, and these failures are leading to unreliable environmental and climatic interpretation. This is significant because such alluvial deposits commonly form a majority of the rock record of continental environments. Working from the basic principles of geomorphology and fluid dynamics, we have undertaken a wide-ranging analysis of the nature of out-of-channel flow and from this make predictions about the characteristics of its deposits. We identify the range of possible locations and conditions that lead to the development of unconfined flow, review the processes operating in each case, and examine the range of lithological features that can be produced by these processes. This allows us to evaluate the reliability of the criteria claimed for identification of out-of-channel flow deposits, and examine how our new insights might alter palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic reconstructions published previously by others. The sedimentary record of unconfined flows is much more diverse and complex than usually portrayed. The received wisdom that the record of unconfined flow consists solely of upwards-fining thin beds produced from shallow waning flows is shown to be flawed. A wide range of lithofacies are possible, and the variation in both flow steadiness and uniformity needs to be taken into account. The previously published criteria for recognition of flows of this type are not diagnostic of process or location; unconfined flow deposits cannot reliably be identified from grain size or bed thickness. Similar lithofacies may develop in a wide range of geomorphic and climatic settings because the deposits solely reflect the local flow conditions and sediment availability. We recommend that the terms ‘sandflat’ and ‘sheetflood’ should not be used in sedimentological accounts because there is no longer a safe informal usage for either; contradictory application of these terms, and lack of robust definitions, is leading to significant misunderstanding of palaeogeography and process. Our analysis should improve reconstruction of past terrestrial environments because it reveals more clearly the true variety of possibilities for the occurrence of unconfined flow and the resultant deposits. Enhanced understanding of the inherent uncertainties, and realisation of the wider range of plausible alternative explanations, should help resolve apparent contradictions with independent indicators of climate or geographic position.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvium 3aclimate 3afluid mechanics 3ageomorphology 3aprediction1 aDavidson, Stephanie K.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2012 Feb., v. 111, no. 1-2 p.199-223dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245011100179300002000290520161300310592002801923650001101951650002501962650001701987650001602004650001302020650001902033650001502052650001002067650001602077650001902093650003602112650001702148650002202165650001802187650001002205650002002215650002002235650001702255650002102272650001402293650001902307650002202326650002402348650001302372650002502385650003602410650003202446773015502478856008302633852000902716655001202725IND60788433320221118162122.0220813e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078843332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19688-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbarakati, Alaa Jameel A.10aProtocatechuic acid counteracts oxidative stress and inflammation in carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice  ap. 56393-56402.  aProtocatechuic acid (PCA), a phenolic compound found in teas, fruits, and vegetables, is widely recognized with its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we verified the protective role of PCA on carrageenan (CGN)-induced paw edema in mice. Forty-five male Swiss albino mice were assigned into five groups: control group, CGN-injected group (1% w/v), PCA (25 mg/kg) + CGN group. PCA (50 mg/kg) + CGN group and diclofenac sodium (20 mg/kg) + CGN group. PCA and diclofenac sodium were administered orally for 5 consecutive days prior to the CGN injection. PCA pretreatment notably decreased the volume of the developed edema and alleviated the histopathological alterations induced by carrageenan. Additionally, PCA administration enhanced the cellular antioxidant capacity as demonstrated by the increased levels of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and reduced glutathione, in addition to the decreased malondialdehyde level in the edematous tissue. Interestingly, PCA administration was able significantly to suppress the developed inflammatory response upon carrageenan injection as indicated by the decreased levels and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase-II, prostaglandin E2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, myeloperoxidase and nuclear factor kappa B. These results collectively confirm the protective effect of PCA against carrageenan-induced paw edema owing to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbino 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarrageenan 3acatalase 3achemokine CCL2 3adiclofenac 3aedema 3aglutathione 3ahistopathology 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amyeloperoxidase 3anitric oxide 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aprostaglandins 3aprotective effect 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aresearch 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.56393-56402dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19688-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01582naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245012700156300001800283520040900301592002800710650002300738650002200761650001200783650000900795650001400804650001300818650001700831650002200848700001300870700002000883700001900903700002200922700002200944700002000966773012800986856007301114852000901187655001201196IND60658206920221123024326.0190816e20080401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065820692DNAL7 a10.1039/b718456e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yue-Ling10aPressure effects and Mössbauer spectroscopic studies on a 3D mixed-valence iron spin-crossover complex with NiAs topology  ap. 1753-1755.  aA three-dimensional mixed-valence iron complex with NiAs-type topology, [(Feᴵᴵᴵ₃O)Feᴵᴵ(TA)₆(H₂O)₃]·(ClO₄)₂(NO₃)(EtOH)(H₂O)₂ (1, HTA = tetrazole-1H-acetic acid), shows spin-crossover behavior that was characterized via variable-temperature crystal structures, Mössbauer spectra and magnetic susceptibilities, the pressure effects on the transition behavior were also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acrystal structure 3aethanol 3airon 3amagnetism 3anitrates 3aperchlorates 3aspectral analysis1 aTao, Jun1 aHuang, Rong-Bin1 aZheng, Lan-Sun1 aZheng, Shao-Liang1 aOshida, Kazuyoshi1 aEinaga, Yasuaki0 tChemical communications.g2008 Apr. 1, , no. 15 p.1753-1755dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b718456e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245009600181300001600277500000900293520113200302592002801434650001601462650001101478650000901489700002101498773014801519856009601667852000901763655001201772IND60668499920221120024626.0191125e197107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066849992DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500040048x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCate, Robert B.12aA Simple Statistical Procedure for Partitioning Soil Test Correlation Data Into Two Classes  ap. 658-660.  aepub  aMost soil test laboratories divide soil test results into two or more classes for the purpose of making fertilizer recommendations. This is usually done for the practical reason that it reduces the number of different recommendations necessary. However, the basis for defining the different classes (e.g., Very Low, Low, Medium, etc.) is often subjective or arbitrary. This paper explains a simple, yet statistically sound, method for setting the class limits. The procedure is to split the data into two groups, using successive tentative critical levels to ascertain that particular critical level which will maximize overall predictive ability (R²), with the means of the two groups (classes) as the predictor values. The paper presents an actual example, using data believed typical of this kind of problem. Several continuous correlation models were also fitted to the same data. None gave as high an R² as a single Low-High split defined by the suggested procedure. Similar results have been obtained with a majority of 200 sets of soil test correlation data, indicating that the new procedure may be widely applicable.  aPublisher supplied data 3afertilizers 3amodels 3asoil1 aNelson, Larry A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1971 July, v. 35, no. 4 p.658-660dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500040048x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001600169245009700185300001600282500002000298520150100318592002801819650001701847650002201864650001201886650001001898650001801908650001601926650001101942650002301953650002501976650001902001650002202020651001902042700002102061773009602082856010702178852000902285655001202294IND60569956320221118134435.0170626e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056995632DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0162:MAOCSI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWorm, Boris10aMeta‐analysis of cod–shrimp interactions reveals top‐down control in oceanic food webs  ap. 162-173.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHere we present a meta‐analytic approach to analyzing population interactions across the North Atlantic Ocean. We assembled all available biomass time series for a well‐documented predator–prey couple, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), to test whether the temporal dynamics of these populations are consistent with the “top‐down” or the “bottom‐up” hypothesis. Eight out of nine regions showed inverse correlations of cod and shrimp biomass supporting the “top‐down” view. Exceptions occurred only close to the southern range limits of both species. Random‐effects meta‐analysis showed that shrimp biomass was strongly negatively related to cod biomass, but not to ocean temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, cod biomass was positively related to ocean temperature. The strength of the cod–shrimp relationship, however, declined with increasing mean temperature. These results show that changes in predator populations can have strong effects on prey populations in oceanic food webs, and that the strength of these interactions may be sensitive to changes in mean ocean temperature. This means that the effects of overfishing in the ocean cascade down to lower trophic levels, as has been shown previously for lakes and coastal seas. In order to further investigate these processes, we establish a methodological framework to analyze species interactions from time series data. Corresponding Editor: O. J.

We integrated results from two global empirical syntheses into a simple temperature‐dependent respiration framework to compare the measured effects of respiration acclimation‐over‐time and variation‐across‐space to one another, and to a null model in which acclimation is ignored. Using these models, we projected the influence of thermal acclimation on: seasonal variation in R; spatial variation in mean annual R across a global temperature gradient; and future increases in R under climate change. The measured strength of acclimation‐over‐time produces differences in annual R across spatial temperature gradients that agree well with global variation‐across‐space. Our models further project that acclimation effects could potentially halve increases in R (compared with the null model) as the climate warms over the 21st Century. Convergence in global temperature‐dependent patterns of R indicates that physiological adjustments arising from thermal acclimation are capable of explaining observed variation in leaf respiration at ambient growth temperatures across the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacclimation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aleaves 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3asynthesis 3atemperature profiles1 aSlot, Martijn1 aLichstein, Jeremy W.1 aReich, Peter B.1 aKattge, Jens1 aAtkin, Owen K.1 aBloomfield, Keith J.1 aTjoelker, Mark G.1 aKitajima, Kaoru0 tnew phytologist.g2015 Sept., v. 207, no. 4 p.1026-1037dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.134173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245011400180300001400294520164600308592002801954650002701982650004102009650001802050650003902068650002502107650001802132650002702150650000902177650003202186650001602218650001302234650001402247650002202261650001202283653002202295653001502317653002202332653000902354653000902363653000802372653000902380700002302389700001702412700001902429700005402448773013602502856008502638852000902723655001202732IND60535155720221119141348.0190318e20151115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Trujillo, M.A.10aSynergistic effects in the antiviral activity of the three Mx proteins from gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata)  ap. 83-90.  aDue to their direct antiviral activity, Mx proteins play a main role in the response mediated by type I interferon against viral infections. The study on gilthead seabream Mx proteins is especially interesting, since this species is unusually resistant to viral diseases, being asymptomatic carrier of several viruses pathogenic to other fish species. Gilthead seabream has three Mx proteins (Mx1, Mx2 and Mx3) that, separately, display antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses, showing interesting differences in their antiviral specificities. In this work, the possible synergy between the three Mx isoforms has been studied using in vitro systems consisting of CHSE-214 cells stably expressing two or the three gilthead seabream Mx proteins. The antiviral activity of these Mx combinations has been tested against the Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus (IPNV), the Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia Virus (VHSV), the European Sheatfish Virus (ESV) and the Lymphocystis Disease Virus (LCDV). A synergistic effect of the Mx proteins was only detected against ESV, no synergy was observed against LCDV, and a negative interference was detected against the two RNA viruses tested, IPNV and VHSV, as viral replication was higher in cells expressing certain Mx combinations than in cells expressing these proteins separately. These results suggest a functional interaction between gilthead seabream Mx isoforms, which results in a higher or lower antiviral activity depending on the virus tested, thus supporting the idea of complex virus-host interactions and finely tuned mechanisms controlling the antiviral activity of Mx proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean catfish virus 3aInfectious pancreatic necrosis virus 3aSparus aurata 3aViral hemorrhagic septicemia virus 3aantiviral properties 3acarrier state 3acrossover interference 3afish 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ainterferons 3aproteins 3asynergism 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0aType I interferon 0aMx protein 0aGilthead seabream 0aIPNV 0aVHSV 0aESV 0aLCDV1 aGarcía-Rosado, E.1 aAlonso, M.C.1 aÁlvarez, M.C.1 aBéjar, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2848-10720 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 168, no. 1-2 p.83-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01560naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009600159300001800255520035400273592002800627650001100655650001500666650002300681650001600704650001200720650001900732650002000751650001900771650001400790650001400804650001300818700002000831700002300851700002400874700002100898700002100919773012800940856007301068852000901141655001201150IND60658207220221123013327.0190816e20080409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065820722DNAL7 a10.1039/b718492a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBříza, Tomáš10aOptical sensing of sulfate by polymethinium salt receptors: colorimetric sensor for heparin  ap. 1901-1903.  aPolymethinium salts based on substituted malondialdehyde have been prepared; the salt 9 with PEG substitution showed high selectivity for sulfate anions and heparin in aqueous medium at physiological condition; intracellular imaging of heparin-rich subcellular compartments was achieved with our polymethinium novel receptor 9 for cancer cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acell lines 3achemical reactions 3acolorimetry 3aheparin 3aimage analysis 3amalondialdehyde 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3areceptors 3asulfates1 aKejík, Zdeněk1 aCísařová, Ivana1 aKrálová, Jarmila,1 aMartásek, Pavel1 aKrál, Vladimír0 tChemical communications.g2008 Apr. 9, , no. 16 p.1901-1903dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b718492a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245008900163300001600252520110400268592002801372653001901400653002101419653003001440653002101470653002701491653002301518700001801541700001601559700001701575700001501592700001801607773010201625856008301727852000901810655001201819IND60677507420221117032824.0191129s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067750742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.4582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadri, S.12aA Comparative Study of Predictive Approaches for Load Forecasting in Smart Buildings  ap. 173-180.  aPredicting electricity consumption represents one of most important information for efficient energy management in smart buildings. It is mainly used for occupancy prediction and the development of optimized control approaches of building’s appliances (e.g., lighting and heating/air conditioning systems). Recently, several approaches have been proposed for load profiling, prediction and forecasting. The work presented in this paper is towards the development of load forecasting approaches for being integrated for occupancy prediction and context-driven control of building’s appliances. We mainly investigated the accuracy of various machine learning and statistical methods for forecasting energy consumption. An IoT and Big Data based platform was deployed for gathering near-real time data about electricity/load consumption. Recorded data were used to deploy predictive models using ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory. Experiments have been conducted and results are reported to shed more light on the accuracy of these methods for load forecasting.  aPublisher supplied data 0asmart building 0aload forecasting 0aIoT/Big data technologies 0amachine learning 0astatistical approaches 0abuilding occupancy1 aNaitmalek, Y.1 aNageeb, M.,1 aBakhouya, M.1 aFakhri, Y.1 aElaroussi, M.0 tProcedia computer science.g2019, v. 160 p.173-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26830x1877-05097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2019.09.4583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015000163300001600313500001500329520149800344592002801842650000901870650001601879650003101895650001301926650002101939650002201960650001601982650002701998650001902025650001302044650001602057650001202073650002102085653001702106700002902123700002202152700002002174700002202194700002202216700003102238700002802269773012002297856007302417852000902490655001202499IND60132269720221118104231.0150505e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013226972DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.124092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSOUSA, RACHEL H.

The rice mutants exhibited metabolic changes such as lower CAT and glycolate oxidase (GO) activities and reduced glyoxylate content; however, APX activity was not altered. CAT inhibition triggered different changes in the expression of CAT, APX and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) isoforms between non‐transformed (NT) and silenced plants. These responses were associated with alterations in APX, GPX and GO activities, suggesting redox homeostasis differences. The glutathione oxidation‐reduction states were modulated differently in mutants, and the ascorbate redox state was greatly affected in both genotypes. The pAPX suffered less oxidative stress and photosystem II (PSII) damage and displayed higher photosynthesis than the NT plants. The improved acclimation exhibited by the pAPX plants was indicated by lower H₂O₂accumulation, which was associated with lower GO activity and glyoxylate content. The suppression of both pAPXs and/or its downstream metabolic and molecular effects may trigger favourable antioxidant and compensatory mechanisms to cope with CAT deficiency. This physiological acclimation may involve signalling by peroxisomal H₂O₂, which minimized the photorespiration.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3aglutathione 3a(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase 3acatalase 3aphotorespiration 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aacclimation 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aphotosystem II 3agenotype 3ahomeostasis 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 0aantioxidants1 aCARVALHO, FABRICIO E.

Based on the optimized fertilizer application amount, we assessed five different amounts of oyster shell powder (0% (control, CK), 0.1% (T1), 0.2% (T2), 0.4% (T3), and 0.8% (T4)) and analyzed the intermittent and dynamic leaching characteristics of nutrients in the soil samples. The results indicated that the loss of nutrients in urea, superphosphate, and potassium chloride (due to leaching) increased linearly with the amount of fertilizer. By adding oyster shell powder, the leaching loss reduced by 23.90–57.25% for ammonium nitrogen, 6.31–10.07% for phosphorus, and 17.08–26.58% for potassium. However, the leaching loss for nitrate nitrogen increased by 2.5–5.8 times. In addition, the application of oyster shell powder to latosol provided acid adjustment and water retention enhancement, which increased the pH value of the soil by 3.77 (from pH 4.15 to 7.92) and reduced water loss by 2.52%. Thus, the application of oyster shell powder can reduce the acidity of the surface soil and retain water and fertilizer to a certain extent.  aPublisher supplied data  a20120301303cSpecial fund for Agro-Scientific Research in the Public Interest of China  a2016A020210052cScience and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China 3aacidity 3aammonium nitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3anitrate nitrogen 3aoyster shells 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3aresearch 3asoil 3asuperphosphate 3aurea 3aChina1 aHuang, Yongxiang1 aLiu, Kexing1 aZheng, Chao0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 37 p.56200-56214dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19911-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245015900161300002000320520148500340592002801825650001501853650001501868650001101883650001201894650001401906650001101920650001901931650001001950650002201960650002101982700002102003700002202024700002402046700002302070700003002093700002502123700002702148700002402175773014402199856007402343852000902417655001202426IND60648089220221119162600.0190626e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064808922DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta09786k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Ingrid F.13aAn Feᴵᴵᴵ dinuclear metallacycle complex as a size-selective adsorbent for nitrogenous compounds and a potentially effective ammonia storage material  ap. 15225-15232.  aAmmonia has a large volume energy density and consequently high potential for application as a fuel and energy reservoir in the future. In this study, the dinuclear Feᴵᴵᴵ metallacycle complex [Fe₂(H₂opba)₂Cl₂(dmso)₂]·2CH₂Cl₂·2dmso (1) with excellent capacity to selectively adsorb ammonia (11.3 mmol g⁻¹) was investigated, demonstrating a strong preference for nitrogenous compounds, especially short-chain amines. The adsorption results suggest that the cavity in the structure of 1 has an essential role in the adsorption mechanism i.e. it is the responsible for size selectivity of 1 during the adsorption process. To better understand the adsorption mechanism of ammonia, 1 was fully characterized before and after adsorption. Thermogravimetric-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and ammonia isotherm experiments revealed that 8 ammonia molecules were physisorbed by the complex cavity (free ammonia) and 4 ammonia molecules were chemisorbed (coordinated ammonia) per dinuclear metallacycle unit. Further characterization also confirmed the proposed adsorption mechanism, corroborating the structural modification of the compound after its interaction with ammonia; in addition, reuse tests showed that despite a small loss of efficiency, the compound was capable of desorbing most of the ammonia and could be used consecutively for at least three cycles. Thus, 1 is a potential ammonia storage material and adsorbent for the removal of ammonia from effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aamines 3aammonia 3aeffluents 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3afuels 3amass spectrometry 3athermogravimetry1 aTeixeira, Ivo F.1 aBarros, Wdeson P.1 aPinheiro, Carlos B.1 aArdisson, José D.1 ado Nascimento, Gustavo M.1 aPradie, Noriberto A.1 aTeixeira, Ana Paula C.1 aStumpf, Humberto O.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 June 25, v. 7, no. 25 p.15225-15232dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta09786k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03363naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005800188245006900246300001800315506007600333520204200409592002802451506003702479650001102516650001302527650003502540650002802575650002202603650001602625650002102641650001602662700006502678700005902743773008502802856008102887852000902968655001202977IND60677507520221207075502.0200110s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067750752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mex.2019.11.0082doi7 aPMC69119062pmcid7 a318719192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanner, Eva M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9241-300210aRepeated holdout validation for weighted quantile sum regression  ap. 2855-2860.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWeighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression is a method commonly used in environmental epidemiology to assess the impact of chemical mixtures in relation to a health outcome of interest. Data are partitioned into a single training and test set to reduce sample-specific chemical weights. However, in typical epidemiology sample sizes, this may produce unstable chemical weights and WQS index estimates, and investigators may resort to training and testing on the same data. To solve this problem, we propose repeated holdout validation whereby data are randomly partitioned 100 times, producing a distribution of validated results. Taking the mean as the final estimate, confidence estimates may also be calculated for inference. Further, this method helps characterize the variability in chemical weights, aiding in the identification of chemicals of concern. This is important since it may direct future research into specific chemicals.Using data from 718 mother-child pairs in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and Child, Asthma and Allergy (SELMA) study, we assessed the association between prenatal exposure to 26 endocrine disrupting chemicals and child Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Results using a single partition were unstable, varying by random seed. The WQS index estimate was significant when all data was used (e.g. no partition) (β = −2.2 CI = −3.43, −0.98), but attenuated and nonsignificant using repeated holdout validation (β = −0.82 CI = −2.11, 0.45). When implementing WQS in epidemiologic studies with limited sample sizes, repeated holdout validation is a viable alternative to using a single, or no partitioning. Repeated holdout can both stabilize results and help characterize the uncertainty in identifying chemicals of concern, while maintaining some of the the rigor of holdout validation.•Repeated holdout validation improves the stability of WQS estimates in finite study samples•Uncertainty in identifying toxic chemicals of concern is acknowledged and characterized  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasthma 3achildren 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aepidemiological studies 3amaternal exposure 3asample size 3atoxic substances 3auncertainty1 aBornehag, Carl-Gustaf1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0417-16861 aGennings, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6058-59070 tMethodsX.g2019, v. 6 p.2855-2860dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23402x2215-01617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2019.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013400211300001300345520153900358592002801897650002101925650002201946650001601968650001601984650000902000650001102009650001302020650001202033653001802045653002202063653002202085653002202107653002202129773010502151856008402256852000902340655001202349IND60605447620221120161056.0180721e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060544762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2014.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandenberghe, Jef1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9910-131910aRiver terraces as a response to climatic forcing: Formation processes, sedimentary characteristics and sites for human occupation  ap. 3-11.  aClimate impact on the fluvial processes led to morphological and sedimentological differentiation of a terrace. This diversity in the fluvial environment determined how people could adapt to the river. Although the climatic impact on development and initiation of river terraces seems to be well accepted, a number of pertinent questions disturb this simplicity. For instance:•The exact terrace development within a climate cycle is still under debate. Different kinds of terraces and their sedimentary successions may originate either from aggradation, incision or lateral migration.•Is there a typical sedimentary succession below terraces? What is the genetic origin of each sedimentary layer?•What are the relative ages of those layers and erosion phases within a climate driven erosion–aggradation cycle? The variability in staircase preservation in relation to climatic cyclicity is analysed in three scenarios. Specific scenarios depend essentially on the preservation of the fluvial deposits dating from the warm periods.Finally, a preliminary inventory is presented of the most favourable sites for human occupation in fluvial valleys as derived from a random selection of archaeological findings. Generally, human occupation in that morphological position seems to be linked with, at least temporarily, dry conditions. Climatic conditions do not seem to play the major role. The termination of a settlement may have been due to increased risks of flooding, apart from other than natural fluvio-environmental reasons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3ahuman settlements 3ainventories 3aperiodicity 3arisk 3arivers 3aterraces 3avalleys 0aRiver terrace 0aTerrace cyclicity 0aTerrace staircase 0aFluvial sediments 0aHuman settlements0 tQuaternary international.g2015 June 03, v. 370 p.3-11dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01320naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245014000160300001800300520025800318592002800576650001200604650002000616650001900636650002200655650001400677700002500691700002600716700002200742700002100764773012800785856007200913852000900985655001200994IND60658207720221123013519.0190816e20080307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065820772DNAL7 a10.1039/b718678a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChmura, Amanda J.10aHighly active and stereoselective zirconium and hafnium alkoxide initiators for solvent-free ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide  ap. 1293-1295.  aUnder solvent-free conditions (at 130 °C), zirconium and hafnium amine tris(phenolate) alkoxides are extremely active, well-controlled, single-site initiators for the ring-opening polymerization of rac-lactide, yielding highly heterotactic polylactide.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahafnium 3apolylactic acid 3apolymerization 3astereoselectivity 3azirconium1 aDavidson, Matthew G.1 aFrankis, Catherine J.1 aJones, Matthew D.1 aLunn, Matthew D.0 tChemical communications.g2008 Mar. 7, , no. 11 p.1293-1295dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b718678a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011100173520101800284592002801302650004401330650002201374650001501396650001801411650001901429650001801448650002001466650004301486650002201529650001901551650002401570650001901594650001501613650002301628650001701651650001801668650003701686653002301723653003501746653003101781700002501812700002301837700002201860773013401882856008302016852000902099655001202108IND60677507720221117032230.0191214e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067750772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enmm.2019.1002652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMrunal, V Kangralkar10aCu2O nanoparticles for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye from aqueous medium  aIn order to treat the organic pollutants like dyes in water bodies, the environmentally benign nanoparticles are used extensively.

The adsorption followed Langmuir isotherm, Freundlich isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics. The photo induced degradation of MB dye in presence of Cu2O NPs was also studied using photocatalytic reactor having UV lamp (250 W). Up to 97% degradation of MB occurred as monitored from UV–vis spectra.

The current aim was to determine histamine levels in embryonic liver and its association with the pathogenicity of a very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) isolate serially passaged in chicken embryos. A vvIBDV isolate and the passaged viruses were inoculated into SPF embryonated chicken eggs (0.2ml per egg) via the chorioallantoic membrane. Embryonic livers were collected at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120h post-inoculation and histamine contents were quantified by fluorescence spectrophotometry analyses. Results showed that the histamine content in embryonic livers infected with the original vvIBDV isolate and the early passaged viruses significantly increased 48h post-inoculation, as compared with the adapted IBDV isolate (p<0.01) and controls (p<0.01), with the concentration peaking from 72h to 96h. Most of the infected chicken embryos died from 48h to 96h post-inoculation. Moreover, the histamine content in dead embryos was markedly increased compared with live embryos (p<0.05), peaking at 72h post-inoculation (p<0.01). There was an association between histamine content in embryonic livers and an elevation in histidine decarboxylase activity. Taken together, our results suggest that an excess of histamine correlates with inflammatory responses during vvIBDV infection. This study provides an incremental step in the understanding of the pathogenesis of vvIBDV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3achicken eggs 3achickens 3achorioallantoic membrane 3aeggs 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahistamine 3ahistidine decarboxylase 3ainflammation 3aliver 3apathogenesis 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aInfectious bursal disease virus 0aHistamine 0aHDC 0avvIBDV 0aChicken embryo1 aHe, Lei1 aCheng, Xiangchao1 aLi, Jing1 aJia, Yanyan1 aYang, Danfang0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Nov. 15, v. 168, no. 1-2 p.91-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245011700204300001800321520101700339592002801356650001801384650001301402650002101415650002501436650001701461650001301478650001801491650000901509650001801518650001901536650002501555650002001580650001201600650001301612700001501625700001501640700001901655700001701674700001701691700001901708700001701727773012901744856007401873852000901947655001201956IND60648089520221119162548.0190626e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064808952DNAL7 a10.1039/c9bm00010k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWangThese authors contributed equally to this work., Xiaoli10aPolydopamine nanoparticles carrying tumor cell lysate as a potential vaccine for colorectal cancer immunotherapy  ap. 3062-3075.  aPolydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) were prepared via dopamine self-polymerization; then, tumor cell lysate (TCL) was covalently attached onto the PDA NPs. The TCL loading capacity was 480 μg per mg of PDA NPs, and the resulting TCL@PDA NPs (241.9 nm) had perfect storage stability and negligible cytotoxicity against APCs. Tumor-bearing mice vaccinated with TCL@PDA NPs experienced significant delay in tumor progression due to the sufficient amount of CTLs and M1-type TAM as well as the deficient number of immunosuppression-related cells in the tumor tissues. Furthermore, empty PDA NPs had the ability to modulate DC maturation and delayed the development of tumors by facilitating the production of activated T cells and decreasing the subpopulation of MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment. Overall, these PDA NPs are expected to be a promising candidate for application as antigen delivery carriers because of their facile antigen loading method as well as their simple and rapid preparation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3achemical bonding 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adopamine 3aimmunotherapy 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasm progression 3astorage quality 3atissues 3avaccines1 aWang, Ning1 aYang, Ying1 aWang, Xiaoxiao1 aLiang, Jiayi1 aTian, Xinxin1 aZhang, Hailing1 aLeng, Xigang0 tBiomaterials science.g2019 June 25, v. 7, no. 7 p.3062-3075dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm00010k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03373naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245012600175300001600301520215900317592002802476650001202504650002002516650001002536650001402546650000902560650001102569650001102580650000902591650001202600650001602612650001902628651001202647700001802659700002202677700002202699700001602721700002202737773009602759856008702855852000902942655001202951IND60112024820221118005713.0141110e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011202482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzanti, Eduardo10aPetrology of the Namib Sand Sea: Long-distance transport and compositional variability in the wind-displaced Orange Delta  ap. 173-189.  aSourced as the Nile in distant basaltic rift highlands, the Orange River is the predominant ultimate source of sand for the Namib Desert dunes, as proved independently by bulk-petrography, heavy-mineral, pyroxene-chemistry, and U/Pb zircon-age datasets. Additional local entry points of sand do exist at the edges of the desert, and were quantified by comparison with detrital modes and heavy-mineral suites of hinterland-river sediments. After long-distance fluvial transport, Orange sand is washed by ocean waves and dragged northwards by vigorous longshore currents. Under the incessant action of southerly winds, sand is blown inland and carried farther north to accumulate in the Namib erg, a peculiar wind-dominated sediment sink displaced hundreds of kilometres away from the river mouth. And yet changes in sand mineralogy along the way are minor. After a multistep journey of cumulative 3000km from their source in Lesotho, volcanic rock fragments and pyroxene are found in unchanged abundance as far as the northern edge of the desert. Only locally is volcanic detritus slightly depleted and minor but regular enrichment in quartz and garnet is observed, the sole potential effect of prolonged transport or recycling of Tertiary aeolianites. Selective comminution of fragile minerals is thus proved unable to substantially modify sand composition in fluvial, coastal, or aeolian settings. Mechanical processes have a much greater effect on the morphology of detrital grains, which in Namib dunes appear commonly shaped into nearly perfect spheres. Aeolian sorting concentrates denser minerals locally in placer lags, but such effects can be identified and compensated for. This study demonstrates that mechanical breakdown is unable to markedly affect provenance signatures even during long-distance and prolonged multistep transport in high-energy settings. In arid climates, where chemical processes are negligible, high-resolution bulk-petrography and heavy-mineral analyses are thus powerful techniques to quantitatively reconstruct provenance, and to trace sediment sources and dispersal paths over distances up to thousands of kilometres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adunes 3ahighlands 3alead 3aoceans 3aquartz 3asand 3asorting 3awater waves 3awind direction 3aLesotho1 aAndò, Sergio1 aVezzoli, Giovanni1 aLustrino, Michele1 aBoni, Maria1 aVermeesch, Pieter0 tEarth-science reviews.g2012 May, v. 112, no. 3-4 p.173-189dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245008700160300002000247520096700267592002801234650003001262650001601292650002501308650001901333650001301352650001701365650001701382650001001399653002801409653001901437653002501456653002001481653003601501700001701537700001501554700005701569700005901626773014201685856007801827852000901905655001201914IND60679471920221119064801.0191228e20191126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067947192DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b156492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGo, Kwangmo10aSolar-to-Steam Generation via Porous Black Membranes with Tailored Pore Structures  ap. 48300-48308.  aSolar-to-steam generation is a powerful, intense, and efficient method to harvest solar energy. Many efforts have been devoted to the development of a durable, affordable, and easy-to-manufacture solar steam device. In this study, we use a versatile polydimethylsiloxane material to fabricate an open porous black membrane with different pore structures using a simple salt water etching process and vapor deposition polymerization of pyrrole into a matrix. The porous black membrane absorbed radiation from a broad section of the light spectrum from near-infrared to ultraviolet and retained its initial pore structures and floating ability. We found that our black membrane with a tailored pore structure and surface exhibits excellent solar-to-steam generation efficiency of up to 72% at five sun irradiation. Also, a series of analyses including density functional theory calculation was used to prove the outstanding efficiency of solar-to-steam generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3airradiation 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3apolymerization 3apyrroles 3asaline water 3asolar energy 3asteam 0aphotothermal conversion 0asolar-to-steam 0abroadband absorption 0aporous membrane 0avapor deposition polymerization1 aBae, Kihyeon1 aChoi, Hyuk1 aKim, Hyun You1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8105-16401 aLee, Kyung-Jin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6709-32350 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 26, v. 11, no. 51 p.48300-48308dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b156493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016000168300001600328520132000344592002801664650001201692650001401704650001601718650001301734650001501747650002901762650001001791650001401801650001601815650002201831653001701853653002301870653001301893653002501906653002801931700001701959700002201976700001301998700001802011700001502029773013802044856008502182852000902267655001202276IND60535156620221119141347.0190318e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathak, Rupal10aAlterations in cortisol concentrations and expression of certain genes associated with neutrophil functions in cows developing retention of fetal membranes  ap. 164-168.  aElevated cortisol concentrations have been reported to impair the functions and alter the life span of neutrophils in cows. The present study assessed the cortisol concentrations and expression of few genes related to longevity (Fas, Caspase 3, Bcl2) and margination (CD 62L, CD 18/11b) of neutrophils in relation to retention of fetal membranes (RFM) in dairy cows. Cortisol concentrations were significantly higher on the day of calving and day 2 postpartum in RFM cows than normal cows. Expression of CD 62L was significantly lower on the day of calving and day 2 postpartum in RFM cows than normal cows. While expression of Fas and GR was significantly lower on the day of calving, expression of Bcl2 was lower on day 7±2 pre-partum in RFM cows compared to normal cows. No significant difference was observed in the expression of CD 18/11b and Caspase 3 between RFM and normal cows. Cortisol concentration was negatively correlated with expression of GR, Fas, CD 62L, CD18/CD11b and Caspase 3, while positively correlated with immature neutrophil percentage and expression of Bcl2. It may be inferred that cortisol concentrations and expression of certain genes associated with lifespan and margination of neutrophils were altered in cows developing RFM compared to those expelled the fetal membranes normally.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalving 3acaspase-3 3acorrelation 3acortisol 3adairy cows 3aextraembryonic membranes 3agenes 3alongevity 3aneutrophils 3aretained placenta 0aDairy cattle 0aPeri-partum period 0aCortisol 0aNeutrophil functions 0aRetained fetal membrane1 aPrasad, Shiv1 aKumarēcan̲, A.,1 aKaur, M.1 aManimaran, A.1 aDang, A.K.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 168, no. 3-4 p.164-168dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03862naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015800166300001600324520201300340592002802353650001202381650000802393650003102401650002702432650003802459650001002497650001202507650001702519650001902536650002202555650001802577650001502595650001902610650002802629650002102657650004302678650005202721650001902773650003202792650001202824650001202836653002702848653001402875653001002889653002102899653002002920700001902940700001402959700001402973700001302987700001303000700001503013773013803028856008503166852000903251655001203260IND60535156720221119141410.0190318e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053515672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarigye, R.10aKinetics of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-10, and virus neutralising antibodies during acute ephemeral fever virus infections in Brahman cattle  ap. 159-163.  aWhile fever and inflammation are hallmark features of bovine ephemeral fever (BEF), the cytokine networks that underlie the acute phase of the disease have not been empirically defined in cattle. This study characterised the plasma kinetics of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and IL-10 during acute BEF and elucidated on the relationship between the onset of the virus neutralizing antibody response and resolution of viraemia in natural BEF virus (BEFV) infections in cattle. Plasma from three BEFV-infected and three uninfected cattle was tested for the study cytokines by a cELISA, viraemia monitored by qRT-PCR, and virus neutralizing antibody titres determined using a standard protocol. Unlike the negative controls, plasma concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were consistently increased in the three virus-infected animals. Two of the infected heifers were recumbent and pyrexic on the first day of monitoring and increased cytokine production was already in progress by the time viraemia was detected in all the three infected animals. In all the virus-infected heifers, IL-1β was the most strongly expressed cytokine, IL-6 and IL-10 manifested intermediate plasma concentrations while TNF-α was the least expressed and demonstrated bi-phasic peaks three and five days after the onset of pyrexia. In two of the BEFV-infected heifers, viraemia resolved on the day of seroconversion while in the other infected animal, viral RNA was detectable up to three days after seroconversion. The present data document variable increase in plasma IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 during natural BEFV infections and the fact that upregulation of all but TNF-α precedes seroconversion. In addition to virus neutralising antibodies, it is likely that cytokine-mediated cellular mechanisms may be required for resolution of viraemia in BEF. Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10, its upregulation may potentially antagonise the fever response in BEFV-infected cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrahman 3aRNA 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abovine ephemeral fever 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afever 3aheifers 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amonitoring 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apharmacokinetics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseroconversion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aviremia 3aviruses 0aBovine ephemeral fever 0aCytokines 0aFever 0aHumoral immunity 0aInnate immunity1 aMelville, L.F.1 aDavis, S.1 aWalsh, S.1 aHunt, N.1 aHunt, R.1 aElliot, N.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 168, no. 3-4 p.159-163dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01247naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245004100161300001800202520028000220592002800500650001800528650002300546650002800569700013600597700002500733773012900758856007300887852000900960655001200969IND60658208220221123024258.0190816e20080229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065820822DNAL7 a10.1039/b718754h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Natalie A.10aFormal total synthesis of triptolide  ap. 1226-1228.  aA new approach to the medicinally-important natural product triptolide is significantly shorter than previous syntheses, highly convergent and avoids the use of protecting groups; key features include two Diels–Alder reactions and a new deoxygenative aromatisation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatization 3achemical compounds 3acycloaddition reactions1 aWillisTo whom correspondence should be addressed regarding the X-ray crystal structures.

Their first description in humans and pigs as extrathymic T cells with a memory phenotype almost 30 years ago came as a surprise. Meanwhile peripheral double-positive T cells have been described in a growing number of different species. In this review we highlight novel data from our very recent studies on canine peripheral double-positive T cells which point to unique features of double-positive T cells in the dog. In contrast to porcine CD4+CD8+ T cells forming a homogenous cellular population based on their expression of CD4 and CD8α, canine CD4+CD8+ T cells can be divided into three different cellular subsets with distinct expression levels of CD4 and CD8α. Double-positive T cells expressing CD8β are present in humans and dogs but absent in swine. Moreover, canine CD4+CD8+ T cells can not only develop from CD4+ single-positive T cells but also from CD8+ single-positive T cells. Together, this places canine CD4+CD8+ T cells closer to their human than porcine counterparts since human double-positive T cells also appear to be heterogeneous in their CD4 and CD8α expression and have both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as progenitor cells. However, CD4+ single-positive T cells are the more potent progenitors for canine double-positive T cells, whereas CD8+ single-positive T cells are more potent progenitors for human double-positive T cells. Canine double-positive T cells have an activated phenotype and may have as yet unrecognized roles in vivo in immunity to infection or in inflammatory diseases such as chronic infection, autoimmunity, allergy, or cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aautoimmunity 3achronic diseases 3adogs 3ahumans 3ahypersensitivity 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3astem cells 3aswine 0aT cells 0aDog 0aDouble-positive T cells1 aBismarck, Doris1 aAlber, Gottfried0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 168, no. 3-4 p.169-175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2015.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100007100138245013700209300001400346500002000360520170000380592002802080596019502108650002102303650001102324650002002335650001302355650001802368650001502386650001102401650001302412650002202425650001202447651001802459651001102477700002302488700005802511700002602569700003402595700002002629773013102649856007202780852000902852655001202861IND60681333220221122114319.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133322DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.35472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMochnacz, N.

Concern over detrimental effects of low flows on population abundance prompted research on how variability in discharge regimes influence habitat availability. Habitat suitability indices for prespawning and spawning adult anadromous Dolly Varden from two streams were integrated into a two‐dimensional hydrodynamic habitat model to assess the effect of flow variability on usable habitat. Regional hydrographs were used to identify an ecologically relevant range of flows that provided optimal spawning habitat for these populations and examine the relationship between abundance and discharge. Adults spawned in the tail end of pools at moderate water depths and water velocities, and used pebble‐ to cobble‐sized substrate for building redds; whereas, prespawning adults occupied deeper pools with moderate velocities and used cobble for cover. Model outputs showed that spawning habitat availability was optimized at flow rates between 1.6 and 3.0 m³/s and between 1.0 and 6.0 m³/s in Fish Hole Creek (FHC) and Little Fish Creek, respectively. A positive relationship between flows during the fall spawning period and abundance of the FHC population suggests that higher flows coinciding with optimal habitat availability may have contributed to positive recruitment. To strengthen and refine this habitat–population relationship for Dolly Varden in this area requires investigation of a broader suite of variables associated with environmental regimes and physical habitat in reaches used for spawning.  aPublisher supplied data  cFinancial support was provided by Fisheries and Oceans Canada; National Research Council of Canada, Program for Energy Research and Development; and the Fisheries Joint Management Committee. 3aSalvelinus malma 3aadults 3aanadromous fish 3ahabitats 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrograph 3amodels 3aspawning 3aspecies abundance 3astreams 3aArctic region 3aCanada1 aGhamry, Haitham K.1 aEnders, Eva C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2103-03591 aWatkinson, Douglas A.1 aGallagher, C.

Flood resilience is a common denominator of most of the approaches. In this article, we present the ‘Flood Resilience Rose’ (FRR), a management tool to promote harmonised action towards flood resilience in European regions and beyond. The FRR is a result of a two‐step process. First, based on scientific concepts as well as analysis of relevant policy documents, we identified three ‘levels of operation’. The first level refers to the EU Floods Directive and an extended multi‐layer safety approach, comprising the four different layers of protection, prevention, preparedness and recovery, and related measures to be taken. This level is not independent but depends both on the institutional (second level) and the wider (third level) context. Second, we used surveys, semi‐structured interviews and group discussions during workshops with experts from Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom to validate the definitions and the FRR's practical relevance. The presented FRR is thus the result of rigorous theoretical and practical consideration and provides a tool capable to strengthen flood risk management practice.  aPublisher supplied data  a38‐2‐9‐16cEuropean Regional Development Fund 3aflood control 3aissues and policy 3arisk management 3aBelgium 3aDenmark 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aUnited Kingdom1 aRestemeyer, Britta1 aKlenke, Thomas0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2021 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.e12726-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.127263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02136naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009000164520116500254592002801419650001501447650001701462650001301479650002101492650001801513653002001531653002201551653001701573653002401590773011301614856008601727852000901813655001201822IND60752553820221120024836.0211030e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Peng10aConcise review on residual chlorine measurement: Interferences and possible solutions  aChlorination is the oldest and most common method to control water quality and biofouling worldwide. Therefore, ensuring the accuracy of the measurements of residual chlorine concentration in treated water is of significant importance. Various residual chlorine measurement methods are used for industrial and municipal (conventional) or academic research (unconventional) purposes. Previous studies have reported that the conventional methods suffer from diverse interferences that lead to erroneous measurements. However, no recent study has summarized and synthesized the existing interferences related to the measurement methods. In this review, the conventional electrochemical and colorimetric-photometric methods are discussed, along with the unconventional methods, with regard to their principles, advantages, limitations, and recent case studies. Further, conventional method interferences are defined and discussed. In particular, possible solutions for interferences in the widespread colorimetric-photometric method are extensively evaluated, and constructive suggestions are offered toward reducing or avoiding the effects of these interferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofouling 3achlorination 3achlorine 3aelectrochemistry 3awater quality 0aWater treatment 0aResidual chlorine 0aInterference 0aColorimetric method0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 323 p.129119-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245008400203300001600287506007600303520146600379592002801845506003701873650002801910650002201938650001601960650001601976650001101992650004702003650001902050650002202069650001502091650001102106650002602117650001202143650001602155650001102171650001802182700002402200700002302224773010502247856007502352852000902427655001202436IND60532712620221207144407.0160728e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271262DNAL7 a10.1021/bm20156192doi7 aPMC37370782pmcid7 a221854862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Arjun
S.10aStrain Tunes Proteolytic Degradation and Diffusive Transport in Fibrin Networks  ap. 499-506.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProteolytic degradation of fibrin, the major structural component in blood clots, is critical both during normal wound healing and in the treatment of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Fibrin-containing clots experience substantial strain due to platelet contraction, fluid shear, and mechanical stress at the wound site. However, little is understood about how mechanical forces may influence fibrin dissolution. We used video microscopy to image strained fibrin clots as they were degraded by plasmin, a major fibrinolytic enzyme. Applied strain causes up to 10-fold reduction in the rate of fibrin degradation. Analysis of our data supports a quantitative model in which the decrease in fibrin proteolysis rates with strain stems from slower transport of plasmin into the clot. We performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements to further probe the effect of strain on diffusive transport. We find that diffusivity perpendicular to the strain axis decreases with increasing strain, while diffusivity along the strain axis remains unchanged. Our results suggest that the properties of the fibrin network have evolved to protect mechanically loaded fibrin from degradation, consistent with its function in wound healing. The pronounced effect of strain upon diffusivity and proteolytic susceptibility within fibrin networks offers a potentially useful means of guiding cell growth and morphology in fibrin-based biomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiocompatible materials 3ablood coagulation 3acell growth 3adiffusivity 3afibrin 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3aimage analysis 3amechanical stress 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3amyocardial infarction 3aplasmin 3aproteolysis 3astroke 3atissue repair1 aMekhdjian, Armen H.1 aDunn, Alexander R.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Feb. 13, v. 13, no. 2 p.499-506dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm20156193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014000169300001600309500001900325520125600344592002801600650002301628650002901651650002301680650001601703650001201719650001501731650001601746650001001762650001201772650002001784650002101804650001001825650001201835650001101847650001101858653000701869653001001876653000901886653001101895653000901906653000801915653001001923653000901933653000901942653000901951653000701960653000701967653001001974653000801984653000801992653002602000653002302026653002402049653003802073700001702111700001702128700001602145700001102161700001802172773010002190856008602290852000902376655001202385IND60697133320221122211124.0200614e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069713332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2020.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Bai-Xue14aThe effect of xylose reductase genes on xylitol production by industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae in fermentation of glucose and xylose  ap. 122-130.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe co-production of xylitol and ethanol from agricultural straw has more economic advantages than the production of ethanol only. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the most widely used ethanol-producing yeast, can be genetically engineered to ferment xylose to xylitol. In the present study, the effects of xylose-specificity, cofactor preference, and the gene copy number of xylose reductase (XR; encoding by XYL1 gene) on xylitol production of S. cerevisiae were investigated. The results showed that overexpression of XYL1 gene with a lower xylose-specificity and a higher NADPH preference favored the xylitol production. The copy number of XYL1 had a positive correlation with the XR activity but did not show a good correlation with the xylitol productivity. The overexpression of XYL1 from Candida tropicalis (CtXYL1) achieved a xylitol productivity of 0.83 g/L/h and a yield of 0.99 g/g-consumed xylose during batch fermentation with 43.5 g/L xylose and 17.0 g/L glucose. During simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of pretreated corn stover, the strain overexpressing CtXYL1 produced 45.41 g/L xylitol and 50.19 g/L ethanol, suggesting its application potential for xylitol and ethanol co-production from straw feedstocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida tropicalis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abatch fermentation 3acorn stover 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3agene dosage 3agenes 3aglucose 3aoxidoreductases 3asaccharification 3astraw 3axylitol 3axylose 3ayeasts 0aXR 0adsDNA 0agRNA 0aCRISPR 0aqPCR 0aDCW 0aNADPH 0aNADH 0aNAD+ 0aHPLC 0aGC 0aSD 0aANOVA 0aSHF 0aSSF 0aXylose reductase gene 0aXylose-specificity 0aCofactor preference 0aXylitol and ethanol co-production1 aXie, Cai-Yun1 aXia, Zi-Yuan1 aWu, Ya-Jing1 aLi, Bo1 aTang, Yue-Qin0 tProcess biochemistry.g2020 Aug., v. 95 p.122-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2020.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245013700175300001600312520158400328592002801912650001201940650001401952650002001966650001601986650001102002650001602013650001602029650002602045650001102071650001502082650001602097650001502113650001802128650000902146650001202155653001202167653002002179653002102199653002602220653001602246700006902262700001502331773009102346856009002437852000902527655001202536IND60615975820221119132516.0201230e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061597582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.09.1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Shofiqul10aImpact of water and fertilizer management on arsenic bioaccumulation and speciation in rice plants grown under greenhouse conditions  ap. 606-613.  aArsenic (As), a non-threshold class I carcinogen, is a main source of human exposure to inorganic As for billions of people worldwide. Rice is much more effectual in accruing As into its grain and other parts. Therefore, strategies to reduce As accumulation in rice should be adopted. The impact of water [Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), incessant flooding (CF)] and fertilizer management [Silicon (Si@ control, 10 and 20 mg/kg soil) and Phosphorus (P@ control, 12.5 and 25.0 mg/kg soil)] on the bioaccumulation of As in rice plants under different As-graded paddy soils (control, 10, 20 mg/kg) using an Australian rice variety (cv. Sherpa) was investigated under greenhouse conditions. Results indicated that, arsenite accounted for >80% of the total inorganic As in pore water and total As concentration declined from 933 μg/L to 177 μg/L with time. AWD irrigation practice with Si fertilization significantly reduced the total As levels in pore water. Arsenic concentration in different rice plant tissues showed significant variations due to water and fertilizer management. Lower concentrations of As in rice grains were observed using AWD (average 93.0 μg/kg) than those observed in CF (average 121 μg/kg) irrigation practice. The addition of Si also significantly (p < 0.03) decreased As uptake by rice plants while adding of P has no significant effect and this is also true for Si and P interaction. AWD irrigation practice with Si fertilization resulted in a reduction of grain As level at around 12%–21%, while grain yield increased by 13%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3abioaccumulation 3acarcinogens 3adrying 3afertilizers 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse production 3ahumans 3airrigation 3apaddy soils 3aphosphorus 3aplant tissues 3arice 3asilicon 0aArsenic 0aBioaccumulation 0aWater management 0aFertilizer management 0aGrain yield1 aRahman, Mohammad Mahmudur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3426-52211 aNaidu, R.,0 tChemosphere.g2019 Jan., v. 214 p.606-613dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.09.1583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011300174300001400287500001900301520124800320592002801568650001701596650001601613650001501629650002401644650001601668650002701684650001301711650001501724650001201739650002001751653000801771653000701779653000901786653000901795653000801804653000801812653000701820653000801827653000701835653002001842653000801862653002301870653002401893653001701917700002901934700003701963700002702000700001902027773009802046856008602144852000902230655001202239IND60697133420221122211116.0200614e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069713342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2020.04.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajar-Azhari, Siti10aNovel fructooligosaccharide conversion from sugarcane syrup using a specialised enzymatic pH-stat bioreactor  ap. 55-63.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFructooligosaccharides (FOS) have gained significant attention for their prebiotic properties. Given that sugarcane syrup (SS) is sucrose-rich but with other nutritional benefits, its direct transformation into FOS may add value to this product. Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop FOS conversion from SS and to define the kinetic behaviour of FOS synthesized in a 1-L specialized pH-stat bioreactor (SPSB). The SS was composed of sucrose (58.93%) with considerable antioxidant capacities and Ƴ-aminobutyric acid. The developed SPSB process consisted of three stages: evaporation of sugarcane juice into syrup (68–75 °Brix) (stage 1), optimization of the Viscozyme L and SS mixture at different reaction temperatures (47–55 °C) (stage 2), and upscaling of the optimized reaction system under defined conditions in a 1 L-SPSB system (stage 3). In the 1 L-SPSB system, the enzymatic reaction yielded 32.22% of FOS from SS after a 6 h reaction, which is comparable with a pure system containing an equivalent concentration of 10% of sucrose as initial substrate with 39.55% yield. This result demonstrated the efficient conversion of SS into FOS, supporting the utilization of sugarcane juice for its health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioreactors 3acane syrup 3aenzymatic reactions 3aevaporation 3afructooligosaccharides 3akinetics 3aprebiotics 3asucrose 3asugarcane juice 0aFOS 0aSS 0aSPSB 0aGABA 0aNCS 0aSTR 0aDW 0aGAE 0aFU 0aSugarcane syrup 0aFOS 0apH-stat bioreactor 0aEnzymatic synthesis 0aNative sugar1 aRahim, Muhamad Hafiz Abd1 aWan-Mohtar, Wan Abd Al Qadr Imad1 aSarbini, Shahrul Razid1 aSaari, Nazamid0 tProcess biochemistry.g2020 Aug., v. 95 p.55-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2020.04.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005700111040001800168072000900186072000900195072000900204100002100213245021200234300001800446500002400464520152900488650002002017650002702037650001602064650001302080650001902093650003002112650002002142650002302162650001802185650002802203650001902231650002302250650002202273650001502295650001502310650001602325650001202341650001202353650002002365650001802385650003102403650002202434650002802456650003202484650005802516653001702574700001202591700001802603700001402621700001702635773012502652852000902777856010702786930003302893945002502926946001302951655001202964IND4418888220221121021521.0090410e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441888822DNAL7 a187677622pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101[1471:SYONSL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF200 0aF6001 aWarrington, C.V.10aSeed Yield of Near-Isogenic Soybean Lines with Introgressed Quantitative Trait Loci Conditioning Resistance to Corn Earworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and Soybean Looper (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) from PI 229358  ap. 1471-1477.  aIncludes references  aThe development of superior soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., cultivars exhibiting resistance to insects has been hindered due to linkage drag, a common phenomenon when introgressing alleles from exotic germplasm. Simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used previously to map soybean insect resistance (SIR) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in a 'Cobb' x PI 229358 population, and subsequently used to create near-isogenic lines (NILs) with SIR QTL in a 'Benning' genetic background. SIR QTLs were mapped on linkage groups (LGs) M (SIRQTL-M), G (SIRQTL-G), and H (SIRQTL-H). The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate linkage drag for seed yield by using Benning-derived NILs selected for SIRQTL-M, SIRQTL-H, and SIRQTL-G; 2) assess the amount of PI 229358 genome surrounding the SIR QTL in each Benning NIL; and 3) evaluate the individual effects these three QTLs on antibiosis and antixenosis to corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens (Walker). Yield data collected in five environments indicated that a significant yield reduction is associated with SIRQTL-G compared with NILs without SIR QTL. Overall, there was no yield reduction associated with SIRQTL-M or SIRQTL-H. A significant antixenosis and antibiosis effect was detected for SIRQTL-M in insect feeding assays, with no effect detected in antixenosis or antibiosis assays for SIRQTL-G or SIRQTL-H without the presence of PI 229358 alleles at SIRQTL-M. These results support recent findings concerning these loci. 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aPseudoplusia includens 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aisogenic lines 3amarker-assisted selection 3apest resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aintrogression 3aquantitative trait loci 3alinkage groups 3aselection response 3aseed productivity 3acrop yield 3aantibiosis 3aantixenosis 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenome, Plant 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMothsximmunology 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aSoybeansxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 0alinkage drag1 aZhu, S.1 aParrott, W.A.1 aAll, J.N.1 aBoerma, H.R.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2008 Aug., v. 101, no. 4 p.1471-1477dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101[1471:SYONSL]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle03244naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245007000169300001800239500002000257500000900277520168300286592002801969596004701997650001602044650001802060650002302078650001302101650001402114650003002128650001202158650000902170650001802179650001302197650001902210650001102229650001302240650002302253650001202276650001602288650001802304650001502322651000902337651002202346700002602368700002402394773021902418856008002637852000902717655001202726IND60666434620221120133408.0220511e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643462DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2016.05.01802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillarini, Gabriele10aSoybean Area and Baseflow Driving Nitrate in Iowa's Raccoon River  ap. 1949-1959.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aImproved understanding of the drivers of stream nitrate is necessary to improve water quality. This is particularly true for Iowa, a large contributor to Mississippi River Basin nitrate loads. Here, we focus on the Raccoon River at Des Moines, Iowa, and develop statistical models to describe the monthly (from March to August) nitrate concentrations in terms of eight drivers representing monthly climate, monthly hydrology, and yearly cropping practices. We consider six two‐parameter distributions, linear and nonlinear dependencies between the predictors, and the distributions’ parameters. Model selection was performed by penalizing more complex models. Our results show that the Weibull and Gumbel distributions are the only two selected distributions. Baseflow and the previous year's soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] area were the two predictors most often identified as important. Our modeling results imply that increases in soybean area have led to increasing nitrate concentrations. Moreover, nitrate concentrations are related to baseflow in a nonlinear way, with effects strongest when baseflow is near or below the average condition. Additional relevant predictors were precipitation and, to a lesser extent, temperature. We conclude that best management practices and improved conservation targeting soybean in a corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean rotation will improve water quality in this artificially drained system. CORE IDEAS: We developed statistical models to understand drivers of stream nitrate. Soybean cultivation and baseflow are strong drivers of stream nitrate. More focus on soybean, rather than corn, may disproportionately improve water quality.  aPublisher supplied data  aC5 52718 35cIowa Nutrient Research Center 3aGlycine max 3aProcyon lotor 3aWeibull statistics 3aZea mays 3abase flow 3abest management practices 3aclimate 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3anitrates 3apollution load 3arivers 3asoybeans 3astatistical models 3astreams 3atemperature 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aIowa 3aMississippi River1 aJones, Christopher S.1 aSchilling, Keith E.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2016 Nov., v. 45, no. 6 p.1949-1959dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2016.05.01803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005400147245014300201300001600344520161700360592002801977596015902005596011402164596011502278650002002393650001502413650001002428650002102438650001902459650001602478650002302494650001102517650002502528650001202553650002902565650002102594650002002615650001802635650002102653650002202674651001002696700002102706700001902727700002002746773012102766856008102887852000902968655001202977IND60614157820221118011338.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061415782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-018-0652-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dongpo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2844-714910aProduction efficiency and effect of water management on rice yield in Japan: two-stage DEA model on 110 paddy fields of a large-scale farm  ap. 643-654.  aWater management is increasingly important for rice productivity to maintain soil temperature and fertility with the presence of global warming. Meanwhile, rice production in Japan is in urgent need to reduce the costs through improving the efficiency and market competitiveness. This paper aims to measure effect of water depth and water temperature on rice yield of individual paddy fields and improve the practice of water management for them. In the first stage, we measure the production efficiency of rice yield through the adoption of data envelopment analysis. The results indicate that enlarged scale of the paddy fields increases the efficiency, and rice quality can be improved more than quantity. Moreover, the most inefficiently used inputs include the amount of fertilizer nitrogen and the soil capacity, which is a compound measurement of 21 soil chemical properties. In the second stage, after comparing the 20 paddy fields with highest and lowest technical efficiency, an observation shows that the rice yield is much more affected by water temperature than by water depth. The data of all the variables used in this study were sampled in 2015 and comprised of 110 paddy fields of Koshihikari, one of the most popular Japanese rice varieties, from a large-scale farm located in Kanto Region of Japan. In the analysis, the outputs include yields of raw paddy, paddy with 15% moisture, unsorted brown rice, sorted brown rice, milled grain rice, and perfect grain rice. The inputs include the field area, air temperature, solar radiation, fertilizer nitrogen, soil capacity, and farming conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aTechnologies for creating next-generation agriculturecCabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP)  aforestrycCabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP)  afisheriescCabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) 3aair temperature 3abrown rice 3afarms 3afertilizer rates 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3amarket competition 3amodels 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apaddies 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil temperature 3asolar radiation 3awater content 3awater management 3awater temperature 3aJapan1 aNanseki, Teruaki1 aChomei, Yosuke1 aYokota, Shuichi0 tPaddy and water environment.g2018 Oct., v. 16, no. 4 p.643-654dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000000129x1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-018-0652-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001600270520134900286592002801635650004701663650001801710650002901728650001201757650001501769650001101784650001401795650001901809650001801828650001801846650001301864650001901877650001901896650001701915650001001932650001801942650000901960650001501969650003101984650001702015650001302032650001502045651002102060653004102081653002802122653002702150653001802177700001802195700001702213700002002230700001902250700002002269700001702289773011102306856008202417852000902499655001202508IND60541937020221116234941.0190401e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054193702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jeong Ah10aPolyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate induces severe lung inflammation, fibrosis, and thymic atrophy  ap. 267-275.  aPolyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate (PHMG-P) has been widely used as a disinfectant because of its strong bactericidal activity and low toxicity. However, in 2011, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health and Welfare reported that a suspicious outbreak of pulmonary disease might have originated from humidifier disinfectants. The purpose of this study was to assess the toxicity of PHMG-P following direct exposure to the lung. PHMG-P (0.3, 0.9, or 1.5mg/kg) was instilled into the lungs of mice. The levels of proinflammatory markers and fibrotic markers were quantified in lung tissues and flow cytometry was used to evaluate T cell distribution in the thymus. Administration of PHMG-P induced proinflammatory cytokines elevation and infiltration of immune cells into the lungs. Histopathological analysis revealed a dose-dependent exacerbation of both inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis on day 14. PHMG-P also decreased the total cell number and the CD4+/CD8+ cell ratio in the thymus, with the histopathological examination indicating severe reduction of cortex and medulla. The mRNA levels of biomarkers associated with T cell development also decreased markedly. These findings suggest that exposure of lung tissue to PHMG-P leads to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis as well as thymic atrophy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibacterial properties 3aatrophy 3abiomarkers 3acortex 3acytokines 3adirect contact 3adisinfectants 3adose response 3afibrosis 3aflow cytometry 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aphosphates 3arespiratory tract diseases 3athymus gland 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aKorean Peninsula 0aPolyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate 0aHumidifier disinfectant 0aPulmonary inflammation 0aLung fibrosis1 aPark, Hyun-Ju1 aYang, Mi-Jin1 aJung, Kyung Jin1 aYang, Hyo-Seon1 aSong, Chang-Woo1 aLee, Kyuhong0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 July, v. 69 p.267-275dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007000160300001600230500002000246520153700266592002801803596004701831596002501878596007101903650001001974650001301984650001301997650001902010650001102029650001302040650002202053650001602075651002202091700006402113700002202177700005902199773013302258856007202391852000902463655001202472IND60681333720221122114259.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133372DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.35392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAppel, Douglas S.10aZooplankton sampling in large riverine systems: A gear comparison  ap. 102-114.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLarge river systems create challenges when sampling zooplankton. The dynamics of large rivers, spatial heterogeneity of biota, and behaviours of zooplankton can all contribute to large variation in estimation. The gear utilized for zooplankton collections may also be a factor, and there is not a well‐studied gear, nor industry standard, for collection in riverine systems. The lack of consistent sampling methods makes it difficult to compare zooplankton within and across systems. A standard method for zooplankton collection would be valuable for comparison among studies. To optimize zooplankton assessment in large river habitats, we tested how community estimations varied between four common zooplankton sampling devices across three river habitat types. We tested four gears: the Schindler–Patalas trap, integrated tube sampler, powered water pump, and horizontal tow net. Each device was used to collect samples in thalweg, channel border, and backwater river habitats within Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River in June, July, and August of 2017. Our results support that there are qualitative and quantitative differences in zooplankton estimates among gear in different habitats. The powered pump most often yielded highest abundances of total and individual zooplankton taxa allowing for more reliable community comparisons. With some modification, the pump is recommended as the most appropriate sampling gear when performing quantitative studies of zooplankton composition and abundance in large river habitats.  aPublisher supplied data  aF17AC00404cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cRiver Studies Center  cUW‐La Crosse Research, Service and Educational Leadership (RSEL) 3agears 3ahabitats 3aindustry 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asampling 3aspatial variation 3azooplankton 3aMississippi River1 aGerrish, Gretchen A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6192-57341 aFisher, Elista J.1 aFritts, Mark W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0438-76710 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.102-114dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.35393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245006800176300001600244500001900260520097700279536014201256592002801398596001401426596001501440650001001455650001601465650002101481650001101502650002301513650001301536653000901549653001701558653001401575653001001589653001701599700001801616700002101634700001601655773012101671856008501792852000901877655001201886IND60708443120221118073916.0200826e20200902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844312DNAL7 a10.1080/10871209.2020.17582522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFančovičová, Jana10aSnake coloration does not influence children’s detection time  ap. 489-497.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough snakes play key roles in the functioning of various ecosystems, they have been among the most persecuted groups of animals. To enhance conservation efforts, we employed research on perceptions about snakes differing in body coloration. We investigated the bright coloration hypothesis, which suggests that bright (aposematic) coloration triggers fear in humans due to an evolved aversion for aposematic signals. The sample was 77 Slovak preschool children. The detection times for aposematically and cryptically colored snakes were similar. The only exception was that aposematically colored snakes were detected quicker among cryptic non-snake animals than among aposematic non-snake animals. These results provide mixed support for the bright coloration hypothesis. This suggests that snakes, unlike non-snake animals, capture visual attention irrespective of their color, which can be utilized in selection of flagship species to increase conservation efforts.  aThis work was supported by the Agentúra Ministerstva Školstva, Vedy, Výskumu a Športu SR [1/0286/20]; Trnava University [12/TU/2018].  aPublisher supplied data  a1/0286/20  a12/TU/2018 3acolor 3afearfulness 3aflagship species 3ahumans 3amimicry (behavior) 3awildlife 0aFear 0aconservation 0aevolution 0ahuman 0awild animals1 aProkop, Pavol1 aSzikhart, Mário1 aPazda, Adam0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2020 Sept. 02, v. 25, no. 5 p.489-497dRoutledgewJournal:J000000084x1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2020.17582523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245009200170300001800262500000900280520150900289592002801798650001901826650001601845650001301861650003001874650001201904650000901916650000901925650002101934650001601955650002301971650001301994650001302007650001302020650001402033650000902047650002002056650000902076650001102085650002902096650001702125650002402142650001902166650002802185700002502213700002102238700002102259700002302280700003402303700002702337700002802364700002202392700002102414700002102435700002302456773021802479856008002697852000902777655001202786IND60666434820221120142758.0191028e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643482DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2015.06.02812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanchoni, Luciana C.10aEffect of Landfill Leachate on Cereal Nutrition and Productivity and on Soil Properties  ap. 1080-1086.  aepub  aLandfill leachates carry nutrients, especially N and K, which can be recycled in cropping systems. We applied doses of landfill leachate (0 [Control], 32.7, 65.4, 98.1, and 130.8 m³ ha⁻¹) three times in 2008 and three times in 2009 on a clay Rhodic Kandiudult soil. In 2009, black oat (Avena strigosa L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) were cropped in succession and assessed for concentration of nutrients in leaves and for shoot biomass and grain yield, respectively. As a positive control, an additional treatment with urea (120 kg ha⁻¹ of N) was studied in corn. Soil was sampled at four depths (down to 60 cm) in three sampling dates to assess chemical and biochemical properties. Concentration of nutrients in leaves, oat biomass (8530–23,240 kg ha⁻¹), and corn grain yield (4703–8807 kg ha⁻¹) increased with increasing doses of leachate. There was a transient increase in the concentration of nitrate in soil (3–30 mg kg⁻¹), increasing the risk of N losses by leaching at doses above 120 kg ha⁻¹ N, as revealed by an estimated N balance in the cropping system. Sodium and K in soil also increased with increasing doses of leachate but decreased as rainfall occurred. The activity of dehydrogenase decreased about 30% from the control to the highest dose of leachate and urea, suggesting an inhibitory effect of mineral N on microbial metabolism. Landfill leachate was promising as a source of N and K for crop productivity and caused minor or transient effects on soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena strigosa 3aKandiudults 3aZea mays 3aagricultural productivity 3abiomass 3aclay 3acorn 3acropping systems 3agrain yield 3alandfill leachates 3aleaching 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aoats 3aplant nutrition 3arain 3asodium 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil enzymes 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3asoil-plant interactions1 aSantos, Cristiane A.1 aKuwano, Biana H.1 aCarmo, Kellen B.1 aCely, Martha V.

Herein, a convenient aqueous route was adopted to synthesize CdTe core QDs for the construction of type-II core/shell QD sensitizers. First, mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped water-soluble CdTe QDs were synthesized in aqueous media. After tethering the CdTe QDs onto a mesoporous TiO₂ photoanode, CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeₓS₁₋ₓ type-II core/shell QD sensitizers were formed by post-depositing CdS and CdSeₓS₁₋ₓ shell materials over the photoanodes via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction processes (SILAR), respectively. A wider light harvesting range together with a wider photoelectronic response range was observed in the resultant CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeₓS₁₋ₓ core/shell QD based solar cells relative to plain CdTe cells. Simultaneously, suppressed charge recombination processes has also been confirmed by impedance spectroscopy (IS), and open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) characterizations. Consequently, compared to the plain CdTe QDSCs, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for CdTe/CdS and CdTe/CdSeS were enhanced by 22 and 35%, respectively. With the optimization of CdSeₓS₁₋ₓ shell thickness, a PCE of 7.24% under the illumination of one full sun was obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric potential difference 3alighting 3aporous media 3aquantum dots 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide 3awater solubility1 aZhong, Xinhua0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Oct. 25, v. 4, no. 42 p.16553-16561dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta07399a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006100138245011300199300001400312500002000326520179800346592002802144596002502172596002102197596004402218650002902262650002902291650002102320650000902341650001502350650001402365650001902379650001302398650001102411700002102422700002202443773013102465856007202596852000902668655001202677IND60681333920221122155135.0200115e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068133392DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.35412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLagarde, Raphaël1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9809-167310aDams select individual morphology but do not modify upstream migration speed of tropical amphidromous gobies  ap. 57-67.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFish locomotor performance depends on inter‐individual morphological differences and influences the response of populations to anthropogenic impacts. Amphidromous gobies, Sicyopterus lagocephalus and Cotylopus acutipinnis can climb up obstacles several metres high, after their arrival in rivers from the ocean. A previous study demonstrated that juveniles of S. lagocephalus performed better than C. acutipinnis when challenged with an artificial climbing ramp, and that individual morphology explained climbing performance for both species. This present study was focused on the effects of two 10‐m high dams on the individual morphological selection of these species. We hypothesized that, compared with C. acutipinnis, (a) S. lagocephalus juveniles will reach the dams faster after they arrive in freshwater and (b) their morphology will play a lesser role in their capacity to climb up the dams. Anatomical traits were measured for 186 and 201 S. lagocephalus and 179 and 221 C. acutipinnis captured downstream and upstream of the dams, respectively. The time they spent in freshwater was estimated by examining the microstructures of their otoliths. As expected, S. lagocephalus individuals reached the dams 10–20 days faster than C. acutipinnis, and their morphology upstream and downstream of the dams did not differ, in contrast to C. acutipinnis. Upstream of the dam, C. acutipinnis had a larger pelvic sucker than downstream, confirming experimental observations. It suggests that juveniles of the cosmopolitan S. lagocephalus have more efficient upstream migration capacities than the endemic C. acutipinnis. Moreover, differences in individual morphologies above and below barriers appear efficient for quantifying their impact on upstream migration of amphidromous species.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Social Fund  cRégion Réunion  cAgence Française pour la Biodiversité 3aSicyopterus lagocephalus 3aanthropogenic activities 3adams (hydrology) 3afish 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3amicrostructure 3aotoliths 3arivers1 aBorie, Guillaume1 aPonton, Dominique0 tRiver research and applications.g2020 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.57-67dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938474x1535-14597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.35413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009000163300001600253520157000269592002801839650001801867650001201885650002701897650002601924650001001950650001001960650001101970650001201981650001001993650001602003650002002019650001602039650002102055650001102076650001202087650001502099653004602114653001502160653001002175653001102185653002702196653001702223700002402240700001902264700002202283700002302305700002102328700001902349700001502368773011102383856008202494852000902576655001202585IND60541937220221116235011.0190401e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054193722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarp, Laura10aMineral oil in human tissues, Part I: Concentrations and molecular mass distributions  ap. 312-321.  aOf 37 subjects aged 25–91y (mean 67y), mineral oil hydrocarbons were measured in subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), spleen, liver and lung, for some of them also in kidney, heart and brain. No mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) were detected. The mean concentration of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) in the mesenteric lymph nodes was 223mg/kg, in liver 131mg/kg, in fat tissue 130mg/kg, in spleen 93mg/kg and in lung 12mg/kg. They were clearly lower in kidney, heart and brain. The maxima, found in MLN and spleen, were 1390 and 1400mg/kg, respectively. For a quarter of the subjects a total amount of MOSH in the body above 5g was calculated. The MOSH composition in the fat tissue and the MLN appeared virtually identical and varied little between the subjects. It was centered on the n-alkanes C23–C24, ranged from C16 to C35 and included hydrocarbons of plant origin. The MOSH in spleen and liver had almost the same composition for a given subject, but varied somewhat between subjects. They were centered between C25 and C27, ranged from C18 to beyond C45 and were without hydrocarbons of plant origin. Part of the MOSH seem to be strongly accumulated, resulting in far higher concentrations in human tissues related to exposure than observed in shorter term animal experiments. The composition of the accumulated MOSH does not support that Class I mineral oils, sometimes termed “food grade”, are less accumulated in the human body than Class II and III oils, which questions the present classification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aalkanes 3aanimal experimentation 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abrain 3aheart 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliver 3alymph nodes 3amineral content 3amineral oil 3amolecular weight 3aspleen 3atissues 3atoxicology 0aMineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) 0aFat tissue 0aLiver 0aSpleen 0aMesenteric lymph nodes 0aAccumulation1 aKornauth, Christoph1 aWuerger, Tanja1 aRudas, Margaretha1 aBiedermann, Maurus1 aReiner, Angelika1 aConcin, Nicole1 aGrob, Koni0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Oct., v. 72 p.312-321dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015700154300001600311520100000327592002801327650001501355650001601370650001401386650000901400650001701409650000901426650001901435650001801454650001301472650001101485700001901496700001301515700001301528700001801541773010501559856007501664852000901739655001201748IND60532713020171121000000.0160728e20120213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053271302DNAL7 a10.1021/bm201614y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Xiaolu10aFunctional Binary Micropattern of Hyperbranched Poly(ether amine) (hPEA-AN) Network and Poly(ether amine) (PEA) Brush for Recognition of Guest Molecules  ap. 535-541.  aA binary micropattern of anthracene-contained hyperbranched poly(ether amine) (hPEA-AN) network and poly(ether amine) (PEA) brush on gold surface was developed and explored. First, a micropatterned hPEA-AN network array on gold surface was fabricated by photolithography via photodimerization of anthracene moieties, and a PEA brush was subsequently immobilized on the remaining free gold surface areas by chemical adsorption of thiol groups. The patterned hPEA-AN network exhibits selectivity with respect to the adsorption of hydrophilic dyes: Methyl orange is strongly adsorbed, but rhodamine 6G is not, as indicated by the fluorescence response. The PEA brush domain exhibits excellent protein adsorption repellency, whereas the hPEA-AN network layer readily adsorbs protein. These characteristics make the binary hPEA-AN network and PEA brush array sensitive to different kinds of dyes and proteins, which open up pathways to potential applications as microsensors, biochips, and bioassays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanthracenes 3abioassays 3adyes 3afluorescence 3agold 3ahydrophilicity 3amethyl orange 3aproteins 3athiols1 aJiang, Xuesong1 aYu, Bing1 aYin, Jie1 aVana, Philipp0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Feb. 13, v. 13, no. 2 p.535-541dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm201614y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010600172300001600278500001900294520132400313592002801637650002401665650002001689650001801709650001201727650002501739650001601764650001601780650001701796650000901813650001401822650001101836650001501847650001901862650002101881650002301902650001001925650001801935651001001953653001601963653002101979653002802000653002702028700001902055700001902074700001702093773013902110856008502249852000902334655001202343IND60708443320221118073912.0200826e20200823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070844332DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2020.17190312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Khatib, A.

The findings may be useful for future surveillance as preliminary reference values for levels of heavy metals in urban and industrial settings. The levels of cadmium, lead and Cupper in plant leaf were determined. The results showed that heavy metals could inhibit the growth of plants including LA and SLA. The water content (WC) and photosynthetic pigments of Eucalyptus and Ficus decreased with the increased concentration of metals. Contrary to chlorophylls (a) and (b), carotenoids and chlorophyll ratio (a/b) showed a significant increase with increasing metals concentration especially that of Cd and Cu. Proline content was relatively increased and soluble carbohydrate content decreased in plants with high metal accumulation. Eucalyptus showed better tolerance capacity for Cd, Pb and Cu when compared to Ficus. The ability of Eucalyptus to accumulate and tolerate metal stress makes this species a good candidate to recuperate heavy metals-contaminated conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aFicus benjamina 3aair pollution 3acadmium 3acarbohydrate content 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3aspecific leaf area 3atrees 3awater content 3aEgypt 0aHeavy metal 0ahyperaccumulator 0aleaf surface morphology 0aphysiological response1 aYoussef, N.

The experimental results indicated that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of N-Mt(the organo-montmorillonite that the amount of modifier was 1.0 CEC) for ATE and ACE was 93.47 mg/g and 84.55 mg/g, respectively, which was more than twice that of raw montmorillonite for two pollutants, the adsorption was better fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir isotherms model, and the adsorption was the spontaneous and exothermic process. Moreover, combining with the Zeta potential values of N-Mt, and with the help of Multiwfn wave function program based on density functional theory (DFT), the electrostatic interaction and the hydrophobic partitioning between N-Mt and two pollutant molecules were verified, p-π/π interaction between NQAS16-3 and ATE (or ACE) may be contributed to the increasing adsorption capacity of N-Mt for two β-blocker pollutants. The work provided novel organomontmorillonite for the removal of non-degradable β-blocker pollutants and the insight of the adsorption mechanism from the atomic level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acationic surfactants 3achlorides 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aheat production 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3apollutants 3azeta potential 0aAdsorption 0aOrgano-montmorillonite 0aMultiwfn 0aβ-blocker pollutants 0aMechanism1 aMa, Jianzhe1 aShi, Mingxing1 aXia, Mingzhu1 aWang, Fengyun1 aFu, Chenlu0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 May 15, v. 590 p.601-613dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.01.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007100151245010500222520138000327592002801707650002601735650001101761650001001772650002101782650001101803653004201814653004301856653001901899653001901918700005701937700005601994700006202050773011302112856008602225852000902311655001202320IND60752554520221120024856.0211030e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075255452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1291402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirshekarlou, Babak Rahmani1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0124-002810aDevelopment of a knowledge-based tool for waste management of prefabricated steel structure projects  aAlthough the construction industry is critical for sustainability goals due to the high amount of waste it generates, its waste management performance is still not at the desired level. One of the main reasons for this can be attributed to the lack of enough knowledge of construction companies on the sources/reasons of waste and amount of waste. The major aim of this study was to develop a knowledge-based tool for capturing, storing, and disseminating waste-related knowledge for prefabricated steel construction projects. The developed tool can be used for waste estimation, monitoring, and minimization of all materials used during different phases of prefabricated steel structure projects based on the data captured from current and previous projects. One advantage of the tool is the integration of all processes of waste management, which have been usually considered independently in previous studies. Moreover, being a knowledge-based tool, it can increase awareness and learning ability of companies about waste and its management. Finally, although the process model of the tool is generic and can operate in alternative domains, the tool is applicable for only prefabricated steel projects. It is believed that the process model and the tool presented in this paper can be further customized for different project types and considering different company needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstruction industry 3amodels 3asteel 3awaste management 3awastes 0aKnowledge-based waste management tool 0aPrefabricated steel structure projects 0aMaterial waste 0aWeb-based tool1 aBudayan, Cenk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8433-28241 aDikmen, Irem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6988-75571 aBirgonul, M.

Owing to the existence of uncertainties in flood control operation, various degrees of risk can be shown in flood control operation systems. Examining these uncertainties and the resulting risk of failure in multireservoir operation systems is extremely beneficial and indispensable for basin flood mitigation. In this study, different stochastic simulation methods were employed to generate streamflow series at multiple stations and other uncertainties such as the flood forecast errors, discharge capacity, and reservoir storage. Then, the Monte Carlo framework was established based on the simulation sequence to estimate the risk of a failure of each flood control unit in the flood control system. Furthermore, a comprehensive risk assessment indicator was proposed to consider the failure probability and failure consequences at the same time. The Xiluodu‐Xiangjiaba‐Three Gorges cascade reservoirs were selected as a case study. Results show that the applied probabilistic simulation methods could simulate various uncertainties in a multireservoir flood control system effectively, and the proposed risk analysis method could comprehensively evaluate the risks of reservoir overtopping, flood flows exceeding a standard, and flood diversion from the perspective of overall watershed security.  aPublisher supplied data  a52039004cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aU1865202cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abasins 3acase studies 3aflood control 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3astream flow 3awatersheds1 aZhou, Jianzhong1 aDai, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4470-07141 aHuang, Kangdi1 aZha, Gang0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 4 p.e12740-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.127403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010300164300001600267500000900283520138300292592002801675650001301703650002001716650001501736650000901751650002101760650001301781650001901794650001701813650001101830650001301841700002101854700002101875773021601896856008002112852000902192655001202201IND60666435120221122222653.0191028e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066643512DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2013.03.00772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingying,10aTreatment of Dissolved Perchlorate, Nitrate, and Sulfate Using Zero-Valent Iron and Organic Carbon  ap. 842-850.  aepub  aWaters containing ClO₄⁻ and dissolved NO₃⁻, derived from detonated explosives and solid propellants, often also contain elevated concentrations of other dissolved constituents, including SO₄²⁻. Four column experiments, containing mixtures of silica sand, zero-valent Fe (ZVI) and organic C (OC) were conducted to evaluate the potential for simultaneous removal of NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻ and ClO₄⁻. Initially, the flow rate was maintained at 0.5 pore volumes (PV) d⁻¹ and then decreased to 0.1 PV d⁻¹ after 100 PV of flow. Nitrate concentrations decreased from 10.8 mg L⁻¹ (NO₃–N) to trace levels through NO₃⁻ reduction to NH₄⁺ using ZVI alone and through denitrification using OC. Observations from the mixture of ZVI and OC suggest a combination of NO₃⁻ reduction and denitrification. Up to 71% of input SO₄²⁻ (24.5 ± 3.5 mg L⁻¹) was removed in the column containing OC, and >99.7% of the input ClO₄⁻ (857 ± 63 μg L⁻¹) was removed by the OC- and (ZVI + OC)-containing columns as the flow rate was maintained at 0.1 PV d⁻¹.

As one of the oldest known edible fruit tree species, the codon usage pattern analysis of pomegranate CYP superfamily is a good genetic tool to understand its evolutionary and genetic mechanisms. In this study, a total of 83 CYP homologous genes were isolated from a pomegranate transcriptome employing Illumine RNA-seq technology. Meanwhile, the codon composition and usage bias of CYP genes for pomegranate were analyzed to investigate codon usage patterns and factors affecting codon usage. The effective number of codons (ENC) varies from 37.41 to 58.73, with a mean value of 50.45 and a standard deviation (SD) of 5.62, revealing that there is only a weak codon bias. An ENC-GC3 scatter diagram indicates that conditional mutation might be a factor in determining the codon bias, but there still exist some others. Significantly positive correlation (r=0.941, P<0.001) of GC was observed with GC3, which may be due to the effect of compositional constraint arising from mutation pressure. Neutrality plot elucidates that natural selection together with some other minor factors play a dominate role in affecting codons usage patterns of pomegranate CYP genes. Moreover, the 19 most frequently used codons were observed and all of them ended by G and C, which enables to shed some light on enhancing the heterologous genes expression of CYP in Punica granatum L. through codon optimization. 3aPunica granatum 3acodon usage 3acytochrome P-450 3aedible fruits 3afruit trees 3agene expression 3agrowth and development 3amutation 3anatural selection 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3apomegranates 3asequence analysis 3astandard deviation 3atranscriptome1 aZhang, T.

Haenlein and M.H. Fahmy. Proceedings of the special symposium in conjunction with the 8th World Conference on Animal Production, June 28-July 4, 1998, Seoul, South Korea.  aFor more than half a century, Heifer Project International (HPI), a charitable organization headquartered in Little Rock, AR, has been providing livestock and training in animal husbandry and sustainable agriculture to developing areas throughout the world. Since 1944, more than four million families have been assisted. More than 20 different kinds of food- and income-producing animals have been provided for communities and families in over 110 countries worldwide. Annually, HPI has projects in approximately 40 countries. Intensive training in animal husbandry, environmentally sound animal agriculture practices and community development are all part of HPI's has program. HPI has had a long history with using small ruminants, from sheep and goats to llamas and alpacas, around the world. Small ruminants are of a most convenient size and prolificacy for the small holders that HPI typically partners with, and they are among the most diverse and multipurpose of all livestock species. In Asia, HPI uses small ruminants in development programs in the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia. All of these programs are with limited resource families living in marginal, rural conditions. The programs are geared toward increasing peoples' income and nutritional status, while enhancing their dignity and benefitting the ecology. 3agoats 3asheep 3aanimal production 3agoat breeds 3acommunity development 3abreed differences 3aAsia 0alivestock numbers 0avoluntary services1 aChandra, B.1 aPu, J.B.1 aLohani, M.1 aSuknaphasawat, N.1 aXu, G.0 tSmall ruminant research.g1999 Nov., v. 34, no. 3 p.247-257x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle03909naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245008400196300001600280500002400296506007600320520191400396506003702310650002602347650001702373650002502390650001002415650002302425650001202448650001802460650001002478650001102488650002602499650001102525650001302536650001002549650001102559650001702570650002302587650002202610650001202632650001602644650001402660650002002674650001702694650002502711650001702736650003002753650004202783650003602825650002202861650002202883700001602905700001802921700001602939700001502955700001902970700002002989700001603009773009903025852000903124856007803133655001203211IND4436281120221207140716.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443628112DNAL7 a202993452pmid7 aPMC28599082pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcq0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaves, M.M.10aGrapevine under deficit irrigation: hints from physiological and molecular data  ap. 661-676.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: A large proportion of vineyards are located in regions with seasonal drought (e.g. Mediterranean-type climates) where soil and atmospheric water deficits, together with high temperatures, exert large constraints on yield and quality. The increasing demand for vineyard irrigation requires an improvement in the efficiency of water use. Deficit irrigation has emerged as a potential strategy to allow crops to withstand mild water stress with little or no decreases of yield, and potentially a positive impact on fruit quality. Understanding the physiological and molecular bases of grapevine responses to mild to moderate water deficits is fundamental to optimize deficit irrigation management and identify the most suitable varieties to those conditions. SCOPE: How the whole plant acclimatizes to water scarcity and how short- and long-distance chemical and hydraulic signals intervene are reviewed. Chemical compounds synthesized in drying roots are shown to act as long-distance signals inducing leaf stomatal closure and/or restricting leaf growth. This explains why some plants endure soil drying without significant changes in shoot water status. The control of plant water potential by stomatal aperture via feed-forward mechanisms is associated with 'isohydric' behaviour in contrast to 'anysohydric' behaviour in which lower plant water potentials are attained. This review discusses differences in this respect between grapevines varieties and experimental conditions. Mild water deficits also exert direct and/or indirect (via the light environment around grape clusters) effects on berry development and composition; a higher content of skin-based constituents (e.g. tannins and anthocyanins) has generally being reported. Regulation under water deficit of genes and proteins of the various metabolic pathways responsible for berry composition and therefore wine quality are reviewed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMediterranean climate 3aanthocyanins 3abiochemical pathways 3acrops 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought 3afruit quality 3agenes 3agrapes 3airrigation management 3aleaves 3aproteins 3aroots 3ashoots 3asmall fruits 3asoil water deficit 3astomatal movement 3atannins 3atemperature 3avineyards 3awater potential 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 3awine quality 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aVitisxmetabolism 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aZarrouk, O.1 aFrancisco, R.1 aCosta, J.M.1 aSantos, T.1 aRegalado, A.P.1 aRodrigues, M.L.1 aLopes, C.M.0 tAnnals of botany.g2010 May, v. 105, no. 5 p.661-676dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq0303Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02697naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002200129245008600151300001600237520095500253650000801208650001201216650002501228650001501253650001801268650001301286650001301299650000901312650001901321650001901340650001701359650001501376650001201391650001601403650003101419650002401450650001601474650002501490650002101515650004201536650002201578650002201600650001301622650001901635650001001654650002401664651001101688651001101699651001801710651001801728653002801746653004001774700002501814700001801839700001501857700001701872773008001889852000901969930003301978945001302011946001102024655001202035IND2334124220221118083523.0030917e200307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233412422DNAL7 a126180502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamirez-Lopez, E.10aCharacterization of five agricultural by-products as potential biofilter carriers  ap. 259-263.  aBiofiltration is the most commonly used biological gas treatment technology and is extensively used for the treatment of polluted air with gas flow rates of up to 2 x 10(5) m3/h. It involves a filter bed of organic matter serving both as carrier for microorganisms and as nutrient supplier. Polluted gas passes through the filter bed and is cleaned by biological activity. Biofiltration is not being developed in Latin America as in the USA, Canada or Europe; the main reason probably being the absence of specific technology and of potential organic carriers locally available. Five different agriculture by-products available in Latin America: peanut shells, rice husk, coconut shells, cane bagasse and maize stubble, were chemically, physically and structurally characterized for their potential use as biofilter carrier. It was found that peanut shells could be used as biofilter carrier and therefore would have potential biological application. 3aair 3abagasse 3abioactive properties 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3acleaning 3acoconuts 3acorn 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3apeanut hulls 3arice hulls 3astubble 2aAgriculture 2aAir Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aArachisxchemistry. 2aBioreactors 2aCellulosexchemistry 2aCocosxchemistry 2aFiltrationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aPressure 2aWaste Products 2aWater 2aZea maysxchemistry 3aCanada 3aEurope 3aLatin America 3aUnited States 0aagricultural byproducts 0abiological gas treatment technology1 aCorona-Hernandez, J.1 aDendooven, L.1 aRangel, P.1 aThalasso, F.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 July, v. 88, no. 3 p.259-263x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02085naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245007900144300001600223520098000239650001301219650000901232650001401241650002701255650001301282650002101295650002001316650001801336650001001354650003401364650002301398650001801421650001301439650003101452650002001483700001401503773008001517852000901597930003301606945001301639946001101652655001201663IND2334123720221118083555.0030917e200307  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233412372DNAL7 a126180462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeytin, S.10aInfluences of composted hazelnut husk on some physical properties of soils  ap. 241-244.  aSome physical properties of clay loam and sandy loam soils amended with hazelnut husk (HH) were investigated.

Before use the composted material obtained was separated to three different aggregate sizes, smaller than 0.84 mm, 0.84-2.38 mm and bigger than 2.38 mm. Then these fractions were mixed with soil samples, at 0%, 1%, 2%, 4% and 8% by weight. Huzelnut husk compost-soil mixtures were placed to plastic pots and kept in an incubator at 25 +/- 5 degrees C for 45 and 90 days. At the end of incubation periods, water stable aggregate (WSA), hydraulic conductivity, total porosity, aeration porosity and macro- and micro-pore percentages of the mixtures were determined. Results obtained showed that composted HH increased the WSA, hydraulic conductivity, total porosity and macro-pore percentage in both clay loam and sandy loam soils depending on the incubation time and aggregate sizes. 3aaeration 3aclay 3ahazelnuts 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aporosity 3asandy loam soils 3asoil amendments 3asoil sampling 3atrees 2aAluminum Silicatesxchemistry 2aCorylusxchemistry 2aParticle Size 2aPorosity 2aSilicon Dioxidexchemistry 2aSoilxanalysis.1 aBaran, A.0 tBioresource technology.g2003 July, v. 88, no. 3 p.241-244x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20031103b20031113c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02015naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002000146245009300166300001800259520090500277650002201182650002501204650001201229650002701241650002501268650002601293650002901319650002401348650001601372650001701388650001901405651001001424700002201434773008301456852000901539930003301548945002501581946001101606655001201617IND4368214520221118083516.0050406e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436821452DNAL7 a156839122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSachindra, N.M.10aProcess optimization for extraction of carotenoids from shrimp waste with vegetable oils  ap. 1195-1200.  aShrimp waste is an important source of natural carotenoid. Studies were carried out to determine the extraction yield of shrimp waste carotenoids in different vegetable oils. Highest yield was obtained by extraction using refined sunflower oil compared to groundnut oil, gingelly oil, mustard oil, soy oil, coconut oil and rice bran oil. The extraction yield of carotenoids in sunflower oil was significantly influenced by level of oil to waste (p < 0.05), time (p < 0.01) and temperature (p < 0.001) of heating waste with oil before centrifugation to separate pigmented oil. A regression equation was derived for carotenoid yield as a function of time of heating, temperature of heating and oil level to waste. The optimized conditions for extraction of shrimp waste carotenoids in sunflower oil were determined to be oil level to waste of 2, temperature of 70 degrees C and heating time of 150 min. 3awaste utilization 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCarotenoidsxchemistry 2aPenaeidaexchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aRegression Analysis 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Products 0aIndia1 aMahendrakar, N.S.0 tBioresource technology.g2005 July, v. 96, no. 10 p.1195-1200x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20050816b00000000c00000000  aINDdGHKe2005/04/26  aNon-US 7aarticle04471naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245022500182300001800407520198900425650001602414650001302430650001302443650001702456650002002473650001102493650001202504650001502516650001602531650001002547650002602557650001602583650001502599650000902614650001102623650000902634650001302643650002702656650001202683650002102695650001602716650001202732650002902744650001402773650001902787650002002806650003702826650003202863650002702895650004002922650002702962650003702989650002003026650003403046650002903080650005303109650001703162651001003179651001803189651001003207653002103217653003603238653001603274653006203290700001903352700001803371700001803389773013603407852000903543856006903552930003303621946001103654655001203665IND4387768120221118084440.0070211e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438776812DNAL7 a172008572pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-1036-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoos, Robert 10aPolar herbicides, pharmaceutical products, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and nonylphenol and its carboxylates and ethoxylates in surface and tap waters around Lake Maggiore in Northern Italy  ap. 1469-1478.  aA survey of contamination of surface and drinking waters around Lake Maggiore in Northern Italy with polar anthropogenic environmental pollutants has been conducted. The target analytes were polar herbicides, pharmaceuticals (including antibiotics), steroid estrogens, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (including perfluorooctanoate PFOA), nonylphenol and its carboxylates and ethoxylates (NPEO surfactants), and triclosan, a bactericide used in personal-care products. Analysis of water samples was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) then liquid chromatography-triple-quadrupole (tandem) mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). By extraction of 1-L water samples and concentration of the extract to 100 μL, method detection limits (MDLs) as low as 0.05-0.1 ng L-¹ were achieved for most compounds. Lake-water samples from seven different locations in the Southern part of Lake Maggiore and eleven samples from different tributary rivers and creeks were investigated. Rain water was also analyzed to investigate atmospheric input of the contaminants. Compounds regularly detected at very low concentrations in the lake water included: caffeine (max. concentration 124 ng L-¹), the herbicides terbutylazine (7 ng L-¹), atrazine (5 ng L-¹), simazine (16 ng L-¹), diuron (11 ng L-¹), and atrazine-desethyl (11 ng L-¹), the pharmaceuticals carbamazepine (9 ng L-¹), sulfamethoxazole (10 ng L-¹), gemfibrozil (1.7 ng L-¹), and benzafibrate (1.2 ng L-¹), the surfactant metabolite nonylphenol (15 ng L-¹), its carboxylates (NPE₁C 120 ng L-¹, NPE₂C 7 ng L-¹, NPE₃C 15 ng L-¹) and ethoxylates (NPE n Os, n = 3-17; 300 ng L-¹), perfluorinated surfactants (PFOS 9 ng L-¹, PFOA 3 ng L-¹), and estrone (0.4 ng L-¹). Levels of these compounds in drinking water produced from Lake Maggiore were almost identical with those found in the lake itself, revealing the poor performance of sand filtration and chlorination applied by the local waterworks. 3aantibiotics 3aatrazine 3acaffeine 3achlorination 3adetection limit 3adiuron 3aestrone 3afiltration 3agemfibrozil 3alakes 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3apollutants 3arain 3arivers 3asand 3asimazine 3asolid phase extraction 3astreams 3asulfamethoxazole 3asurfactants 3asurveys 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atap water 3awater analysis 3awater utilities 2aCaprylatesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aCarboxylic Acidsxchemistry 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aFluorocarbonsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIonsxchemistry 2aPhenolsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Supply 3aItaly 3aLake Maggiore 0aItaly 0aPolar herbicides 0aPerfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) 0aNonylphenol 0aLiquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS)1 aWollgast, Jan 1 aHuber, Tania 1 aHanke, Georg 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Feb., v. 387, no. 4 p.1469-1478dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-1036-73electronic resource  a20070211b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03265naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245016000167300001600327500002400343520180700367650001102174650001602185650002002201650002802221650002602249650002002275650005202295650000902347650002602356653003202382653003002414653003502444653004402479700001702523700001802540700001302558700001602571700002002587700001802607700001802625773010702643852000902750856004802759655001202807IND4402206720221118084321.0080302e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440220672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-005-0091-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Guang-Huai10aTestifying the rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa5 by genetic complementation and further analyzing xa5 (Xa5) in comparison with its homolog TFIIAγ1  ap. 354-366.  aIncludes references  aThe recessive gene xa5 for resistance to bacterial blight resistance of rice is located on chromosome 5, and evidence based on genetic recombination has been shown to encode a small subunit of the basal transcription factor IIA (Iyer and McCouch in MPMI 17(12):1348-1354, 2004). However, xa5 has not been demonstrated by a complementation test. In this study, we introduced the dominant allele Xa5 into a homozygous xa5-line, which was developed from a cross between IRBB5 (an indica variety with xa5) and Nipponbare (a japonica variety with Xa5). Transformation of Xa5 and subsequent segregation analysis confirmed that xa5 is a V39E substitution variant of the gene for TFIIAγ on chromosome 5 (TFIIAγ5 or Xa5). The rice has an addition gene for TFIIAγ exists on chromosome 1 (TFIIAγ1). Analysis of the expression patterns of Xa5 (TFIIAγ5)/xa5 and TFIIAγ1 revealed that both the genes are constitutively expressed in different rice organs. However, no expression of TFIIAγ1 could be detected in the panicle by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. To compare the structural difference between the Xa5/xa5 and TFIIAγ1 proteins, 3-D structures were predicted using computer-aided modeling techniques. The modeled structures of Xa5 (xa5) and TFIIAγ1 fit well with the structure of TFIIA small subunit from human, suggesting that they may all act as a small subunit of TFIIA. The E39V substitution in the xa5 protein occurs in the α-helix domain, a supposed conservative substitutable site, which should not affect the basal transcription function of TFIIAγ. The structural analysis indicates that xa5 and Xa5 potentially retain their basic transcription factor function, which, in turn, may mediate the novel pathway for bacterial blight resistance and susceptibility, respectively. 3ablight 3achromosomes 3agene expression 3agenetic complementation 3agenetic recombination 3arecessive genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3atranscription factors 0aBacterial blight resistance 0aRecessive resistance gene 0aBasal transcription factor IIA 0aGene duplication rice (Oryza sativa L.)1 aXia, Zhi-Hui1 aZhou, Yong-Li1 aWan, Jia1 aLi, Da-Yong1 aChen, Run-Sheng1 aZhai, Wen-Xue1 aZhu, Li-Huang0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2006 Apr., v. 275, no. 4 p.354-366dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-005-0091-7 7aarticle02833naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008700168300001400255500002400269500001500293520157400308650001301882650001601895650001501911650001601926650001801942650001401960650003001974650000902004650003302013650001802046650002402064650001302088650001002101650001402111653001402125700001602139700002002155700001602175700002102191773010602212852000902318856004802327655001202375IND4432143920221118084210.0100129e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443214392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-009-0209-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShishido, Masahiro10aPCR-based assays to detect and quantify Phomopsis sclerotioides in plants and soil  ap. 21-30.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to detect and quantify Phomopsis sclerotioides, the causal agent of black root rot of cucurbits. We used internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from representative isolates to search for target sequences. Primer pairs were selected after testing against 40 fungal isolates including 13 Ph. sclerotioides isolates, 9 Phomopsis isolates other than Ph. sclerotioides, and 18 soilborne fungi that were either pathogenic or nonpathogenic to cucurbits. Conventional PCR assays with the primer pair of CPs-1 (forward) and CPs-2 (reverse) produced target DNA amplicons from all Ph. sclerotioides isolates but none of the other isolates tested. From soil and root samples collected from fields naturally infested with black root rot of cucumber and melon, the CPs-1/CPs-2 primer pair successfully amplified target DNA fragments in conventional PCR assays. Moreover, we applied the CPs-1/CPs-2 primer pair in a real-time PCR assay with SYBR Green I, and PCR-amplified products were successfully quantified by reference to a standard curve generated by adding known amounts of target DNA. Target Ph. sclerotioides DNA fragments were similarly detected in artificially inoculated roots of cucumber, melon, pumpkin, and watermelon, but quantities of Ph. sclerotioides DNA in their hypocotyls of the hosts varied as follows: melon ≥ cucumber ≥ watermelon > pumpkin. These results suggest that Ph. sclerotioides infection is not species-specific but the rate of infection may differ among host species. 3apumpkins 3awatermelons 3ahypocotyls 3aDNA primers 3aribosomal DNA 3acucumbers 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3asoil sampling 3areference standards 3aroot rot 3aroots 3aDiaporthe 0aPhomopsis1 aSato, Kyoko1 aYoshida, Nanako1 aTsukui, Rie1 aUsami, Toshiyuki0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2010 Feb., v. 76, no. 1 p.21-30dSpringer Japanx1345-26307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-009-0209-6 7aarticle02206naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012800128300001600256520106000272650001001332650001401342650001801356650002001374650002201394650002601416650002201442650001401464650001101478650002401489653001501513700001401528700002101542700001801563700002201581700001601603700001801619773008101637852000901718930003301727945001301760946001101773655001201784IND2328884020221118084130.0020911e200111  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232888402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatalha, E.S.10aPlasma profile of pregnancy associated glycoprotein (PAG) in pregnant Alpine goats using two radioimmunoassay (RIA) systems  ap. 111-118.  aThis paper evaluates the profiles obtained for caprine pregnancy associated glycoprotein (cPAG) in pregnant multiparous and nulliparous goats using the heterologous-radioimmunoassay (htPAG-RIA) and the homologous-RIA (hmPAG-RIA) systems during the pregnancy and postpartum periods. The results show that the cPAG concentrations detected through the hmPAG-RIA procedure were lower than those found through the htPAG-RIA method. No statistical differences were observed due to the maternal reproductive status (nulliparous or multiparous goats) during pregnancy using either one of the methods. However, pregnant and cyclic goats were distinguished from each other by cPAG concentrations verified through the hmPAG-RIA procedure. The lower cPAG concentrations detected through this method suggest that this system is more specific than the htPAG-RIA procedure to measure cPAG during pregnancy and postpartum period in goats. The homologous system was also an efficient method to predict pregnancies of only 35 days in both nulliparous and multiparous goats. 3agoats 3apregnancy 3aglycoproteins 3ablood chemistry 3aradioimmunoassays 3aquantitative analysis 3apostpartum period 3adetection 3aestrus 3apregnancy diagnosis 0aevaluation1 aSulon, J.1 aFigueiredo, J.R.1 aBeckers, J.F.1 aEspeschit, C.J.B.1 aMartins, R.1 aSilva, L.D.M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2001 Nov., v. 42, no. 2 p.111-118x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02700naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245010600172300001600278500002400294520151500318650002601833650001901859650002001878650001301898650001901911650001801930650001401948650001001962650001001972700002101982700002002003700002302023700002202046700002202068700001902090700002402109773009602133852000902229856005202238655001202290IND4463143120221118083544.0120504e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446314312DNAL7 a10.1016/S0929-1393(03)00024-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrocker, Tracey L.10aSubstituting root numbers for length: improving the use of minirhizotrons to study fine root dynamics  ap. 127-135.  aIncludes references  aMinirhizotrons provide a unique way to repeatedly measure the production and fate of individual root segments, while minimizing soil disturbance and the confounding of spatial-temporal variation. However, the time associated with processing videotaped minirhizotron images limits the amount of data that can be extracted in a reasonable amount of time. We found that this limitation can be minimized using a more easily measured variable r (i.e. root numbers) as a substitute of root length. Linear regression models were fitted between root length versus root number for production and mortality of seven sample datasets of varying tree species and treatments. The resulting r2 values ranged from 0.79 to 0.99, suggesting that changes in root numbers can be used to predict root length dynamics reliably. Slope values, representing the mean root segment length (MRSL), ranged from 2.34 to 8.38 mm per root segment for both production and mortality. Most treatments did not alter MRSL substantially, the exceptions being CO2 treatments and a girdling treatment that altered plant community composition and, consequently, root morphology. The high r2 values demonstrated a robust relationship between variables irrespective of species or treatments. Once the quantitative relationship between root lengths and numbers has been established for a particular species–treatment combination, quantifying changes in root number through time should substantially decrease the time required to quantify root dynamics. 3abotanical composition 3acarbon dioxide 3adisturbed soils 3agirdling 3aimage analysis 3alinear models 3amortality 3aroots 3atrees1 aHendrick, Ron L.1 aRuess, Roger W.1 aPregitzer, Kurt S.1 aBurton, Andrew J.1 aAllen, Michael F.1 aShan, Jianping1 aMorris, Lawrence A.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2003 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.127-135dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0929-1393(03)00024-6 7aarticle03022naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245016100197300001600358500002400374520141800398650001501816650002001831650001201851650001501863650001501878650001001893650001401903650001901917650001301936650003601949650005701985650005902042650003802101650004102139650004202180650003602222650002002258650002202278650001302300651001102313700002102324700001902345773010002364852000902464856005502473655001202528IND4457956520221118083540.0110513e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445795652DNAL7 a217141832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03652.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRejmánková, Eliška10aPatterns of activities of root phosphomonoesterase and phosphodiesterase in wetland plants as a function of macrophyte species and ambient phosphorus regime  ap. 968-976.  aIncludes references  a• Phosphorus (P)-limited plants produce higher amounts of root phosphatases, but research has mostly focused on phosphomonoesterases (PMEs). Because phosphate diesters can form a significant proportion of organic P in wetlands, we aimed to determine whether wetland plants produce both root PMEs and root phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and, if so, what factors influence activities of these enzymes. • We measured the activities of root PMEs and PDEs colorimetrically in a wide range of macrophytes from natural and P-enriched wetlands. Hydrolyzable P in sediments was analyzed using commercially available PMEs and PDEs. • In all species, both root PMEs and PDEs were always present, and their activities were closely correlated. Sedges and broadleaved emergents had the highest activity of both enzymes, while those of floating-leaved plants were the lowest. Redundancy analysis revealed close association between root enzymes and the proportion of monoesterase- and diesterase-hydrolyzable dissolved unreactive P. Both enzymes were positively correlated with root tissue N : P ratio. • Both plant and sediment traits were important when explaining differences in enzyme activities. Although the activities are related to ambient P regime, the relationship was not close enough to use root enzymes as reliable predictors of dissolved unreactive P that is hydrolyzed by sediment phosphomono- and diesterases. 3aCyperaceae 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aroots 3asediments 3awetland plants 3awetlands 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhosphoric Diester Hydrolasesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorusxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aWetlands 0aBelize1 aSirová, Dagmara1 aCarlson, Emily0 tnew phytologist.g2011 June, v. 190, no. 4 p.968-976dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03652.x 7aarticle02657naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014500126300001600271520151300287650001001800650001601810650002201826650002001848650001501868650001601883650001701899650001801916650002601934651001001960653002301970653001201993653001102005653001702016653001502033653002402048700001402072773008302086852000902169930003302178945001302211946001102224655001202235IND2332279920221118084512.0030429e200211  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233227992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisra, A.K.10aEffect of water deprivation on dry matter intake, nutrient utilization and metabolic water production in goats under semi-arid zone of India  ap. 159-165.  aEffect of water deprivation on dry matter (DM) intake, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention and metabolic water production was studied in bucks of Sirohi, Marwari and Kutchi breeds during August-September. Eighteen adult bucks (4-4.5 years of age), six each of the above-mentioned breeds were divided into three treatment groups in such a way that each group had two bucks of each breed. Water was made available ad libitum to group I, once daily at 15 h to group II and once after 48 h (alternate day) at 15 h to group III. Animals were offered 400 g per buck per day of a pelleted concentrate mixture in the morning and it was consumed by them within 15-20 minutes. Animals were then offered ad libitum pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) straw. The green grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) 1 kg per buck per day was provided after watering at 15.30 h. Refusals were recorded next morning at 8.30 h daily. The experiment continued for a period of 60 days following an adjustment period of one month. Dry matter intake (g kg W(-0.75) per day) was the lowest in group II (77.53) and the highest in group I (82.91). Total water intake (per kilogram DM intake) ranged from 2.331 per buck per day in group III to 2.771 per buck per day in group I. Water deprivation did not effect (P > 0.05) DM intake, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen retention and metabolic water production. The study showed that water deprivation up to 48 h does not adversely affect feed intake and nutrient digestibility in non-producing adult goats. 3agoats 3afeed intake 3awater deprivation 3anutrient uptake 3ametabolism 3agoat breeds 3afeed rations 3adigestibility 3anutrient availability 3aIndia 0anitrogen retention 0amarwari 0asirohi 0awater intake 0adry matter 0akutchi (goat breed)1 aSingh, K.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2002 Nov., v. 46, no. 2/3 p.159-165x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03506naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006700128300001600195500001500211520234500226650001202571650002502583650002702608650001002635650001202645650002402657650001902681650001602700650001402716650001702730651001002747653001702757653000902774653001902783653001302802653002502815700002302840700001702863700001902880773008302899852000902982930003302991945001303024946001103037655001203048IND2332280820221118083700.0030429e200211  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233228082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarai, I.F.M.10aReproductive doe traits of the Nubian (Zaraibi) goats in Egypt  ap. 201-205.  a2019-12-05  aNubian does from the hot arid climate of upper Egypt were evaluated for productive and reproductive traits under Nile Delta (lower Egypt) conditions. The mean values for age at first kidding, abortion rate, and mortality rate were 691 days, 1.4 and 26.8%, respectively. Corresponding values for litter size at birth and weaning were 2.9 and 2.3 kids, respectively, and for litter weight at birth and weaning were 4.9 and 25.3 kg, respectively. The lifetime production per doe for kid weight at birth and weaning were 19.8 and 83.7 kg, respectively. Does kidding in November-December surpassed (P < 0.05) those in February-March for age at first kidding, kidding interval, abortion rate and kilogram kids produced at weaning/doe lifetime, while those of February-March births surpassed those of November-December in kilogram kids produced at birth/doe lifetime (P < 0.05). Effects of time of birth were significant for the age at first kidding, kidding interval and kilogram kids produced at birth and at weaning/doe lifetime, as well as abortion rate and litter size at birth. Age at first kidding (P < 0.05), kidding interval, abortion and mortality rates were lowest for dams born as single, while kilogram kids produced at birth (P < 0.05) and at weaning/doe lifetime were highest. Effects of type of birth were significant for the age at first kidding and for kilogram kids produced at birth/doe lifetime. In general, abortion and mortality rates in dams, litter size and weight values at birth and at weaning, kilogram kids produced at birth and at weaning/doe lifetime increased with parity. Effects of parity were significant for abortion rate, mortality rate, litter size at weaning, litter weights at birth and at weaning and kilogram kids produced at birth and at weaning/doe lifetime and litter size at birth. The effect of sex of the kids was significant on kilogram kids produced at weaning/doe lifetime and litter weight at weaning. Effects of year of birth were significant for age at first kidding, abortion rate, mortality rate, litter size at weaning, litter weights at birth and at weaning and kilogram kids produced at birth and at weaning/doe lifetime and litter size at birth. The present study shows that conditions at the Nile are favourable for raising Nubian goats due to increased potential for reproductive rate. 3afemales 3aparturition interval 3ageographical variation 3agoats 3aweaning 3asexual reproduction 3aweaning weight 3alitter size 3amortality 3abirth weight 3aEgypt 0areproduction 0akids 0akidding season 0aabortion 0aage at first kidding1 aAbou-Fandoud, E.I.1 aDaader, A.H.1 aAbu-Ella, A.A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2002 Nov., v. 46, no. 2/3 p.201-205x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02329naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008200126300001600208500001500224520118700239650001801426650001701444650002001461650002601481650001601507650000901523650002001532650001601552650001601568650001801584650001601602653001601618653000901634653001501643700002001658700001801678700001601696700002201712773008301734852000901817930003301826945001301859946001101872655001201883IND2332280420221118083706.0030429e200211  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233228042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBueno, M.S.10aEffect of replacing corn with dehydrated citrus pulp in diets of growing kids  ap. 179-185.  a2019-12-05  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effect of replacing corn with dehydrated citrus pulp (DCP) on the performance of growing kids and apparent digestibility of their diets. Thirty-two Saanen kids (16 intact males and 16 females) were placed in individual pens and fed grass hay (42%) plus concentrate mixture (58%) with four levels of replacement of corn by DCP (0, 33, 66, 100%) during 60 days. Daily live-weight gain, dry matter intake, and feed conversion were evaluated. After this period, male kids (n = 16) were transferred to metabolic cages and apparent digestibility was evaluated. Daily gain, feed intake, feed conversion and the apparent dry matter digestibility coefficient showed a quadratic effect (P < 0.05) with the increasing levels of replacement. Crude fiber, NDF, ADF and ether extract digestibility showed a linear increase (P < 0.01) and the digestibility of other organic nutrients were not modified (P > 0.05). Apparent digestibility of Ca, P differed among diets (P < 0.05) fitted in a quadratic model and showed a great decrease at the highest level of replacement. Replacing around 40% of corn by DCP can attain the best performance for growing kids. 3adietary fiber 3aconcentrates 3afeed conversion 3anutrient availability 3acitrus pulp 3acorn 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3aingredients 3adigestibility 3acrude fiber 0aperformance 0akids 0aevaluation1 aFerrari, E.

Up to now, however, there was no genetic evidence that supported the relationship between ethylene production, or perception, and sexual expression in this species. Here we demonstrate that the extreme male phenotype of the Vegetable Spaghetti (Veg) inbred line of C. pepo subspecies pepo is determined by a major gene that confers reduced ethylene sensitivity in plants. The production of female flowers in the Veg line is very delayed and reduced with respect to the contrasting Bolognese (Bog) line, ranging between 5 and 35% of female flowers per plant. This enhanced maleness trait segregates as a single gene in the F₂ and backcross (BC) generations, and co-segregates with a weak ethylene-insensitive phenotype in the F₂ population, suggesting that the gene responsible for the Veg phenotype could be the result of a mutation in a receptor or response gene for ethylene. Although the etiolated seedlings of the Veg line, and the most androecious plants in the F₂ generation, produce more ethylene than those of the contrasting line, they are less sensitive to this hormone, as indicated by a weaker triple response and a delayed abscission of ethylene-treated male flowers. Given that the sexual phenotype of F₂ plants is correlated with ethylene sensitivity, with the more sensitive plants producing the higher number of female flowers, our results demonstrate that the ethylene response is directly involved in the control of sex determination in C. pepo. It regulates the induction of female flower production, and therefore the extension of the initial phase of development in which the plant produces only male flowers, as well as the number of female flowers per plant. 3aCucurbita pepo 3aabscission 3abackcrossing 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aetiolation 3afemale flowers 3ainbred lines 3amajor genes 3amale flowers 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aseedlings 3asex determination 3avegetables1 aMartinez, Cecilia.1 aDomínguez Condezo, Víctor.1 aAvalos, Eugenio1 aGarrido, Dolores1 aGómez, Pedro.1 aJamilena, Manuel0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2010 Mar., v. 29, no. 1 p.73-80dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-009-9116-5 7aarticle02308naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005600127300001400183500001500197520127500212650002801487650001101515650001001526650000901536650001301545650002001558650002701578650001401605650001601619650002101635650001601656650002601672653001601698653001901714700001601733773008301749852000901832930003301841945001301874946001101887655001201898IND2330326120221118080357.0030109e200203  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233032612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGujral, H.S.10aBack extrusion properties of wheat porridge (Dalia)  ap. 53-56.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of wheat grits and sugar concentrations and temperature on the rheological characteristics of wheat porridge were investigated using the back extrusion method. Wheat porridge (Dalia) was prepared with addition of grits at concentrations of 10%, 12.5% and 15% and sugar at levels of 0%, 6% and 12% in distilled water. The porridge was back extruded at temperatures of 20 degrees C, 40 degreed C and 60 degrees C. Plunger speeds varying from 100-2500 mm/min were used so that the porridge could be back extruded over a wide range of shear rates. The force displacement data were used to determine the consistency coefficient and flow behaviour index. The study revealed the non-Newtonian and pseudoplastic behaviour of wheat porridge. Wheat grits concentration had the most pronounced effect on the consistency followed by temperature and sugar concentration. Consistency coefficient increased with increasing grits and sugar concentration but decreased with increasing temperature. The consistency coefficient of the porridge samples varied from 5.9 to 241.6 Pa s(n) and the activation energy varied from 9.23 to 33.57 kJ/g mol. The porridge samples exhibited yield stress only at the highest grits concentration of 15% and lowest temperature of 20 degrees C. 3afood processing quality 3asugars 3awheat 3aflow 3avelocity 3afood processing 3arheological properties 3aextrusion 3aingredients 3afood composition 3atemperature 3agrits (particle size) 0aconsistency 0agrain products1 aSodhi, N.S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Mar., v. 52, no. 1 p.53-56x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01808naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245005400123300001400177500001500191520083900206650001101045650001801056650002501074650001401099650002001113650002001133650001901153650002101172650001901193653002201212653001001234653001601244700001301260773008301273852000901356930003301365945001301398946001101411655001201422IND2330326620221118080353.0030109e200203  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233032662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, J.10aDrying characteristics of irradiated apple slices  ap. 83-88.  a2019-12-05  aThe technology of drying by hot-air on fruit and vegetable is widely used in practice because of its convenience. However, it has some defects such as a low efficiency and the inferior quality of the dried products, which are the obstacles to its further application. This study focuses on improving the current technology and a new technology is introduced, that is, to dry bio-products by hot-air after they are pretreated by gamma irradiation. Experiments are made to study the influence of different irradiation dosages, air temperatures, slice thicknesses of apple on the dehydration rate and temperature of samples. A conclusion is reached that the three factors affect the dehydration rate and temperature of slice apple, and, the higher the dosage, the greater the rate of dehydration of apple, and the higher the temperature. 3aapples 3adose response 3ainternal temperature 3athickness 3aair temperature 3afood processing 3adrying quality 3afood irradiation 3aultrastructure 0ahot air treatment 0afruit 0atemperature1 aChao, Y.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Mar., v. 52, no. 1 p.83-88x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011900124300001600243520147500259650001401734650001401748650001601762650001601778650002101794650001301815650001901828653001401847700001701861773008401878852000901962930003301971945001302004946001102017655001202028IND2330324820221118075614.0030109e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233032482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTesch, S.10aInfluence of increasing viscosity of the aqueous phase on the short-term stability of protein stabilized emulsions  ap. 305-312.  aThe emulsification process includes two steps. First, deformation and disruption of droplets, and secondly, stabilization of the newly formed interfaces by surfactants. Emulsions are thermodynamically unstable, as droplets tend to coalesce. To avoid coalescence of droplets, different effects have to be taken into account. Hydrodynamic stabilization by slowing down the drainage of the liquid between two colliding droplets is one of these effects. The objective of this paper is to investigate the possibility of producing finely dispersed emulsions by increasing the viscosity of the continuous phase even using poor stabilizing surfactants. Experiments were carried out using proteins as surface active agents. To increase the viscosity of the continuous phase, stabilizers of different molecular weights were used in order to change the conditions for interactions between proteins, stabilizers and the emulsion droplets. The results are compared to those obtained with a model system containing surfactant and stabilizer of the same type of molecule (polyvinyl alcohol), realizing a system without additional interactions between stabilizer and surfactant. The results presented in this study have shown that by adding stabilizers not only a better stability of the emulsion is achieved: depending on the molecule structure of the stabilizer, also destabilizing effects such as inhibition of protein adsorption and isotropic/anisotropic phase separation may occur. 3aemulsions 3aviscosity 3astabilizers 3asurfactants 3amolecular weight 3aproteins 3afood additives 0astability1 aSchubert, H.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 May, v. 52, no. 3 p.305-312x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02447naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011200129300001400241520144000255650001601695650002001711650002301731650001801754650001601772650001501788650002001803650001401823650002101837650001101858650001301869650002401882700001801906773008301924852000902007930003302016945001302049946001102062655001202073IND2330325820221118075605.0030109e200203  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233032582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheridan, P.S.10aDetermination of the thermal diffusivity of ground beef patties under infrared radiation oven-shelf cooking  ap. 39-45.  aThe effect of cooking and fat content on thermal diffusivity for beefburger-type meat patties while cooking with far infrared radiation was investigated. Most research on thermal diffusivity is based on temperatures below cooking temperatures with the sample in an enclosed container. These conditions do not reflect a commercial cooking practice. An experimental method was designed to determine values for thermal diffusivity in circumstances similar to those in open oven industrial radiant cooking. Temperatures were above pasteurisation temperature and the patties were not enclosed. Evaporation and drip loss could occur freely. Experimental results were examined and found to be reasonable. The initial value of thermal diffusivity for uncooked lean ground beef fell steadily as cooking progressed. From an initial calculated value of 1.94x10(-7) m(2) s(-1) the final value was 1.03x10(-7) m(2) s(-1). High fat beefburger also experienced a fall, from initial values of around 2.00x10(-7) m(2) s(-1) to end values around 1.20x10(-7) m(2) s(-1). In keeping with values for thermal diffusivity estimated, the cooking time for fat-added beefburger patties was shorter. This may be attributed to physical changes taking place during cooking. Theoretical analysis is unhelpful in predicting thermal diffusivity under oven-shelf cooking conditions, therefore it is necessary to consider the temperature profile throughout the process. 3aground beef 3acooking quality 3ainfrared radiation 3afood analysis 3atemperature 3aprediction 3afood processing 3aequations 3afood composition 3alipids 3aduration 3athermal diffusivity1 aShilton, N.C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Mar., v. 52, no. 1 p.39-45x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030304b20030311c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02017naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011700130300001600247520089500263650001401158650001501172650003001187650002201217650002201239650002801261650001101289650002201300650001301322650002001335653001801355653001401373653001101387653002201398700001901420700001801439773008401457852000901541930003301550945001301583946001101596655001201607IND2330323820221118075641.0030109e200205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233032382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwolarafe, O.K.10aComparative evaluation of the digester-screw press and a hand-operated hydraulic press for palm fruit processing  ap. 249-255.  aIn order to demonstrate the strength and possible weaknesses of the digester-screw press (DSP) system for small-scale oil palm fruit processing, a comparison was made of its performance and that of the erstwhile hand-operated hydraulic extraction system.

The results indicate that the throughput of the DSP system was four folds of that of the hydraulic system, whilst also operating at higher oil extraction efficiency (89.1%). There was no significant difference between the quality of the palm oil obtained from the two systems. However, the economic analysis of the systems indicates that at throughput of 0.75 t/h and above, the DSP system was more economical than the hydraulic system in terms of equipment, labour, material and floor space requirement and revenue accruing from the processing operation. 3apalm oils 3aextraction 3afood processing equipment 3aElaeis guineensis 3ahydraulic systems 3afood processing quality 3ayields 3aeconomic analysis 3aduration 3afood processing 0ascrew presses 0adigesters 0afruits 0ahydraulic presses1 aFaborode, M.O.1 aAjibola, O.O.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 May, v. 52, no. 3 p.249-255x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01669naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011800125300001600243520073900259650001600998650002201014650001301036650002401049650001401073650001301087650000701100650001301107650002301120653001101143700001401154773008501168852000901253930003301262945001301295946001101308655001201319IND2330322620221118075948.0030109e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233032262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErkmen, O.10aMathematical modeling of citric acid production and biomass formation by Aspergillus niger in undersized semolina  ap. 161-166.  aCitric acid production and biomass formation in submerged culture using Aspergillus niger from undersized semolina, with and without methanol, were analyzed using Gompertz, Logistic, Schnute, and Boltzman's models.

  1 aChu, B.S.10aSeparation of vitamin E from palm fatty acid distillate using silica. I. Equilibrium of batch adsorption  ap. 97-103.  aIn this study, vitamin E was separated from palm fatty acid distillate by batch adsorption using an orbital shaker. Silica was used as the adsorbent. Equilibrium of the adsorption process as a function of reaction temperature, agitation rate and silica mass on vitamin E adsorption onto silica was investigated over a range of vitamin E concentration. Lower reaction temperature led to higher vitamin E uptake at equilibrium, indicating that the adsorption process in this study was exothermic. Adsorption capacity increased with the rise in agitation rate. However, in this study the maximum adsorption capacity remained unchanged when silica mass was increased. Generally, non-linear regression analysis showed that the Redlich-Peterson and Langmuir isotherm models described the equilibrium data reasonably well (coefficient of determination, R2 > 0.90 in most cases). The Freundlich model, however, was found to be relatively poor (R2 < 0.90 in most cases) for explaining the adsorption equilibrium in this study. Thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption further confirmed the exothermic nature of the adsorption process as did the negative heat of enthalpy, accompanied by a negative value of entropy change. The overall Gibbs free energy change during the adsorption process was negative for the experimental range of temperatures, corresponding to spontaneous adsorption. 3avitamin E 3apalm oils 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 3aseparation 3afatty acids 3afood technology1 aBaharin, B.S.1 aChe Man, Y.B.1 aQuek, S.Y.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Mar., v. 62, no. 1 p.97-103x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdPNNe2004/02/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02066naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002700144245006300171300001400234520112800248650001801376650001101394650001001405650001401415650001901429650002001448650001201468653003601480653002201516700001401538700002401552773008301576852000901659945002501668946001101693655001201704IND4361343120221118080445.0040224e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436134312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSivaramakrishnan, H.P.10aRheological properties of rice dough for making rice bread  ap. 37-45.  aThe rheological properties of two varieties of rice with Hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) added as gluten substitute were studied using a farinograph and a rheometer and compared with wheat dough to find its suitability for making rice bread. The water absorption and dough development time data were obtained from the farinogram. The tests conducted in the rheometer were oscillation measurements (frequency sweep from 0.1 to 20 Hz at 1% strain), shear measurement (shearing from 0.1 to 5 s-1) and creep tests with an instant loading of 50 Pa for 60 S. Baking tests were conducted with all the dough samples and the loaf volume and moisture loss of bread were measured. The farinogram showed that rice flour supplemented with HPMC reached a consistency of 500 BU at a later time than that of standard wheat dough. The rheological measurements from the oscillation tests and creep tests showed that the rice dough with 1.5% and 3.0% HPMC had similar rheological properties to that of wheat flour dough and was suitable for making rice bread. The long grain rice sample produced a rice bread with better crumb texture. 3arice products 3abreads 3adough 3aviscosity 3abaking quality 3amethylcellulose 3atexture 0ahydroxy propyl methyl cellulose 0agluten substitute1 aSenge, B.1 aChattopadhyay, P.K.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2004 Mar., v. 62, no. 1 p.37-45x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdPNNe2004/02/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02177naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006000127300001600187500009400203520088900297650001101186650001301197650001201210650001801222650001201240650001701252650001401269650002101283650001101304650001801315650001001333650001301343650001301356650001501369650001301384650001101397650001101408653002201419653001601441653002201457653003601479700001501515773008701530852000901617930003301626945001301659946001101672655001201683IND2332329720221118075113.0030501e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233232972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalska, H.10aMass exchange during osmotic pretreatment of vegetables  ap. 137-140.  aIn the special issue: Osmotic Dehydration/edited by W.

Osmotic dehydration was carried out in 61.5% solution of sugar. Temperature of dewatering was constant at 30 degrees C. Time of dehydration was varied from 0 to 180 min. Osmotic dehydration in sugar solution at 30 degrees C depends on the kind of plant tissue. The most significant changes of water content, water loss and solids gain took place during the first 30 min of dewatering. During that time water content in apples was reduced by some 48%, whereas further dehydration from 60 to 180 min resulted in water content reduction by next 30%. Further dewatering of pumpkin and carrot proceeded much slower than that at the beginning of the process. Rate of water loss was 5-10 times higher than the rate of solids gain and depended on the advancement of the dewatering process. 3aapples 3apumpkins 3acarrots 3amass transfer 3aosmosis 3apretreatment 3asolutions 3aosmotic pressure 3adrying 3awater content 3awater 3akinetics 3avelocity 3adewatering 3aduration 3asolids 3asugars 0aprocessing losses 0adehydration 0aosmotic solutions 0adewatering impregnation soaking1 aLenart, A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 Aug., v. 49, no. 2/3 p.137-140x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02053naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004800128300001600176500009400192500001500286520040700301650001800708650001400726650002400740650001200764650002500776650002100801650001700822650001800839650001500857650001200872650001900884650001700903650001800920650001100938650002800949650001400977653002300991653001201014653001901026653003601045653002001081653001101101653001401112653003701126653002001163653001601183653002201199653001801221700001501239700001601254700001601270773008701286852000901373930003301382945001301415946001101428655001201439IND2332330120221118075159.0030501e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233233012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollignan, A.10aOsmotic treatment of fish and meat products  ap. 153-162.  aIn the special issue: Osmotic Dehydration/edited by W.

We determined the concentration of various phenolic compounds and related enzyme activities. Infection with the Venturia inaequalis fungus enhanced the metabolism of phenolic compounds at the scab spot, around the spot and in healthy peel. Compared with the healthy tissue and the tissue around the spot, the scab spot showed higher enzyme activity for all tested enzymes, except for dihydrochalcone 2′-O-glucosyltransferase, which had lower activity in the scab spot. In comparison to the healthy peel, the scab spot showed up to 3.4 times more hydroxycinnamic acids, up to 1.1 times more dihydrochalcones and up to 1.4 times more flavan-3-ols. In contrast, the healthy peel showed up to 1.6 times more flavonols than the scab spot. 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aapples 3acoumaric acids 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aflavanols 3aflavonols 3afungi 3ametabolism 3atrees 0aDihydrochalcone 2′-O-glucosyltransferase 0afruits 0aphenylpropanoid pathway 0aphenylalanine ammonia lyase1 aMikulic Petkovsek, M.1 aHalbwirth, H.1 aStampar, F.1 aStich, K.1 aVeberic, R.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2010 May, v. 156, no. 3 p.449-456dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2010.00402.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03106naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245015700171300001600328500010400344520163900448650001102087650002102098650001402119650002802133650002602161650001602187650001602203650001302219650001702232650001502249650000902264650001102273650001302284650003102297650001802328650001602346650001302362650001302375650001002388651001002398700001902408773014502427856005502572852000902627655001202636IND60602941420221118075250.0180712e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060294142DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1199.632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamposeo, S.10aYield, harvesting efficiency and oil chemical quality of cultivars 'Arbequina' and 'Arbosana' harvested by straddle machine in two Apulian growing areas  ap. 397-402.  aPaper presented at the VIII International Olive Symposium held October 10 -14, 2016, Split, Croatia  aSuper-high-density olive culture is characterized by hedgerow trees with planting density ranging from 1200 up to 2000 trees ha-1, in order to allow continuous harvesting by straddle machines. The genotype cultivated is the key factor for both the agronomic and economic sustainability of this new cropping system. 'Arbequina' and 'Arbosana', together with a few others, are the most-used cultivars up to now. Yield, harvesting efficiency and oil quality are strongly affected by agronomical and environmental factors, among others. We report yields, harvesting efficiencies and chemical characteristics of oils of the cultivars 'Arbequina' and 'Arbosana' grown in two different pedoclimatic Apulian areas (southern Italy), with the same planting density, tree age, cropping practices and harvesting machine. Each cultivar was harvested at the same ripening stage for both sites. Site 1 was warmer and more arid than site 2. Mean harvesting efficiency was 98%; 'Arbequina' had higher harvesting efficiency with respect to 'Arbosana', due to different detachment force. The colder site reduced fruit yield and yield efficiencies of both cultivars but increased yield quality, by increasing both unsaturation level of fatty acids and polyphenol content of the extracted oil. The selection of appropriate growing areas was an important tool to define levels of both fruit yield and oil quality for the high-density olive orchards. Moreover, cultivar and harvesting time influenced not only the above-mentioned yield parameters, but also the performance of the straddle harvesters both in terms of harvesting efficiency and canopy damage. 3acanopy 3acropping systems 3acultivars 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acids 3afruit yield 3agenotype 3aharvest date 3aharvesters 3aoils 3aolives 3aorchards 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant density 3apolyphenols 3aripening 3atree age 3atrees 3aItaly1 aVivaldi, G.

After the boiling process, none of the olive oil samples was oxidized, independently of the olive oil quality used. However, in contrast with tocopherols, all polyphenolic components decreased in concentration with the thermal treatment and this decrease was dramatic in the presence of vegetables, probably because of their high content in metals such as iron and copper. The addition of olive oil only 15 min before the end of the boiling process was shown to bring benefits in general for the content of both elenolic acid derivatives, 3,4-DHPEA-EA and 4-HPEA-EA, and hydroxytyrosol acetate in the processed oils. Moreover, less destruction of the vegetables polyphenols was also observed when processing olive oils only 15 min before the end of the boiling process. Interestingly, and besides the use of EVOO instead of OO did not bring benefits to the stability of samples or a higher polyphenolic content in the samples after processing, an higher radical scavenging capacity of phenolic extracts obtained from EVOO samples could be observed. 3aacetates 3aboiling 3acopper 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3aoxidative stability 3apolyphenols 3atocopherols 3avegetables1 aGarcia, Barbara1 aPaiva-Martins, Fátima0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2010 Nov., v. 43, no. 9 p.1336-1344dPublished for the Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology by Academic PresswJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2010.05.0133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245010300172300001800275500002400293520131400317650002701631650000901658650001701667650001601684650001301700650001801713650002501731650002101756700002501777700003801802700002701840700003001867700002401897773019801921852000902119856008502128655001202213IND4440531620221118074925.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444053162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2010.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoraes, Paula Mendonca10aProtocols for the isolation and detection of lactic acid bacteria with bacteriocinogenic potential  ap. 1320-1324.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate culture media and methodologies for isolation and detection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) capable to produce bacteriocin-like substances. Samples of milk and cheese were pour plated on de Mann-Rogosa-Sharpe agar (MRS) and Kang-Fung-Sol agar (KFS) (both at 35 °C/48 h, under anaerobiosis), from which 389 and 256 LAB cultures were selected. The antagonistic activity of them was evaluated using the spot-on-the-lawn and two culture media: brain-heart infusion agar with catalase (BHI + C) and M17 (both at 35 °C/24 h). The proteinaceous nature of the antagonistic cultures was verified using: spot-on-the-lawn (MRS, 25 °C/24 h, under anaerobiosis) and well-diffusion (cultures amplified on modified MRS broth at 25 °C/24 h, and then neutralized using NaOH). Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 was used as indicator. A larger number of antagonist cultures were isolated from MRS (83 by M17 and 65 by BHI + C) in comparison to KFS (24 by M17 and 15 by BHI + C). The spot-on-the-lawn identified a higher frequency of LAB capable of producing bacteriocin-like substances. MRS was considered to be the best culture media for the isolation of LAB capable to produce bacteriocin-like substances, activity that was better identified using the spot-on-the-lawn methodology. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aagar 3aanaerobiosis 3aantagonists 3acatalase 3aculture media 3alactic acid bacteria 3asodium hydroxide1 aPerin, Luana Martins1 aOrtolani, Maria Beatriz Tassinari1 aYamazi, Anderson Keizo1 aVicosa, Gabriela Nogueira1 aNero, Luis Augusto.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2010 Nov., v. 43, no. 9 p.1320-1324dPublished for the Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology by Academic PresswJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2010.05.0053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03318naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245011700187300001600304520131600320650001301636650002001649650002301669650000901692650002301701650001701724650001801741650002201759650001501781650002601796650001101822650002701833650003001860650001501890650002001905650002301925650001601948650005601964650002602020650004102046650001602087650003202103650003002135650004102165651001002206653002102216700002202237700002002259700002902279700002402308700001802332700002002350700002102370700002202391773013302413852000902546856006902555930003302624946001102657655001202668IND4389968820221118075242.0070401e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438996882DNAL7 a173931542pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1214-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarré, Marinella.10aPart per trillion determination of atrazine in natural water samples by a surface plasmon resonance immunosensor  ap. 207-214.  aA new immunoassay for continuously monitoring atrazine in water has been developed. It uses a portable biosensor platform based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. This immunoassay is based on the binding inhibition format with purified polyclonal antibodies, with the analyte derivative covalently immobilized on a gold sensor surface. An alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) was formed on the gold-coated sensor surface in order to obtain a reusable sensing surface. The low detection limit for the optimized assay, calculated as the concentration that produces a 10% decrease in the blank signal, is 20 ng/L. A complete assay cycle, including regeneration, is accomplished in 25 min. Additionally, a study of the matrix effects of different types of wastewater was performed. All measurements were carried out with the SPR sensor system (β-SPR) commercialised by the company Sensia, S.L. (Spain). The small size and low response time of the β-SPR platform would allow it to be used in real contaminated locations. The immunosensor was evaluated and validated by measuring the atrazine content of 26 natural samples collected from Ebro River. Solid-phase extraction followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometric detection (SPE-GC-MS) was used to validate the new immunoassay. 3aatrazine 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3agold 3aherbicide residues 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3apolyclonal antibodies 3arivers 3asolid phase extraction 3asurface plasmon resonance 3awastewater 3awater pollution 2aAtrazinexanalysis 2aCalibration 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFresh Waterxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aImmunoassay 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSurface Plasmon Resonance 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aSpain 0aSPR immunosensor1 aMartínez, Elena.1 aRamón, Javier 1 aNavarro Granell, Alicia.1 aRadjenovic, Jelena 1 aMauriz, Elba 1 aLechuga, Laura 1 aMarco, M.

Two different mediators, ferricyanide and flexible polyvinylimidazole osmium functionalized polymer (Os-polymer), were employed to prepare two different microbial biosensors, both of which gave high detection performance. The good operational stabilities of both types of biosensor were underlined by the ability to detect 1,3-PD throughout 140 h of continuous operation. Both microbial biosensor systems showed excellent selectivity for 1,3-PD in the presence of a high excess of glycerol [selectivity ratios (1,3-PD/Gly) of 118 or 245 for the ferricyanide and Os-polymer systems, respectively]. Further, the robustness of each microbial biosensor was highlighted by the high reliability of 1,3-PD detection achieved (average RSD of standards <2%, and well below 4% for samples). The biosensor implementing the Os-polymer mediator exhibited high selectivity towards 1,3-PD detection and allowed moderate sample throughput (up to 12 h-¹) when integrated into a flow system. This system was used to monitor the concentration of 1,3-PD during a real bioprocess. Results from biosensor assays of 1,3-PD in bioprocess samples taken throughout the fermentation were in a very good agreement with results obtained from reference HPLC assays (R ² = 0.999). 3aGluconobacter oxydans 3abioprocessing 3abiosensors 3abiotransformation 3afermentation 3aglycerol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3apolymers 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aElectrochemistry 2aFermentation 2aFerricyanidesxchemistry 2aGluconobacter oxydansxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aGlycerolxchemistry 2aImidazolesxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aOsmiumxchemistry 2aPolyvinylsxchemistry 2aPropylene Glycolsxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0a1,3-Propanediol 0a3-Hydroxyl-propionaldehyde 0aClostridium sp1 aVoštiar, Igor 1 aŠefčovičová, Jana 1 aTkáč, Ján 1 aMastihuba, Vladimír 1 aValach, Milan 1 aŠtefuca, Vladimír.1 aGemeiner, Peter 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 May, v. 388, no. 1 p.287-295dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1211-53electronic resource  a20070401b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02520naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245018200182300001800364520088700382650001901269650001101288650001401299650002001313650003201333650002601365650002201391650002101413650003701434650003501471650004201506650003601548650004501584650003901629653001401668653004401682700002201726700002101748700002301769773013601792852000901928856006901937930003302006946001102039655001202050IND4389673720221118074814.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438967372DNAL7 a173258222pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1157-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOoki, Yoriko 10aInhibitory analysis of the effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the activity of chitinase by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of chitin oligosaccharides  ap. 2641-2644.  aThe analytical method of determining enzyme activity by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was developed and applied for investigation of the effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the enzyme activity of chitinase. The measurement of chitinase activity by LC/MS is useful in order to use the nonderivatized substrate, which can show in vivo chitinase activity. Substrate consumption and product formation were monitored in order to determine chitinase activity. It was shown that, for the first time, in vitro addition of PAHs inhibited the activity of chitinase in a noncompetitive manner. The IC₅₀ value of benzo[a]pyrene was 1.4 μM, and PAHs containing four or more aromatic rings showed the same or higher inhibitory effect, whereas PAHs with a lower number of aromatic rings showed lower inhibition of the chitinase activity than benzo[a]pyrene. 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3achitin 3achitinase 3aenzyme activity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoligosaccharides 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 2aChitinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChitinasesxantagonists & inhibitors. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aOligosaccharidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPolycyclic Compoundsxpharmacology 0aInhibitor 0aLiquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry1 aKumemura, Momoko 1 aItoh, Masayoshi 1 aKorenaga, Takashi 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Apr., v. 387, no. 8 p.2641-2644dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1157-73electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03371naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245007000181300001800251520162800269650001501897650002101912650001601933650002801949650001601977650001101993650002602004650001802030650004002048650001802088650001302106650000902119650002202128650001702150650002102167650001502188650002902203650003702232650001102269650003102280650003202311650004102343653000802384653001602392653000802408653002302416653001002439700001602449700002502465700002102490773013602511852000902647856006902656930003302725946001102758655001202769IND4388248620221118074829.0070225e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438824862DNAL7 a171031492pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-006-0895-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Kan-Zhi10aQuantification of serum apolipoprotein B by infrared spectroscopy  ap. 1809-1814.  aWhile the conventional approach to assessing both the risk of coronary artery disease and the adequacy of therapy is LDL cholesterol testing, there is compelling evidence to suggest that apolipoprotein B (apoB) is superior to LDL cholesterol for both of these purposes. However, the measurement of apoB requires techniques that can be expensive and difficult to standardize. The aim of this study was, therefore, to develop a new method, based on infrared (IR) spectroscopy, for the routine quantification of apoB in human serum. A total of 366 serum samples were obtained from patients with various disorders. Small volumes (2 μl) of serum specimens were dried to films, and duplicate IR absorption spectra measured. The reference apoB concentrations were determined separately using a standard method, and the proposed IR method was then calibrated using partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis to quantitatively correlate the IR spectra with the reference results. The apoB concentrations predicted from the IR spectra of serum were highly correlated and in excellent agreement with those determined by the reference method. The correlation coefficient (r) for apoB was 0.94, with the standard error between IR-predicted and reference values was 0.10 g/L. In combination with earlier work demonstrating the accurate determination of LDL-C, HDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides from a single infrared spectroscopic measurement, the addition of accurate apoB determination from the same spectrum makes the method very attractive for laboratory use in the routine evaluation of coronary artery disease risk. 3aabsorption 3aapolipoprotein B 3ablood serum 3acoronary artery disease 3acorrelation 3ahumans 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aleast squares 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anormal values 3apatients 3arisk 3aspectral analysis 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols 2aAlgorithms 2aApolipoproteins Bxblood 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxmethods 2aHumans 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpectrophotometry, Infraredxmethods 0aLDL 0aLipid panel 0aPLS 0aClinical chemistry 0aSerum1 aMan, Angela1 aDembinski, Thomas C.1 aShaw, R.

The aerosol mass was determined by differential weighing of filters carried out in a clean chemistry laboratory under controlled temperature and humidity. A two-step sequential extraction procedure was used to separate the water-soluble and the insoluble (dilute-HCl-extractable) fractions. Cd, Pb and Cu were determined in the two fractions using an ultrasensitive square wave anodic stripping voltammetric (SWASV) procedure set up for and applied to aerosol samples for the first time. Total extractable metals showed maxima at midsummer for Cd and Pb and a less clear trend for Cu. In particular, particulate metal concentrations ranged as follows: Cd 0.84-9.2 μg g-¹ (average 4.7 μg g-¹), Pb 13.2-81 μg g-¹ (average 33 μg g-¹), Cu 126-628 μg g-¹ (average 378 μg g-¹). In terms of atmospheric concentration, the values were: Cd 0.55-6.3 pg m-³ (average 3.4 pg m-³), Pb 8.7-48 pg m-³ (average 24 pg m-³), Cu 75-365 pg m-³ (average 266 pg m-³). At the beginning of the season the three metals appear widely distributed in the insoluble (HCl-extractable) fraction (higher proportions for Cd and Pb, 90-100%, and lower for Cu, 70-90%) with maxima in the second half of December. The soluble fraction then increases, and at the end of the season Cd and Pb are approximately equidistributed between the two fractions, while for Cu the soluble fraction reaches its maximum level of 36%. Practically negligible contributions are estimated for crustal and sea-spray sources. Low but significant volcanic contributions are estimated for Cd and Pb (~10% and ~5%, respectively), while there is an evident although not quantified marine biogenic source, at least for Cd. The estimated natural contributions (possibly including the marine biogenic source) cannot account for the high fractions of the metal contents, particularly for Pb and Cu, and this suggests that pollution from long-range transport is the dominant source. 3aaerosols 3acadmium 3acellulose 3acopper 3afilters 3alead 3apollution 3asummer 2aAerosolsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aCadmiumxanalysisxchemistry. 2aCopperxanalysisxchemistry. 2aHydrochloric Acidxchemistry 2aLeadxanalysisxchemistry. 2aParticle Size 2aPotentiometryxmethods 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSeasons 2aSeawater 2aSolubility 2aWaterxchemistry 3aAntarctic region 0aAntarctica. 0aAntarctic aerosol 0aSoluble/insoluble fractionation 0aSquare wave anodic stripping voltammetry 0aSummer seasonal variation 0aSource identification1 aTruzzi, C.1 aIlluminati, S.1 aBassotti, E.1 aScarponi, G.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Feb., v. 387, no. 3 p.977-998dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-006-0994-03electronic resource  a20070405b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02770naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245017800179300001800357520100100375650002501376650002001401650000901421650002401430650001601454650002901470650003101499650002301530650001301553650002401566650003501590650003201625650001601657653009601673653002801769653008801797653003101885653003001916700001701946700001901963700002001982773013602002852000902138856008502147930003302232946001102265655001202276IND4389676020221118074912.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438967602DNAL7 a173185212pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1153-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hong10aSpectrophotometric determination of total protein in serum using a novel near-infrared cyanine dye, 5,5'-dicarboxy-1,1'-disulfobutyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine  ap. 2857-2862.  aThe application of near-infrared (NIR) dyes (λ em > 750 nm) to the analysis of biological samples shows much promise, because the long emission wavelengths of such dyes allow interferences from biomolecule matrices to be minimized. In this paper, a novel NIR dye, 5,5'-dicarboxy-1,1'-disulfobutyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine (DCDSTCY) has been developed for the spectrophotometric determination of total protein in serum. Under acidic conditions, the binding of DCDSTCY to proteins caused a new peak at 878 nm, the height of which was proportional to the concentration of protein. The linear range of the method was found to be 0.04-0.5 μg mL-¹ for bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA), and detection limits of 5 ng mL-¹ were obtained for these substances. The maximum binding number of BSA with DCDSTCY was measured to be 133. The method proposed here has been applied to the quantitation of total protein in serum, and recoveries of 96.6-104% were achieved. 3abovine serum albumin 3adetection limit 3adyes 3ahuman serum albumin 3awavelengths 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aColoring Agentsxchemistry 2aIndolesxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aNitrilesxchemistry 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet 2aSpectroscopy, Near-Infrared 2aTemperature 0a5,5′-dicarboxy-1,1′-disulfobutyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine (DCDSTCY) 0aNear-infrared (NIR) dye 0a5,5'-dicarboxy-1,1'-disulfobutyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine (DCDSTCY) 0aBovine serum albumin (BSA) 0aHuman serum albumin (HSA)1 aLi, Wei-Rong1 aGuo, Xiao-Feng1 aZhang, Hua-Shan0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 Apr., v. 387, no. 8 p.2857-2862dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1153-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070405b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02856naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002800186245015500214300001600369506007600385520130500461506003701766650002501803650001401828650002601842650001701868653001801885653001401903653001701917653003501934653002701969653001801996653001402014653001702028653003502045653002702080700002002107773013302127852000902260856008502269930003302354946001102387655001202398IND4389968620221207141858.0070401e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438996862DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1215-12doi7 aPMC19142862pmcid7 a173931532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan de Meent, M.

This can be achieved by using either long columns or columns packed with small particles. Monolithic columns allow the use of long columns at relatively low back-pressure. The gain in peak capacity using long columns was evaluated by the separation of a tryptic bovine serum albumin digest with an LC-UV-mass spectrometry (MS) system and monolithic columns of different length (150 and 750 mm). Peak capacities were determined from UV chromatograms and MS/MS data were used for Mascot database searching. Analyses with a similar gradient slope for the two columns produced ratios of the peak capacities that were close to the expected value of the square root of the column length ratio. Peak capacities of the short column were 12.6 and 25.0 with 3 and 15 min gradients, respectively, and 29.7 and 41.0 for the long column with 15 and 75 min gradients, respectively. Protein identification scores were also higher for the long column, 641 and 750 for the 3- and 15-min gradients with the short column and 1,376 and 993 for the 15- and 75-min gradients with the long column. Thus, the use of long monolithic columns provides improved peptide separation and increased reliability of protein identification.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abovine serum albumin 3adatabases 3aliquid chromatography 3aspectroscopy 0aPeak capacity 0aMonoliths 0aLong columns 0aGradient liquid chromatography 0aProtein identification 0aPeak capacity 0aMonoliths 0aLong columns 0aGradient liquid chromatography 0aProtein identification1 ade Jong, G.

The regeneration of the resins was also studied. The decoloring capacity of the selected resin (Lewatit S-6328-A) was compared with a powder activated carbon which is currently used as an adsorbent in the vinegar industry for decolorization. For a batch process with white and rose vinegars with resin Lewatit S-6328-A (10 g/l for white and 20 g/l for rose) at equilibrium the maximum decolorization efficiency was 69% and 72%, respectively. In the continuous process with a packed column on bench scale, the pseudo-contact time (ratio resin volume and vinegar flow-rate) is the operation factor which determines the decolorization level. The maximum level of decolorization for white and rose vinegars in continuous process was practically the same. The pseudo-contact time required to obtain the maximum decolorization for rose vinegar was almost three times that required for white vinegar. The adsorption of colored compounds with exchange resins in continuous packed columns seems to be technically feasible, and the results of this work form the backbone of subsequent studies of scaling up for vinegar decolorization. The possibility of packing the resins into a column means that a new continuous process can be used for vinegar decolorization. 3adecolorization 3afood processing 3afood processing quality 3aion exchange resins 3aadsorption 3aactivated carbon 3acontinuous systems 0avinegar1 aGuell, C.1 aLopez, F.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Mar., v. 51, no. 4 p.311-317x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02731naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012400182300001600306520107700322650001901399650001601418650001401434650001101448650003001459650003301489650005001522650002401572650005101596650005001647650001801697650002101715650005201736650003001788650004901818650001701867653000901884653003301893700002001926700001801946700001801964773013301982852000902115856006902124930003302193946001102226655001202237IND4389968120221118075055.0070401e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438996812DNAL7 a173425392pmid7 a10.1007/s00216-007-1188-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yueying 13aAn accurate QSRR model for the prediction of the GCxGC-TOFMS retention time of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners  ap. 165-172.  aQuantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) models were constructed for the GCxGC-TOFMS retention time of 209 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to recognize groups of samples with similar behavior and assist the separation of the data into training and test sets. The best multi-linear regression (BMLR) method was used for the systematic development of multi-linear regression equations; the best regression model involved four descriptors which were related to GCxGC-TOFMS chromatographic retention of PCBs. The obtained model has good predictive ability. For the test set, it gave a predictive correlation coefficient (R) of 0.988 and an average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 3.08%. Results of a six-fold cross-validation procedure, which were in accordance with those from validation of training and test sets, demonstrated that this model was reliable. Additionally, this paper provides a simple, practical, and effective method for analytical chemists to predict the retention times of PCBs in GC. 3achromatography 3acorrelation 3aequations 3amodels 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aregression analysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aLinear Models 2aModels, Chemical 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aQuantitative Structure-Activity Relationship 2aTime Factors 0aQSRR 0aBest multi-linear regression1 aLiu, Huanxiang 1 aYao, Xiaojun 1 aLiu, Mancang 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2007 May, v. 388, no. 1 p.165-172dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-007-1188-03electronic resource  a20070401b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01373naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009100127300001600218520044200234650001800676650002000694650001600714650002200730650002400752650001400776650001500790653001600805700001400821700001600835700002100851773008500872852000900957930003300966945001300999946001101012655001201023IND2330102420221118075402.0021216e200203  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233010242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKockel, T.K.13aAn experimental study of the equilibrium for skim milk powder at elevated temperatures  ap. 291-297.  aThe equilibrium moisture contents for skim milk powder at temperatures between 55 degrees C and 90 degrees C and for relative humidities between 3.3% and 19% have been measured in order to assess the drying behavior of this material in spray dryers, where these temperature and relative humidity conditions are common.

Using a buffer constituted with 10 mM sodium borate and 50 mM SDS at pH 9.0, micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography was able to determine with very high resolution the AA Δ-oligomers produced by the action of the lyase (mainly DP3 and DP4) as one single species. The intra- and inter-day variations (CV%) were between 6.3 and 9.1 for migration time and between 2.5 and 5.7 for peak area, respectively. The calibration curve showed good linearity for the examined concentration range (60-360 ng) with an average correlation coefficient greater than 0.980. The lowest detection limit and the lowest quantitation limit of the method were 15 ng (0.25 mg/mL) and 40 ng (0.67 mg/mL), respectively. The intra- and inter-day variations in terms of CV% were 5.5 and 8.6%, respectively, and the intra- and inter-day accuracy was estimated to range from 4.1 to 8.9%, while the percent recoveries of AA were calculated to be 102, 97 and 93% for different AA amounts. Variations in temperatures, voltage and buffer composition in comparison with adopted conditions within a 10% limit do not modify the electrophoresis results. The evaluation of AA was performed in both solid and liquid pharmaceutical formulations also in the presence of other ingredients, in particular, aluminium, sodium and potassium bicarbonate, and emulsifying and flavouring agents. The quantitative results obtained were 101.2±3.4% of AA content in tablets and 98.4±2.8% in liquid formulation, in total conformity with the label claims. 3aalginate lyase 3aalginates 3aaluminum 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3adrug formulations 3aemulsifying 3aflavorings 3aingredients 3amicellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography 3apH 3apotassium bicarbonate 3asodium 3asodium borate 3atemperature0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 Aug., v. 29, no. 17 p.3504-3510dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2008001043Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02042naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002200142245013800164300001800302520101800320650001701338650003501355650001501390650001901405650002001424650001101444650001501455700001701470773009401487852000901581856008201590930003301672946001101705655001201716IND4411406920221118074901.0081010e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441140692DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2008000342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubalczyk, Paweł10aMethod for determination of total cysteamine in human plasma by high performance capillary electrophoresis with acetonitrile stacking  ap. 3636-3640.  aAn analytical procedure enabling routine analysis of human plasma for total cysteamine (CASH) has been developed and validated.

A large volume of sample is injected to achieve analyte concentration directly on the capillary, according to the transient pseudo-isotachophoresis principle, before the separation step takes place. Method performance characteristics, for example recovery, calibration, precision, limit of detection and limit of quantitation are presented.

Conventional Western blotting allows detection of specific proteins to the level of single isotypes while its quantitative accuracy is rather limited. We report a novel and improved quantitative Western blotting method. The use of fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies strongly extends the dynamic range of the quantitation and improves the correlation with the protein amount (r=0.997). By an additional fluorescent staining of all proteins immediately after their transfer to the blot membrane, it is possible to visualise simultaneously the antibody binding and the total protein profile. This allows for an accurate correction for protein load. Applying this normalisation it could be demonstrated that fluorescence-based Western blotting is able to reproduce a quantitative analysis of two specific proteins in blood platelet samples from 44 subjects with different diseases as initially conducted by 2D-DIGE. These results show that the proposed fluorescence-based Western blotting is an adequate application technique for biomarker quantitation and suggest possibilities of employment that go far beyond. 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3aapplication methods 3abiomarkers 3ablood proteins 3aelectrophoresis 3afluorescence 3aquantitative analysis1 aBabeluk, Rita1 aDiestinger, Michael1 aPirchegger, Petra1 aSkeledzic, Senada1 aOehler, Rudolf0 tElectrophoresis.g2008 Aug., v. 29, no. 17 p.3621-3627dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2007009353Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03342naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245009000175300001600265520162300281650001101904650000801915650001801923650001401941650001101955650001901966650000901985650001901994650001402013650001302027650001102040650001602051650001402067650001502081650002202096650000902118650001602127650001002143650001502153650002102168650002902189650002902218650001602247650001102263650003102274650001102305650001802316650002302334650001702357650001002374650001202384651001102396653001302407653001502420773009802435852000902533856008102542930003302623945001302656946001102669655001202680IND2332788020221118074433.0030528e200109  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233278802DNAL7 a115946322pmid7 a10.1007/s0048401000962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaaidi, K.10aPredicting days of high allergenic risk during Betula pollination using weather types  ap. 124-132.  aThe aim of this study was to build up a picture of the influence of meteorological conditions on pollen and pollinosis, taking account of weather types, pollen concentrations in the air and pollinosis symptoms, with the aim of preventing allergic responses. The study took place in Burgundy from 1996 to 1998, during the pollination of the birch (Betula), which is the most important arborean allergen in this region. We used daily pollen data from four Hirst volumetric traps, identified weather types by Benichou's classification, and obtained data on the occurrence of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma and coughing from a sample of 100 patients. These data were analysed by multiple-component analysis. The results show that pollen dispersal is favoured by windy conditions, low relative humidity, precipitation below 2 mm and temperatures above 6 degrees C. Such weather also favours pollinosis, but other particular meteorological situations, even if they do not assist pollen dispersal, can act directly on the development of symptoms: a decrease of temperature (3 degrees C) led to the development of rhinitis and conjunctivitis, while strong winds were associated with many cases of conjunctivitis and asthma, owing to the irritant effect of cold or wind; asthma was favoured by temperature inversions with fog, probably because such weather corresponds to high levels of pollution, which act on bronchial hyperreactivity. Because the weather types favouring pollination and pollinosis are predicted by the meteorological office, this can constitute a tool for reducing the effect of high-risk allergenic days. 3aBetula 3aair 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aasthma 3abioclimatology 3acold 3aconjunctivitis 3ahay fever 3apatients 3apollen 3apollen flow 3apollution 3aprediction 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3atemperature 3atraps 3awind speed 2aAsthmaxetiology 2aConjunctivitisxetiology 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aForecasting 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivityxetiology 2aPollen 2aPublic Health 2aRhinitisxetiology 2aRisk Factors 2aTrees 2aWeather 3aFrance 0asymptoms 0apollinosis0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2001 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.124-132x0020-71287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0048401000963Available from publisher's Web site  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02788naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010600181300001600287500027200303520093800575650001201513650001901525650004301544650001501587650001401602650001901616650001601635650001101651650001101662650001501673650001501688650001101703650001901714650001401733650003801747650001601785650002201801650000901823650001701832650001201849650000901861650002201870653002201892653001701914653004301931773009701974852000902071856008502080930003302165945001302198946001102211655001202222IND2334268720221118074440.0031002e200308  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233426872DNAL7 a127078362pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-003-0169-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarnieli, A.10aNatural vegetation phenology assessment by ground spectral measurements in two semi-arid environments  ap. 179-187.  aPrepared in conjunction with the International Conference "The times they are a-changin'". Climate change, phenological responses and their consequences for biodiversity, agriculture, forestry and human health, held December 5-7, 2001, in Wageningen, The Netherlands.  aNatural vegetation in semi-arid regions is characterized by three ground features, in addition to bare surfaces--biological soil crusts, annuals, and perennials. These three elements have distinguishable phenological cycles that can be detected by spectral ground measurements and by calculating the weighted normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The latter is the product of the derived NDVI of each ground feature and its respective areal cover. Each phenological cycle has the same basic elements--oscillation from null (or low) to full photosynthetic status and back to a stage of senescence. However, they vary in phase. The biological soil crusts show the earliest and highest weighted NDVI peak during the rainy season, and their weighted NDVI signal lasts longer than that of the annuals. The annuals are dominant in late winter and early spring while the perennials predominate in late spring and during the summer. 3aannuals 3abioclimatology 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aperennials 3aphenology 3asemiarid zones 3asoil crusts 3aspring 3asummer 3avegetation 3awet season 3awinter 2aDesert Climate 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aPeriodicity 2aPlant Development 2aRain 2aReproduction 2aSeasons 2aSoil 2aSpectrum Analysis 0adesert vegetation 0aNegev Desert 0anormalized difference vegetation index0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2003 Aug., v. 47, no. 4 p.179-187x0020-71287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-003-0169-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03020naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245008900186300001800275500002400293520146000317650001601777650002001793650002901813650002501842650003501867650001501902650001801917650002001935650002301955650002001978650005601998650003802054650003902092650005702131650003502188650001402223650003902237650002002276650001702296700002202313773011502335852000902450856009102459655001202550IND4440588520221118075233.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444058852DNAL7 a199394352pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLahr, Joost10aEnvironmental risk mapping of pollutants: State of the art and communication aspects  ap. 3899-3907.  aIncludes references  aRisk maps help risk analysts and scientists to explore the spatial nature of the effects of environmental stressors such as pollutants. The development of Geographic Information Systems over the past few decades has greatly improved spatial representation and analysis of environmental information and data. Maps also constitute a powerful tool to communicate the outcome of complex environmental risk assessment to stakeholders such as the general public and policy makers. With appropriate cartography one can improve communication and thus bridge the gap between experts and users. Appropriate risk communication is pivotal to risk management, decision making and implementation and may prevent unnecessary concern about environmental pollutants. However, at present few risk maps are specifically tailored to meet the demands of such defined uses. This paper presents an overview of the most important types of risk maps that can be distinguished using examples from the scientific literature: contamination maps, exposure maps, hazard maps, vulnerability maps and ‘true' risk maps. It also discusses, in a general way, the most important issues that need to be addressed when making risk maps for communication purposes: risk perception, target audience, scale and spatial aggregation and visualisation such as use of colours and symbols. Finally, some general rules of thumb are given for making environmental risk maps for communication purposes. 3acartography 3adecision making 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3ageographic information systems 3apollutants 3apublic policy 3arisk assessment 3arisk communication 3arisk perception 2aEnvironmental Exposurexstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aGeography 2aInformation Disseminationxmethods 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors1 aKooistra, Lammert0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 408, no. 18 p.3899-3907dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03092naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001900170245007800189300001800267500002400285520166200309650001501971650001901986650001302005650000902018650002002027650002002047650001702067650001502084650001402099650001602113650006702129650003802196650003902234650005702273650002902330650001702359700001302376700001402389700001602403773011502419852000902534856009102543655001202634IND4440588220221118075213.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444058822DNAL7 a200040022pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Lange, H.J.10aEcological vulnerability in risk assessment — A review and perspectives  ap. 3871-3879.  aIncludes references  aThis paper reviews the application of ecological vulnerability analysis in risk assessment and describes new developments in methodology. For generic non-site-specific assessments (e.g. for the requirements of most European directives on dangerous chemicals) risk is characterised just on the basis of the ratio between an effect indicator and an exposure indicator. However, when the actual risk for a specific ecosystem is desired, the concept of ecological vulnerability may be more appropriate. This calls for a change in thinking, from sensitivity at the organism level to vulnerability at higher organization levels, and thus forms the link from laboratory toxicology to field effects at population, community or ecosystem level. To do so, biological and ecological characteristics of the ecosystems under concern are needed to estimate the ecological vulnerability. In this review we describe different vulnerability analysis methods developed for populations (of a single species), communities (consisting of different populations of species) and ecosystems (community and habitat combined). We also give some examples of methods developed for socio-ecological systems. Aspects that all methods share are the use of expert judgment, the input of stakeholders, ranking and mapping of the results, and the qualitative nature of the results. A new general framework is presented to guide future ecological vulnerability analysis. This framework can be used as part of ecological risk assessment, but also in risk management. We conclude that the further quantification of ecological vulnerability is a valuable contribution to vulnerability assessment. 3aecosystems 3aexpert opinion 3ahabitats 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3astakeholders 3atoxicology 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironment 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aRisk Factors1 aSala, S.1 aVighi, M.1 aFaber, J.H.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 408, no. 18 p.3871-3879dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.11.0093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02395naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245004400175300001600219500019100235520098700426650001101413650001901424650000901443650001301452650001401465650001101479650002501490650001001515650002001525650001201545650002901557650002201586650001201608650001601620651001601636651001601652700001301668773009701681852000901778856008101787930003301868945001301901946001101914655001201925IND2326192920221118075244.0020326e200111  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232619292DNAL7 a117693212pmid7 a10.1007/s0048401001012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDefila, C.10aPhytophenological trends in Switzerland  ap. 203-207.  aPaper prepared in conjuction with the international conference "Progress in Phenology: Monitoring, Data Analysis and Global Change Impacts," held October 4-6, 2000, in Freising, Germany.  aNation-wide phenological observations have been made in Switzerland since 1951. In addition to these observation programmes, there are two very long phenological series in Switzerland: leaf bud burst of horse-chestnut trees has been observed in Geneva since 1808 and full flowering of cherry trees in Liestal since 1894. In addition to the presentation of these two long phenological series, trends for 896 phenological time series have been calculated with national data from 1951 to 1998. The earlier bud burst of horse-chestnut trees in Geneva can be attributed mainly to the city effect (warmth island). This phenomenon was not observed with the cherry tree flowering in Liestal. A clear trend towards earlier appearance dates in spring and a weak tendency towards later appearance dates in autumn could be shown with data from the national observation network. It must be noted that different phenophases and plant species react differently to various environmental influences. 3aautumn 3abioclimatology 3abuds 3acherries 3aflowering 3aspring 3atime series analysis 3atrees 2aAcclimatization 2aClimate 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aPlant Development 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 3aSwitzerland 0aSwitzerland1 aClot, B.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2001 Nov., v. 45, no. 4 p.203-207x0020-71287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0048401001013Available from publisher's Web site  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03084naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001100160245014400171300001400315520160300329650001901932650001701951650002101968650001901989650001602008650001902024650002402043650000902067650002002076650001602096650002302112650001402135650002502149650001202174650002402186650003302210650001702243650001202260651001002272651001002282700001802292700001402310773009502324852000902419856008102428930003302509945001302542946001102555655001202566IND2327598320221118075230.0020617e200107  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232759832DNAL7 a115130472pmid7 a10.1007/s0048400000842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Q.10aApplication of a progressive-difference method to identify climatic factors causing variation in the rice yield in the Yangtze Delta, China  ap. 53-58.  aTime series of rice yields consist of a technology-driven trend and variations caused by climate fluctuations. To explore the relationship between yields and climate, the trend and temporal variation often have to be separated. In this study, a progressive-difference method was applied to eliminate the trend in time series. By differentiating yields and climatic factors in 2 successive years, the relationship between variations in yield and climatic factors was determined with multiple regression analysis. The number of hours of sunshine, the temperature and the precipitation were each defined for different intervals during the growing season and used as different regression variables. Rice yields and climate data for the Yangtze Delta of China from 1961 to 1990 were used as a case study. The number of hours of sunshine during the tillering stage and the heading to milk stage particularly affected the yield. In both periods radiation was low. In the first period, the vegetative organs of the rice crop were formed while in the second period solar radiation was important for grain filling. The average temperature during the tillering to jointing stage reached its maximum, which affected rice yields negatively. Precipitation was generally low during the jointing and booting stages, which had a positive correlation with yield, while high precipitation had a negative effect during the milk stage. The results indicate that the climatic factors should be expressed as 20- to 30-day averages in the Yangtze Delta; a shorter or longer period, e.g. 10 or 40 days, is less appropriate. 3abioclimatology 3acase studies 3aclimatic factors 3afilling period 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3aregression analysis 3arice 3asolar radiation 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3atillering 3atime series analysis 2aClimate 2aModels, Statistical 2aOryzaxgrowth & development. 2aTime Factors 2aWeather 3aChina 0aChina1 aHengsdijk, H.1 aLiu, J.D.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2001 July, v. 45, no. 2 p.53-58x0020-71287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0048400000843Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03783naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001800170245010600188300001800294500002400312520213500336650000802471650002702479650001202506650001402518650001402532650003002546650003502576650001502611650001502626650001502641650001702656650001602673650002602689650003802715650005102753650005702804650002702861650003502888650001302923650002102936650002002957651001102977651001102988700002202999700001703021773011503038852000903153856009103162655001203253IND4440587720221118075250.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444058772DNAL7 a200892952pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPistocchi, A.10aSpatially explicit multimedia fate models for pollutants in Europe: State of the art and perspectives  ap. 3817-3830.  aIncludes references  aA review by Hollander et al. (in preparation), discusses the relative potentials, advantages and shortcomings of spatial and non spatial models of chemical fate, highlighting that spatially explicit models may be needed for specific purposes. The present paper reviews the state of the art in spatially explicit chemical fate and transport modeling in Europe. We summarize the three main approaches currently adopted in spatially explicit modeling, namely (1) multiple box models, (2) numerical solutions of simultaneous advection-dispersion equations (ADE) in air, soil and water, and (3) the development of meta-models. As all three approaches experience limitations, we describe in further detail geographic information system (GIS)-based modeling as an alternative approach allowing a simple, yet spatially explicit description of chemical fate. We review the input data needed, and the options available for their retrieval at the European scale. We also discuss the importance of, and limitations in model evaluation. We observe that the high uncertainty in chemical emissions and physico-chemical behavior in the environment make realistic simulations difficult to obtain. Therefore we envisage a shift in model use from process simulation to hypothesis testing, in which explaining the discrepancies between observed and computed chemical concentrations in the environment takes importance over prediction per se. This shift may take advantage of using simple models in GIS with residual uses of complex models for detailed studies. It also calls for tighter joint interpretation of models and spatially distributed monitoring datasets, and more refined spatial representation of environmental drivers such as landscape and climate variables, and better emission estimates. In summary, we conclude that the problem is not “how to compute” (i.e. emphasis on numerical methods, spatial/temporal discretization, quantitative uncertainty and sensitivity analysis…) but “what to compute” (i.e. emphasis on spatial distribution of emissions, and the depiction of appropriate spatial patterns of environmental drivers). 3aair 3achemical concentration 3aclimate 3aemissions 3aequations 3afate and transport models 3ageographic information systems 3apollutants 3aprediction 3asoil water 3aspatial data 3auncertainty 2aAtmospherexchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aSoilxanalysis. 3aEurope 0aEurope1 aSarigiannis, D.A.1 aVizcaino, P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 408, no. 18 p.3817-3830dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.10.0463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02639naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001800170245006600188300001800254500002400272520107600296650002001372650002001392650001901412650001501431650000901446650001901455650001101474650002201485650002101507650000901528650001301537650001201550650001301562650002101575650002801596650004601624650006101670650004401731700001701775700001801792700002301810700001601833700001701849700001101866700001701877773011501894852000902009856009102018655001202109IND4440587320221118075416.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444058732DNAL7 a201851632pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.01.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitrova, N.10aElimination kinetic model for organic chemicals in earthworms  ap. 3787-3793.  aIncludes references  aMechanistic understanding of bioaccumulation in different organisms and environments should take into account the influence of organism and chemical depending factors on the uptake and elimination kinetics of chemicals.

This study attempts to model elimination kinetics of organic chemicals in earthworms by accounting for the effects of both chemical and biological properties, including metabolism. The modeling approach that has been developed is based on the concept for simulating metabolism used in the BCF base-line model developed for predicting bioaccumulation in fish. Metabolism was explicitly accounted for by making use of the TIMES engine for simulation of metabolism and a set of principal transformations.

The present study was conducted to elucidate the role of glutamine synthetase, glutaminase and glycogen synthetase under conditions of chronic intermittent hypoxia. Four groups, each consisting of 12 male albino rats (Wistar strain), were exposed to a simulated altitude of 7620 m in a hypobaric chamber for 6 h per day for 1, 7, 14 and 21 days, respectively. Blood haemoglobin, blood glucose, protein levels in the liver, muscle and plasma, glycogen content, and glutaminase, glutamine synthetase and glycogen synthetase activities in liver and muscle were determined in all groups of exposed and in a group of unexposed animals. Food intake and changes in body mass were also monitored. There was a significant reduction in body mass (28-30%) in hypoxia-exposed groups as compared to controls, with a corresponding decrease in food intake. There was rise in blood haemoglobin and plasma protein in response to acclimatisation. Over a three-fold increase in liver glycogen content was observed following 1 day of hypoxic exposure (4.76 +/- 0.78 mg(.)g-1 wet tissue in normal unexposed rats; 15.82 +/- 2.30 mg(.)g-1 wet tissue in rats exposed to hypoxia for 1 day). This returned to normal in later stages of exposure. However, there was no change in glycogen synthetase activity except for a decrease in the 21-days hypoxia-exposed group. There was a slight increase in muscle glycogen content in the 1-day exposed group which declined significantly by 56.5, 50.6 and 42% following 7, 14, and 21 days of exposure, respectively. Muscle glycogen synthetase activity was also decreased following 21 days of exposure. There was an increase in glutaminase activity in the liver and muscle in the 7-, 14- and 21-day exposed groups. Glutamine synthetase activity was higher in the liver in 7- and 14-day exposed groups; this returned to normal following 21 days of exposure. Glutamine synthetase activity in muscle was significantly higher in the 14-day exposed group (4.32 micromol gamma-glutamyl hydroxamate formed(.)g protein-1(.)min-1) in comparison to normal (1.53 micromol gamma-glutamyl hydroxamate formed(.)g protein-1(.)min-1); this parameter had decreased by 40% following 21 days of exposure. These results suggest that since no dramatic changes in the levels of protein were observed in the muscle and liver, there is an alteration in glutaminase and glutamine synthetase activity in order to maintain nitrogen metabolism in the initial phase of hypoxic exposure. 3aacclimation 3aaltitude 3abioclimatology 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3afood intake 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutaminase 3aglycogen 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3ahemoglobin 3ahypoxia 3aliver 3amales 3amuscles 3anitrogen metabolism 3aprotein metabolism 3arats 0ahigh altitude1 aMukherjee, A.K.1 aKumria, M.M.L.1 aSingh, S.N.1 aPatil, S.K.B.1 aRangnathan, S.1 aSridharan, K.0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g1999 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.205-209x0020-71287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0048400501063Available from publisher's Web site  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03023naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001800154245014000172300001600312500002400328500002300352520137100375650002001746650001601766650001501782650001401797650002201811650002201833650000901855650002701864650001401891650003101905650004701936650005101983650003602034650001402070650003602084650002602120651001102146651001102157651001102168700002402179700001802203700002102221700002902242700001802271773012002289852000902409856007502418655001202493IND4440497520221118075206.0100728s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444049752DNAL7 a206168762pmid7 a10.1139/g10-0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatzak, Josef10aEvaluation of genetic variability of wild hops (Humulus lupulus L.) in Canada and the Caucasus region by chemical and molecular methods  ap. 545-557.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aWild hops (Humulus lupulus L.) are potential new germplasms to expand the variability of genetic resources for hop breeding. We evaluated Canadian (62 plants) and Caucasian (58 plants) wild hops by their chemical characteristics and with molecular genetic analyses using sequence-tagged site and simple sequence repeat markers, in comparison with European (104 plants) and North American (27 plants) wild hops. The contents of alpha and beta acids varied from 0.36% to 5.11% and from 0.43% to 6.66% in Canadian wild hops, and from 0.85% to 3.65% and from 1.22% to 4.81% in Caucasian wild hops, respectively. The contents of cohumulone and colupulone distinctly differed between European and North American wild hops: the cohumulone level in alpha acids was in the range 46.1%–68.4% among North American wild hops and in the range 13.6%–30.6% among European wild hops. The high content of myrcene and the low contents of humulene, farnesene, and selinenes were typical for wild hops from Canada, in contrast to wild hops from the Caucasus region. We compared the chemical characteristics with molecular genetic data. Chemical characteristics differentiated wild hops into North American and Eurasian groups. Molecular genetic analysis was able to separate Caucasian wild hops from European wild hops. We proved a hop phylogeny by means of wide molecular analysis. 3aHumulus lupulus 3aalpha acids 3abeta acids 3afarnesene 3agenetic resources 3agenetic variation 3ahops 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphylogeny 2aCyclohexanonesxmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxmetabolism 2aHumulusxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMinisatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aSequence Tagged Sites 3aCanada 0aCanada 0aRussia1 aNesvadba, Vladimír1 aKrofta, Karel1 aHenychova, Alena1 aMarzoev, Arkady Inalovic1 aRichards, Ken0 tGenome =.g2010 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.545-557dNRC Research Press, National Research Council Canadax0831-27967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/g10-0243Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02117naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001200148245014100160300001600301500002400317520112300341650001901464650001501483650001701498650001101515650001301526650001601539700001901555700002001574773011201594852000901706856008801715655001201803IND4440487120221118074835.0100727s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444048712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2010.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Qin10aDirect measurement of paraquat in leaf protoplasts indicates vacuolar paraquat sequestration as a resistance mechanism in Lolium rigidum  ap. 104-109.  aIncludes references  aSequestration of paraquat away from its target site in the chloroplast has been proposed as a mechanism of paraquat resistance. However, no consensus has been reached as to where paraquat is sequestered. This study quantifies paraquat in leaf protoplasts of paraquat resistant (R) and susceptible (S) Lolium rigidum. Intact protoplasts were prepared from plants treated with commercial dose of paraquat for 2 h. Paraquat absorbed by the leaf protoplasts was determined by light absorption of reduced paraquat following concentration and purification using a cation-exchange resin. Leaf protoplasts from treated paraquat resistant plants contained 2- to 3-fold more paraquat than leaf protoplasts isolated from susceptible plants. Since paraquat is not metabolised in L. rigidum and paraquat readily enters chloroplasts of both R and S plants, this greater amount of paraquat in leaf protoplasts of R plant must be kept away from the target site (chloroplast). This result indicates that paraquat resistance in L. rigidum is associated with a cytoplasmic mechanism, most likely a greater rate of vacuolar sequestration. 3aLolium rigidum 3aabsorption 3achloroplasts 3aleaves 3aparaquat 3aprotoplasts1 aHuang, Shaobai1 aPowles, Stephen0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2010 Sept., v. 98, no. 1 p.104-109dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2010.05.0073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03667naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245011800165300001400283500002400297520216700321650001102488650002502499650001302524650001302537650001702550650001702567650001102584650001802595650001602613650002702629650003602656650001902692650001902711650001102730650002302741650001002764650003402774650002102808650002202829650001302851650000902864650002502873650001402898700001402912700001602926773011002942852000903052856008803061655001203149IND4440483720221118074910.0100727s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444048372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2010.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatti, G.K.10aModulation of ethion-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress by vitamin E supplementation in male Wistar rats  ap. 26-32.  aIncludes references  aOrganophosphorus insecticides (OPIs) may induce oxidative stress leading to generation of free radicals and alteration in antioxidant system of animals. Many studies reported that enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant may play protective role against OPIs induced toxicity in human and rats. The aim of present study was to investigate the possible protective role of vitamin E on ethion-induced hepatotoxicity in rats using qualitative, quantitative and biochemical approaches. Adult male albino rats of Wistar strain were randomly divided into four groups; each group consists of six animals. Animals were treated for a period of 28 days. Group I (control group received corn oil); Group II [ethion treated (2.7 mg/kg bw/day)]; Group III (vitamin E treated (50 mg/kg of bw/day)]; Group IV (ethion + vitamin E treated). Animals were sacrificed after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days by decapitation and liver tissue was used for the measurement of proteins, lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione (GSH) content and activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Erythrocytes were analyzed for acetyl cholinesterase activity. The result of this study shows that in vivo administration of ethion caused a significant induction of oxidative damage in liver tissue as evidenced by increased level of LPO and decreased GSH content. Ethion toxicity also led to a significant increase in the activities of SOD, CAT, GPx and GST in liver tissue. In addition, decrease in GR activity was observed in ethion administered rats compared to control. Histopathological findings revealed that exposure to ethion caused damage in liver tissue. However, simultaneous supplementation with vitamin E restored these parameters partially. In conclusion, the results of the current study revealed that ethion-induced toxicity caused lipid peroxidation, alterations in the antioxidant enzymes and histopathological changes in liver. Supplementation of vitamin E exhibited protective effect by inhibiting ethion-induced toxicity in liver and erythrocytes. 3aalbino 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3acorn oil 3adecapitation 3aerythrocytes 3aethion 3afree radicals 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3arats 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avitamin E1 aKiran, R.1 aSandhir, R.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2010 Sept., v. 98, no. 1 p.26-32dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2010.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03393naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002500157245012700182300001600309500002400325500001500349520143400364650001301798650001601811650001801827650001001845650002201855650001201877650001201889650001801901650002401919650001301943650002801956650001301984650001501997650002002012650001502032650002002047650001402067650002102081650002402102650003302126650003902159650003802198650004802236650003702284650002802321650001402349650004202363650001302405650002202418650002502440650002602465653001002491700002302501700001902524773011302543852000902656856007802665655001202743IND4403343820221118074858.0080321e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440334382DNAL7 a183100832pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ern0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhaubhadel, Sangeeta10aIdentification and characterization of isoflavonoid specific glycosyltransferase and malonyltransferase from soybean seeds  ap. 981-994.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIsoflavonoids are a diverse group of biologically active natural products that accumulate in soybean seeds during development. The majority of isoflavonoids are accumulated in the form of their glyco- and malonyl-conjugates in soybean seeds. The conjugation step confers stability and solubility to isoflavone aglycones enabling their compartmentalization to vacuoles or transport to the site of accumulation. A functional genomic approach was used to identify isoflavonoid specific glycosyltransferase (UGT) and malonyltransferase (MT) from soybean (Glycine max) seeds. An expressed sequence tag database for soybean was searched by key words to make a list of candidate genes. The full-length cDNAs for candidate UGTs and MTs were obtained and cloned into an expression vector for the production of recombinant enzymes. The in vitro enzymatic activity assays were conducted for recombinant UGTs and MTs using uridine diphosphate glucose and malonyl CoA, respectively, as donors with isoflavone substrates. Among several recombinant enzymes, UGT73F2 showed glycosylation activity towards all three soybean isoflavone aglycones and GmMT7 exhibited malonylation activity towards isoflavone glycosides. The subcellular localization study revealed both UGT73F2 and GmMT7 to be in the cytoplasm. The transcripts and protein accumulation patterns for UGT73F2 and GmMT7 genes have provided further support for their in planta function. 3aproteins 3aGlycine max 3aisoflavonoids 3aseeds 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymes 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3auridine diphosphate 3asoybeans 3aexpressed sequence tags 3avacuoles 3asolubility 3aenzyme activity 3aglycosides 3agenetic vectors 3adatabases 3aseed development 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlycosyltransferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHerb-Drug Interactionsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlasmids 2aSeedsxenzymology 2aSoybeansxenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 0agenes1 aFarhangkhoee, Mana1 aChapman, Ralph0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 Mar., v. 59, no. 4 p.981-994dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern0463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04119naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010100183300001600284500002400300520164300324650001801967650001701985650002102002650002202023650001602045650002102061650002002082650001002102650001602112650002102128650001902149650001202168650003002180650001602210650000902226650001002235650001102245650002402256650001702280650002902297650004102326650002002367650002302387650002902410650005202439650002702491650003102518650005402549650002302603650006402626650004202690650003102732650005202763650006202815653001602877653003102893653002902924653002002953653003502973700002003008700001503028700002303043700002903066700002203095700003003117773010803147852000903255856008503264655001203349IND4440432520221118075027.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444043252DNAL7 a200910792pmid7 a10.1007/s10142-009-0155-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Mankesh12aA candidate gene OsAPC6 of anaphase-promoting complex of rice identified through T-DNA insertion  ap. 349-358.  aIncludes references  aA dwarf mutant (Oryza sativa anaphase-promoting complex 6 (OsAPC6)) of rice cultivar Basmati 370 with 50% reduced plant height as compared to the wild type was isolated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using HmR Ds cassette. This mutant was found to be insensitive to exogenous gibberellic acid (GA₃) application. Homozygous mutant plants showed incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity for plant height and pleiotropic effects including gibberellic acid insensitivity, reduced seed size, panicle length, and female fertility. Single copy insertion of T-DNA and its association with OsAPC6 was confirmed by Southern hybridization, germination on hygromycin, and 3:1 segregation of HPT gene in F₂ from OsAPC6 × Basmati 370 cross. The T-DNA flanking region sequenced through thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction showed a single hit on chromosome 3 of japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare in the second exonic region of a gene which encodes for sixth subunit of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. The candidate gene of 8.6-kb length encodes a 728-amino acid protein containing a conserved tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and has only a paralog, isopenicillin N-synthase family protein on the same chromosome without the TPR domain. There was no expression of the gene in the mutant while in Basmati 370, it was equal in both roots and shoots. The knockout mutant OsAPC6 interferes with the gibberellic acid signaling pathway leading to reduced height and cell size probably through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Further functional validation of the gene through RNAi is in progress. 3aAgrobacterium 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA interference 3aSouthern blotting 3achromosomes 3afemale fertility 3agene expression 3agenes 3agermination 3agibberellic acid 3ainflorescences 3amutants 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproteolysis 3arice 3aroots 3ashoots 3asignal transduction 3atransfer DNA 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 2aAnaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome 2aAutoradiography 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGibberellinsxpharmacology 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOryzaxanatomy & histologyxcytologyxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aBasmati 370 0aAnaphase-promoting complex 0aTetratricopeptide repeat 0aT-DNA insertion 0aGibberellic acid insensitivity1 aBasha, P.

Historically, a number of models have been explored to predict the potential combined effects of chemicals on species. These models, especially concentration addition and the independent action, have been applied to a number of mixtures. While often providing a good prediction of joint effect, there are cases where these models can have limitations: notably in cases where there are interactions for which they fail to adequately predict joint effects. To support the better mechanistic understanding of interactions in mixture toxicology a framework to support experimental studies to investigate the basis of observed interactions is proposed. The conceptual framework is derived from the extension of a three stage scheme which has previously been applied to understand chemical bioavailability. The framework considers that interactions in mixtures result from processes related to 1) the speciation, binding and transport of chemicals in the exposure medium (external exposure); 2) the adsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of chemicals within the organisms (toxicokinetics); 3) associations governing the binding and toxicity of the chemical(s) at the target site (toxicodynamics). The current state of the art in (eco)toxicology in relation to investigation of the mechanisms of interactions between chemicals is discussed with particular emphasis towards the multi-disciplinary tools and techniques within environmental chemistry; toxicology; biochemistry and systems biology that can be used to address such effects. 3aprediction 3aecotoxicology 3abioavailability 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3amethodology 3atoxicity 3apharmacokinetics 3aexcretion 3aadsorption 2aBiotransformation 2aComplex Mixturesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aDrug Interactions 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aSystems Analysis 0anew methods1 aJones, Oliver A.H.1 aDorne, Jean-Lou C.M.1 aSvendsen, Claus1 aSwain, Suresh1 aStürzenbaum, Stephen R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 408, no. 18 p.3725-3734dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.02.0383Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02520naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245012900174300001800303500002400321500001500345520111600360650001301476650002101489650001101510650001101521650002501532650001201557650001201569650001301581650001801594650001901612650002301631650001801654650001001672650001901682653001901701700002201720700002001742700002001762773019801782852000901980856008501989655001202074IND4440533420221118074952.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444053342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2010.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChassagne-Berces, Sophie10aFreezing protocol effect on quality properties of fruit tissue according to the fruit, the variety and the stage of maturity  ap. 1441-1449.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAmong the changes induced by freezing of fruits, it is still difficult to determine the major properties which are the most representative of quality variation. A range of characteristics (texture, color, soluble solids, water activity, water content, pH, titrable acidity) were determined before and after three different freezing protocols (at −20 °C in a cold chamber, at −80 °C in gas nitrogen convection chamber and after immersion in liquid nitrogen at −196 °C) for two fruit types (apple-Malus domestica Borkh- and mango – Mangifera indica L. cv. ‘KENT’-), two varieties of apples (Golden Delicious and Granny Smith) and two maturities of one variety (ripe and unripe Granny Smith). Freezing induced significant changes mostly in texture, color and soluble solids. Property variations due to freezing depended mainly on the type of fruit, to a lesser extent on the variety of apples studied and slightly on the maturity of Granny Smith apples. Among the freezing conditions tested, gas nitrogen convection at −80 °C appeared to be the best choice for limiting fruit quality degradation. 3afreezing 3aMangifera indica 3aapples 3afruits 3atotal soluble solids 3atexture 3amangoes 3anitrogen 3afruit quality 3amaturity stage 3atitratable acidity 3awater content 3acolor 3awater activity 0asoluble solids1 aFonseca, Fernanda1 aCiteau, Morgane1 aMarin, Michèle0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2010 Nov., v. 43, no. 9 p.1441-1449dPublished for the Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology by Academic PresswJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2010.04.0043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02562naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012600161300001800287500002400305520131600329650001801645650001201663650001101675650001401686650002401700650001901724650002001743650000701763650002001770650001401790650002001804650001601824650001801840700002601858773019801884852000902082856008502091655001202176IND4440532820221118074703.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444053282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2010.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoopa, B.S.10aTexturized alginate gels: Screening experiments to identify the important variables on gel formation and their properties  ap. 1403-1408.  aIncludes references  aA screening experiment for the formation of alginate gels with eight variables like sodium alginate (3–5 g/100 g), calcium orthophosphate (1.5–2.5 g/100 g), glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) (1.5–2.5 g/100 g), pineapple juice (0–78 g/100 g) and sugar (0–12 g/100 g) and gel-setting variables such as pH (7–9), temperature (10–40°C) and time of gel setting (6–24 h) has been designed by employing Plackett–Burman experimental design. The response functions were the compressive textural parameters namely peak force, irrecoverable compression area or energy and strain, Young’s modulus, and the model parameters like rigidity constant (k) and degree of concavity (n). The formation of an elastic gel is favored at high pH and temperatures while the level of pineapple juice and sugar should be low. Addition of pineapple juice offers a soft gel with low stiffness/rigidity. The experimental results relating the variables and response functions fitted well (0.938 ≤ r ≤ 0.996, p ≤ 0.01) by multivariate linear equations indicating the suitability of the Plackett–Burman design to identify important variables of gel formation. Among the variables, in general, the effect of pineapple juice > glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) > sodium alginate > temperature while other variables had marginal effects. 3aalginate gels 3acalcium 3aenergy 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3agluconolactone 3aorthophosphates 3apH 3apineapple juice 3ascreening 3asodium alginate 3atemperature 3atexturization1 aBhattacharya, Suvendu0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2010 Nov., v. 43, no. 9 p.1403-1408dPublished for the Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology by Academic PresswJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2010.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02427naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011900163300001800282500002400300520109900324650002001423650002501443650001701468650001201485650001301497650001201510650001801522650001401540650001701554650001401571650001301585650001001598650001501608650001601623650002201639650001801661700003401679773019801713852000901911856008501920655001202005IND4440532520221118074705.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444053252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2010.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonsoula, Zoe10aEffect of endogenous antioxidants of sesame seeds and sesame oil to the thermal stability of edible vegetable oils  ap. 1379-1386.  aIncludes references  aDifferently processed sesame seeds were used for the preparation of sesamol, seed extract, oil extract or unsaponifiable matter. Analysis of these sesame extracts revealed that dehulling and roasting of seeds had an adverse effect on their lignan and phenolic compounds content. Various concentrations of the extracts were incorporated in vegetable oils and their effectiveness in retarding the oxidative deterioration of oils was evaluated. Additionally, the formation of oxidation products in these oil samples was correlated with their antioxidant activity and their sesamol and phenolic compounds content. Results indicated that decomposition of phenolic compounds present in oil samples induced a significant reduction in their linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition capacity and a corresponding increase in their oxidative rancidity. Sesame seed extract was the most effective in protecting oils from oxidation, suggesting that seed extract, especially the one prepared from coated-unroasted sesame seeds, may have potential application as a source of natural antioxidants in oil industry. 3aadverse effects 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ahulling 3aindustry 3alignans 3alinoleic acid 3aoxidation 3aperoxidation 3arancidity 3aroasting 3aseeds 3asesame oil 3asesame seed 3athermal stability 3avegetable oil1 aLiakopoulou-Kyriakides, Maria0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2010 Nov., v. 43, no. 9 p.1379-1386dPublished for the Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology by Academic PresswJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2010.04.0163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03260naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245011100178300001400289500001900303500002400322520217300346650001302519650003002532650003002562650001602592650001802608650001402626700002402640700001702664700002802681700002002709773011702729852000902846856005502855655001202910IND4434820620221118074728.0100402e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443482062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-8903.2010.00509.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindenmayer, David B.14aThe importance of temperate woodland in travelling stock reserves for vertebrate biodiversity conservation  ap. 27-30.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aTravelling stock reserves have well recognised and important commercial, cultural and other values in the pastoral and agricultural regions of Australia, but their conservation values remain poorly known. In general, many areas of woodlands within travelling stock reserves have not been subjected to the same high levels of degradation pressure as similar temperate woodlands on private land. In this study, we compared several measures of vertebrate biota in 217 permanent field sites located in travelling stock reserves and woodland remnants located almost exclusively on private land in the Murray Riverina and South West Slopes bioregions in southern New South Wales. We found that in comparison with temperate woodland remnants on private land, temperate woodland in travelling stock reserves tended to support more species of birds, more species of declining birds, and a greater abundance of arboreal marsupials. Temperate woodland in travelling stock reserves was more likely to be occupied by particular individual species of birds of conservation concern. However, such tenure differences were not consistent between bioregions. For example, the Rufous Whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris) and the Red-capped Robin (Petroica goodenovii ) were significantly more likely to occupy temperate woodland in travelling stock reserves than temperate woodland on private land in the Murray Riverina but such effects were not apparent in the South West Slopes. Similarly, while the Grey-crowned Babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis) was significantly more likely to occupy temperate woodland in travelling stock reserve sites in the South West Slopes, we found the opposite effect in Murray Riverina. We demonstrated that travelling stock reserves have important conservation values for some taxa and individual species. Because of the paucity of large ecological reserves in the Murray Riverina and South West Slopes bioregions, temperate woodlands located in travelling stock reserves should be considered as an important resource that contributes to a portfolio of vegetation assets in formerly woodland-dominated, but now extensively cleared, agricultural landscapes. 3aPetroica 3aadministrative management 3abiodiversity conservation 3apastoralism 3aprivate lands 3awoodlands1 aCunningham, Ross B.1 aCrane, Mason1 aMontague-Drake, Rebecca1 aMichael, Damian0 tEcological management & restoration.g2010 Apr., v. 11, no. 1 p.27-30dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1442-70017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-8903.2010.00509.x 7aarticle01380naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245009500171300001600266500002400282520042300306650002000729650000900749650001200758650001100770650002300781650001100804650001300815700002000828700001700848773012300865852000900988856005700997655001201054IND4456229920221118074750.0110408e198803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445622992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1988.tb01119.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiff, N.M.10aDietary self-selection for vitamins and lipid by larvae of the corn earworm, Heliothis zea  ap. 249-256.  aIncludes references  aLast instar larvae of the corn earworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), require lipid and certain vitamins in their diet in order to complete larval development.

Although the bacteria bound FN poorly at pH above 7, brief acid pretreatment greatly enhanced FN binding within the pH range (3 to 10) studied. A 4.6-kbp fragment from an M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis genomic library was found to contain a 1,107-bp open reading frame that shows very high nucleotide sequence identity with that of the FN attachment protein (FAP) gene of M. avium subsp. avium. Pretreatment of FN with an FN-binding peptide from M. avium subsp. avium FAP abolished FN binding, indicating that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis binds FN in a FAP-dependent manner. Pretreatment of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis with anti-FAP immunoglobulin G did not abrogate FN binding; blocking occurred only when anti-FAP was added together with FN. FAP was detected by immunofluorescence only in lipid-extracted M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Western blotting and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that FAP is located near the interior of the cell envelope of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The results indicate that a FAP homologue mediates the attachment of FN to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Further, given the subcellular location of FAP, it is considered that this protein operates at the terminus of a coordinated FN binding system in the cell envelope of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. avium 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aWestern blotting 3abacteria 3aepithelial cells 3afibronectins 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amicroscopy 3amucosa 3aopen reading frames 3apH 3aparatuberculosis 3apathogenesis 3apeptides 3asequence analysis 2aAdhesins, Bacterialxanalysisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aFibronectinsxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aOpen Reading Frames 0amolecular sequence data1 aLin, T.L.1 aWu, C.C.0 tInfection and immunity.g2001 Apr., v. 69, no. 4 p.2075-2082x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.69.4.2075-2082.20013Available from publisher's Web site  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle01725naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245007200137300001800209300003200227520081300259650001301072650001301085650001601098650002201114650001201136650001601148650001601164650001801180653003501198773009101233852000901324939003301333945000801366946001301374655001201387991630196200742620221118074458.0840720e198312  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840051992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHafez, Youssef S.10aNutrient composition of different varieties and strains of soybeans  ap. 1197-1206.  ap. 1197-1206. ill., charts.  aExtract: Fifty five varieties and strains of soybeans were analyzed for protein and oil contents. Nineteen varieties and strains were selected for determining trypsin inhibitors, lipoxygenase activities, fatty acids and amino acids. The protein contents ranged from 39.03 to 51.23 gm/100 gm dry matter. The oil contents ranged from 11.96 to 21.50 gm/100 gm dry matter. High correlation between protein and oil contents was calculated. In 19 varieties and strains of soybean, trypsin defatted sample, and lipoxygenase activity ranged from 4354 to 9521 units/mg defatted sample. The correlations between lipoxygenase activity and oil content of the seeds was 41.7% between lipoxygenase activity and total unsaturated fatty acids was 26.2% and between lopoxygenase activity and linoleic acid was 56.6%.

Nanoparticles were prepared via non-hydrolytic solution process using zinc acetate di-hydrate (Zn(CH₃COO)₂·2H₂O) and aniline (C₆H₅NH₂) in 6 h refluxing at ∼65 °C. In the presence of four pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antibacterial study of zinc oxide nanoparticles were observed. The antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) were studied by spectroscopic method taking different concentrations (5-45 μg/ml) of ZnO-NPs. Our investigation reveals that the lowest concentration of ZnO-NPs solution inhibiting the growth of microbial strain is found to be 5 μg/ml for K. pneumoniae, whereas for E. coli, S. aureus, and S. typhimurium, it was calculated to be 15 μg/ml. The diameter of each ZnO-NPs lies between “20 and 30 nm” as observed from FESEM and transmission electron microscopy images. The composition of synthesized material was analyzed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and it shows the band of ZnO at 441 cm⁻¹. Additionally, on the basis of morphological and chemical observations, the chemical reaction mechanism of ZnO-NPs was also proposed. 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aacetates 3azinc 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3azinc oxide 3amicrobial growth 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aaniline 3atransmission electron microscopy 3ananoparticles 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaexdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aNanoparticlesxchemistry 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aZinc Oxidexpharmacology 0aPathogenic bacteria 0aFTIR spectroscopy 0aZnO nanoparticles and antibacterial activity 0aX-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0aPL spectroscopy1 aMishra, Amrita1 aYun, Soon-Il1 aKim, Yŏng-sun.1 aShin, Hyung-Shik0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 87, no. 5 p.1917-1925dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2692-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02026naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245012400182300001800306500002400324520052100348650002100869650002800890650001100918650001400929650001800943650001400961650000700975650001600982650002300998650004401021650004801065650002601113650006301139650001601202653001301218653001201231653002801243653002401271700001601295700001801311700001801329773010301347852000901450856008501459655001201544IND4440059920221118074642.0100716s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444005992DNAL7 a203612322pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-010-0261-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jianjun12aA novel esterase Sso2518 from Sulfolobus solfataricus with a much lower temperature optimum than the growth temperature  ap. 1103-1108.  aIncludes references  aAn esterase, Sso2518, from Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 was over-expressed in E. coli. and characterized after purification.

Facilitation and dispersal are the primary mechanisms responsible for the formation of spatial patterns. Furthermore, disruptions in the formation of patterns arise after degradation, which can serve as an early indicator of stress in plant communities. Spatial dispersal ability and pattern formation were evaluated in 53 linear transects of 500 m in length within 14 fragments of natural vegetation within a matrix of abandoned crop fields in Cabo de Gata National Park, Almería, Spain. Fragments were classified into three size classes (< 300, 300-900, and > 900 ha). Fragment connectivity was quantified using the distances between fragments. Spatial dispersal ability was quantified for the 187 species recorded in the study. Species with restricted dispersal had the highest degree of long-range spatial autocorrelation and, species that disperse by biotic vectors (e.g. vertebrates), the lowest. In addition, species most susceptible to fragmentation are vertebrate-dispersed shrubs, which declined in abundance and was associated with loss of spatial organization in the smallest fragments. It is postulated that the positive feedback between abundance of recruitment and vertebrate visits influences the colonization and persistence of vertebrate-dispersed shrubs, explaining its abundance in large fragments. Indeed, fragments lower than a certain threshold reduced spatial organization not only in shrubs with biotic dispersal, but also in species with abiotic dispersal (mainly wind) and with restricted dispersal. Fragments lower than a certain threshold may be vulnerable to a cascade of species loss because of reduced recruitment, establishment and patch biomass as a result of natural senescence, finally breaking up facilitative plant interactions. 3anational parks 3aplant stress 3ashrubs 3aplant communities 3alandscapes 3avertebrates 3aautocorrelation 3avegetation 3abiogeography 3aSpain 0arecruitment 0asenescence 0afragmentation 0adetrended fluctuating analyses 0aself-organization 0adispersal1 aNAVARRO, TERESA1 aKOMAC, BENJAMIN1 aPascual, Virginia.1 aRietkerk, Max.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2010 Aug., v. 100, no. 4 p.935-947dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01465.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02731naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002800148245013700176300001600313500002400329520161600353650002501969650001201994650001302006650001102019650001102030650002302041650003902064650001502103650002402118651001002142700002102152773011102173852000902284856008802293655001202381IND4439863620221118074521.0100713s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443986362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2010.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El-Latif, Ashraf O.10aPyrethroid synergists suppress esterase-mediated resistance in Indian strains of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner)  ap. 279-288.  aIncludes references  aThe role of esterase in pyrethroid resistance was studied in the final larval instar of different strains of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The resistant strains viz., Nagpur strain and the Delhi strain were found to have elevated midgut esterase activity in comparison to the susceptible strain. Nagpur strain and Delhi strain have 2.24 and 1.73-fold higher esterase activity, respectively, than that of the susceptible strain. The Native PAGE displayed important differences in the midgut esterase isozyme pattern between the susceptible and the pyrethroid-resistant strains. Out of the 10 esterase isozyme observed, susceptible strain lacked three bands, E2, E6 and E10 that were found in the resistant strains. The potency of the synergists piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and dihydrodillapiole (DDA) as esterase inhibitor were also studied both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro results clearly show that both PBO and DDA inhibited esterase activity in the two resistant strains, while there was almost no esterase inhibition in the homogenate of the susceptible strain. The in vivo inhibition studies (topical application of PBO and DDA followed by biochemical analysis) illustrated that PBO- and DDA-esterase binding is rather slow and non permanent process. Esterase inhibition did not occur immediately after the synergist treatment but at 4 and 8 h post treatment in case of PBO and DDA, respectively. Native PAGE revealed that the in vivo esterase inhibition caused by both PBO and DDA was due to the binding of the synergist with the E6 isozyme which was not present in the susceptible strain. 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3ainstars 3aisozymes 3alarvae 3amidgut 3apiperonyl butoxide 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asynergists 3atopical application 3aIndia1 aSubrahmanyam, B.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2010 July, v. 97, no. 3 p.279-288dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2010.03.0093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02965naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245009900182300001800281500002400299500001500323520128400338650001201622650001501634650001301649650001401662650001101676650002801687650001201715650002301727650002601750650003701776650003001813650004301843650002401886650003201910650007001942650002102012653004302033653002302076653002502099653002502124653002202149700002002171700001702191700001802208773011502226852000902341856008502350655001202435IND4440680520221118074626.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444068052DNAL7 a205492032pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2683-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIke, Masakazu10aCellulase production on glucose-based media by the UV-irradiated mutants of Trichoderma reesei  ap. 2059-2066.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFrom 22,791 mutants of a cellulase hyper-producing strain of Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina), ATCC66589, as the parent, we selected two mutants, M2-1 and M3-1, that produce cellulases in media containing both cellulose and glucose. The mutation enabled the mutants to produce cellulases, which were measured as p-nitrophenyl β-d-lactopyranoside-hydrolyzing activities, in media with glucose as a sole carbon source, although M2-1 exhibited different sensitivities to glucose from M3-1. When the mutants were grown for 8 days on a medium with cellulose as a sole carbon source, the filter-paper-degrading activities (FPAs) per gram of cellulose were 257 and 281 U for M2-1 and M3-1, respectively, values that were 1.1-1.2 times higher than that of the parental strain. Cellulase production by M2-1 and M3-1 on a medium with a continuously fed mixture of glucose and cellobiose resulted in 214 and 210 U of FPA/gram carbon sources, respectively, whereas less efficient production (140 U of FPA/gram carbon source) was achieved by the parental strain. The improved cellulase productivity of the mutants allows us to use glucose as a carbon source for efficient on-site production of cellulases with quality/quantity-controlled feeding of soluble carbon sources and inducers. 3aglucose 3acellobiose 3amutation 3acellulose 3acarbon 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3amutants 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aultraviolet radiation 2aCellulasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCulture Mediaxmetabolism 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aMutationxradiation effects 2aTrichodermaxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aTrichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) 0aRandom mutagenesis 0aCellulase production 0aGlucose-based medium 0aHypocrea jecorina1 aPark, Jeung-yil1 aTabuse, Mine1 aTokuyasu, Ken0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 87, no. 6 p.2059-2066dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2683-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03325naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013900171300001800310520163100328650001601959650002201975650001101997650001802008650001602026650003002042650000902072650001002081650002702091650001502118650001802133650001702151650001002168650001002178650001102188650001402199650002102213650001202234650001202246650001102258650001402269650001502283650002502298650003402323650000902357650001402366650001102380650001002391650001302401651001802414700002102432700001702453700001902470773017402489856005102663852000902714655001202723IND60408714020221118075057.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871402DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-3642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorak, Katherine10aEnvironmental Contaminant Concentrations in Canada Goose (Branta canadensis) Muscle: Probabilistic Risk Assessment for Human Consumers  ap. 1634-1641.  aThe issue of food insecurity affects millions of people in the United States every year. Often these people rely on soup kitchens, food banks, and shelters for proper meals, and these organizations often depend on donations to meet needs. One of the most limited food resources is meat. To help alleviate this problem, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services donates more than 60 tons of wild game (deer, moose, feral hogs, goats, geese, and ducks) to a variety of charitable organizations each year. Although commercially produced meat routinely undergoes screening for contaminants, potential exposure to environmental contaminants from eating wild game is not well characterized. In this study, the concentration of 17 contaminants of concern in the breast meat of wild geese was examined. These concentrations were then used in a probabilistic model to estimate potential risk associated with consumption of this meat. Based on model predictions, more than 99 % of all adults were below exposure limits for all of the compounds tested. For all consumer age classes modeled, consumption of wild goose meat may expose a small fraction of these populations to levels of lead higher than the recommended exposure limits. Similarly, mercury exposure was predicted to be higher than the recommended limits when the meat was served as steaks. This information about concentrations of contaminants of concern in goose meat and potential exposures associated with meat consumption based on probabilistic models will enable others to make informed decisions about the risks associated with the consumption of wild meat. 3aAlces alces 3aBranta canadensis 3aadults 3aage structure 3abreast meat 3acommunity feeding centers 3adeer 3aducks 3aenvironmental exposure 3afood banks 3afood security 3agame animals 3ageese 3agoats 3ahumans 3aingestion 3ameat consumption 3amercury 3amuscles 3apeople 3apollution 3aprediction 3aprobabilistic models 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3ascreening 3asteaks 3aswine 3awildlife 3aUnited States1 aChipman, Richard1 aMurphy, Lisa1 aJohnston, John0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Sept., v. 77, no. 9 p.1634-1641dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-364  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002100170245008700191300001800278500002400296520194200320650001602262650001102278650000902289650001002298650001302308650001902321650003402340650001402374650003002388650001102418650001202429650001302441650001402454650001302468650000902481650001102490650006702501650002902568650005202597650003802649650002202687650003302709650005402742650002802796651001302824651001102837700002002848700002202868700003402890700001902924773011502943852000903058856009103067655001203158IND4440288920221118074448.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444028892DNAL7 a206467392pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemire, Mélanie10aElevated levels of selenium in the typical diet of Amazonian riverside populations  ap. 4076-4084.  aIncludes references  aSelenium (Se) intake is generally from food, whose Se content depends on soil Se and plant accumulation. For humans, adequate Se intake is essential for several selenoenzymes. In the Lower Tapajós region of the Brazilian Amazon, Se status is elevated with large inter-community variability. Se intake in this region, where Hg exposure is among the highest in the world, may be important to counteract mercury (Hg) toxicity. The present study was conducted in 2006 with 155 persons from four communities of the Lower Tapajós. The objectives were: i) to evaluate Se content in their typical diet and drinking water; ii) to compare food Se concentrations with respect to geographic location; and iii) to examine the contribution of consumption of different food items to blood Se. More than 400 local foods and 40 drinking water samples were collected. Participants responded to an interview-administered food frequency questionnaire and provided blood samples. Food, water and blood Se levels were assessed by ICP-MS. Since Brazil nuts may also contain significant levels of barium (Ba) and strontium (Sr), these elements were likewise analyzed in nuts. The highest Se concentrations were found in Brazil nuts, but concentrations were highly variable (median: 13.9µg/g; range: 0.4-158.4μg/g). Chicken, game meat, eggs and beef also contained considerable levels of Se, with median concentrations from 0.3 to 1.4μg/g. There was no particular geographic distribution of food Se. Se concentration in drinking water was very low (<1.4µg/L). Blood Se covered a (103-1500μg/L), and was positively related to regular consumption of Brazil nuts, domestic chicken and game meat. Brazil nuts were found to contain highly variable and often very high concentrations of Ba (88.0µg/g, 1.9-1437µg/g) and Sr (38.7µg/g, 3.3-173µg/g). Further studies should address multiple nutrient/toxic interactions in the diet and related effects on health. 3aBrazil nuts 3abarium 3abeef 3ablood 3achickens 3adrinking water 3afood frequency questionnaires 3agame meat 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3amercury 3aselenium 3astrontium 3atoxicity 2aDiet 2aEating 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFoodxstatistics & numerical data 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSeleniumxbloodxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 3aAmazonia 0aBrazil1 aFillion, Myriam1 aBarbosa, Fernando1 aGuimarães, Jean Rémy Davée1 aMergler, Donna0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 408, no. 19 p.4076-4084dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03691naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001200170245014200182300001800324500002400342520168700366650000802053650001402061650002802075650001002103650003502113650001702148650002202165650001402187650001402201650001702215650001102232650001502243650002202258650002802280650001802308650001502326650001202341650001202353650001502365650001002380650002902390650001002419650002902429650003102458650005102489650001102540650006402551650001802615650003302633650005702666650001602723651001002739651002502749700001302774700001302787700001402800773011502814852000902929856009102938655001203029IND4440288220221118074455.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444028822DNAL7 a205425372pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Q.13aAn evaluation of resident exposure to respirable particulate matter and health economic loss in Beijing during Beijing 2008 Olympic Games  ap. 4026-4032.  aIncludes references  aPrevious epidemiological studies showed that air pollutants, especially respirable particulate matter, including PM₁₀, could impose harmful effects on human health. The assessment of the effects of PM₁₀ on mortality and morbidity makes an important basis for enhancing pollution control efforts, and for protecting public health. In this study, we measured the levels of Beijing residents' exposure to PM₁₀ during three different time periods around the Beijing Olympic Games held in 2008, and calculated the economic cost associated with human health. A comparative analysis of human exposure to PM₁₀ and associated health economics was also made to see the difference between 2005 and 2008. GIS technology was employed to interpolate the distribution of population and PM₁₀ data collected by 27 stations at a scale of 1km×1km. Study results show that Beijing's population is distributed in a highly inhomogeneous manner, with the majority of people dwelling in the city proper. During the Olympic Games, population-weighted PM₁₀ exposure came down by 46% and 19% respectively, compared with the pre-OG and the post-OG periods. Consequently, the economic cost associated with human health during the Games came down by 38% and 16% respectively, compared with the pre-OG and the post-OG periods. Comparative analysis shows that during the Olympic Games, both PM₁₀ and the economic cost associated with health as a proportion of GDP sat at the bottom of the 4-year statistics, indicating that in addition to favorable weather conditions, enhanced traffic and emission control policies and measures have produced a noticeable effect on PM₁₀ reduction. 3aair 3aeconomics 3aepidemiological studies 3agames 3ageographic information systems 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aparticulates 3apeople 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apopulation distribution 3apublic health 3astatistics 3atraffic 3aweather 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aChild 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEpidemiological Monitoring 2aHealth Care Costsxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aInhalation Exposurexanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aParticle Size 2aParticulate Matterxanalysis 2aRespiratory Tract Diseasesxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aYoung Adult 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aAn, X.Q.1 aWang, Y.1 aGuo, J.P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 408, no. 19 p.4026-4032dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.12.0303Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02811naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132245013200150300001800282520143800300650001501738650001301753650000901766650001201775650001201787650000901799650002201808650001901830650001301849650001001862650001501872650002101887650001101908650000901919650001501928650001101943650001601954650001201970700001901982700002602001700001702027700001802044700001702062700001602079773017402095856005102269852000902320655001202329IND60408717820221118071401.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871782DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aEvaluation of Salmonella Thermal Inactivation Model Validity for Slow Cooking of Whole-Muscle Meat Roasts in a Pilot-Scale Oven  ap. 1897-1903.  aSublethal heating can increase subsequent thermal resistance of bacteria, which may compromise the validity of thermal process validations for slow-roasted meats. Therefore, this research evaluated the accuracy of a traditional log-linear inactivation model, developed via prior laboratory-scale isothermal tests, and a novel path-dependent model accounting for sublethal injury, applied to pilot-scale slow cooking of whole-muscle roasts. Irradiated turkey breasts, beef rounds, and pork loins were inoculated with an eight-serovar Salmonella cocktail via vacuum tumble marination in a salt-phosphate marinade. The resulting initial Salmonella population in the geometric center (core) was 7.0, 6.3, and 6.3 log CFU/g for turkey, beef, and pork, respectively. Seven different cooking schedules representing industry practices were evaluated in a pilot-scale, moist-air convection oven. Core temperatures recorded during cooking were used to calculate lethality real-time, via the log-linear model. The path-dependent model reduced the bias (mean residual) and root mean square error by 4.24 and 4.60 log CFU/g respectively, in turkey; however, the new model did not reduce the prediction error in beef or pork.

To understand cross-contamination risk during washing, we tested a collection of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC), including O157:H7 and other non-O157 strains, for certain traits during washing of fresh-cut lettuce, i.e., sensitivity to sublethal chlorine levels and ability to cross-contaminate (detach from and attach to) lettuce in the presence of sublethal chlorine levels. Nonpathogenic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and Pediococcus pentosaceus lactic acid bacterial species (LAB) were included as potential washing process validation surrogates. As measured by extension of the lag phase of growth in media containing 0.15 ppm of chlorine, chlorine sensitivity varied among the STECs. Cross-contamination was assessed by evaluating transfer of bacteria from inoculated to uninoculated leaves during washing. Without chlorine, similar transfer to wash water and uninoculated leaves was shown. In 1 ppm of chlorine, cross-contamination was not detected with most strains, except for the substantial transfer by a STEC O111 strain and EcN in some replicates. Strain O111 and EcN showed less inactivation in 0.25 ppm of chlorine water compared with O157 (P < 0.05). LAB showed similar transfer and similar chlorine inactivation to O157. Considering together the sublethal chlorine sensitivity and detachment/attachment traits, neither EcN nor LAB displayed optimal characteristics as washing process surrogates for the STEC strains, although further evaluation is needed. This work demonstrated a range of behaviors of STEC strains during lettuce washing and may be helpful in hazard characterization, identifying factors to consider for evaluating washing process efficacy, and identifying phenotypic traits to select surrogates to validate washing processes. 3aPediococcus pentosaceus 3aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli 3aanti-infective agents 3achlorine 3across contamination 3aculture media 3afresh-cut produce 3ahazard characterization 3alactic acid bacteria 3aleaves 3alettuce 3arisk 3awashing1 aWang, Xue1 aYen, Li-Han1 aDing, Hongliu1 aTortorello, Mary Lou0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1860-1867dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-220  aDNAL 7aarticle04493naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002700157245016700184300001600351500002400367500001500391520161300406650002502019650002602044650002002070650002002090650001302110650001602123650002902139650001902168650001002187650001202197650003102209650002102240650002102261650003902282650005802321650004802379650002902427650004802456650001602504650003002520650005702550650002902607650002702636650004702663650004302710650001002753650002302763650005902786650004702845650004202892650004602934650003202980650005403012650004503066650004903111650004603160650006103206653001103267700001803278700002003296700002103316700002103337700002003358700001603378700002403394700002203418700002103440700002203461773010503483852000903588856007803597655001203675IND4457933120221118071502.0110513e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445793312DNAL7 a214711172pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcr0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishizawa-Yokoi, Ayako10aHsfA1d and HsfA1e Involved in the Transcriptional Regulation of HsfA2 Function as Key Regulators for the Hsf Signaling Network in Response to Environmental Stress  ap. 933-945.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHeat shock transcription factor A2 (HsfA2) acts as a key component of the Hsf signaling network involved in cellular responses to various types of environmental stress. However, the mechanism governing the regulation of HsfA2 expression is still largely unknown. We demonstrated here that a heat shock element (HSE) cluster in the 5'-flanking region of the HsfA2 gene is involved in high light (HL)-inducible HsfA2 expression. Accordingly, to identify the Hsf regulating the expression of HsfA2, we analyzed the effect of loss-of-function mutations of class A Hsfs on the expression of HsfA2 in response to HL stress. Overexpression of an HsfA1d or HsfA1e chimeric repressor and double knockout of HsfA1d and HsfA1e Arabidopsis mutants (KO-HsfA1d/A1e) significantly suppressed the induction of HsfA2 expression in response to HL and heat shock (HS) stress. Transient reporter assays showed that HsfA1d and HsfA1e activate HsfA2 transcription through the HSEs in the 5'-flanking region of HsfA2. In the KO-HsfA1d/A1e mutants, 560 genes, including a number of stress-related genes and several Hsf genes, HsfA7a, HsfA7b, HsfB1 and HsfB2a, were down-regulated compared with those in the wild-type plants under HL stress. The PSII activity of KO-HsfA1d/A1e mutants decreased under HL stress, while the activity of wild-type plants remained high. Furthermore, double knockout of HsfA1d and HsfA1e impaired tolerance to HS stress. These findings indicated that HsfA1d and HsfA1e not only regulate HsfA2 expression but also function as key regulators of the Hsf signaling network in response to environmental stress. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atranscription factors 3astress response 3alight intensity 3amutation 3aheat stress 3atranscription (genetics) 3aphotosystem II 3agenes 3amutants 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3astress tolerance 2aAcclimatizationxradiation effects 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnvironment 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHeat-Shock Responsexradiation effects 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aMutagenesis, Insertionalxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRepressor Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aResponse Elementsxgenetics 2aSignal Transductionxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aStress, Physiologicalxradiation effects 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Geneticxradiation effects 2aTranscriptional Activationxgeneticsxradiation effects. 0aplants1 aNosaka, Ryota1 aHayashi, Hideki1 aTainaka, Hitoshi1 aMaruta, Takanori1 aTamoi, Masahiro1 aIkeda, Miho1 aOhme-Takagi, Masaru1 aYoshimura, Kazuya1 aYabuta, Yukinori1 aShigeoka, Shigeru0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2011 May, v. 52, no. 5 p.933-945dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcr0453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02922naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245015400173300001800327520160300345650002301948650003901971650002302010650001502033650002102048650001002069650002202079650001902101650002002120650001002140650001102150650001202161650002802173650001902201650001402220650001202234700003202246773017402278856005102452852000902503655001202512IND60408717120221118071542.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871712DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-2002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiombelli, Audecir10aPrevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter on Broiler Chickens from Farm to Slaughter and Efficiency of Methods To Remove Visible Fecal Contamination  ap. 1851-1859.  aA study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter from farm to slaughter. The efficiency of trimming and water spray (490 to 588 kPa pressure) on the removal of visible fecal contamination from broiler carcasses before chilling was also investigated. Drag swabs were used to sample litter from the farm houses. Samples of ceca and carcasses without and with visible fecal contamination before and after trimming or spray washing of fecal contamination were taken during slaughter of the flocks previously visited at the farms. There was a low prevalence of Salmonella on the litter from the farms (5%) and cecum and carcasses (0%). However, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were present in farms' litter (100 and 58.8%, respectively), cecum samples (100 and 70.6%, respectively), and carcasses with (58.8 and 11.6%, respectively) and without (17.6 and 9.8%, respectively) visible fecal contamination. There was high prevalence of C. jejuni but at low counts and low prevalence and high counts of C. coli. Campylobacter lari was not detected in any sample. Trimming the visible fecal contamination decreased the prevalence of C. jejuni but increased occurrence of C. coli. Trimming did not reduce the counts of Campylobacter and of hygiene indicator microorganisms on the carcasses. Water shower reduced the counts of hygiene indicator microorganisms by 20%. Therefore, control measures for preventing introduction of Campylobacter and the use of good hygienic conditions are needed to warrant the microbiological quality and safety of broiler carcasses. 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni 3aCampylobacter lari 3aSalmonella 3abroiler chickens 3acecum 3achicken carcasses 3acold treatment 3acontrol methods 3afarms 3aflocks 3ahygiene 3amicrobiological quality 3amicroorganisms 3aslaughter 3awashing1 aGloria, Maria Beatriz Abreu0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1851-1859dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-200  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012500173300001800298520205700316650002102373650002702394650002302421650002402444650002402468650001202492650001002504650001102514650001602525650002502541650001902566650003702585650002302622650002002645650001302665651001802678700002702696700001802723700002202741700001702763700002102780700001802801700002302819700002102842700002102863773017402884856005103058852000903109655001203118IND60408718320221118071653.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871832DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-1832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, Courtenay10aListeria monocytogenes and Listeria spp. Contamination Patterns in Retail Delicatessen Establishments in Three US States  ap. 1929-1939.  aPostprocessing contamination in processing plants has historically been a significant source of Listeria monocyto genes in ready-to-eat delicatessen meats, and therefore a major cause of human listeriosis cases and outbreaks. Recent risk assessments suggest that a majority of human listeriosis cases linked to consumption of contaminated deli meats may be due to L. monocyto genes contamination that occurs at the retail level. To better understand the ecology and transmission of Listeria spp. in retail delicatessens, food and nonfood contact surfaces were tested for L. monocyto genes and other Listeria spp. in a longitudinal study conducted in 30 retail delis in three U.S. states. In phase I of the study, seven sponge samples were collected monthly for 3 months in 15 delis (5 delis per state) prior to start of daily operation; in phase II, 28 food contact and nonfood contact sites were sampled in each of 30 delis during daily operation for 6 months. Among the 314 samples collected during phase I, 6.8% were positive for L. monocytogenes. Among 4,503 samples collected during phase II, 9.5% were positive for L. monocytogenes; 9 of 30 delis showed low L. monocytogenes prevalence (<1%) for all surfaces. A total of 245 Listeria spp. isolates, including 184 Listeria innocua, 48 Listeria seeligeri, and 13 Listeria welshimeri were characterized. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to characterize 446 L. monocytogenes isolates. PFGE showed that for 12 of 30 delis, one or more PFGE types were isolated on at least three separate occasions, providing evidence for persistence of a given L. monocyto genes subtype in the delis. For some delis, PFGE patterns for isolates from nonfood contact surfaces were distinct from patterns for occasional food contact surface isolates, suggesting limited cross-contamination between these sites in some delis. This study provides longitudinal data on L. monocytogenes contamination patterns in retail delis, which should facilitate further development of control strategies in retail delis. 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aListeria seeligeri 3aListeria welshimeri 3across contamination 3aecology 3agenes 3ahumans 3alisteriosis 3alongitudinal studies 3aluncheon meats 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aready-to-eat foods 3arisk assessment 3asurfaces 3aUnited States1 aStasiewicz, Matthew J.1 aWright, Emily1 aWarchocki, Steven1 aRoof, Sherry1 aKause, Janell R.1 aBauer, Nathan1 aIbrāhīm, Salām,1 aWiedmann, Martin1 aOliver, Haley F.0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1929-1939dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-183  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015200172300001800324520175700342650002702099650002702126650003002153650001102183650001302194650001502207651001302222700002702235700002102262700002102283700002102304773017402325856005102499852000902550655001202559IND60408718220221118071646.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871822DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapin, Travis K.10aGeographical and Meteorological Factors Associated with Isolation of Listeria Species in New York State Produce Production and Natural Environments  ap. 1919-1928.  aListeria species have been isolated from diverse environments, often at considerable prevalence, and are known to persist in food processing facilities. The presence of Listeria spp. has been suggested to be a marker for Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Therefore, a study was conducted to (i) determine the prevalence and diversity of Listeria spp. in produce production and natural environments and (ii) identify geographical and/or meteorological factors that affect the isolation of Listeria spp. in these environments. These data were also used to evaluate Listeria spp. as index organisms for L. monocytogenes in produce production environments. Environmental samples collected from produce production (n = 588) and natural (n = 734) environments in New York State were microbiologically analyzed to detect and isolate Listeria spp. The prevalence of Listeria spp. was approximately 33 and 34% for samples obtained from natural environments and produce production, respectively. Coisolation of L. monocytogenes and at least one other species of Listeria in a given sample was recorded for 3 and 9% of samples from natural environments and produce production, respectively. Soil moisture and proximity to water and pastures were highly associated with isolation of Listeria spp. in produce production environments, while elevation, study site, and proximity to pastures were highly associated with isolation of Listeria spp. in natural environments, as determined by random Forest models. These data show that Listeria spp. were prevalent in both agricultural and nonagricultural environments and that geographical and meteorological factors associated with isolation of Listeria spp. were considerably different between the two environments. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood processing plants 3ameteorological parameters 3amodels 3apastures 3asoil water 3aNew York1 aNightingale, Kendra K.1 aWorobo, Randy W.1 aWiedmann, Martin1 aStrawn, Laura K.0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1919-1928dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-132  aDNAL 7aarticle03468naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014300172300001800315520168600333650002202019650001302041650001502054650001402069650002002083650001102103650001002114650001502124650001902139650001902158650002602177650001502203650000902218650001602227650001302243650001202256650002902268650001002297650001602307650001602323651001002339700002202349700001702371700002202388700002402410700001702434700001802451700002002469700001602489700002302505700002002528700002302548700002102571700002802592773017402620856005102794852000902845655001202854IND60408718420221118071709.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871842DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshinari, Tomoya10aOccurrence of Four Fusarium Mycotoxins, Deoxynivalenol, Zearalenone, T-2 Toxin, and HT-2 Toxin, in Wheat, Barley, and Japanese Retail Food  ap. 1940-1946.  aA survey of the contamination of wheat, barley, and Japanese retail food by four Fusarium mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN), T-2 toxin (T-2), and HT-2 toxin (HT-2), was performed between 2010 and 2012. A method for the simultaneous determination of the four mycotoxins by liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry was validated by a small-scale interlaboratory study using two spiked wheat samples (DON was spiked at 20 and 100 Î¼g/kg and ZEN, T-2, and HT-2 at 6 and 20 Î¼g/kg in the respective samples). The recovery of the four mycotoxins ranged from 77.3 to 107.2%. A total of 557 samples of 10 different commodities were analyzed over 3 years by this validated method. Both T-2 and HT-2 were detected in wheat, wheat flour, barley, Job's tears products, beer, corn grits, azuki beans, soybeans, and rice with mixed grains. Only T-2 toxin was detected in sesame seeds. The highest concentrations of T-2 toxin (48.4 Î¼g/kg) and HT-2 toxin (85.0 Î¼g/kg) were present in azuki beans and wheat, respectively. DON was frequently detected in wheat, wheat flour, beer, and corn grits. The contamination level of wheat was below the provisional standard in Japan (1,100 Î¼g/kg). The maximum contamination level of DON was present in a sample of a Job's tears product (1,093 Î¼g/kg). ZEN was frequently detected in Job's tears products, corn grits, azuki beans, rice with mixed grains, and sesame seeds. A sample of a Job's tears product presented the highest ZEN contamination (153 Î¼g/kg). These results indicate that continuous monitoring by multiple laboratories is effective and necessary due to the percentage of positive samples detected. 3aCoix lacryma-jobi 3aFusarium 3aHT-2 toxin 3aT-2 toxin 3aVigna angularis 3abarley 3abeers 3acorn grits 3adeoxynivalenol 3afood retailing 3aliquid chromatography 3amonitoring 3arice 3asesame seed 3asoybeans 3asurveys 3atandem mass spectrometry 3awheat 3awheat flour 3azearalenone 3aJapan1 aTakeuchi, Hiroshi1 aAoyama, Koji1 aTaniguchi, Masaru1 aHashiguchi, Shigeki1 aKai, Shigemi1 aOgiso, Motoki1 aSatō, Takashi,1 aAkiyama, Yu1 aNakajima, Masahiro1 aTabata, Setsuko1 aTanaka, Toshitsugu1 aIshikuro, Eiichi1 aSugita-Konishi, Yoshiko0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Nov., v. 77, no. 11 p.1940-1946dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-185  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245006300171300001400234500002400248520126800272650001701540650001201557650002501569650002601594650001101620650001601631650001201647650001701659650002601676650001101702650002701713650001701740650000901757773010801766852000901874856004801883655001201931IND4385514820221118071457.0061126e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438551482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-006-9124-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato-Noguchi, Hisashi10aPyruvate metabolism in rice coleoptiles under anaerobiosis  ap. 41-46.  aIncludes references  aRelative importance of ethanolic, lactate and alanine fermentation pathways was estimated in coleoptiles of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) subjected to anoxic stress. The in vitro activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, EC 4.1.1.1) and alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT, EC 2.6.1.2) in the coleoptiles increased in anoxia, whereas no significant increase was measured in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) activity. At 48 h, the ADH, PDC and AlaAT activities in anoxic coleoptiles were 62-, 15- and 7.6-fold greater, respectively, than those in the presence of oxygen. Ethanol and alanine in the coleoptiles accumulated rapidly under anoxia, increasing by 48 h, 57- and 5.6-fold compared with those in the presence of oxygen, respectively. However, lactate concentration did not increase and no initial burst of lactate production was detected. The relative ratio of carbon flux from pyruvate to ethanol, lactate and alanine in anoxic coleoptiles was estimated to be 92, 1 and 7% of the total carbon flux, respectively. These results suggest that the potential carbon flux from pyruvate to ethanol may be much greater than the potential flux from pyruvate to lactate and alanine in rice coleoptiles during anoxia. 3aOryza sativa 3aalanine 3aalanine transaminase 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3acarbon 3acoleoptiles 3aethanol 3afermentation 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aoxygen 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3apyruvic acid 3arice0 tPlant growth regulation.g2006 Sept., v. 50, no. 1 p.41-46dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-006-9124-4 7aarticle02841naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008800164300001800252500002400270520171800294650001402012650002302026650001002049650002402059650001302083650001502096650001802111650002202129650001702151650002502168650001402193700001702207700001902224700002002243700002302263773010002286852000902386856004802395655001202443IND4413996520221118071458.0081219e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441399652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-008-9257-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroci, Solène10aSmall urban woodlands as biodiversity conservation hot-spot: a multi-taxon approach  ap. 1171-1186.  aIncludes references  aTo evaluate the importance of urban woodlands to serve as potential sites for biodiversity conservation, we analysed bird, carabid beetle and small mammal community responses to urbanisation at different spatial scales. We analysed the relationships between the variations of the structure (species richness S, diversity H' and dominance D) of animal communities of woodlands distributed along a rural-urban gradient, and the variations along this same gradient of (1) the vegetation within woodlands, (2) the landscape at 100 m and (3) 600 m around the woodlands. We identified the spatial scales whose variations along the gradient most affected each animal community structure, and characterised community responses to these variations. Our results showed that urbanisation affected taxa differently according to their dispersal ability. Carabid beetles, less mobile, seem to be sensitive to increasing fragmentation and built surfaces from periurban to town centre which could make their movement within the urban landscape difficult. Birds, mobile species, seem to be more sensitive to variations of the vegetation structure within woodlands from periurban to town centre that could affect their capacity to maintain in habitat patches. Although our study did not allow relating the small mammal community structure to urbanisation, it suggests that this taxa is sensitive to urban local disturbances. A relevant management scale of woodlands can be specified for each taxa conservation. Urban woodlands accommodate over 50% of the species present in periurban woodlands, and effective management could enhance this number. Woodlands seem to be a good choice for promoting biodiversity conservation in towns. 3aCarabidae 3aanimal communities 3abirds 3acommunity structure 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3asmall mammals 3aspecies diversity 3aurbanization 3avegetation structure 3awoodlands1 aButet, Alain1 aGeorges, Anita1 aAguejdad, Rahim1 aClergeau, Philippe0 tLandscape ecology.g2008 Dec., v. 23, no. 10 p.1171-1186dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-008-9257-0 7aarticle01503naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245006800166300001800234500002400252520041100276650000800687650001400695650000900709650001700718650002000735650001200755650001300767700001800780700001800798700001900816700002700835773019300862852000901055856008901064655001201153IND4439860020221118071640.0100713s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443986002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2010.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArdura, Alba10aApplication of barcoding to Amazonian commercial fish labelling  ap. 1549-1552.  aIncludes references  aMethods for seafood authentication are increasingly demanded in food sciences.

Fruit are most often used for processed products. As a specialty crop, black raspberry production is limited by its susceptibility to viruses, which reduce fruit size and yield and can kill the plant in a few years. As part of a NIFA-SCRI grant project, black raspberry fruit from the same seedling sets were grown at four geographic locations including Oregon, Ohio, New York and North Carolina. The goal of this project is to identify germplasm suitable for expanded processed and fresh market production. Total monomeric anthocyanin and phenolic content, soluble solids content (SSC), and titratable acidity (TA) were determined from fruit harvested in 2013 and 2014 from all sources for 56 seedlings (44 of ORUS 4304 and 12 of ORUS 4305) of two mapping populations. Genotypes were not significantly different in pH, total monomeric anthocyanin, or total phenolic content. Population ORUS 4304 parent ORUS 4158-2 was highest in SSC and grandparent 'Jewel' was highest in titratable acidity. Production environment had a strong effect on fruit composition. Fruit from Oregon-grown seedlings were highest in total monomeric anthocyanin and pH and lowest in titratable acidity. Fruit harvested from North Carolina and Ohio were lowest in total monomeric anthocyanin content. 3aRubus occidentalis 3aanthocyanins 3afresh market 3afruit composition 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3apH 3aseedlings 3aspecialty crops 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aviruses 3aNew York 3aNorth Carolina 3aOhio 3aOregon1 aMa, G.1 aFernandez, G.

Consequently, a method was devised to estimate this. Four 50-berry samples were weighed and the number of canes was counted in twenty random 1 m lengths of row. From each 1 m length of row, one cane was removed at random and the number of lateral branches and the number of berries on each lateral branch counted. In 1999-2000, 28 farms and seven cultivars were sampled. Potential marketable yield was calculated to be between 23.0 and 4.2 t ha-1, and yield losses between 17.0 and 0.5 t ha-1. The major disease encountered was cane blight. The main conclusions were that a yield potential of 20 t ha-1 with some cultivars was attainable, that growers should be able to pick at least 7 t ha-1, that cane blight needed to be controlled, and cane density rearranged so that there were fewer canes per linear metre and the rows were placed closer together. 3ablight 3abranches 3acanes 3acultivars 3afarms 3agrowers 3araspberries 3aOntario1 aFisher, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 May 19, , no. 1133 p.319-322dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1133.49  aDNAL 7aarticle04007naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245007600185300001600261500002400277520234300301650001602644650001102660650001102671650002502682650001402707650002702721650002702748650002302775650004802798650004802846650004802894650004802942650004802990650001103038650001103049650000903060653001503069653005003084653001103134653001103145653002403156700001603180700002003196700001603216700002203232700001803254773009903272852000903371856008503380655001203465IND4440418720221118071345.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444041872DNAL7 a205680052pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-010-9138-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEwers, Elisabeth10aCentromere activity in dicentric small supernumerary marker chromosomes  ap. 555-562.  aIncludes references  aTwenty-five dicentric small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) derived from #13/21, #14, #15, #18, and #22 were studied by immunohistochemistry for their centromeric activity.

In concordance with previous studies a certain centromeric plasticity was observed in up to 13% of the cells of an individual case. Surprisingly, the obtained data suggests a possible influence of the sSMC carrier's gender on the implementation of the predominant activation pattern; especially, only one active centromere was found more frequently in female than in male carriers. Also, it might be suggested that dicentric sSMC with one active centromere could be less stable than such with two active ones—centromeric plasticity might have an influence here, as well. Also, centromere activity in acrocentric-derived dicentrics could be influenced by heteromorphisms of the corresponding short arms. Finally, evidence is provided that the closer the centromeres of a dicentric are and if they are not fused, the more likely it was that both of them became active. In concordance and refinement with previous studies, a distance of 1.4 Mb up to about 13 Mb the two active centromere state was favored, while centromeric distance of over ∼15 Mb lead to inactivation of one centromere. Overall, here, the first and largest ever undertaken study in dicentric sSMC is presented, providing evidence that the centromeric activation pattern is, and parental origin may be of interest for their biology. Influence of mechanisms similar or identical to meiotic imprinting in the centromeric regions of human chromosomes might be present. Furthermore, centromeric activation pattern could be at least in parts meaningful for the clinical outcome of dicentric sSMC, as sSMC stability and mosaicism can make the difference between clinically normal and abnormal phenotypes. 3acentromeres 3agender 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aphenotype 2aCentromerexphysiology 2aChromosome Aberrations 2aChromosomes, Human 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 13xultrastructure 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 14xultrastructure 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 15xultrastructure 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 18xultrastructure 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 22xultrastructure 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 0adicentrics 0asmall supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) 0aCENP-B 0aCENP-C 0acentromere activity1 aYoda, Kinya1 aHamid, Ahmed B.1 aWeise, Anja1 aManvelyan, Marina1 aLiehr, Thomas0 tChromosome research.g2010 July, v. 18, no. 5 p.555-562dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-010-9138-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02892naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245011000183300001600293500002400309520112500333650002701458650001701485650002401502650001101526650002801537650002601565650002201591650004801613650001701661650002301678650002801701650002901729650002901758650004001787650002801827650004801855650004701903650004601950650003401996650002202030651001002052700002002062700001902082700002102101700001902122700002002141773009502161852000902256856008502265655001202350IND4440397420221118071653.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444039742DNAL7 a200989902pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-010-9585-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKapur, Manisha12aA Case Study for Assessment of Microbial Community Dynamics in Genetically Modified Bt Cotton Crop Fields  ap. 118-124.  aIncludes references  aBt cotton was the first genetically modified crop approved for use in India. However, only a few studies have been conducted to assess the feasibility of its commercial application. Bt cotton is genetically modified to express a proteinaceous endotoxin (Cry) encoded by cry gene of Bacillus thuringiensis that has specific insecticidal activity against bollworms. Therefore, the amount of pesticides used for growing Bt cotton is postulated to be considerably low as compared to their non-Bt counterparts. Alternatively, it is also speculated that application of a genetically modified crop may alter the bio-geochemical balance of the agriculture field(s). Microbial community composition and dynamics is an important descriptor for assessment of such alterations. In the present study, we have assessed the culturable and non-culturable microbial diversities in Bt cotton and non-Bt cotton soils to determine the ecological consequences of application of Bt cotton. The analyses of microbial community structures indicated that cropping of Bt cotton did not adversely affect the diversity of the microbial communities. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acase studies 3acommunity structure 3acotton 3ainsecticidal properties 3amicrobial communities 3atransgenic plants 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Archaealxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEndotoxinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGossypiumxmicrobiology 2aHemolysin Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmicrobiology 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoil Microbiology 0aIndia1 aBhatia, Ranjana1 aPandey, Gunjan1 aPandey, Janmejay1 aPaul, Debarati1 aJain, Rakesh K.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2010 Aug., v. 61, no. 2 p.118-124dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-010-9585-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03387naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245014300184300001600327500002400343520103900367650002701406650001101433650002601444650001601470650001301486650001001499650001101509650001301520650001201533650004701545650001001592650004001602650003401642650004801676650003301724650003201757650002801789650003101817650002301848650002901871650003101900650002401931650001301955650001101968650000901979650003201988650001602020650003002036650001502066650002002081650004502101650005502146650008002201700002002281700002402301700002102325700001802346700001902364700002002383700002002403700002102423700002002444773009502464852000902559856008502568655001202653IND4440397120221118071633.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444039712DNAL7 a201079922pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-010-9581-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinami, Masaaki10aCharacterization of Streptococcus pyogenes Isolated from Balanoposthitis Patients Presumably Transmitted by Penile-Oral Sexual Intercourse  ap. 101-105.  aIncludes references  aStreptococcus pyogenes is indigenous to the human pharynx and causes acute pharyngitis. Balanoposthitis is an inflammatory disease of the glans and the foreskin. However, balanoposthitis caused by S. pyogenes is not widely recognized as a sexually transmitted disease. In addition, bacteriological features of the isolates causing balanoposthitis are unclear. The four S. pyogenes strains isolated from adult balanoposthitis were examined. We performed emm typing, T antigen typing, RAPD assay, PCR assay for the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin-related genes and antibiotic-resistant genes, and antibiotic susceptibility assay. All four strains were suspected to be transmitted by penile-oral sexual intercourse, were found to be different by genetic analysis, and also harbored some antibiotic-resistant factors. We propose that S. pyogenes should be considered as a causative agent of sexually transmitted disease. The drug resistant S. pyogenes must be taken into account when balanoposthitis patients are treated with antibiotic. 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aadults 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aantigens 3agenes 3ahumans 3apatients 3apharynx 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 2aAdult 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aAntigens, Bacterialxgenetics 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aBalanitisxmicrobiology 2aCarrier Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aExotoxinsxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSerotyping 2aSexual Behavior 2aSexually Transmitted Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aStreptococcus pyogenesxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification.1 aWakimoto, Yukio1 aMatsumoto, Masakado1 aMatsui, Hideyuki1 aKubota, Yasue1 aOkada, Atsushi1 aIsaka, Masanori1 aTatsuno, Ichiro1 aTanaka, Yasuhito1 aHasegawa, Tadao0 tCurrent microbiology.g2010 Aug., v. 61, no. 2 p.101-105dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-010-9581-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03603naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002200170245014300192300001800335500002400353520186100377650001002238650001902248650001302267650001102280650001502291650001502306650000902321650001102330650001102341650002002352650002102372650001102393650001702404650001502421650002902436650001602465650002102481650003702502650002202539650003502561650002002596650005302616650005902669651001802728700001602746700002102762700001802783700002102801773011502822852000902937856009102946655001203037IND4440290720221118071546.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444029072DNAL7 a205474132pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowes, Michael J.10aPredicting phosphorus concentrations in British rivers resulting from the introduction of improved phosphorus removal from sewage effluent  ap. 4239-4250.  aIncludes references  aPhosphorus (P) concentration and flow data gathered during the 1990s for a range of British rivers were used to determine the relative contributions of point and diffuse inputs to the total P load, using the Load Apportionment Model (LAM). Heavily urbanised catchments were dominated by sewage inputs, but the majority of the study catchments received most of their annual phosphorus load from diffuse sources. Despite this, almost 80% of the study sites were dominated by point source inputs for the majority of the year, particularly during summer periods when eutrophication risk is greatest. This highlights the need to reduce sewage P inputs to improve the ecological status of British rivers. These modelled source apportionment estimates were validated against land-use data and boron load (a chemical marker for sewage). The LAM was applied to river flow data in subsequent years, to give predicted P concentrations (assuming no change in P source inputs), and these estimates were compared with observed concentration data. This showed that there had been significant reductions in P concentration in the River Thames, Aire and Ouse in the period 1999 to 2002, which were attributable to the introduction of P stripping at sewage treatment works (STW). The model was then used to forecast P concentrations resulting from the introduction of P removal at STW to a 2 or 1mgl⁻¹ consent limit. For the urbanised rivers in this study, the introduction of phosphorus stripping to a 1mgl⁻¹ consent level at all STW in the catchment would not reduce P concentrations in the rivers to potentially limiting concentrations. Therefore, further sewage P stripping will be required to comply with the Water Framework Directive. Diffuse P inputs may also need to be reduced before some of the highly nutrient-enriched rivers achieve good ecological status. 3aboron 3aeutrophication 3aland use 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3arisk 3arivers 3asewage 3asewage effluent 3asewage treatment 3asummer 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aForecasting 2aModels, Chemical 2aPhosphorusxanalysisxstandards. 2aSewagexchemistry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxstandards. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxlegislation & jurisprudence 0aGreat Britain1 aNeal, Colin1 aJarvie, Helen P.1 aSmith, Jim T.1 aDavies, Helen N.0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 408, no. 19 p.4239-4250dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03152naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002100170245015400191300001800345500002400363500001500387520141900402650002101821650001801842650001201860650001301872650001101885650001701896650002001913650002901933650001701962650002001979650001901999650001302018650003802031650002402069650001702093650001702110650002102127650003102148650004202179650005302221650002302274650001702297651001802314653003602332700002702368773011502395852000902510856009102519655001202610IND4440290320221118071557.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444029032DNAL7 a205800592pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulkarni, Pranav10aDisinfection by-product formation following chlorination of drinking water: Artificial neural network models and changes in speciation with treatment  ap. 4202-4210.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aArtificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to predict disinfection by-product (DBP) formation during municipal drinking water treatment using the Information Collection Rule Treatment Studies database complied by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The formation of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and total organic halide (TOX) upon chlorination of untreated water, and after conventional treatment, granular activated carbon treatment, and nanofiltration were quantified using ANNs. Highly accurate predictions of DBP concentrations were possible using physically meaningful water quality parameters as ANN inputs including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm and one cm path length (UV₂₅₄), bromide ion concentration (Br⁻), chlorine dose, chlorination pH, contact time, and reaction temperature. This highlights the ability of ANNs to closely capture the highly complex and non-linear relationships underlying DBP formation. Accurate simulations suggest the potential use of ANNs for process control and optimization, comparison of treatment alternatives for DBP control prior to piloting, and even to reduce the number of experiments to evaluate water quality variations when operating conditions are changed. Changes in THM and HAA speciation and bromine substitution patterns following treatment are also discussed. 3aactivated carbon 3awater quality 3abromine 3achlorine 3amodels 3achlorination 3awater treatment 3adissolved organic carbon 3adisinfection 3aprocess control 3adrinking water 3abromides 2aAcetic Acidxanalysisxchemistry. 2aChlorinexchemistry 2aDisinfection 2aHalogenation 2aModels, Chemical 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aTrihalomethanesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Purification 2aWater Supply 3aUnited States 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aChellam, Shankararaman0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 408, no. 19 p.4202-4210dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0403Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02135naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008700177300001800264520097800282650002001260650002101280650002701301650002601328650001601354650002901370650001601399650001301415650001801428650001801446650001401464650001501478650001501493700001901508773017401527856005101701852000901752655001201761IND60408713420221118071520.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871342DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-2102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirhosseini, Mahboubeh10aReducing Pathogens by Using Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles and Acetic Acid in Sheep Meat  ap. 1599-1604.  aPractical applications of different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mM) of zinc oxide (ZnO) suspensions containing 1 % acetic acid were investigated against the pathogenic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. ZnO suspensions (0, 1, 3, 6, and 8 mM) containing acetic acid had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of L. monocytogenes, E. coli, and S. aureus during 12 h of incubation, and the 8 mM suspensions of ZnO were the most effective against all the strains. These data suggested that the antibacterial activity of ZnO was concentration dependent. Thus, 6 and 8 mM ZnO were selected for further studies in meat. ZnO nanoparticles reduced initial growth of all inoculated strains in meat. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles in meat and indicates the potential of these nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent in the food industry. 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aacetic acid 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3afood industry 3ananoparticles 3apathogens 3asheep meat 3azinc oxide1 aArjmand, Vahid0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Sept., v. 77, no. 9 p.1599-1604dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-210  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245012200186300001800308500002400326520156500350650001801915650001001933650001301943650001201956650001401968650001301982650001701995650001002012650001302022650001102035650002202046650002902068650001202097650002402109650000902133650002902142650004002171650006002211700001802271700001902289773011502308852000902423856009102432655001202523IND4440289820221118071526.0100723s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444028982DNAL7 a205425352pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEeva, Tapio10aEffects of pollution on land snail abundance, size and diversity as resources for pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca  ap. 4165-4169.  aIncludes references  aPasserine birds need extra calcium during their breeding for developing egg shells and proper growth of nestling skeleton. Land snails are an important calcium source for many passerines and human-induced changes in snail populations may pose a severe problem for breeding birds. We studied from the bird's viewpoint how air pollution affects the shell mass, abundance and diversity of land snail communities along a pollution gradient of a copper smelter. We sampled remnant snail shells from the nests of an insectivorous passerine, the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, to find out how the availability of land snails varies along the pollution gradient. The total snail shell mass increased towards the pollution source but declined abruptly in the vicinity of the smelter. This spatial variation in shell mass was evident also within a single snail species and could not be wholly explained by spatially varying snail numbers or species composition. Instead, the total shell mass was related to their shell size, individuals being largest at the moderately polluted areas. Smaller shell size suggests inferior growth of snails in the most heavily polluted area. Our study shows that pollution affects the diversity, abundance (available shell mass) and individual quality of land snails, posing reproductive problems for birds that rely on snails as calcium sources during breeding. There are probably both direct pollution-related (heavy metal and calcium levels) and indirect (habitat change) effects behind the observed changes in snail populations. 3aair pollution 3abirds 3abreeding 3acalcium 3aegg shell 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3anests 3askeleton 3asnails 3aspecies diversity 2aAir Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aDiet 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aPasseriformesxgrowth & development 2aSnailsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aRainio, Kalle1 aSuominen, Otso0 tScience of the total environment.g2010 Sept. 1, v. 408, no. 19 p.4165-4169dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.0283Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02756naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008200171300001800253520167000271650002701941650002801968650001501996650003002011650002502041650001902066650002402085650001002109650002402119700002102143700002002164773017402184856005102358852000902409655001202418IND60408713820221118071557.0150918s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040871382DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuxier, Julie A.10aActivity Retention after Nisin Entrapment in a Polyethylene Oxide Brush Layer  ap. 1624-1629.  aThe cationic, amphiphilic peptide nisin is an effective inhibitor of gram-positive bacteria whose mode of action does not encourage pathogenic resistance, and its proper incorporation into food packaging could enhance food stability, safety, and quality in a number of circumstances. Sufficiently small peptides have been shown to integrate into otherwise nonfouling polyethylene oxide (PEO) brush layers in accordance with their amphiphilicity and ordered structure, including nisin, and we have recently shown that nisin entrapment within a PEO layer does not compromise the nonfouling character of that layer. In this work we test the hypothesis that surface-bound, pendant PEO chains will inhibit displacement of entrapped nisin by competing proteins and, in this way, prolong retention of nisin activity at the interface. For this purpose, the antimicrobial activity of nisin-loaded, PEO-coated surfaces was evaluated against the gram-positive indicator strain, Pediococcus pentosaceous. The retained antimicrobial activity of nisin layers was evaluated on uncoated and PEO-coated surfaces after incubation in the presence of bovine serum albumin for contact periods up to 1 week. Nisin-loaded, uncoated and PEO-coated samples were withdrawn at selected times and were incubated on plates inoculated with P. pentosaceous to quantify nisin activity by determination of kill zone radii. Our results indicate that nisin activity is retained at a higher level for a longer period of time after entrapment within PEO than after direct adsorption in the absence of PEO, owing to inhibition of nisin exchange with dissolved protein afforded by the pendant PEO chains. 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aPediococcus pentosaceus 3aadsorption 3aanti-infective properties 3abovine serum albumin 3afood packaging 3amechanism of action 3anisin 3apolyethylene glycol1 aSchilke, Karl F.1 aMcGuire, Joseph0 tJournal of food protection.g2014 Sept., v. 77, no. 9 p.1624-1629dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-042  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245008600211300002200297520114100319592002801460650001401488650001001502650001401512650003501526650001101561650001001572650002001582653001701602653001201619653001001631653001101641653001401652653001701666653001301683653001701696653001401713653001401727700006001741700005601801700001701857700001901874700002301893773010301916856008302019852000902102655001202111IND60759047320221119203017.0220205e20211124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075904732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeissbourd, Brandon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5422-387312aA genetically tractable jellyfish model for systems and evolutionary neuroscience  ap. 5854-5868.e20.  aJellyfish are radially symmetric organisms without a brain that arose more than 500 million years ago. They achieve organismal behaviors through coordinated interactions between autonomously functioning body parts. Jellyfish neurons have been studied electrophysiologically, but not at the systems level. We introduce Clytia hemisphaerica as a transparent, genetically tractable jellyfish model for systems and evolutionary neuroscience. We generate stable F₁ transgenic lines for cell-type-specific conditional ablation and whole-organism GCaMP imaging. Using these tools and computational analyses, we find that an apparently diffuse network of RFamide-expressing umbrellar neurons is functionally subdivided into a series of spatially localized subassemblies whose synchronous activation controls directional food transfer from the tentacles to the mouth. These data reveal an unanticipated degree of structured neural organization in this species. Clytia affords a platform for systems-level studies of neural function, behavior, and evolution within a clade of marine organisms with growing ecological and economic importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScyphozoa 3abrain 3aevolution 3agenetically modified organisms 3amodels 3amouth 3aneurophysiology 0aneuroscience 0aimaging 0aGCaMP 0aClytia 0acnidarian 0aneuropeptide 0abehavior 0atransgenesis 0ajellyfish 0anerve net1 aMomose, Tsuyoshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3806-34081 aNair, Aditya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5242-55271 aKennedy, Ann1 aHunt, Bridgett1 aAnderson, David J.0 tCell.g2021 Nov. 24, v. 184, no. 24 p.5854-5868.e20dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245008300207520108500290592002801375650002301403650001701426650001701443650002101460650000901481650002101490650001101511650001101522650001901533650002301552653001901575653001901594653001601613653002801629700005701657700005401714700005501768700001301823700005701836700001701893773011001910856008702020852000902107655001202116IND60750275820221122234801.0211213e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075027582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1043812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChollet, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1434-411410aHow protein containing foods are represented in memory? A categorization study  aProtein intake for humans is a major issue as the production of meat is contributing to the excess of greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity. To cover the upcoming protein demand in a sustainable way, a shift from animal-based food items to plant-based ones will be necessary. The aim of this article is to better understand the representations people have of protein containing food and more specifically, the role of origin and process in these representations. Two categorization tasks of pictures of protein containing foods are used: a forced extraction task and an extended sorting task including a property generation step. Our results show that, globally, the origin dimension is preponderant, except for ready-to-eat dishes for which the process dimension is more important. While plant and animal unprocessed foods are clearly two distinct categories with specific properties, plant-based and animal-based ready-to-eat dishes share a large number of properties and thus could be a potential way of decreasing meat consumption by substituting one by the other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal-based foods 3abiodiversity 3afood quality 3agreenhouse gases 3ameat 3ameat consumption 3amemory 3apeople 3aprotein intake 3aready-to-eat foods 0aCategorization 0aRepresentation 0aFlexibility 0aProtein containing food1 aSénécal, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7829-00661 aWoelki, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6088-23061 aCortesi, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8748-27561 aFifi, V.1 aArvisenet, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7994-56101 aValentin, D.0 tFood quality and preference.g2022 Mar., v. 96 p.104381-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2021.1043813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245015500179500001900334520209300353592002802446650001802474650001902492650001702511650002402528650001602552650001202568650000902580650001202589650000902601651001302610653001302623653001702636653001502653653001902668700003402687700002502721700002302746700002302769700002302792773009702815856009002912852000903002655001203011IND60736815020221119052745.0210617e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073681502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1059532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSomwang, Puckavadee10aField evaluation of four commercial light traps, trap placement, and effect of carbon dioxide on phlebotomine sand fly collection in northern Thailand  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral light trap devices have been invented and developed to assess the abundance of sand flies. Traps available in the market have different designs and attractant combinations to catch sand fly vectors. We evaluated the efficacy of four commercial light traps and determined the effect of trap placement and carbon dioxide (CO₂) on sand fly collection in northern Thailand. Trap evaluations were conducted at two natural caves located in Chiang Rai province, Thailand. In the first part of the study, the efficacies of four trap types including the Centers for Disease Control miniature light trap (CDC LT), Encephalitis Vector Survey trap (EVS), CDC Updraft Blacklight trap (CDC UB), and Laika trap (LK) were evaluated and compared using a Latin square experimental design. The second half of the study evaluated the influence of trap placement and CO₂ on sand fly collection. Additionally, CDC LT were placed inside, outside, and at the entrance of caves to compare the number of sand flies collected. For the trap efficacy experiment, a total of 11,876 phlebotomine sand flies were collected over 32 trap-nights. Results demonstrated that CDC LT, CDC UB, and LK collected significantly more sand flies than EVS (P > 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the numbers of sand flies collected by CDC LT, CDC UB, and LK. A total of 6,698 sand flies were collected from the trap placement and CO₂ experiment over 72 trap-nights. Results showed that CO₂ did not influence the numbers of sand flies captured (P < 0.05), whereas trap placement at the entrance of the caves resulted in collection of significantly more sand flies than traps placed inside and outside of the caves. We found the CDC LT, CDC UB, and LK without CO₂ captured the greatest amount of sand flies. This was particularly observed when traps were placed at the entrance of a cave, perhaps because of the greater passage of stimuli caused by wind flow at the entrance of the cave. The light traps in this study can be used effectively to collect sand fly vectors in northern Thailand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhlebotominae 3acarbon dioxide 3aencephalitis 3aexperimental design 3alight traps 3amarkets 3asand 3asurveys 3awind 3aThailand 0aSand fly 0aPhlebotomine 0aLight trap 0aTrap placement1 aKhositharattanakool, Pathamet1 aPathawong, Nattaphol1 aPongsiri, Arissara1 aDavidson, Silas A.1 aPonlawat, Alongkot0 tActa tropica.g2021 Aug., v. 220 p.105953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1059533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02454naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245008400170300001600254520117600270592002801446650001501474650001501489650001401504650001401518650002401532650001401556650001101570650002001581650001801601650001801619650001601637653001501653653002201668653001701690653002501707653000701732653000801739700001601747700002201763700001901785773009701804856008601901852000901987655001201996IND60582372020221116165716.0171006e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058237202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedfi, Hachem10aModeling of a bioethanol combustion engine under different operating conditions  ap. 808-820.  aA physical model based on a thermodynamic analysis was designed to characterize the combustion reaction parameters. The time-variations of pressure and temperature required for the calculation of specific heat ratio are obtained from the solution of energy conservation equation. The chemical combustion of biofuel is modeled by an overall reaction in two-steps. The rich mixture and EGR were varied to obtain the optimum operating conditions for the engine. The NOx formation is modeled by using an eight-species six-step mechanism. The effect of various formation steps of NOx in combustion is considered via a phenomenological model of combustion speed. This simplified model, which has been validated by the most available published results, is used to characterize and control, in real time, the impact of biofuel on engine performances and NOx emissions as well. It has been demonstrated that a delay of the ignition timing leads to an increase of the gas mixture temperature and cylinder pressure. Furthermore, it has been found that the CO is lower near the stoichiometry. Nevertheless, we notice that lower rich mixture values result in small NOx emission rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3acombustion 3acylinders 3aemissions 3aenergy conservation 3aequations 3amodels 3anitrogen oxides 3aspecific heat 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 0aBioethanol 0aCombustion engine 0aRich-mixture 0aFinite-rate kinetics 0aCO 0aNOx1 aJedli, Hedi1 aJbara, Abdessalem1 aSlimi, Khalifa0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Dec., v. 88 p.808-820dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245004600163300001600209520153500225592002801760650002501788650002501813650002201838650002301860650002501883650002701908650002101935650001401956650001801970650001401988650002002002650001802022650001702040650001402057650001602071651001102087653002502098653000902123653001602132653001202148653002302160653003102183653001902214700001402233700002102247700001702268700001802285700002002303700002302323700002902346773013802375856007902513852000902592655001202601IND60772890320221117234024.0220410e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077289032DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2021-01972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Santosh10aAAC Hodge Canada western red spring wheat  ap. 505-514.  aAAC Hodge (BW1069) is a hollow-stemmed, awned and high yielding Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat cultivar suited to the growing conditions in Western Canada. AAC Hodge was 6% higher yielding than AAC Viewfield, the highest yielding check in the Central Bread Wheat Cooperative (CBWC) registration trials (2017–2019). Within the same test, AAC Hodge was 16% higher yielding than Carberry. AAC Hodge matured 1 d earlier than Carberry and 2 d later than Unity; Unity is the earliest maturing check in the eastern prairie growing conditions. AAC Hodge was 7 cm shorter with better lodging resistance than Unity. The lodging score for AAC Hodge was lower than the mean of the checks. The test weight of AAC Hodge was similar to the mean of the checks. Over the 3 yr of testing (2017–2019), the 1000-kernel weight of AAC Hodge was equal to, or higher than all the checks. The grain protein content of AAC Hodge was equal to that of AAC Viewfield. AAC Hodge was rated moderately resistant to Fusarium head blight (FHB; Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) and resistant to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Erikss.), stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis Westend), stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn), and common bunt [Tilletia caries (DC) Tul. & C. Tul.]. AAC Hodge ranged from resistant to moderately susceptible for its reaction to the Ug99 family of stem rusts. AAC Hodge was resistant to orange wheat blossom midge (OBWM) (Sitodiplosis mosellana Géhin). AAC Hodge was registered under the CWRS class.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aPuccinia graminis 3aPuccinia recondita 3aPuccinia striiformis 3aSitodiplosis mosellana 3aTilletia tritici 3acultivars 3agrain protein 3aleaf rust 3aprotein content 3asmut diseases 3aspring wheat 3astem rust 3astripe rust 3aCanada 0aTriticum aestivum L. 0aCWRS 0agrain yield 0aquality 0adisease resistance 0aorange blossom wheat midge 0adeoxynivalenol1 aFox, S.L.1 aNilsen, Kirby T.1 aGreen, Denis1 aFetch, Thomas1 aMcCallum, Brent1 aAboukhaddour, Reem1 aHenriquez, Maria Antonia0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 102, no. 2 p.505-514dCanadian Science PublishingwJournal:1933x1918-18337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2021-01973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245013500168500001900303520195800322592002802280650001802308650001602326650003202342650002202374650001802396650002502414650001602439650001902455650001902474650001302493650001102506650002902517650001102546650001502557653002202572653002402594700001402618700001402632700001702646700001802663700001402681700001402695700001502709700001402724773009702738856009002835852000902925655001202934IND60736815220221119052841.0210617e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073681522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1059552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Wei10aBioinformatic prediction and identification of immunogenic epitopes of the antigenic 14-3-3 protein of Echinococcus multilocularis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlveolar echinococcosis is a high-risk parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. The study aimed to predict and identify the dominant Th1/Th2 and B cell epitopes of the antigen protein 14-3-3 beta:alpha from Echinococcus multilocularis.A comparison of the four amino acid sequences of 14-3-3 beta:alpha was respectively derived from Echinococcus multilocularis, Rattus norvegicus, Canis lupus familiaris, and Homo sapiens was carried out by CLUSTALW to provide a basis for excluding similar epitopes. The amino acid sequence information was analyzed by SOPMA and the homology model was established by Swiss-Model. IEDB and SYFPEITHI were used to predict T cell epitopes. According to the Bcepred and ABCpred, the B cell epitopes were comprehensively predicted and analyzed. The dominant epitopes were validated by Lymphocyte Proliferation, ELISA, ELISpot, and Flow cytometry.Eight potential epitopes of 14-3-3 from Echinococcus multilocularis were screened according to the results of prediction and analysis: 14-3-3₁₋₁₅, 14-3-3₆₋₂₁, 14-3-3₇₁₋₈₆, 14-3-3₁₄₄₋₁₅₇, 14-3-3₁₄₅₋₁₆₆, 14-3-3₁₄₆₋₁₆₀, 14-3-3₁₅₃₋₁₆₁, and 14-3-3₁₆₄₋₁₇₇. The 3D structure model of the protein was constructed and the location distribution of potential epitope was ascertained. Respectively, the epitopes of the dominant antigen of B cells were validated as 14-3-3₁₄₅₋₁₆₆ and 14-3-3₁₆₄₋₁₇₇; the Th1 dominant antigen epitopes were 14-3-3₆₋₂₁, 14-3-3₁₄₅₋₁₆₆; and the Th2 dominant epitopes was 14-3-3₁₄₅₋₁₆₆.In this study, two dominant antigen epitopes of B cells, two Th1 dominant antigen epitopes, and one Th2 dominant antigen epitope were validated. Our work provides a basis for the subsequent development of efficient and safe vaccines targeting epitopes of Echinococcus multilocularis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aCanis lupus 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aRattus norvegicus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3aechinococcosis 3aepitopes 3alarvae 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amodels 3aprediction 0a14-3-3 Beta:alpha 0aSecondary structure1 aWang, Lei1 aZhou, Pei1 aJiang, Baili1 aLiu, Haisheng1 aFeng, Lin1 aGe, Ri-Li1 aTang, Feng1 aLi, Runle0 tActa tropica.g2021 Aug., v. 220 p.105955-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1059553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013100168520157000299592002801869650002201897650002001919650001601939650001101955650001301966650001501979650001401994650000902008650001902017650001102036650001902047650001402066650001702080650001502097650001902112650002102131650001802152651001002170653001702180653002402197653001902221653003702240700005602277700001702333700001702350773010502367856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60661705320221119033558.0201025e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066170532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1240862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Xudong10aRole of underground leakage in soil, water and nutrient loss from a rock-mantled slope in the karst rocky desertification area  aLeakage loss of soil and water is the main reason for karst rocky desertification, and the concomitant nutrient loss/leakage carried by soil and sediment is an important factor that affects groundwater quality. Due to the difficulty in measuring the underground leakage of soil water, the amount of nutrient loss/leakage on a karst slope is currently unknown. A karst slope farmland is simulated in a laboratory based on field investigations in slope farmlands in a karst plateau region in Guizhou Province, China. Rainfall experiments were conducted to determine the surface losses and underground leakages of soil, water, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as the effects of rainfall intensity and slope on these factors in karst slope farmlands. Surface runoff occurs only at rainfall intensities greater than 30 mm/h, but underground runoff occurs under all rainfall intensity conditions. Moreover, underground leakage loss is the main mode of water loss. Soil loss on a karst slope farmland is a process that transitions from underground leakage to surface erosion as the rainfall intensity increases. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total potassium (TK) in surface runoff increase with increasing rainfall intensity and decrease with increasing slope gradient. The total loss loads of TN and TK in runoff and sediment increase with increasing rainfall intensity or slope gradient. The total nutrient loss loads of TN and TP are dominated by runoff losses, but the TK loss load is dominated by sediment losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adesertification 3agroundwater 3akarsts 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arain 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3asoil water 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 3awater quality 3aChina 0aSoil erosion 0aUnderground leakage 0aSoil nutrients 0aKarst rocky desertification area1 aDai, Quanhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9373-50971 aDing, Guijie1 aLi, Changlan0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Nov., v. 578 p.124086-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.1240863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245005300207300002000260506007600280520171000356592002802066506003702094650000802131650001302139650001402152650001402166650001002180650001502190650001102205650002702216650000902243650002502252650002502277651001102302700002302313700002402336700002302360700002102383773017702404856008302581852000902664655001202673IND4481606520221207132852.0120502e20110913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448160652DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11093001082doi7 aPMC31746712pmcid7 a218967352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammer, Michael F.10aGenetic evidence for archaic admixture in Africa  ap. 15123-15128.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA long-debated question concerns the fate of archaic forms of the genus HOMO: did they go extinct without interbreeding with anatomically modern humans, or are their genes present in contemporary populations? This question is typically focused on the genetic contribution of archaic forms outside of Africa. Here we use DNA sequence data gathered from 61 noncoding autosomal regions in a sample of three sub-Saharan African populations (Mandenka, Biaka, and San) to test models of African archaic admixture. We use two complementary approximate-likelihood approaches and a model of human evolution that involves recent population structure, with and without gene flow from an archaic population. Extensive simulation results reject the null model of no admixture and allow us to infer that contemporary African populations contain a small proportion of genetic material (≈2%) that introgressed ≈35 kya from an archaic population that split from the ancestors of anatomically modern humans ≈700 kya. Three candidate regions showing deep haplotype divergence, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and small basal clade size are identified and the distributions of introgressive haplotypes surveyed in a sample of populations from across sub-Saharan Africa. One candidate locus with an unusual segment of DNA that extends for >31 kb on chromosome 4 seems to have introgressed into modern Africans from a now-extinct taxon that may have lived in central Africa. Taken together our results suggest that polymorphisms present in extant populations introgressed via relatively recent interbreeding with hominin forms that diverged from the ancestors of modern humans in the Lower-Middle Pleistocene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aancestry 3aevolution 3agene flow 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 3apopulation structure 3aAfrica1 aWoerner, August E.1 aMendez, Fernando L.1 aWatkins, Joseph C.1 aWall, Jeffrey D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Sept. 13, v. 108, no. 37 p.15123-15128dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11093001083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245008900217300002200306520109900328592002801427650001001455650001401465650001501479650001801494650001701512650000901529650001601538650001501554653001001569653000901579653001701588653002401605653000801629653001901637653002001656653001201676700001701688700005701705700005401762700002601816700002201842700005101864773010301915856008302018852000902101655001202110IND60759047720221119203211.0211219e20211222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075904772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2021.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndreeva, Li︠u︡dmila,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3421-743810aNLRP3 cages revealed by full-length mouse NLRP3 structure control pathway activation  ap. 6299-6312.e22.  aThe NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat- (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is emerging to be a critical intracellular inflammasome sensor of membrane integrity and a highly important clinical target against chronic inflammation. Here, we report that an endogenous, stimulus-responsive form of full-length mouse NLRP3 is a 12- to 16-mer double-ring cage held together by LRR-LRR interactions with the pyrin domains shielded within the assembly to avoid premature activation. Surprisingly, this NLRP3 form is predominantly membrane localized, which is consistent with previously noted localization of NLRP3 at various membrane organelles. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals that trans-Golgi network dispersion into vesicles, an early event observed for many NLRP3-activating stimuli, requires the double-ring cages of NLRP3. Double-ring-defective NLRP3 mutants abolish inflammasome punctum formation, caspase-1 processing, and cell death.

Woodwasps in the genus Sirex engage in obligate nutritional ectosymbioses with two species of Amylostereum, a homobasid\iomycete genus of white rot fungi. In the present study, the Amylostereum species and genotypes associated with three species of Sirex native to eastern North America and one relatively recent invasive Sirex from Europe were investigated by comparing intergenic spacer regions (IGS). Sirex spp. were sampled over 6 years from 23 sites in six US states, ranging from Maine in the northeast to Louisiana in the southeast, to obtain samples of Amylostereum from mycangia of adult females. Two of the native Sirex species (Sirex nigricornis and Sirex nitidus) were associated with either Amylostereum chailletii or Amylostereum areolatum, refuting the hypothesis of strict species-specific relationships. However, the invasive Sirex noctilio and the native Sirex cyaneus were each collected with only A. areolatum or A. chailletii, respectively, although S. noctilio was associated with two different IGS genotypes of A. areolatum and S. cyaneus occurs sympatrically with the other native Sirex. In Pinus, the preferred host tree of S. nigricornis and S. noctilio, these species co-occurred in 25.9 % of trees sampled, and horizontal transmission of fungal strains from S. noctilio to S. nigricornis was documented, although only in one tree. The extent that further spread and establishment of S. noctilio will alter the composition of symbionts carried by native Sirex is unknown but will depend in part on the degree of flexibility in these host–symbiont associations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmylostereum 3aPinus 3aSirex cyaneus 3aSirex noctilio 3afemales 3agenotype 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3aintergenic DNA 3asymbionts 3atrees 3awhite-rot fungi 2aAnimals 2aBasidiomycotaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHost Specificity 2aMale 2aPinusxparasitology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSymbiosis 2aTreesxparasitology 2aWaspsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 3aEurope 3aLouisiana 3aMaine 0aUnited States1 aNielsen, Charlotte1 aKepler, Ryan M.1 aLong, Stefan J.1 aCastrillo, Louela0 tMicrobial ecology.g2013 Apr., v. 65, no. 3 p.753-762dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-013-0218-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245010200161300001800263520102000281592002801301650002001329650001501349650001601364650001701380650003501397650002301432650003001455700002201485773010801507856007201615852000901687655001201696IND60140177220221120092617.0150526e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6014017722DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.29392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Wing‐Leung12aA new bisphenol A derivative for estrogen receptor binding studies with surface plasmon resonance  ap. 1390-1396.  aA new bisphenol A (BPA) derivative was synthesized and immobilized onto the surface of a CM5 sensor chip for a binding study with orphan estrogen‐related receptor γ using the surface plasmon resonance technique. The kinetic parameters, including dissociation and association constants and dissociation and association rate constants, were investigated. Moreover, a competitive inhibition assay was conducted to understand the competition relationship between the free BPA molecules in solution and the immobilized BPA molecules on the sensor chip surface. The CM5 sensor chip immobilized with the BPA derivative can be regenerated by using a high‐concentration running buffer for repeated use more than 150 times without any adverse effect on its performance in the binding studies. The results indicate that the system has potential for further development as a sensitive surface plasmon resonance–based biosensor for endocrine‐disrupting chemicals.

It is even more complex when it has to be estimated in urban areas, because of the complex patterns of the land-cover in these areas. In this research a modeling approach with integrated remote sensing analysis has been developed for estimating water fluxes in urban environments. The methodology was developed with the aim to simulate fluxes of contaminants from polluted sites. Groundwater pollution in urban environments is linked to patterns of land use and hence it is essential to characterize the land cover in a detail. An object-oriented classification approach applied on high-resolution satellite data has been adopted. To assign the image objects to one of the land-cover classes a multiple layer perceptron approach was adopted (Kappa of 0.86). Groundwater recharge has been simulated using the spatially distributed WetSpass model and the subsurface water flow using MODFLOW in order to identify and budget water fluxes. The developed methodology is applied to a brownfield case site in Vilvoorde, Brussels (Belgium). The obtained land use map has a strong impact on the groundwater recharge, resulting in a high spatial variability. Simulated groundwater fluxes from brownfield to the receiving River Zenne were independently verified by measurements and simulation of groundwater-surface water interaction based on thermal gradients in the river bed. It is concluded that in order to better quantify total fluxes of contaminants from brownfields in the groundwater, remote sensing imagery can be operationally integrated in a modeling procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3atemperature profiles 3agroundwater recharge 3agroundwater contamination 3astream channels 3aspace and time 3aurban areas 3aland cover 3aremote sensing 3aland use 3asubsurface flow 3asatellites 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGeographic Information Systems 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxanalysisxchemistry. 2aModels, Chemical 2aRemote Sensing Technology 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSpacecraft 2aWater Cycle 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 0awater balance1 aBatelaan, O.1 aCanters, F.1 aBoel, S.1 aAnibas, C.1 aBronders, J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 409, no. 4 p.800-809dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245009900203300001600302520159000318592002801908650002001936650002201956650001101978650001201989650001202001650001102013650001602024650001002040650002602050650001802076650001502094650002702109650001502136650001402151650001102165650001902176650001702195650002102212653001802233653002602251653002302277653002502300653003402325700002302359773009602382856008502478852000902563655001202572IND60750276820221120033139.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075027682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2021.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrod, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6146-520210aClosing global P cycles: The effect of dewatered fish sludge and manure solids as P fertiliser  ap. 190-198.  aThe aim of this study was to contribute to closing global phosphorus (P) cycles by investigating and explaining the effect of fish sludge (feed residues and faeces of farmed fish) and manure solids as P fertiliser. Phosphorus quality in 14 filtered and/or dried, composted, separated or pyrolysed products based on fish sludge or cattle or swine manure was studied by sequential chemical fractionation and in two two-year growth trials, a pot experiment with barley (Hordeum vulgare) and a field experiment with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum). In fish sludge, P was mainly solubilised in the HCl fraction (66 ± 10%), commonly being associated with slowly soluble calcium phosphates, and mean relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) of fish sludge products during the first year of the pot experiment was only 47 ± 24%. Low immediate P availability was not compensated for during the second year. Thus efforts are needed to optimise the P effects if fish sludge is to be transformed from a waste into a valuable fertiliser. In manure solids, P was mainly soluble in H₂O and 0.5 M NaHCO₃ (72 ± 14%), commonly being associated with plant-available P, and mean RAE during the first year of the pot experiment was 77 ± 19%. Biochars based on fish sludge or manure had low concentrations of soluble P and low P fertilisation effects, confirming that treatment processes other than pyrolysis should be chosen for P-rich waste resources to allow efficient P recycling. The field experiment supported the results of the pot experiment, but provided little additional information.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aTriticum aestivum 3abarley 3abiochar 3acalcium 3acattle 3afarmed fish 3afeces 3afield experimentation 3afractionation 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3apig manure 3apyrolysis 3asludge 3asolubilization 3aspring wheat 3awaste management 0aOrganic waste 0aPhosphorus solubility 0aPlant availability 0aHedley fractionation 0aRelative agronomic efficiency1 aØgaard, Anne Falk0 tWaste management.g2021 Nov., v. 135 p.190-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245013400209300001800343500001900361520175400380592002802134650001102162650001402173650002302187650002302210650002102233650002202254650001602276650001702292650001902309650001302328650001102341650001302352650001702365650001502382650003302397650001302430650001702443650001402460700006202474700006302536700005902599773011902658856008402777852000902861655001202870IND60731768420221119124532.0210323e20210304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073176842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c027202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHesse, Sarah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2383-447610aStructurally Asymmetric Porous Carbon Materials with Ordered Top Surface Layers from Nonequilibrium Block Copolymer Self-Assembly  ap. 2979-2991.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInorganic materials with asymmetric pore structures provide increased accessibility and flux, making them attractive for applications in energy conversion and storage, separations, and catalysis. Non-equilibrium-based block copolymer structure-directed self-assembly approaches provide routes to obtaining such materials. We report a one-pot synthesis using the co-assembly and non-solvent-induced phase separation (CNIPS) of poly(isoprene)-b-poly(styrene)-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (ISV) triblock terpolymer and phenol formaldehyde resols. After heat-treatment, carbon materials with asymmetric pore structures result. They have a mesoporous top surface atop a porous support with graded porosity along the film normal. The walls of the macroporous support are also mesoporous, providing an additional structural hierarchy and increased specific surface area. We demonstrate how successfully navigating the pathway complexity associated with the nonequilibrium approach of CNIPS enables switching from disordered to ordered top surfaces in the as-made organic–organic hybrids and resulting carbon materials after thermal treatments. To that end, a combination of ex situ transmission small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of the membrane dope solutions, in situ grazing-incidence SAXS (GISAXS) after dope solution blading and during solvent evaporation, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the final membrane structures was used. We expect the final porous carbon materials exhibiting a combination of asymmetric, hierarchical pore structures and well-defined mesoporosity throughout the material to be of interest for a number of applications, including batteries, fuel cells, electrochemical double-layer capacitors, and as catalyst supports.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3aevaporation 3aformaldehyde 3aheat treatment 3aisoprene 3aphenol 3aporosity 3aporous media 3aseparation 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolvents 3asurface area 3asynthesis1 aBeaucage, Peter A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2147-07281 aSmilgies, Detlef-M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9351-581X1 aWiesner, Ulrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6934-37550 tMacromolecules.g2021 Mar. 04, v. 54, no. 6 p.2979-2991dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c027203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245012500211520113400336592002801470650000801498650000801506650001501514650001801529650003001547650002301577650002201600650001701622650001301639653003001652653001901682653002501701653004101726653002101767653002001788700006001808700006301868773010901931856008102040852000902121655001202130IND60736815820221119052827.0210904e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073681582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2021.1142392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDangerfield, Tyler L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1413-208210aHigh throughput quantification of short nucleic acid samples by capillary electrophoresis with automated data processing  aAnalysis of catalytic activity of nucleic acid enzymes is crucial for many applications, ranging from biotechnology to the search for antiviral drugs. Commonly used analytical methods for quantifying DNA and RNA reaction products based on slab-gel electrophoresis are limited in throughput, speed, and accuracy. Here we report the optimization of high throughput methods to separate and quantify short nucleic acid reaction products using DNA sequencing instruments based on capillary electrophoresis with fluorescence detection. These methods afford single base resolution without requiring extensive sample preparation. Additionally, we show that the utility of our system extends to quantifying RNA products. The efficiency and reliability of modern instruments offers a large increase in throughput but complications due to variations in migration times between capillaries required us to develop a computer program to normalize the data and quantify the products for automated kinetic analysis. The methods presented here greatly increase sample throughput and accuracy and should be applicable to many nucleic acid enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aautomation 3abiotechnology 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acatalytic activity 3acomputer software 3afluorescence 3akinetics 0aCapillary electrophoresis 0aDNA polymerase 0aDNA and RNA analysis 0aQuantification and analysis software 0aSanger sequencer 0aHigh throughput1 aHuang, Nathan Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8543-29341 aJohnson, Kenneth A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6575-28230 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 629 p.114239-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2021.1142393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245015400198300001600352500001500368506007600383520167900459592002802138506003702166650001102203650002602214650002602240650001302266650000902279650001402288650002202302650001502324650001802339650002002357653001702377700001502394700001702409700001602426700001602442700001802458700001502476700001902491700001802510773011302528856007402641852000902715655001202724IND60135805020221207105517.0150522e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013580502DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.125942doi7 aPMC48954012pmcid7 a259006462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCulp, W.T.N.10aEarly Tumor Response to Intraarterial or Intravenous Administration of Carboplatin to Treat Naturally Occurring Lower Urinary Tract Carcinoma in Dogs  ap. 900-907.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Survival times and tumor responses associated with malignant neoplasia of the lower urinary tract are poor despite the vast array of current treatments. Therefore, the evaluation of alternative treatments, such as intraarterial administration of chemotherapy (IAC) should be considered. OBJECTIVE: To describe a technique for superselective catheterization for IAC and to evaluate initial tumor response by ultrasonography after both IAC and intravenous administration of chemotherapy (IVC). ANIMALS: Client‐owned dogs with lower urinary tract neoplasia treated with either IVC (n = 15) or IAC (n = 11). METHODS: Retrospective study. An arterial approach via the carotid or femoral artery was utilized to obtain superselective access and administer chemotherapy in the IAC cases. Medical record review was performed, data were recorded, and recorded variables were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: Intraarterial chemotherapy was successfully administered in all cases. There was a significantly greater decrease in longest unidimensional measurement in the IAC group as compared to the IVC group (P = .013). The IAC group was also significantly more likely to have a tumor response as assessed by modified RECIST guidelines (P = .049). Dogs in the IAC group were significantly less likely to develop anemia (P = .001), lethargy (P = .010) and anorexia (P = .024). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of performing IAC for lower urinary tract neoplasia. Further investigation is necessary as the follow‐up time was short and the impact on long‐term outcome and survival was not determined.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3aretrospective studies 3aintravenous injection 3aanorexia 3adogs 3acarcinoma 3along term effects 3aguidelines 3aurinary tract 3aultrasonography 0adrug therapy1 aWeisse, C.1 aBerent, A.C.1 aReetz, J.A.1 aKrick, E.L.1 aJackson, D.E.1 aKass, P.H.1 aClifford, C.A.1 aSorenmo, K.U.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2015 May, v. 29, no. 3 p.900-907dJ.B.

Firstly, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were used to create a favorable loading interface for the fixation of tris (2, 2′-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) (Ru (bpy)₃²⁺). At the same time, copper (core)-gold (shell) bimetallic nanoparticles (Cu@Au NPs) were synthesized in the aqueous phase for the sensor construction. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) could promote the electrochemiluminescence intensity of Ru (bpy)₃²⁺ with high efficiency by catalyzing the oxidation process of tri-n-propylamine (TPrA). Compared with the Au NPs, Cu@Au NPs increased the solid loading of Au NPs by virtue of the large specific surface area of copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs), which could further improve the sensitivity of aptasensor. When OPs were added, the ECL intensity was significantly reduced, and the concentration of OPs could be detected through the ECL intensity. Under the optimum conditions, the aptasensor had a wider dynamic range and ultra-low detection limit for the detection of four pesticides: profenofos, isocarbophos, phorate, and omethoate, and their detection limits were 3 × 10⁻⁴ ng/mL, 3 × 10⁻⁴ ng/mL, 3 × 10⁻³ ng/mL, and 3 × 10⁻² ng/mL respectively (S/N = 3). The aptasensor had the merits of good stability, reproducibility, and specificity, and had a favorable recovery rate in detecting OPs residues in vegetables. This work provided an effective method for the construction of a simple, rapid, and sensitive biosensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaptasensors 3acarbon nanotubes 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3ananogold 3aomethoate 3aoxidation 3aphorate 3aprofenofos 3aruthenium 3asurface area 0aOrganophosphorus pesticides 0aAptasensor 0aRu(bpy)32+ 0aCu@Au NPs1 aXiang, Yaodong1 aLi, Jiansen1 aKong, Qianqian1 aZhai, Hongguo1 aXu, Rui1 aYang, Fengzhen1 aSun, Xia1 aGuo, Yemin0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 194 p.113601-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1136013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012400173300001600297520133400313592002801647650001601675650001201691650001201703650001701715650001301732650000901745650001201754650002301766651001601789651002101805653002201826653001301848653001601861653001501877653001601892653001301908700002101921700001701942700002101959773012201980856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60612627020221120123627.0181029e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061262702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Groot, Beatrijs10aClay preparation and function of the first ceramics in north-west Anatolia: A case study from Neolithic Barcın Höyük  ap. 542-552.  aThis article investigates the process of Neolithisation of the eastern Marmara region of north-west Anatolia by discussing the results of a pilot study to define the development of the clay preparation methods of the first ceramics at Barcın Höyük. We used petrographic analysis on a sample of sherds (n=34) from Neolithic levels (c. 6600–6200cal. BC) at the site, and compared our findings with the ceramic technology of Neolithic settlements in neighbouring regions. The results suggested that the composition of the clays used changed over time, moving from the use of heterogeneous metamorphic clays in the first phase of the settlement, to the extensive use of crushed calcite temper in later phases. The development in clay recipes may have involved changes in the strength, toughness and thermal behaviour of the ceramic vessels when used for cooking or boiling over fire. Although the development of cooking ware is seen in Central Anatolia at about the same time as the beginning of the settlement at Barcın Höyük, the use of crushed calcite temper may be specific to the eastern Marmara region and adjacent inland areas. The use of crushed calcite temper may therefore represent a local innovation, although future petrographic studies of early ceramics in Anatolia are necessary to support this interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3aboiling 3acalcite 3acase studies 3aceramics 3aclay 3acooking 3athermal properties 3aMarmara Sea 3aTurkey (country) 0aNeolithic pottery 0aAnatolia 0aPetrography 0aTechnology 0aInnovations 0aFunction1 aThissen, Laurens1 aÖzbal, Rana1 aGerritsen, Fokke0 tJournal of archaeological science: Reports.g2017 Dec., v. 16 p.542-552dElsevier LtdwJournal:26843x2352-409X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2017.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245013300151300002000284520191700304592002802221650002302249650002302272650002502295650002602320650001102346650001802357650001302375650001402388650002102402650002702423650001502450700001902465700002002484773010102504856007502605852000902680655001202689IND60576851020221116151949.0170806e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057685102DNAL7 a10.1021/la401775p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ya10aUsing Light To Guide the Motion of Nanorods in Photoresponsive Binary Blends: Designing Hierarchically Structured Nanocomposites  ap. 12785-12795.  aOne of the challenges in creating high-performance polymer nanocomposites is establishing effective routes for tailoring the morphology of both the polymer mixture and the dispersed nanoparticles, which contribute desirable optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. Using computational modeling, we devise an effective method for simultaneously controlling the spatial regularity of the polymer phases and the distribution of the rods within this matrix. We focus on mixtures of photosensitive AB binary blends and A-coated nanorods; in the presence of light, the binary blends undergo a reversible chemical reaction and phase separation to yield a morphology resembling that of microphase-separated diblock copolymers. We simulate the effects of illuminating this sample with a uniform background light and a higher intensity, spatially localized light, which is rastered over the sample with a velocity v. The resulting material displays a periodically ordered, essentially defect-free morphology, with the A-like nanoparticles localized in lamellar A domains. The dynamic behavior of the rods within this system can be controlled by varying the velocity v and Γ₂, the reaction rate coefficient produced by the higher intensity light. Specifically, the rastering light can drive the rods to be “pushed” along the lamellar domains or oriented perpendicular to these stripes. Given these attributes, we isolate scenarios where the system encompasses a complex hierarchical structure, with rods that are simultaneously ordered along two distinct directions within the periodic matrix. Namely, the rods form long nanowires that span the length of the sample and lie perpendicular to these wires in regularly spaced A lamellae. Hence, our approach points to new routes for producing self-organized rectangular grids, which can impart remarkable optoelectronic or mechanical properties to the materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acomposite polymers 3aelectronic equipment 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3ananowires 3aphotosensitivity 3apolymer nanocomposites 3aseparation1 aKuksenok, Olga1 aBalazs, Anna C.0 tLangmuir.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 29, no. 41 p.12785-12795dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla401775p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011800157300001600275500001400291520122300305592002801528650002901556650003001585650001801615650001401633650001001647650001801657650001201675650001201687650002101699650002601720650001101746653003001757653001801787653002001805653000901825700001601834700002001850700002401870700002001894700002001914700002001934773018301954856007302137852000902210655001202219IND60692418420221119102331.0200502e20090223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069241842DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.807122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOHASHI, Takao14aThe och1 Mutant of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Produces Galactosylated Core Structures of N-Linked Oligosaccharides  ap. 407-414.  aNAL-light  aUnlike the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe synthesizes large outer chains on the N-linked oligosaccharides that consist mainly of D-Gal and D-Man residues. The fission yeast och1 ⁺ gene product has α1,6-mannosyltransferase activity, and Och1p is the key enzyme in the initiation of outer chain elongation. Although the in vitro substrate specificity of S. pombe Och1p has been reported (Yoko-o et al., FEBS Lett., 489, 75–80 (2001)), the structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides of och1Δ cells has not been investigated. In this study, we report a structural analysis of S. pombe N-linked oligosaccharides. Lectin blot analysis indicated that galactose residues were attached to the cell surface glycoproteins of the och1Δ cells. We conducted a structural analysis of pyridylaminated N-linked oligosaccharides prepared from galactomannoproteins by HPLC and ¹H NMR. These analyses revealed that the N-linked oligosaccharides of the och1Δ cells displayed heterogeneity in the glycan consisting of Hex₁₁–₁₅GlcNAc₂. The structural heterogeneity arose mainly from the addition of α1,2- and α1,3-Gal residues to the Man₉GlcNAc₂ core structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3abiotechnology 3agalactose 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3alectins 3amutants 3aoligosaccharides 3asubstrate specificity 3ayeasts 0aα1,6-mannosyltransferase 0aglycosylation 0agalactosylation 0aOch11 aIKEDA, Yuka1 aTANAKA, Naotaka1 aNAKAKITA, Shin-ichi1 aNATSUKA, Shunji1 aGIGA-HAMA, Yuko1 aTAKEGAWA, Kaoru0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2009 Feb. 23, v. 73, no. 2 p.407-414dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.807123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011200208300001800320520153200338592002801870650002001898650001101918650002101929650001401950650001801964650001601982650001801998650001502016650001402031650001702045650001202062651001402074651001302088651001902101651001402120651001102134651000902145651001002154651002902164773013602193856008302329852000902412655001202421IND60643752420221122040803.0190816e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064375242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-019-00769-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdollahi, Hamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0668-757412aA review on history, domestication and germplasm collections of quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.) in the world  ap. 1041-1058.  aThe areas between Dagestan to Talysh, in the Trans-Caucasia and north of Iran are the central regions of quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.) origin. Historic documents present evidences of quince domestication in the Mesopotamia, between 5000 and 4000 BC that have been pursued to about 500 BC in the ancient Persian and Greek empires. By the end of nineteenth century, domesticated populations of this plant had been spread to the west and east Asia, Europe and America which in turn, created several centers of diversity along its distribution route in some regions such as plateau of Iran, Anatolia, Greece and southern Europe, north of the Black Sea and Russia. Gradually in the mentioned domestication routes, selected quinces such as, Isfahan, Smyrna, Ekmek, Eşme, Vranja, Lescovatz and Champion have become commercialized as superior cultivars. Also genebank collections of the historic cultivars together with the promising genotypes of quince have been established in several countries including, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, UK and USA. Investigations on morphological, molecular and horticultural characteristics of the germplasm have provided ample opportunities for application of advanced breeding programs especially to boost bearing potential, induce dwarfing, increase fruit quality and resistance to the main diseases such as fire blight. This review paper has attempted to give an account for quince historic origin, domestication, gene bank collections and breeding strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCydonia oblonga 3aRussia 3aTurkey (country) 3acultivars 3adomestication 3afire blight 3afruit quality 3agene banks 3agermplasm 3ahorticulture 3aquinces 3aBlack Sea 3aBulgaria 3aCzech Republic 3aEast Asia 3aGreece 3aIran 3aItaly 3aSouthern European region0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2019 June, v. 66, no. 5 p.1041-1058dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-019-00769-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011700157300001600274500001900290520040000309592002800709650001700737650001800754650002300772653002100795653002000816653001500836653003400851653001600885700002100901700001900922700001900941773018300960856007301143852000901216655001201225IND60692418520221119102507.0200502e20090223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069241852DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.807132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOJIMA, Kenji14aThe Activity of a Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease, Matriptase, Is Dependent Solely on the Catalytic Domain  ap. 454-456.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMatriptase is a transmembrane serine protease comprising multiple domains in the extracellular region, including a stem domain and a catalytic domain.

The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) screens elbow radiographs, and assigns grades 0–3 based on presence and severity of bony proliferation on the anconeal process. Grade 1 is assigned when less than 3 mm is present and considered positive for dysplasia. We investigated the incidence of elbow dysplasia and progression of osteoarthritis in elbows with grades 0 and 1 in 46 elbows screened at least 1 year previously, using CT as a gold standard and with the addition of CT absorptiometry. The incidence of dysplasia based on CT was 62% in grade 0, and 75% in grade 1 elbows, all of which had medial coronoid disease. Progressive osteoarthritis at recheck was consistent with elbow dysplasia. The sensitivity and specificity of the OFA grade for elbow dysplasia compared to CT findings was 75% and 38%, respectively. Increased bone mineral density of the medial coronoid process as characterized by osteoabsorptiometry warrants further investigation with respect to elbow dysplasia. Proliferation on the anconeal process without CT evidence of dysplasia or osteoarthritis was present in 20% of the elbows, and is theorized to be an anatomic variant or enthesopathy of the olecranon ligament/synovium. Results of our study suggest that the “anconeal bump” used for elbow screening by the OFA is a relatively insensitive characteristic, and support the use of CT for identifying additional characteristics of elbow dysplasia.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone density 3acomputed tomography 3adogs 3aelbows 3alameness 3aligaments 3aosteoarthritis 3aradiography 3ascreening1 aPease, Anthony P.1 aNelson, Nathan C.1 aHabing, Greg1 aBallegeer, Elizabeth A.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2014 Sept., v. 55, no. 5 p.511-520dAmerican College of Veterinary RadiologywJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.121713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010900160300001600269500001400285520047700299592002800776650001400804650001600818651001000834653001700844653001700861653000800878653001700886700001600903700001900919700002000938773009700958856008201055852000901137655001201146IND60699056920221118200919.0210116e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069905692DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.697.136172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meng14aThe cockroach genus Sorineuchora Caudell, 1927 from China (Blattodea, Ectobiidae, Pseudophyllodromiinae)  ap. 133-156.  aNAL-light  aIn this paper, three new species (S. bimaculata sp. n., S. viridis sp. n., and S. hispida sp. n.) and five known species, S. formosana (Matsumura, 1913), S. nigra (Shiraki, 1908), S. shanensis (Princis, 1950), S. bivitta (Bey-Bienko, 1969), and S. undulata (Bey-Bienko, 1958), are described and illustrated.

In the last decade, the effects of decreasing ocean pH as a result of climate change processes (i.e. ocean acidification) on marine organisms have been target of much research. However, the effects of natural pH variability in the species’ niche have been largely neglected. Marine coastal habitats are characterized by a high environmental variability and, in some cases, organisms are already coping with pH values predicted by the end of the century. It is thought that because of adaptation or acclimation to natural environmental variability, intertidal species may have some resilience to future changes. In this study, we explored the sensitivities of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus during its larvae development and settlement undergoing two different daily pH frequencies (12 h fluctuation from 7.7 to 8.1 units of pH, and constant pH treatment of 8.1 units of pH) that have been currently recorded in the sampling region (Canary Islands). Results showed that, despite larvae development was slightly enhanced by moderated fluctuating pH regimes, P. lividus larva was able to develop normally in both, fluctuating and constant, pH environments. Results of the settlement experiment showed very clear patterns since postlarvae settlement was only successful when a covering of algae was added, regardless of the pH fluctuation applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacentrotus lividus 3aacclimation 3aalgae 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3aocean acidification 3apH 3apostlarvae 3aCanary Islands 0apH 0aSea urchin 0aLarvae development 0aSettlement 0aParacentrotus lividus1 aClemente, Sabrina1 aHernández, José Carlos,0 tMarine environmental research.g2018 Aug., v. 139 p.11-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010800168300001800276520164800294592002801942650001801970650001301988650001602001650001202017650001602029650001202045650001602057650002802073650001202101650002302113650002202136650002102158650004302179650001202222650001502234650002302249650001702272650000902289650001302298700002802311700002002339700001602359700002202375700002202397700001902419700002302438773012402461856007402585852000902659655001202668IND60662178520221122065306.0190904e20140820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066217852DNAL7 a10.1039/c4fo00447g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Abuín, Noemi12aA grape seed extract increases active glucagon-like peptide-1 levels after an oral glucose load in rats  ap. 2357-2364.  aWe have previously reported that procyanidins, a class of flavonoids, improve glycemia and exert an incretin-like effect, which was linked to their proven inhibitory effect on the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) activity. However, their actual effect on incretin levels has not been reported yet. Therefore, in the present study we have evaluated whether a grape seed extract enriched in procyanidins (GSPE) modulates plasma incretin levels and attempted to determine the mechanisms involved. An acute GSPE treatment in healthy Wistar female rats prior to an oral glucose load induced an increase in plasma active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which was accompanied by an increase in the plasma insulin/glucose ratio and a simultaneous decrease in glucose levels. In agreement with our previous studies, the intestinal DPP4 activity was inhibited by the GSPE treatment. We have also assayed in vitro whether this inhibition occurs in inner intestinal tissues close to GLP-1-producing cells, such as the endothelium of the capillaries. We have found that the main compounds absorbed by intestinal CaCo-2 cells after an acute treatment with GSPE are catechin, epicatechin, B2 dimer and gallic acid, and that they inhibit the DPP4 activity in endothelial HUVEC cells in an additive way. Moreover, an increase in plasma total GLP-1 levels was found, suggesting an increase in GLP-1 secretion. In conclusion, our results show that GSPE improves glycemia through its action on GLP-1 secretion and on the inhibition of the inner intestinal DPP4 activity, leading to an increase in active GLP-1 levels, which, in turn, may affect the insulin release.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acatechin 3aendothelium 3aenzymes 3aepicatechin 3afemales 3agallic acid 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3aglucose 3agrape seed extract 3ahormone secretion 3ahuman cell lines 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ainsulin 3aintestines 3alaboratory animals 3aprocyanidins 3arats 3asecretin1 aMartínez-Micaelo, Neus1 aMargalef, Maria1 aBlay, Mayte1 aArola-Arnal, Anna1 aMuguerza, Begoña1 aArdévol, Anna1 aPinent, Montserrat0 tFood & function.g2014 Aug. 20, v. 5, no. 9 p.2357-2364dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4fo00447g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010600166300001800272520167500290592002801965650001401993650002002007650001502027650002602042650002002068650001102088650001402099650001402113650001302127650001502140650000902155650001702164650001702181700001902198773011102217856008102328852000902409655001202418IND60603941520221122010033.0180716e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060394152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-018-1692-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDörken, V. M.14aThe foliar change in two species of Melaleuca (Myrtaceae): a morpho-anatomic and ontogenetic approach  ap. 1013-1028.  aKEY MESSAGE: In Melaleuca minutifolia mature leaves are linear, in Melaleuca micromera scale-like and peltate. This peltation is caused by swollen basal mesophyll without meristematic fusions. Thus, a novel peltation strategy is described. The foliar change of two Australian Melaleuca species (Myrtaceae) was investigated in different ontogenetic stages from cotyledons up to the mature leaf types. In both taxa (M. minutifolia and M. micromera), a strong leaf reduction occurs. While in M. minutifolia the mature leaf type is linear, inverse bifacial and strongly adpressed to the shoot axis, in M. micromera it is scale-like, aequifacial, minute and peltate. The mature leaf type of M. micromera is one of the rare examples of peltation among woody species. The ontogenetic studies on the mature peltate leaf type of M. micromera showed that a shield-like leaf base and typical peltate leaf morphology can be formed, not exclusively by meristematic fusions, as is the case for peltate leaves in the classical sense, but instead by strongly swollen mesophyll, particularly in the basal part of the leaf. While most species with peltate leaves are herbaceous perennials from very moist to aquatic habitats and lack reduced leaves, the four Melaleuca species known with the M. micromera type of peltation are from habitats showing either seasonal water stress, soil infertility or both and all show extreme leaf reduction. Given our morpho-anatomical data, it is clear that, as well as the classical type of peltation, a novel, second strategy for achieving peltation needs to be distinguished. The two types are correlated with quite different environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelaleuca 3aaquatic habitat 3acotyledons 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaf morphology 3aleaves 3ameristems 3amesophyll 3aontogeny 3aperennials 3asoil 3awater stress 3awoody plants1 aParsons, R.

These species are cultivated under restricted growth conditions, not suitable for the growth of other fruits/vegetables. The cactus pear is a well-known example inside Opuntia genus. Its young cladodes, also known as nopalitos, are frequently consumed and used in folk medicine due to their beneficial effects and phytochemical composition. Herein, hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts from cladodes of Opuntia microdasys and Opuntia macrorhiza were characterized. Furthermore, their antioxidant properties were compared to the corresponding phytochemical profile. Despite the phylogenetic proximity and similar geographical origin O. microdasys and O. macrorhiza showed significant differences in sugars, organic acids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids and tocopherols profiles. In particular, O. microdasys distinguished for having high contents in fructose, glucose, C6:0, C8:0, C12:0, C14:0, C14:1, C16:0, C18:3, C20:0, C22:0, C23:0, C24:0, SFA and tocopherols, and also for its higher DPPH EC₅₀ values. O. microdasys by its side proved to have significantly higher amounts of trehalose, organic acids, C13:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1, C20:1, C20:2 and MUFA. The obtained phytochemical profiles might be considered as useful information to select the best Opuntia species regarding a determined application of its natural extracts/isolated compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aOpuntia macrorhiza 3aantioxidant activity 3acactus pears 3achemical constituents of plants 3acladodes 3afatty acids 3afructose 3afruits 3aglucose 3ahydrophilicity 3alipophilicity 3amedian effective concentration 3aphylogeny 3aphytochemicals 3aprovenance 3asemiarid zones 3atocopherols 3atraditional medicine 3atrehalose 3avegetables1 aBarreira, João C.

Such infections are largely attributable to quinolone resistant microorganisms which colonize the rectal vault and are translocated into the bloodstream during the biopsy procedure. A povidone iodine rectal preparation (PIRP) at time of biopsy is a simple, reproducible method to reduce rectal microorganism colony counts and therefore resultant infections following TRUS PNB. All patients are administered three days of oral antibiotic therapy prior to biopsy. The PIRP technique involves initially positioning the patient in the standard manner for a TRUS PNB. Following digital rectal examination, 15 ml of a 10% solution of commercially available povidone iodine is mixed with 5 ml of 1% lidocaine jelly to create slurry. A 4 cm x 4 cm sterile gauze is soaked in this slurry and then inserted into the rectal vault for 2 min after which it is removed. Thereafter, a disposable cotton gynecologic swab is used to paint both the perianal area and the rectal vault to a distance of 3 cm from the anus. The povidone iodine solution is then allowed to dry for 2 - 3 min prior to proceeding with standard transrectal ultrasonography and subsequent biopsy. This PIRP technique has been in practice at our institution since March of 2012 with an associated reduction of post-biopsy infections from 4.3% to 0.6% (p = 0.02). The principal advantage of this prophylaxis regimen is its simplicity and reproducibility with use of an easily available, inexpensive agent to reduce infections. Furthermore, the technique avoids exposing patients to additional systemic antibiotics with potential further propagation of multi-drug resistant organisms. Usage of PIRP at TRUS PNB, however, is not applicable for patients with iodine or shellfish allergies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aanus 3abiopsy 3ablood flow 3acotton 3adisease control 3ahypersensitivity 3aiodine 3alidocaine 3amicroorganisms 3amultiple drug resistance 3apatients 3aquinolones 3arisk reduction 3ashellfish 3aslurries 3aultrasonography1 aLehman, Kathleen K.1 aDewan, Kalyan1 aKirimanjeswara, Girish0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 Sept. 21, , no. 103 p.e52670-e52670dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/526703Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/52670/povidone-iodine-rectal-preparation-at-time-prostate-needle-biopsy-is  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008900162300001800251520161000269592002801879650001401907650002001921650002301941650001201964650002601976650001502002650001302017650001602030653003002046653001502076653001502091700002002106700001702126700002102143700002202164700001702186773014302203856007402346852000902420655001202429IND60680193520221121014811.0200104e20170808xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068019352DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjx1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta-Neta, B. M.10aLight-Emitting Diode (LED) Traps Improve the Light-Trapping of Anopheline Mosquitoes  ap. 1699-1703.  aNumerous advantages over the standard incandescent lamp favor the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as an alternative and inexpensive light source for sampling medically important insects in surveillance studies. Previously published studies examined the response of mosquitoes to different wavelengths, but data on anopheline mosquito LED attraction are limited. Center for Disease Control and Prevention-type light traps were modified by replacing the standard incandescent lamp with 5-mm LEDs, one emitting at 520 nm (green) and the other at 470 nm (blue). To test the influence of moon luminosity on LED catches, the experiments were conducted during the four lunar phases during each month of the study period. A total of 1,845 specimens representing eight anopheline species were collected. Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) evansae (35.2%) was the most frequently collected, followed by An. (Nys.) triannulatus (21.9%), An. (Nys.) goeldii (12.9%), and An. (Nys.) argyritarsis (11.5%). The green LED was the most attractive light source, accounting for 43.3% of the individuals collected, followed by the blue (31.8%) and control (24.9%) lights. The LED traps were significantly more attractive than the control, independent of the lunar phase. Light trapping of anopheline mosquitoes was more efficient when the standard incandescent lamp was replaced with LEDs, regardless of the moon phase. The efficiency of LEDs improves light trapping results, and it is suggested that the use of LEDs as an attractant for anopheline mosquitoes should be taken into consideration when sampling anopheline mosquitoes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles 3aCDC light traps 3aincandescent lamps 3ainsects 3alight emitting diodes 3amonitoring 3atrapping 3awavelengths 0alight-emitting diode trap 0aattraction 0alight trap1 aSilva, A.

Here we take an unbiased approach utilizing centromere protein A (CENP-A) chomatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing to identify the centromeric repeat sequence in the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). A 186-bp, AT-rich repeat was validated as centromeric using both fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence combined with FISH (IF-FISH) on interphase nuclei and metaphase spreads. This repeat hybridizes strongly to the centromere on all chromosomes, with the exception of weak hybridization to the Y chromosome. Together, our work provides the first validated sequence information for the threespine stickleback centromere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aY chromosome 3acentromeres 3afish 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainterphase 3ametaphase 3aprecipitin tests1 aPeichel, Catherine L.0 tChromosome research.g2015 Dec., v. 23, no. 4 p.767-779dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-015-9495-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03816naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245010600179520199900285592002802284650002902312650001702341650001202358650001402370650001402384650001602398650002702414650001502441650001602456650001702472650002202489650001402511650001902525650001502544650001902559650001102578650003302589650001102622650001902633650001102652650001202663650002002675650001302695650002102708650001902729650001502748651001402763653002702777653002302804653002702827653003302854653002902887700002602916700002602942700002402968773010102992856008803093852000903181655001203190IND60716220320221116154711.0210212e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071622032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1047992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenarathne, Sachintha10aGeochemical and isotope evidence for groundwater mineralization in a semi-arid river basin, Sri Lanka  aMineralization of groundwater has become a major concern in the coastal, arid, and semi-arid regions throughout the world. The lower segment of the Walawe river stretches through a semi-arid region in Southern Sri Lanka, and groundwater has become an important source of freshwater for the region. A hydrogeochemical study was carried out to identify the sources and processes of groundwater mineralization in the lower region of the Walawe river basin. The groundwater composition was analysed using samples collected from 32 locations during the pre- and post-monsoon periods. The analysis of groundwater revealed that the groundwater composition of the region was dominated by HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻, and SO₄²⁻, which were mostly balanced by Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺. Ionic relationships of major solutes indicated that anthropogenic influences such as effects of fertilizer applications during the post-monsoon period and notable effects of evaporation during both periods. δ¹⁸O and δ²H signatures of the groundwater in the region showed deviations from the regional meteoric water line suggesting intensive evaporation events (δ²H = 5.6 *δ¹⁸O – 1.37, r = 0.98). Particularly, isotope values of pre-monsoon samples in the study region indicated contributions of north-east monsoon and first inter-monsoon. Solute geochemistry and stable isotope evidences from the region indicate that groundwater salinity in the area is mainly caused by anthropogenic inputs of solutes through agricultural activities and modified heavily by intensive evaporation. Principle Component Analysis indicated higher heavy metal concentrations in the groundwater during the post-monsoon period in comparison to that of the pre-monsoon period possibly originated from anthropogenic activities. The finding of this study suggested the need for comprehensive groundwater management plans and monitoring programs for ensuring sustainable management of groundwater in the lower Walawe river basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abicarbonates 3acalcium 3achlorides 3adeuterium 3aevaporation 3afertilizer application 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogeochemistry 3amagnesium 3amineralization 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3aoxygen 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asemiarid zones 3asodium 3asolutes 3astable isotopes 3asulfates 3awater management 3awater salinity 3awatersheds 3aSri Lanka 0aAgricultural pollution 0aWalawe river basin 0aEnvironmental isotopes 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aGroundwater salinization1 aJayawardana, J.M.C.K.1 aEdirisinghe, E.A.N.V.1 aChandrajith, Rohana0 tApplied geochemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 124 p.104799-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1047993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245013700214300001600351520147800367592002801845650002701873650001801900650001401918650002201932650002201954650003001976650001502006650002202021650002502043650001102068650001102079650002102090650002702111651001302138653002502151653001902176653002202195700002002217700006402237773011502301856008302416852000902499655001202508IND60612627620221120133842.0200210e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061262762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwakosya, Catherine A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9237-064710aGenetic connectivity of Fenneropenaeus indicus (H.

The three zones are connected to major estuaries of Ruvu, Rufiji and Matandu rivers, respectively. The genetic connectivity of Fenneropenaeus indicus population in those areas had not been previously studied. The population study was performed to test the hypothesis that only a single population exists in the area, utilizing the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data. There were 89 sequences of F. indicus used in the analysis. Results indicated that there were 36 haplotypes and the mean haplotype diversity (h) was relatively moderate when there was a low level of nucleotide diversity (π). The FST values ranged from −0.00798 to 0.00918 indicating the absence of differentiations between localities. The Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs statistic showed the presence of recent expansion of the population. An analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) indicated a higher variation within a population than among populations. The study established that the populations existing in the three prawn fishing grounds were a panmictic population. Thus, the reconsideration of the geographical distribution of the fishing grounds (Zones 1–3) and extension of closed season management strategy to the artisanal fishers are recommended. Further study is recommended using nuclear markers to infer population structure in the coastal waters of Tanzania.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFenneropenaeus indicus 3acoastal water 3aestuaries 3afishery resources 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation structure 3arivers 3ashrimp 3ashrimp fisheries 3atraditional technology 3aTanzania 0aGenetic connectivity 0aPenaeid prawns 0aMitochondrial DNA1 aMgaya, Yunus D.1 aJiddawi, Narriman S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4287-66520 tRegional studies in marine science.g2018 Nov., v. 24 p.107-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012000166300001800286520051300304592002800817650001600845650003000861650001400891700001700905700001900922700001400941700001700955700001700972700001800989700001901007773011701026856008201143990002301225852000901248655001201257IND60091204020221118145703.0141103e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009120402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.04.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jinglei10aDevelopment of a novel class of pyrrolo-[1,2,5]benzothiadiazepine derivatives as potential anti-schistosomal agents  ap. 3785-3787.  aAnalogues of pyrrolo-[1,2,5]benzothiadiazepine were prepared and evaluated against Schistosoma japonica.

Because of their durability and ease of synthesis, aptamers are used in a wide range of biomedical fields, including the diagnosis of diseases and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents. The aptamers were selected using a process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), which has been improved for various research purposes since its development in 1990. In this protocol, we describe a modified SELEX method that rapidly produces high aptamer screening yields using two types of magnetic beads. Using this method, we isolated an aptamer that specifically binds to an antimicrobial peptide. We suggest that by conjugating a small therapeutic-specific aptamer to a gold nanoparticle-based delivery system, which enhances the stability and intracellular delivery of peptides, aptamers selected by our method can be used for the development of therapeutic agents utilizing small therapeutic peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aantimicrobial peptides 3adurability 3agold 3amagnetism 3amicrobiology 3anucleotide aptamers 3asingle-stranded DNA 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3atherapeutics1 aRyu, Minkyung1 aBae, Dayeong1 aKim, Hong-man,1 aEyun, Seong-il1 aBae, Jeehyeon1 aLee, Kangseok0 tjournal of microbiology.g2022 July, v. 60, no. 7 p.659-667dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1976-37947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-022-2235-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008000154300002000234520064000254592002800894650002200922650003700944650001400981650001400995650001901009650003301028650003701061650003701098700001601135700001501151773010101166856007501267852000901342655001201351IND60576851620221116151940.0170806e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057685162DNAL7 a10.1021/la402473k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Liang10aSynthesis and Photocatalytic Performance of ZnIn2S4 Nanotubes and Nanowires  ap. 12818-12822.  aZnIn₂S₄ nanotubes and nanowires have been selectively fabricated via a convenient one-step wet-chemical approach by using porous polycarbonate membrane as a hard template.

Yet, a new species of Themira (Diptera: Sepsidae) was recently discovered which is currently only known to reside in two of New York City’s largest urban parks. Finding a new species of Themira in these parks was all the more surprising because the genus was revised in 1998 and is not particularly species-rich (13 species). Its status is confirmed as a new species based on morphology, DNA sequences, and reproductive isolation tests with a closely related species, and is described as Themira lohmanus Ang, sp. n. The species breeds on waterfowl dung and it is hypothesized that this makes the species rare in natural environments. However, it thrives in urban parks where the public feeds ducks and geese. The mating behavior of Themira lohmanus was recorded and is similar to the behavior of its closest relative T. biloba.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aSepsidae 3afeces 3anew species 3areproductive isolation 3awaterfowl 3aNew York 0acryptic species 0aspecies description1 aRajaratnam, Gowri1 aSu, Kathy FY1 aMeier, Rudolf0 tZooKeys.g2017 Sept. 18, v. 698 p.95-111dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.698.134113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012300157300001800280520152700298592002801825650002101853650003701874650001301911650002401924650002201948650001301970650002101983650001102004650001502015650001202030650001302042651001302055653002702068653001702095653001302112653001102125700002202136700002202158700001702180773014502197856007402342852000902416655001202425IND60680193720221120221746.0200104e20170914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068019372DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjx1502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalan, Katja10aPresence and Potential Distribution of Aedes albopictus and Aedes japonicus japonicus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Slovenia  ap. 1510-1518.  aIn Slovenia, two invasive mosquito species are present, Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes japonicus (Theobald, 1901) (Diptera: Culicidae). In this study, we examined their actual distribution and suitable habitats for new colonizations. Data from survey of species presence in 2013 and 2015, bioclimatic variables and altitude were used for the construction of predictive maps. We produced various models in Maxent software and tested two bioclimatic variable sets, WorldClim and CHELSA. For the variable selection of A. albopictus modeling we used statistical and expert knowledge-based approach, whereas for A. j. japonicus we used only a statistically based approach. The best performing models for both species were chosen according to AIC score-based evaluation. In 2 yr of sampling, A. albopictus was largely confined to the western half of Slovenia, whereas A. j. japonicus spread significantly and can be considered as an established species in a large part of the country. Comparison of models with WorldClim and CHELSA variables for both species showed models with CHELSA variables as a better tool for prediction. Finally, we validated the models performance in predicting distribution of species according to collected field data. Our study confirms that both species are co-occurring and are sympatric in a large part of the country area. The tested models could be used for future prevention of invasive mosquitoes spreading in other countries with similar bioclimatic conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes albopictus 3aOchlerotatus japonicus japonicus 3aaltitude 3abioclimatic indexes 3acomputer software 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3aprediction 3asurveys 3asympatry 3aSlovenia 0ainvasive Aedes species 0adistribution 0amodeling 0aCHELSA1 aIvović, Vladimir1 aGlasnović, Peter1 aBuzan, Elena0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2017 Sept. 14, v. 54, no. 6 p.1510-1518dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl45776x0022-25857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjx1503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245018200211300001600393520149200409592002801901650002301929650002201952650001501974650000801989650001101997650001702008650001402025650002402039650002402063650003702087700006002124700002702184773011102211856008502322852000902407655001202416IND60762676820221122044527.0220112e20211222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076267682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c029902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProniewicz, Edyta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1872-277910aDetermination of the Influence of Various Factors on the Character of Surface Functionalization of Copper(I) and Copper(II) Oxide Nanosensors with Phenylboronic Acid Derivatives  ap. 557-568.  aIn this work, we attempt to determine the influence of the oxidation state of copper [Cu(I) vs Cu(II)], the nature of the interface (solid/aqueous vs solid/air), the incubation time, and the structure of N-substituted phenylboronic acids (PBAs) functionalizing the surface of copper oxide nanostructures (NSs) on the mode of adsorption. For this purpose, 4-[(N-anilino)(phosphono)-S-methyl]phenylboronic acid (1-PBA) and its two analogues (2-PBA and bis{1-PBA}) and the copper oxide NSs were synthesized in a surfactant-/ion-free solution via a synthetic route that allows controlling the size and morphology of NSs. The NSs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, which confirmed the formation of spherical Cu₂O nanoparticles (Cu₂ONPs) with a size of 1.5 μm to 600 nm crystallized in a cubic cuprite structure and leaf-like CuO nanostructures (CuONSs) with dimensions of 80–180 nm in width and 400–700 nm in length and crystallized in a monoclinic structure. PBA analogues were deposited on the surface of the copper oxide NSs, and adsorption was investigated using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The changes in the orientation of the molecule relative to the substrate surface caused by the abovementioned factors were described, and the signal enhancement on the copper oxide NSs was determined. This is the first study using vibrational spectroscopy for these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3aair 3acopper 3acupric oxide 3aoxidation 3aphenylboronic acids 3asensors (equipment) 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aStarowicz, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4764-37191 aOzaki, Y.q(Yukihiro),0 tLangmuir.g2021 Dec. 22, v. 38, no. 1 p.557-568dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c029903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007800173520140000251592002801651650002901679650001301708650001501721650001201736650001201748650001301760650001101773650001101784650001101795650001701806650000901823650001201832650000901844650001101853650001101864650001801875650002401893650001901917650001801936650001201954650001001966650002101976650001301997650001302010650001102023650000902034651001002043651001202053653002302065653000902088653002302097653001402120653001002134653001202144700001802156700002002174773010102194856008802295852000902383655001202392IND60716220620221116154630.0210305e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071622062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1048132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarvainen, Timo10aAcceptable soil baseline levels in Taltal, Chile, and in Tampere, Finland  aSoil geochemical baselines of potentially toxic elements were studied in two cities: Tampere in Finland and Taltal in Chile. Soil samples were sieved to the <2 mm grain-size fraction and the concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb, V and Zn were measured after aqua regia extraction. The upper limit of baseline variation was defined for the topsoils of Tampere and for soil samples from various lithological units in Taltal. Arsenic was the potentially toxic element of most concern in both towns. In both cases, arsenic concentrations were mostly geogenic. Anthropogenic activities related to the long mining history had caused elevated As concentrations in the topsoil samples in parts of Taltal city and soils surrounding abandoned mining wastes. In the case of this study, the geochemical baseline was useful to show the pollution level of As. Vanadium concentrations were also higher than the global average values in soils of Taltal commune. Heatmap plots based on compositional data analysis revealed that the abundance of mica minerals and soil organic matter controlled the distribution of most of the studied elements in Tampere, while the clustering of metals in Taltal was probably related to either abandoned mining sites or active mining operations. Regional baseline values should be used for the assessment of soil contamination with these elements in both cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantimony 3aaqua regia 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acities 3acobalt 3acopper 3ageochemistry 3alead 3amercury 3amica 3amining 3anickel 3anormal values 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3atopsoil 3atowns 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3avanadium 3awastes 3azinc 3aChile 3aFinland 0aUrban geochemistry 0aSoil 0aCompositional data 0aBaselines 0aChile 0aFinland1 aReyes, Arturo1 aSapon, Svetlana0 tApplied geochemistry.g2020 Dec., v. 123 p.104813-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1048133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04406naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015100166300001600317500001400333520298900347592002803336650001003364650001403374650001703388650001903405650001503424650001503439650001403454650001203468650001503480650001403495650001103509650001503520650001303535650001303548650001203561653001203573653001703585653001103602653002203613653001703635653001803652653002003670700002203690773009703712856008203809852000903891655001203900IND60699057520221118195944.0210116e20170918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069905752DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.698.149132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBousquet, Yves10aStatus of the new genera in Gistel’s “Die Insecten-Doubletten aus der Sammlung des Herrn Grafen Rudolph von Jenison Walworth” issued in 1834  ap. 113-145.  aNAL-light  aAll new genus-group names included in Gistel’s list of Coleoptera from the collection of Count Rudolph von Jenison Walwort, published in 1834, are recorded.

We evaluate whether environmental and climatic variability, measured from operational oceanographic data, allow assessment of discarded species abundances. Monthly data collected by onboard fishery observers during 2011 and 2012 in the Northern Alboran Sea served as a case study of the trawling fishery’s dynamics. The study area was split into west and east zones to account for differences in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea water influences, for distinct geomorphology and for species composition of catches. Sixteen species divided in three groups were analysed: species without discards, those partially discarded and those completely discarded. Applying Gaussian Generalized Additive Models (GAM), we tested the relationships of standard oceanographic data products and climatic variability with discard abundances. These variables were sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (chl-a) from satellite imagery, as indicators of environmental conditions, and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) as a climatic indicator. Models were applied for target and bycatch species partially discarded. These were the following species: gadoid like European hake (Merluccius merluccius), Blue Whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), Seabreams (Pagellus acarne, and Pagellus erythrinus), and Mackerels (Trachurus mediterraneus, Trachurus picturatus and Trachurus trachurus). Surface seawater temperature was a relevant variable in coastal and eastern, more haline Mediterranean waters. Climatic variability represented by NAO was useful for assessing discard rates in the more productive western zone. Chlorophyll a showed less relevance for discard prediction models, but it was more related in the coastal zones. Including oceanographic data products and climatic patterns in GAM models of fishery discards provides a new perspective that may improve our predictive capabilities for management decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerluccius merluccius 3aMicromesistius poutassou 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3aPagellus erythrinus 3aTrachurus trachurus 3abycatch 3acase studies 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3amackerel 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3aseawater 3aspecies diversity 3asurface water temperature 3aMediterranean Sea 0aDiscards 0aOtter-trawl fisheries 0aFishery conservation 0aOperational oceanography 0aNAO1 aGarcía, Teresa,1 aGonzalez, Maria,1 aBerastegui, Diego Álvarez-1 aMallol, Sandra1 ade la Serna, Jose Miguel1 aBultó, Cristina1 aBellido, José María,1 aBarcala, Elena1 aBaro, Jorge0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2018 Sept., v. 23 p.73-86dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2017.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003100188245018200219300001800401506007600419520091800495592002801413506003701441650003401478650002201512650002501534650002501559650002901584650002801613650001801641650002001659650001801679650000701697650001501704650001101719650001101730650001701741650002101758650001501779650001301794650003001807700004101837773011401878856008101992852000902073655001202082IND60519078120221207140139.0160420e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051907812DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-015-2084-92doi7 aPMC48377312pmcid7 a271624112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElavarasan, Krishnamoorthy10aEffect of oven drying and freeze drying on the antioxidant and functional properties of protein hydrolysates derived from freshwater fish (Cirrhinus mrigala) using papain enzyme  ap. 1303-1311.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFish protein hydrolysate (FPH) was prepared from fresh water fish Cirrhinus mrigala using papain and dried in oven (OD-FPH) and freeze dryer (FD-FPH). The electron micrographs of FD-FPH samples showed porous structure. The browning intensity of OD-FPH samples was higher than the FD-FPH samples. The DPPH (2, 2 Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity and linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition activity of FPH were not affected by oven drying process. The sequential digestion of FPH with pepsin and pancreatin reduced the antioxidant properties in both OD-FPH and FD-FPH samples. The solubility of proteins in OD-FPH was lower at pH 5 while for that of FD-FPH it was at pH 7 with water as solvent. The surface active properties of FD-FPH samples were higher than OD-FPH samples. The oven drying of fish protein hydrolysates may be advocated considering the properties and cost of production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCirrhinus mrigala 3aantioxidant activity 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afish protein hydrolysate 3afree radical scavengers 3afreeze drying 3afreshwater fish 3alinoleic acid 3apH 3apancreatin 3apapain 3apepsin 3aperoxidation 3aproduction costs 3asolubility 3asolvents 3asurface active properties1 aShamasundar, Bangalore Aswathnarayan0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2016 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 p.1303-1311dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-015-2084-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113024002200140040001800162100002800180245013300208300001600341500001500357506007600372520168500448592002802133506003702161650003102198650002402229650001602253650000902269650001602278650001402294653001602308653001602324700002202340773015202362856007302514852000902587655001202596IND60081574720221207093954.0140915e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008157472DNAL7 a246983932pmid7 a10.1111/vru.121592doi7 aPMC41630982pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin‐Vaquero, Paula10aEvaluation of traditional and novel radiographic vertebral ratios in great danes with versus without cervical spondylomyelopathy  ap. 488-495.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGreat Danes are predisposed to osseous‐associated cervical spondylomyelopathy (Wobbler syndrome). The first aim of this prospective study was to compare values measured using previously published intravertebral and intervertebral ratio methods and a novel ventrodorsal ratio method in radiographs of clinically normal and affected Great Danes. The second aim was to determine whether these ratios could be used as predictors of sites of spinal cord compression based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty dogs (15 normal, 15 affected) were prospectively enrolled. Lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs were obtained and six measurements were recorded from C3‐T1. For each vertebral location, intravertebral ratios and intervertebral ratios were calculated from lateral views, and the ratio of the distance between the articular process joints vs. vertebral body width (novel ventrodorsal ratio) was calculated from ventrodorsal views. Values for these three ratios were compared, by vertebral location and dog group. Intravertebral and intervertebral ratios did not differ between dog groups. The ventrodorsal ratio was significantly smaller in affected Great Danes at C5–6 (P = 0.005) and C6–7 (P < 0.001). The ventrodorsal ratio was significantly associated with MRI presence of spinal cord compression. For each 0.1 unit increase in this ratio value, there was a 65% decrease in the odds of spinal cord compression being present at that site, independent of vertebral location (P = 0.002). Findings from this study supported use of the novel ventrodorsal ratio as an initial radiographic screening method for Great Danes with suspected cervical spondylomyelopathy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3aprospective studies 3aradiography 3adogs 3aspinal cord 3ascreening 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aCosta, Ronaldo C.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2014 Sept., v. 55, no. 5 p.488-495dAmerican College of Veterinary RadiologywJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.121593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015000169300001400319520119200333592002801525650002801553650002201581650002401603650001601627650001101643650001901654650001401673650002601687650001201713651001401725653002601739653001401765653001901779653002401798653002201822700002001844700002001864700001801884700002301902773011301925856008302038852000902121655001202130IND60612628020221120123604.0200210e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061262802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2018.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoth, Sabrina K.14aThe highly competitive ascidian Didemnum sp. threatens coral reef communities in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia  ap. 48-54.  aCoral reefs in the Wakatobi Marine National Park (WMNP), Indonesia, are protected but have been degrading in several areas due to local anthropogenic stressors. In affected areas, benthic surveys revealed the occurrence of a dominant ascidian species of the genus Didemnum, which may negatively impact the benthic community composition and structure. We quantified the abundance, substrate preference, and growth rate of Didemnum sp. in non-degraded and degraded reefs to assess its impact on the benthic community. While Didemnum sp. occurred in similar high abundances in both, non-degraded (0.66%) and degraded (0.75%) reef sites, this species showed a substantially (>10-fold) increased growth rate in degrading reefs (2.7 ± 0.98% day−1 increase in colony size, compared to 0.17 ± 0.39% day −1 in non-degraded reefs). Furthermore, Didemnum sp. colonized many different substrates and showed the ability to overgrow live corals quickly. These observations indicate that Didemnum sp. can be a severe threat to a reef community by outcompeting live corals and call for further studies on the interaction between environmental pollution and Didemnum growth patterns in coral reefs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic stressors 3abenthic organisms 3acommunity structure 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3anational parks 3apollution 3asubstrate specificity 3asurveys 3aIndonesia 0aDidemnidae (ascidian) 0aEpibiosis 0aCoral Triangle 0aBenthic competition 0aPollution impacts1 aPowell, Abigail1 aSmith, David J.1 aRoth, Florian1 aSchierwater, Bernd0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2018 Nov., v. 24 p.48-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2018.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245019100171300001600362500001500378520147100393592002801864650001301892650002301905650001101928650002501939650002601964650001501990650001902005650002102024650000902045650002202054650001302076650001602089650002102105650001202126650001602138650001102154651001002165651001702175653001802192700001902210700002102229700002202250700002302272773010202295856008102397852000902478655001202487IND50071842620221121045545.0150212e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007184262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10333-013-0373-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaruyama, Toshisuke10aAnalysis of water balance in the Tedori river alluvial fan areas of Japan: focused on quantitative analysis of groundwater recharge from river and ground surface, especially paddy fields  ap. 163-171.  a2019-12-05  aWater balance in the Tedori River alluvial fan areas was analyzed for all components of the hydrological cycle based on exchange of the channel/soil surface and aquifer horizon fractions with river water. The results were summarized on an annual basis, as well as for the irrigation and non-irrigation periods. The study area received 6.28 mm/day of precipitation and had an outflow of 2.32 mm/day as direct runoff, resulting in 3.96 mm/day of water being supplied to the soil surface. The channel/soil horizon fraction received this 3.96 mm/day, as well as 9.12 mm/day intake water from the head works. Conversely, 2.74 and 2.85 mm/day were lost by evapotranspiration and percolation, respectively. Thus, surface runoff of 7.49 mm/day flowed from the study area to the Sea of Japan or drainage canals near the river mouth. In the aquifer horizon fraction, 2.85 mm/day of water was supplied from the channel/soil horizon fraction and 2.15 mm/day was supplied from the Tedori River, while 1.73 mm/day was extracted by groundwater. Thus, 3.27 mm/day of groundwater flowed out to the Sea of Japan or into downstream drainage canals. An outline of the water balance of the irrigation and non-irrigation period is also shown. Because various hydrological components are closely related to each other, planning and management of water resources for individual goals are not adequate, but require the integrated aspect of water balance for sustainable water use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanning 3aevapotranspiration 3arivers 3agroundwater recharge 3aquantitative analysis 3airrigation 3awater analysis 3awater management 3asoil 3adrainage channels 3aaquifers 3ariver water 3ahydrologic cycle 3apaddies 3agroundwater 3arunoff 3aJapan 3aSea of Japan 0awater balance1 aNoto, Fumikazu1 aYoshida, Masashi1 aHorino, Haryuhiko1 aNakamura, Kimihito0 tPaddy and water environment.g2014 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.163-171dSpringer-Verlagx1611-24907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-013-0373-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001100158245009600169300001600265520154900281592002801830650001901858650002401877650004001901650001801941650001101959650004301970650001502013650002002028650001802048650001702066650002202083700001402105700001302119700001202132700001202144700001102156773008902167856007302256852000902329655001202338IND60081574920221120111842.0140915e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008157492DNAL7 a250738712pmid7 a10.1111/obr.122142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, S.10aPreterm birth and risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta‐analysis  ap. 804-811.  aPreterm birth is suggested to play an important role in the development of diabetes. However, results have been inconsistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis to clarify the relationship between preterm birth and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. PubMed, Embase and ISI Web of Science were searched. A total of 18 studies (including 2,176,480 participants and 22,073 cases) for type 1 diabetes and five studies (including 31,478 participants and 1,898 cases) for type 2 diabetes were included in the current meta‐analyses. We calculated pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using fixed‐effects model to evaluate the relations between preterm birth and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The results suggested that preterm birth was significantly associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.11–1.25), with no evidence of between‐study heterogeneity (I² = 13.2%, P = 0.296). Preterm birth was also significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.32–1.72), with no evidence of (I² = 0.0%, P = 0.557). Subgroup analyses suggested that there was significant association in both case‐control studies (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.06–1.26) and cohort studies (relative risk = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.11–1.29) for type 1 diabetes, and similar results were found for type 2 diabetes. The results suggested that preterm birth was a significant and independent risk factor for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3apremature birth 3arelative risk 3arisk factors 3asystematic review1 aZhang, M.1 aTian, H.1 aLiu, Z.1 aYin, X.1 aXi, B.0 tObesity reviews.g2014 Oct., v. 15, no. 10 p.804-811dBlackwell Pubx1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.122143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245008100176300001600257520077400273592002801047650002101075650000901096650001701105650001401122650001901136650002801155650002201183650004101205650001301246650005001259650001201309650003901321650000901360650004801369650005301417653000801470653002401478653003201502653001901534653001301553700001801566700001301584700001901597700001801616773010601634852000901740856007601749655001201825IND4398737820221118063642.0181009e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439873782DNAL7 a180399072pmid7 a10.1354/vp.44-6-9242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunday, J.

Due to farming on terraces, large scale water resource development to store water for supplemental irrigation is not feasible in this region. Construction of trenches may be a good option to hold the runoff and enrich the soil moisture profile. The present study was undertaken to determine the optimal size of the trench through field experimentation, and also to determine the scope of on-farm water management and improvement in soil moisture regime. Four sizes (namely TR1, TR2, TR3 and TR4) of trenches were constructed using 25, 20, 17 and 12 % of the terrace area, respectively. It was observed that all the trenches provided higher average soil moisture and gave 32.9, 50.3 63.6 and 58.4 % higher yield than the control, respectively. However, the yield was statistically at par for TR2, TR3 and TR4. After economical evaluation it is concluded that the trenches may be used as to increase the soil moisture in terraced land, and consequently productivity of upland rice economically, but the area of such trenches must be limited to 12–17 %.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3afield experimentation 3ahills 3airrigation 3apaddies 3arice 3arunoff 3asoil water 3aterraces 3awater conservation 3aIndia1 aSingh, K.

Here, we assess how OA conditions predicted for 2100 affects the biological functioning of an important habitat-forming species Mytilus edulis and its susceptibility to predation by a key predator, the gastropod Nucella lapillus. Change in three physiological parameters in Mytilus were assessed: (1) shell thickness and cross-sectional surface area, (2) body volume and (3) feeding rate, as well as susceptibility to predation by N. lapillus. Shell thickness and cross-section area, body volume and feeding rate of Mytilus all reduced under OA conditions indicating compromised fitness. Predation risk increased by ∼26% under OA, suggesting increased susceptibility of mussels to predation and/or altered predator foraging behaviour. Notably, predation of large Mytilus – that were largely free from predation under control conditions – increased by more than 8x under OA, suggesting that body size was no longer a refuge. Our results suggest OA will impact upon ecosystem structure and functioning and the continued provision of ecosystem services associated with Mytilus reefs and the communities associated with them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aMytilus edulis 3abody size 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforaging 3amussels 3aocean acidification 3apredation 3areefs 3arisk 3asurface area 0aClimate change 0aEcosystem engineer 0aPredation 0aTrophic cascade 0aEnvironmental change 0aInteraction1 aLemasson, Anaëlle J.1 aKnights, Antony M.0 tMarine environmental research.g2018 Aug., v. 139 p.162-168dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245015700211300001200368520154400380592002801924650001701952650002001969650001501989650001202004650001502016650001702031650001602048650001102064650001202075651001002087651000902097651001602106651001702122700002102139773013502160856008302295852000902378655001202387IND60781985620221116200533.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078198562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-022-10488-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoshnoodi, Khalegh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2017-744710aUranium and rare earth elements in the phosphate deposits of the Pabdeh Formation, Zagros Zone, Iran: concentrations and geochemical patterns comparison  ap. 362.  aThe Upper Cretaceous-Eocene Mediterranean phosphogenic belt, in North Africa to the Middle East is one of the most important phosphate province of the world. The Pabdeh Formation in the west to south of Iran hosting the Tethyan sedimentary phosphate deposits of Iran is defined as low-grade deposits on a global scale. Forty-four phosphorite samples were collected from five phosphate deposits (Choram, Kuh-e Rish, Kuh-e Kumeh, Sheikh Habil and Khormoj) of Pabdeh Formation. Uranium in the Pabdeh phosphates ranges between 9.1 and 107.9 ppm, which is 14.9 (8.7–36.1) times more enriched relative to the NASC values. Pabdeh phosphate samples are enriched in heavy REEs relative to light REEs with an enrichment factor of 0.5 to 5.1 and show Ce anomaly. The REEs exhibit the same geochemical behaviour in the Pabdeh phosphate deposits, El-Jalamid and Umm Wual deposits in Saudi Arabia and also El-Sibayia and Abu Tartur deposits in Egypt, which are enriched in HREEs. Absence of U and REEs mineral based on mineralogical studies, strong positive relation between P₂O₅ and U and between P₂O₅ and REEs, as well as reducing conditions imply that U and REEs are mainly present in the francolite structure as substituting for Ca²⁺ in the Pabdeh phosphates. During Eocene to Oligocene hot arid climate, uranium was leached from continent and transported to sea by river as carbonate complexes. Finally, in reducing and weak alkaline condition, U⁶⁺ was converted to U⁴⁺ and substituted for Ca²⁺ in the francolite structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEocene epoch 3aOligocene epoch 3aarid zones 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3ageochemistry 3aphosphorite 3arivers 3auranium 3aEgypt 3aIran 3aMiddle East 3aSaudi Arabia1 aZiapour, Samaneh0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2022 July, v. 81, no. 14 p.362-362dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-022-10488-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03575naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013400163300001200297520197400309592002802283650002202311650001102333650001402344650002502358650001202383650001402395650001802409650001002427650003102437650002102468650000902489650001202498650001802510650002102528650001802549650002502567650001902592650002402611650002002635650001602655700002002671700001502691700001702706700001602723700001202739700001902751700001702770700001602787700001702803773009902820856008102919852000903000655001203009IND60468372420221120044846.0151223e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046837242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-015-0420-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yuling10aEndogenous target mimics, microRNA167, and its targets ARF6 and ARF8 during somatic embryo development in Dimocarpus longan Lour.  ap. 227.  amicroRNA167 regulates vegetative and reproductive growth by controlling expression patterns of auxin response factors 6 and 8 (ARF6/8) in plants. However, their mutual regulatory roles during plant embryo development are still unknown. Here, we first identified miR167 family members, isolated the primary miR167 and its promoter, predicted endogenous target mimics (eTMs), identified miR167 targets, and analyzed their accumulation in Dimocarpus longan (longan). Four variants of dlo-miR167a and one dlo-miR167f were identified; their accumulation at the cotyledonary embryo stage suggests they may be required for cotyledon-shaped embryo morphogenesis in longan. We then isolated the miR167 precursor, primary transcript, and promoter. The promoter contained cis-acting elements responsive to stimuli such as light, fungal elicitors, heat, low temperature, drought, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, gibberellic acid, and circadian control. Two eTM homologs of a phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinase family protein containing a FAT domain and an unknown protein were predicted for miR167. miR167 mediates transcript degradation in longan somatic embryos for DlARF8 but not cleaves for DlARF6. Moreover, both the eTMs were barely detectable in incomplete compact pro-embryogenic cultures and torpedo-shaped embryos, but reached peaks at globular embryos, which was largely reciprocal to that of their corresponding miR167, indicating a potential role in the negative control of miR167 expression; increased DlARF6 is required for somatic embryo development; miR167a/DlARF8 pair is essential to globular embryo formation and subsequent conversion to cotyledonary embryos. In addition, eTM-miR167-ARF6-8 signal transduction was found to play a conserved role in root development of the longan cultivar ‘Sijimi.’ We conclude that eTM down-regulates miR167 via cleavage of DlARF8 mRNAs in longan somatic embryo development, especially during late developmental stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDimocarpus longan 3aauxins 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3adrought 3aelicitors 3aembryogenesis 3afungi 3agene expression regulation 3agibberellic acid 3aheat 3alongans 3amessenger RNA 3amethyl jasmonate 3amorphogenesis 3aregulatory sequences 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3asomatic embryos 3atemperature1 aLai, Zhongxiong1 aLin, Lixia1 aLai, Ruilian1 aTian, Qilin1 aYe, Wei1 aZhang, Dongmin1 aYang, Manman1 aChen, Yukun1 aZhang, Zihao0 tMolecular breeding.g2015 Dec., v. 35, no. 12 p.227-227dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-015-0420-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009200166520197600258592002802234650002002262650001902282650001802301650001802319650001402337650001702351650001802368650001802386650001602404650001202420650001102432650001702443650001202460650002102472650002002493650001902513650002202532700002602554700002302580700001902603700002102622700002402643773011902667856007802786852000902864655001202873IND60768316320221120032513.0220225e20220209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076831632DNAL7 a10.3390/foods110404992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGowda, N. A. Nanje10aModern Processing of Indian Millets: A Perspective on Changes in Nutritional Properties  aGlobally, billions of people are experiencing food insecurity and malnutrition. The United Nations has set a global target to end hunger by 2030, but we are far from reaching it. Over the decade, climate change, population growth and economic slowdown have impacted food security. Many countries are facing the challenge of both undernutrition and over nutrition. Thus, there is a need to transform the food system to achieve food and nutrition security. One of the ways to reach closer to our goal is to provide an affordable healthy and nutritious diet to all. Millets, the nutri-cereals, have the potential to play a crucial role in the fight against food insecurity and malnutrition. Nutri-cereals are an abundant source of essential macro- and micronutrients, carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber, lipids, and phytochemicals. The nutrient content and digestibility of millets are significantly influenced by the processing techniques. This review article highlights the nutritional characteristics and processing of Indian millets, viz. foxtail, kodo, proso, little, and pearl millets. It also envisages the effect of traditional and modern processing techniques on millet’s nutritional properties. An extensive literature review was conducted using the research and review articles related to processing techniques of millets such as fermentation, germination, dehulling, extrusion, cooking, puffing, popping, malting, milling, etc. Germination and fermentation showed a positive improvement in the overall nutritional characteristics of millets, whereas excessive dehulling, polishing, and milling resulted in reduction of the dietary fiber and micronutrients. Understanding the changes happening in the nutrient value of millets due to processing can help the food industry, researchers, and consumers select a suitable processing technique to optimize the nutrient value, increase the bioavailability of nutrients, and help combat food and nutrition security.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3aclimate change 3adietary fiber 3adigestibility 3aextrusion 3afermentation 3afood industry 3afood security 3agermination 3ahulling 3ahunger 3amalnutrition 3amillets 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aphytochemicals 3apopulation growth1 aSiliveru, Kaliramesh 1 aPrasad, P.

There is a consensus that diversification of cropping would support sustainable development. However, a reduction in legume cultivation has been observed in the EU during the last decades. This decline has induced, in turn, a deficit of proteins and a reduction of ecosystem services provided by legumes. Therefore, we analysed the mechanisms that shape agricultural systems to identify leverage points for reviving European legume production. Specifically, we reviewed the factors that affect the market and non-market value of legumes and the relevant agricultural policies. We characterized the decline in legume cropping as an outcome of the dominance of economic forces that favour specialization of production systems over diversification. We found that the value of market outputs of legumes per unit area is relatively low and volatile, with a 25–78 % variation in pea gross margins, which reduces market competitiveness. We observed that the value of system-internal outputs of legumes such as the nitrogen fixed, of 130 to 153 kg N ha⁻¹; crop protection services that reduce agrochemical costs, by 20–25 % in cereals; and yield enhancements of subsequent crops, of 0.2 to 1.6 t ha⁻¹ in cereals, are often underestimated. In addition, markets fail to translate external effects of legumes such as biodiversity enhancement, reduction in emissions, of up to 50 % in N₂O, and soil improvements into economic benefits. Current policies support legumes through selected mechanisms such as ecological focus areas, agri-environmental programmes and sparse coupled support measures. Domestic cultivation of legumes could be supported through trade policies such as import restrictions on genetically modified soybean or new mechanisms to appreciate non-market outputs including payments for ecosystem services and carbon markets. In addition, development of new value chains, niche markets, scaling-up of plant breeding efforts and dissemination of information is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aagricultural policy 3aagrochemicals 3abiodiversity 3acarbon markets 3acrops 3adecline 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3afunding 3agrains 3aimport policies 3ainformation dissemination 3amarket value 3aniche markets 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apeas 3aplant breeding 3aplant protection 3aproduction technology 3aprofits and margins 3aproteins 3asoil 3asoybeans 3asustainable development 3atransgenic plants 3aEurope1 aAmjath-Babu, T.

However, an understanding of molecular aggregation during solution processing and its influence on thin-film morphology is still underexplored. Here, the influences of molecular aggregation on the film morphology, phase purity and phase separation, and mechanical and electrical properties of a partially compatible blend of conjugated polymer poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (IDTBT) and elastomer polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) were systematically examined. When using high-boiling-point (b.p.) solvents, namely, toluene and chlorobenzene, large-scale liquid–liquid phase separation predominates IDTBT aggregation in blend films, leading to isolated IDTBT domains and, thus, poor electrical performance. In contrast, fast solvent evaporation from low-b.p. chloroform suppresses large-scale phase separation and enhances IDTBT aggregation via nanoconfinement effect. The nanoconfinement effect enables us to achieve a stretchable film with a low elastic modulus of 72 MPa, a respectable crack-onset strain of 326% (ca. 3–14 times larger than the neat IDTBT films), and a negligible loss of mobility (ca. 0.7 cm² V–¹ s–¹) at 100% strain. These results provide insight into molecular aggregation and thin-film morphology in conjugated polymer/elastomer blends for high-performance stretchable electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorobenzene 3achloroform 3aelectronics 3aevaporation 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asolvents 3atoluene1 aDing, Zicheng1 aWu, Yin1 aLiu, Shengzhong Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6338-852X1 aHan, Yanchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9901-59951 aZhao, Kui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9512-04050 tMacromolecules.g2021 Dec. 28, v. 55, no. 1 p.297-308dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c015373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002300176245010600199300001500305520163300320592002801953650001801981650001001999650002302009650001502032650001902047650001702066650002802083650000902111650001802120650002002138650001402158650001402172650001602186650001202202650001102214700002202225700001702247773015102264856006902415856010202484990002302586852000902609655001202618IND60643635620221119200717.0190512e20150326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064363562DNAL7 a10.3791/526792doi7 aPMC44013782pmcid7 a258677162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeough, Michael B.10aExperimental demyelination and remyelination of murine spinal cord by focal injection of lysolecithin  ap. e52679.  aMultiple sclerosis is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by plaque formation containing lost oligodendrocytes, myelin, axons, and neurons. Remyelination is an endogenous repair mechanism whereby new myelin is produced subsequent to proliferation, recruitment, and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, and is necessary to protect axons from further damage. Currently, all therapeutics for the treatment of multiple sclerosis target the aberrant immune component of the disease, which reduce inflammatory relapses but do not prevent progression to irreversible neurological decline. It is therefore imperative that remyelination-promoting strategies be developed which may delay disease progression and perhaps reverse neurological symptoms. Several animal models of demyelination exist, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and curprizone; however, there are limitations in their use for studying remyelination. A more robust approach is the focal injection of toxins into the central nervous system, including the detergent lysolecithin into the spinal cord white matter of rodents. In this protocol, we demonstrate that the surgical procedure involved in injecting lysolecithin into the ventral white matter of mice is fast, cost-effective, and requires no additional materials than those commercially available. This procedure is important not only for studying the normal events involved in the remyelination process, but also as a pre-clinical tool for screening candidate remyelination-promoting therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aaxons 3acost effectiveness 3adetergents 3adisease course 3aencephalitis 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3amice 3amyelin sheath 3aoligodendroglia 3asclerosis 3ascreening 3aspinal cord 3asurgery 3atoxins1 aJensen, Samuel K.1 aYong, V.

However, evidence also suggests the relevance of non-climatic physical factors, such as light, and biotic factors, which may act in interactive or additive way. We used a mechanistic approach to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of four seaweed species (three dominant intertidal fucoids, Fucus serratus, Ascophyllum nodosum, Bifurcaria bifurcata, and the invasive Sargassum muticum) to different conditions of grazing, light irradiance and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We performed a large-scale mesocosm experiment with a total of 800 individual thalli of macroalgae. The factorial experimental design included major algal traits, photoacclimation, nutrient stoichiometry and chemical defence as response variables. Few significant effects of the factors acting alone or in combination were observed, suggesting a good capacity for acclimatization in all four species. The significant effects were generally additive and there were no potentially deleterious synergistic effects between factors. Fucus serratus, a species currently undergoing a drastic contraction of its southern distribution limit in Europe, was the most strongly affected species, showing overall lower photosynthetic efficiency than the other species. The growth rate of F. serratus decreased when UV radiation was filtered out, but only in the presence of grazers. Moreover, more individuals of this species tended to reach maturity in the absence of grazers, and the nitrogen content of tissues decreased under full-spectrum light. Only the phlorotannin content of tissues of B. bifurcata and of exudates of A. nodosum, both slow-growing species, were positively affected by respectively removal of UVB radiation and the presence of grazers. The findings for S. muticum, a well-established invasive seaweed across European coasts, suggested similar physiological response of this fast-growing species to different levels of grazing activity and light quality/intensity. As expected, this species grew faster than the other species. Bifurcaria bifurcata and A. nodosum only showed minor effects of light quality and grazing on phlorotannins content, which suggests good resistance of these two long-lived species to the experimental conditions. Mechanistic approaches that are designed to analyse interactive effects of physical and biotic factors provide an understanding of physiological responses of species and help to improve the confidence of predictive distribution models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3aBifurcaria bifurcata 3aFucus serratus 3aSargassum muticum 3aacclimation 3abiodiversity 3abiotic factors 3achemical defenses 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3aecophysiology 3aexperimental design 3agrazing 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alight intensity 3alight quality 3alittoral zone 3amacroalgae 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3astoichiometry 3asynergism 3athallus 3atissues 3aultraviolet radiation 3aEurope 0aFucoids 0aEcophysiological responses 0aGrazing 0aLight quality and intensity 0aAdditive effects1 aArenas, Francisco1 aFernández, Angela,1 aTroncoso, Jesús S.1 aMartínez, Brezo0 tMarine environmental research.g2018 Aug., v. 139 p.151-161dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03875naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010300170300001800273520250900291592002802800650001502828650002202843650003102865650001502896650000902911650001802920650001102938650001402949650002402963650001602987700005803003700002203061700005703083700006703140700006203207773011403269856008503383852000903468655001203477IND60731765520220207000000.0220207e20210311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073176552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c034852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagriñá, Ivan10aFerrocene-Containing DNA Monolayers: Influence of Electrostatics on the Electron Transfer Dynamics  ap. 3359-3369.  aA 153-mer target DNA was amplified using ethynyl ferrocene dATP and a tailed forward primer resulting in a duplex with a single-stranded DNA tail for hybridization to a surface-tethered probe. A thiolated probe containing the sequence complementary to the tail as well as a 15 polythimine vertical spacer with a (CH₂)₆ spacer was immobilized on the surface of a gold electrode and hybridized to the ferrocene-modified complementary strand. Potential step chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry were used to probe the potential of zero charge, PZC, and the rate of heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and the immobilized ferrocene moieties. Chronoamperometry gives three, well-resolved exponential current–time decays corresponding to ferrocene centers located within 13 Å (4 bases) along the duplex. Significantly, the apparent standard heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant, kₐₚₚᵒ, observed depends on the initial potential, i.e., the rate of electron transfer at zero driving force is not the same for oxidation and reduction of the ferrocene labels. Moreover, the presence of ions, such as Sr²⁺, that strongly ion pair with the negatively charged DNA backbone modulates the electron transfer rate significantly. Specifically, kₐₚₚᵒ = 246 ± 23.5 and 14 ± 1.2 s–¹ for reduction and oxidation, respectively, where the Sr²⁺ concentration is 10 mM, but the corresponding values in 1 M Sr²⁺ are 8 ± 0.8 and 150 ± 12 s–¹. While other factors may be involved, these results are consistent with a model in which a low Sr²⁺ concentration and an initial potential that is negative of the PZC lead to electrostatic repulsion of the negatively charged DNA backbone and the negatively charged electrode. This leads to the DNA adopting an extended configuration (concertina open), resulting in a slow rate of heterogeneous electron transfer. In contrast, for ferrocene reduction, the initial potential is positive of PZC and the negatively charged DNA is electrostatically attracted to the electrode (concertina closed), giving a shorter electron transfer distance and a higher rate of heterogeneous electron transfer. When the Sr²⁺ concentration is high, the charge on the DNA backbone is compensated by the electrolyte and the charge on the electrode dominates the electron transfer dynamics and the opposite potential dependence is observed. These results open up the possibility of electromechanical switching using DNA superstructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aferrocenes 3agold 3ahybridization 3amodels 3aoxidation 3asingle-stranded DNA 3avoltammetry1 aOrtiz, Mayreli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9423-00551 aŠimonová, Anna,1 aHocek, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1113-20471 aO’ Sullivan, Ciara K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2603-22301 aForster, Robert J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5079-31230 tLangmuir.g2021 Mar. 11, v. 37, no. 11 p.3359-3369dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c034853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03576naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013500167300002000302500001900322520178700341592002802128650002502156650001402181650002002195650001702215650002402232650001802256650002302274650003702297700002002334700002202354700002002376700001902396700001302415700001802428700001502446700001702461700001702478700002302495700002102518700002002539700001802559700001102577700002802588700002102616700002102637700001802658700001602676700002002692700006202712773013102774856008402905852000902989655001202998IND60712020520221119025730.0201009e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071202052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c028052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeija, Juris10aParticle Size Distributions for Cellulose Nanocrystals Measured by Transmission Electron Microscopy: An Interlaboratory Comparison  ap. 13434-13442.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aParticle size is a key parameter that must be measured to ensure reproducible production of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and to achieve reliable performance metrics for specific CNC applications. Nevertheless, size measurements for CNCs are challenging due to their broad size distribution, irregular rod-shaped particles, and propensity to aggregate and agglomerate. We report an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) that tests transmission electron microscopy (TEM) protocols for image acquisition and analysis. Samples of CNCs were prepared on TEM grids in a single laboratory, and detailed data acquisition and analysis protocols were provided to participants. CNCs were imaged and the size of individual particles was analyzed in 10 participating laboratories that represent a cross section of academic, industrial, and government laboratories with varying levels of experience with imaging CNCs. The data for each laboratory were fit to a skew normal distribution that accommodates the variability in central location and distribution width and asymmetries for the various datasets. Consensus values were obtained by modeling the variation between laboratories using a skew normal distribution. This approach gave consensus distributions with values for mean, standard deviation, and shape factor of 95.8, 38.2, and 6.3 nm for length and 7.7, 2.2, and 2.9 nm for width, respectively. Comparison of the degree of overlap between distributions for individual laboratories indicates that differences in imaging resolution contribute to the variation in measured widths. We conclude that the selection of individual CNCs for analysis and the variability in CNC agglomeration and staining are the main factors that lead to variations in measured length and width between laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acellulose 3adata collection 3ananocrystals 3anormal distribution 3aparticle size 3astandard deviation 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aBushell, M.

In Tanzania, the elevated fluoride (F⁻) concentration and related chronic fluorosis associated with drinking F⁻ rich water are common in the East African Rift Valley regions. In these regions, F⁻ concentration is space dependence which poses much uncertainty when targeting safe source for drinking water. To account for the spatial effects, integrated exploratory spatial data analysis, regression analysis, and geographical information systems tools were used to associate the distribution of F⁻ in groundwater with spatial variability in terrain slopes, volcanic deposits, recharge water/vadose materials contact time, groundwater resource development for irrigated agriculture in the Sanya alluvial plain (SAP) of northern Tanzania. The F⁻ concentration increased with distance from steep slopes where the high scale of variation was recorded in the gentle sloping and flat grounds within the SAP. The areas covered with debris avalanche deposits in the gentle sloping and flat grounds correlated with the high spatial variability in F⁻ concentration. Furthermore, the high spatial variability in F⁻ correlated positively with depth to groundwater in the Sanya flood plain. In contrast, a negative correlation between F⁻ and borehole depth was observed. The current irrigation practices in the Sanya alluvial plain contribute to the high spatial variability in F⁻ concentration, particularly within the perched shallow aquifers in the volcanic river valleys. The findings of this study are important to the overall chain of safe water supply process in historically fluorotic regions. They provide new insights into the well-known F⁻ contamination through the use of modern geospatial methods and technologies. In Tanzania's context, the findings can improve the current process of drilling permits issuance by the authority and guide the local borehole drillers to be precise in siting safe source for drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalluvial plains 3aenvironment 3afloodplains 3afluorides 3afluorosis 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airrigated farming 3airrigation 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3aresource management 3arivers 3aspatial data 3auncertainty 3awater supply 3aTanzania 0aFluoride contamination 0aVolcanic deposits 0aSpatial variability 0aGeospatial analysis 0aSanya alluvial plain 0aNorthern Tanzania1 aLigate, Fanuel1 aIrunde, Regina1 aBhattacharya, Prosun1 aAhmad, Arslan1 aTomašek, Ines1 aMaity, Jyoti Prakash1 aMtalo, Felix0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 810 p.152153-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1521533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001800174245010700192300001800299520150800317592002801825650002701853650001301880650002201893650000901915650001701924650001401941650001001955650001601965650001601981650002601997650002902023650003302052650001502085650001802100650001802118650003802136650003602174650003402210650002202244650002902266650003802295650002002333650002202353650004302375651001102418651001102429700002702440700002202467700002802489700003702517773008602554856008902640852000902729655001202738IND60112140320221116143239.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011214032DNAL7 a227395442pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVryzas, Zisis10aBiotransformation of atrazine and metolachlor within soil profile and changes in microbial communities  ap. 1330-1338.  aBiotransformation studies of atrazine, metolachlor and evolution of their metabolites were carried out in soils and subsoils of Northern Greece. Trace atrazine, its metabolites and metolachlor residues were detected in field soil samples 1year after their application. The biotransformation rates of atrazine were higher in soils and subsoils of field previously exposed to atrazine (maize field sites) than in respective layers of the field margin. The DT₅₀ values of atrazine ranged from 5 to 18d in the surface layers of the adapted soils. DT₅₀ values of atrazine increased as the soil depth increased reaching the value of 43d in the 80–110cm depth layer of adapted soils. Metolachlor degraded at slower rates than atrazine in surface soils, subsoils of field and field margins with the respective DT₅₀ values ranging from 56 to 72d in surface soils and from 165 to 186d in subsoils. Hydroxyatrazine was the most frequently detected metabolite of atrazine. The maximum concentrations of metolachlor-OXA and metolachlor-ESA were detected in the soil layers of 20–40cm depth after 90d of incubation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of soil Phospholipid Fatty Acids (PLFAs), fungal/bacterial and Gram-negative/Gram-positive ratios of the PLFA profiles revealed that the higher biotransformation rates of atrazine were simultaneously observed with the abundance of Gram-negative bacteria while the respective rates of metolachlor were observed in soil samples with abundance of fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aatrazine 3abiotransformation 3acorn 3aedge effects 3aevolution 3afungi 3ametabolites 3ametolachlor 3amicrobial communities 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil depth 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 2aAcetamidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aAtrazinexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiotransformation 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxmetabolism. 3aGreece 0aGreece1 aPapadakis, Emmanuil N.1 aOriakli, Katerina1 aMoysiadis, Theodoros P.1 aPapadopoulou-Mourkidou, Euphemia0 tChemosphere.g2012 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.1330-1338dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010100164300001600265500001500281520109400296592002801390650001301418650001301431650002401444650000801468650001601476650003001492650001101522650001601533650001001549650001601559650001401575650002401589650001501613650001001628651001001638653001601648700001701664773011301681856004801794852000901842655001201851IND50062535320221123014513.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006253532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-012-0708-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Weiping10aDesign of agricultural insurance policy for tea tree freezing damage in Zhejiang Province, China  ap. 713-728.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper proposes a method to design freezing damage policy-based agricultural insurance contracts for tea trees (an economic crop) in the Zhejiang Province of China, using a weather index. Data of economic losses caused by freezing damage, and the beginning dates of tea plucking (BDTP) from the Agricultural Bureau of each county in Zhejiang Province and tea planters, and meteorological observations were collected to establish the prediction model for BDTP, and to determine the relationship between economic loss rates caused by freezing damage at or before BDTP, and the minimum temperatures for “Wuniuzao,” “Longjing-43,” and “Jiukeng” teas. Based on the information diffusion theoretical model, occurrence probabilities of BDTP from 1 February to 20 April and lower temperatures at different levels are calculated. Then, the insurance premium rates of the three tea tree species can be estimated. Lastly, the tea tree freezing damage insurance contracts are designed, combining the advantages of regional yield-based index insurance and weather-based index insurance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanters 3afreezing 3ameteorological data 3atea 3aprobability 3ainformation dissemination 3amodels 3atree damage 3atrees 3atemperature 3ainsurance 3aagricultural policy 3aprediction 3acrops 3aChina 0acontracting1 aSun, Shanlei0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2013 Feb., v. 111, no. 3-4 p.713-728dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0708-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003700135040001800172100001300190245014700203300001400350520199000364592002802354650002002382650002202402650002602424650002902450650002402479650002302503650002002526650002102546650000902567650002002576650002302596650003002619650001502649650001402664650001302678650001502691650001502706650001602721653001202737653002602749653001402775700001502789700001802804700001502822700001502837773016402852856008403016852000903100655001203109IND60661702520221119033450.0211219e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066170252DNAL7 aPMC70826922pmcid7 a322115312pmid7 a10.1016/j.aninu.2019.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yun10aEffects of dietary probiotic supplementation on the growth, gut health and disease resistance of juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)  ap. 69-79.  aThis study investigated the effects of the Streptococcus agalactiae antagonizing probiotics Bacillus cereus NY5 and Bacillus subtilis as feed additives for Nile tilapia in terms of growth performance, intestinal health and resistance to S. agalactiae. A total of 720 apparently healthy juvenile Nile tilapia (0.20 ± 0.05 g) were randomly divided into 4 equal groups with 3 replicates for each group. Fish were fed a basal diet (control check group, CK group) supplemented with B. subtilis (1 × 10⁸ CFU/g feed, BS group), B. cereus NY5 (1 × 10⁸ CFU/g feed, BC group), and B. subtilis + B. cereus NY5 (0.5 × 10⁸ CFU/g feed of each probiotic, BS + BC group) for 6 wk, and the probiotic supplementation groups were then fed the basal diet for 1 wk to investigate the gut microbial community. The results of this study showed that BS + BC and BC treatments significantly increased weight gain (WG), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and S. agalactiae resistance in Nile tilapia (P < 0.05). Gut microvilli length and density and c-type lysozyme (lyzc) gene expression were significantly increased by probiotic supplementation (P < 0.05). The results of high-throughput sequencing showed that the B. cereus NY5 and B. subtilis + B. cereus NY5-supplemented feed resulted in a significant improvement in tilapia autochthonous gut bacterial communities and had a stimulation effect on a variety of potential probiotics after 6 wk of feeding. After cessation of probiotic administration for 1 wk, the gut bacteria of the fish in the BS + BC and BC groups had minor changes and maintained a stable state. Consequently, it was inferred that, as a feed supplement, B. cereus NY5 and the mixture of B. subtilis and B. cereus NY5 at 1 × 10⁸ CFU/g feed were able to promote growth and disease resistance, which may be associated with the supplement's effects on gut immune status, intestinal morphology, and intestinal microbial community composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus subtilis 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3acommunity structure 3adisease resistance 3afeed conversion 3afeed supplements 3afish 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3alysozyme 3amicrovilli 3aprobiotics 3aweight gain 0aTilapia 0aIntestinal microbiota 0aProbiotic1 aWang, Miao1 aGao, Fengying1 aLu, Maixin1 aChen, Gang0 tAnimal nutrition.g2020 Mar., v. 6, no. 1 p.69-79dElsevier B.V.aChinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary MedicinewJournal:23216x2405-65457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aninu.2019.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001700191245018400208506007600392520140700468592002801875506003701903650002701940650002701967650001101994650002202005650001702027650001502044650001002059650001302069650001102082650002702093650000902120650001402129650001402143650001802157650004402175650001802219650002002237650001302257651001002270653002402280653001002304653001302314653001202327653001602339653002602355700002102381700001902402700002502421700001802446700002202464773011302486856008402599852000902683655001202692IND60661702620221207072040.0200103e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066170262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fawpar.2019.e000642doi7 aPMC70340512pmcid7 a320956342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Koushik10aGenetic characterization reveals evidence for an association between water contamination and zoonotic transmission of a Cryptosporidium sp. from dairy cattle in West Bengal, India  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCryptosporidium sp. is an enteric parasite with zoonotic potential, and can infect a wide range of vertebrates, including human. Determining the source of infection and the mode of transmission in a new endemic region is crucial for the control of cryptosporidiosis. In the present study, we have assessed the importance of dairy cattle as a potential source of Cryptosporidium infection for humans in a newly recognized endemic region. Cryptosporidium isolates from dairy calves, humans (farm workers) and nearby water bodies were genetically characterized based on 18SrRNA and hsp70 genes. A high incidence of Cryptosporidium infection was identified in our study region. This finding is of public health concern. Cryptosporidium ryanae rather than Cryptosporidium parvum has been identified as the most prevalent infecting species in the study region. Infections were associated with clinical symptoms of infected animals. An incomplete linkage disequilibrium (LD) value with potential recombination events at 18SrRNA locus were identified for the first time in C. ryanae, which was previously reported as a clonal population. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of identical genotypes of a Cryptosporidium sp. from dairy calves, farm workers and nearby water bodies and indicates an association between water contamination and zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidiosis in our study region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aCryptosporidium ryanae 3aclones 3acryptosporidiosis 3adairy calves 3afarm labor 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3aparasites 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3azoonoses 3aIndia 0aCryptosporidium sp. 0aDairy 0aZoonotic 0a18SrRNA 0aAssociation 0aGenetic recombination1 aNair, Lakshmi V.1 aGhosal, Ajanta1 aSardar, Sanjib Kumar1 aDutta, Shanta1 aGanguly, Sandipan0 tFood and Waterborne Parasitology.g2019 Dec., v. 17 p.e00064-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23307x2405-67667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fawpar.2019.e000643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245011100166300001600277500001500293520215500308592002802463650002102491650002202512650002302534650001902557650001102576650001302587650002302600650003102623650001602654650001202670650002302682650001502705653001302720700002102733700002902754700002602783700002602809700002102835700002302856700002902879700001902908700002202927773009402949856007403043852000903117655001203126IND60135802220221119182602.0150522e20150701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013580222DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.237152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNazarychev, Victor M.10aParameterization of electrostatic interactions for molecular dynamics simulations of heterocyclic polymers  ap. 912-923.  a2019-12-04  aThe paper focuses on the problem of electrostatic interactions in molecular dynamics simulations of thermal properties of heterocyclic polymers. The study focuses on three thermoplastic polyimides synthesized on the basis of 1,3‐bis‐(3′,4‐dicarboxyphenoxy)benzene (dianhydride R) and three diamines: 4,4′‐bis‐(4″‐aminophenoxy) diphenylsulfone (diamine BAPS), 4,4′‐bis‐(4″‐aminophenoxy) biphenyl (diamine BAPB), and 4,4′‐bis‐(4''‐aminophenoxy) diphenyloxide (diamine BAPO). In the molecular dynamics simulations these polyimides were described by the Gromos53a5 force field. To parameterize the electrostatic interactions four methods of calculating the partial atomic charges were chosen: B3LYP/6–31G*(Mulliken), AM1(Mulliken), HF/6–31G*(Mulliken), and HF/6–31G*(ChelpG). As our parameterization is targeted to reproduce thermal properties of the thermoplastic polyimides, the choice of proper partial charges was finalized on a basis of the closest match between computational and experimental data for the thermal expansion coefficients of the polyimides below glass transition temperatures. Our finding clearly show that the best agreement with experimental data is achieved with the Mulliken partial atomic charges calculated by the Hartree‐Fock method with 6–31G* basis set. Furthermore, in addition to the thermal expansion coefficients this set of partial atomic charges predicts an experimentally observed relationship between glass transition temperatures of the three polyimides under study: TgR‐BAPS>TgR‐BAPB>TgR‐BAPO. A mechanism behind the change in thermal properties upon the change in the chemical structure in considered polyimides may be related to an additional spatial ordering of sulfone groups due to dipole‐dipole interactions. Overall, the modified force‐field is proved to be suitable for accurate prediction of thermal properties of thermoplastic polyimides and can serve as a basis for building up atomistic theoretical models for describing other heterocyclic polymers in bulk. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study aimed to investigate the association between AGEs and carotid atherosclerosis (CAS) as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD).A total of 1006 patients with type 2 diabetes were included. CAS was defined as the presence of carotid arterial atherosclerotic plaque in any of bilateral carotid artery segments measured by ultrasonography. AGEs were measured by the noninvasive skin autofluorescence method. AGEₐgₑ index was calculated as AGEs × age/100. Patients with CAS showed a significantly higher AGEₐgₑ (P < 0.01), and the prevalence of CAS increased with ascending AGEₐgₑ levels (P for trend < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that AGEₐgₑ was significantly positively associated with odds of CAS, and the odds ratios of the presence of CAS across quartiles of AGEₐgₑ were 1.00, 3.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90–4.74], 4.04 (95%CI 2.50–6.53) and 4.99 (95%CI 2.97–8.40) for the multivariable-adjusted model (P for trend <0.001), respectively. In the fully adjusted model, each 5.0 increase in AGEₐgₑ was associated with a 0.019 mm increment in carotid intima-media thickness. Furthermore, AGEₐgₑ presented an acceptable predictive value for CAS, with an optimal cutoff point of 43.2, and the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) were 74.5% (95%CI 70.7–78.1%), 61.9% (95%CI 57.2–66.4%) and 0.735 (0.706–0.762), respectively.AGEₐgₑ, the noninvasive measurement of AGEs combined with age is a promising approach for triaging patients at high risk of CVDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acarotid arteries 3aconfidence interval 3ametabolism 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aultrasonography 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aCarotid atherosclerosis 0aCardiovascular events 0aNon-invasive 0aType 2 diabetes 0aACR 0aAGEs 0aAGEage 0aAUC 0aBMI 0aCAS 0aCI 0aC-IMT 0aCRP 0aCVDs 0aDR 0aESC 0aESH 0aFCP 0aFPG 0aGA 0aHbA1c 0aHDL-c 0aLDL-c 0aLEAD 0aRAGE 0aROC 0aSBP 0aTC 0aTG 0aWHO1 aShen, Yun1 aZhang, Yang1 aWang, Yikun1 aLiu, Yong1 aYin, Jun1 aWang, Yufei1 aYin, Jingrong1 aZhu, Wei1 aBao, Yuqian1 aZhou, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1534-22790 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 Nov. 29, v. 31, no. 12 p.3449-3456dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245010700218500002200325520160000347592002801947653000901975653002801984653001702012653001702029653001202046700001502058700001802073700001902091773010802110856008302218852000902301655001202310IND60661702720221119033555.0190830e20190827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066170272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tsep.2019.1004002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeccarelli, Marino,d1909-1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8468-728910aTowards the nearly zero and the plus energy building: primary energy balances and economic evaluations  aPre-press version  aIn the construction sector, responsible of the greatest amounts of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, nowadays a significant turning point in the current scenario that qualifies building approach is taking place. In recent years, the ambitious nZEB (nearly Zero Energy Building), a building with very high energy performance, in which energy saving, cost-optimal vision and user well-being are assessed in a comprehensive way, has found legislative and operational implementation. Moreover, the adoption of increasingly challenging energy targets today offers important opportunities for the energy requalification and improvement of the overall quality of the building stock, particularly in the field of renewable plants.Within this frame in the paper, as a contribution to the analysis of benefits deriving from the use of RES (Renewable Energy Sources) plants in buildings, in terms of primary energy, cost, and greenhouse gas emissions, an intervention aimed at the satisfaction of the electric demand of a residential building through a photovoltaic plant, in different configurations (grid connected, stand-alone and storage on grid) has been analysed. For each configuration, balances between energy rates (production, load, grid exchange and/or battery store/withdrawal) have been hourly assessed in order to evaluate the Net Present Cost at the end of plant life.Moreover, a yearly primary energy balance has been determined, taking into account also thermal energy required to guarantee thermal needs (provided by a methane boiler), together with produced CO2 emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 0anZEB 0arenewable energy source 0asolar energy 0aphotovoltaic 0astorage1 aNucara, A.1 aPanzera, M.F.1 aPietrafesa, M.0 tThermal science and engineering progress.g2019 Aug. 27, dElsevier LtdwJournal:26839x2451-90497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tsep.2019.1004003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245017800170300001600348520166900364592002802033596007202061596003002133650001002163650002102173650002002194650001502214650000902229650001402238650001802252650000902270650002202279650002102301650002902322650001102351650001202362650002302374650001602397650002602413650001702439650001002456653001202466653002302478653001902501653002302520653002702543700001602570700002002586700001802606700001702624700001902641700001802660700001902678700004002697700001802737773012902755856007602884852000902960655001202969IND60673592220221120024032.0210209e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067359222DNAL7 a10.3382/japr/pfz0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWickramasuriya, SamiruS.10aMulti-Carbohydrase Addition Into a Corn-Soybean Meal Diet Containing Wheat and Wheat By Products to Improve Growth Performance and Nutrient Digestibility of Broiler Chickens  ap. 399-409.  aFeed enzymes are used in poultry diets to enhance nutrient availability and thereby improve growth performances of the birds. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary Multi-Carbohydrase (MC) supplementation on growth performance, blood metabolites, visceral organ weights, gut morphology, and nutrient digestibility in broiler chickens. A total of 168 one-day-old broiler chicks (47.5 ± 0.20 g) were randomly allocated into one of four dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 6 replications per treatment. Dietary treatments were as follows: (1) positive control (PC; energy sufficient, 3,200 ME, kcal/kg); (2) negative control (NC; energy deficient, 3,100 ME, kcal/kg); (3) PC with MC (MC; Superzyme-CS™; 0.05%); (4) NC with MC. Greater ADG (P = 0.022) was observed with the birds fed MC for the entire period (1–35 d) compared to birds fed a diet without MC. Birds fed the NC diet supplemented with MC showed improved FCR (P = 0.037) compared to birds fed the NC diet during the starter period (1–21 d). MC supplementation increased dry matter (P = 0.029), crude protein (P = 0.015), and energy digestibility (P = 0.015) of the birds compared to those fed a diet without MC on day 21. Moreover, birds fed a diet with MC had increased (P = 0.037) dry matter digestibility on day 35 compared to its counterpart, regardless of dietary energy level. Therefore, our study indicated that MC improved growth performance along with nutrient digestibility in broiler chickens fed corn soybean-meal-based diets containing wheat and wheat by-products from hatch to 35 d of age, regardless of dietary energy level.  aPublisher supplied data  cChungnam National Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002462  cCanadian Bio-Systems Inc. 3ablood 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3abyproducts 3acorn 3acorn meal 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestible energy 3adigestive system 3adry matter digestibility 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3agrowth performance 3ametabolites 3anutrient availability 3asoybean meal 3awheat 0abroiler 0agrowth performance 0agut morphology 0aMulti-Carbohydrase 0anutrient digestibility1 aKim, Eunjoo1 aShin, Taeg Kyun1 aCho, Hyun Min1 aKim, Beomgyu1 aPatterson, Rob1 aYi, Young-Joo1 aPark, Sungkwon1 aBalasubramanian, Balamuralikrishnan1 aHeo, Jung Min0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2019 June 01, v. 28, no. 2 p.399-409dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfz0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245012000172300002000292500001900312520089800331592002801229650001201257650002501269650001101294650001401305650002001319650002201339650001001361650001301371650001701384650001201401700001801413700002001431700007401451700002301525700002501548700001801573700002301591700002201614700001501636700006201651773013201713856008401845852000901929655001201938IND60712020920210421000000.0201009e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071202092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c028862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ryan Yongtae12aA Laser-Activated Membrane Introduction Mass Spectrometry Study of Proton Spillover Promoted Alkane Dehydrogenation  ap. 13462-13469.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOperando high-throughput evaluation of heterogeneous catalysts by laser-activated membrane introduction mass spectrometry (LAMIMS) elucidates the Pt loading dependence of methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation on platinized γ-alumina beads. A CO₂ marking laser rapidly and sequentially heats catalyst beads positioned on a heat-dissipating carbon paper support that overlays a silicone membrane, separating the bead library reaction zone from a quadrupole mass analyzer. The toluene m/z peak varies logarithmically with Pt loading, suggesting that reactivity includes factors that are negatively correlated to Pt loading.

The characterization of native and quaternized Cassia tora gum (CTG) was done by employing 2D NMR spectroscopy including HSQC and HMBC spectra. The data was analysed to identify the quaternary ammonium moiety introduced onto the galactomannan chain. The correlation signal of carbon and hydrogen of quaternary ammonium groups introduced onto the galactomannan chain was observed at 56 and 2.7 ppm respectively in HSQC spectrum. Further, the rheological data of CTG and derivatized product has been discussed.

However, optimal starter average feed particle size has not been identified and represents an important void, as this is a critical stage in a broiler's lifecycle. Therefore, 2 experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of average particle size on 0 to 14 d broiler performance in an effort to determine the optimal average particle size. Both experiments utilized Ross × Ross 708 male broiler chicks that were provided diets varying in average feed particle size from 1,202 to 2,172 μm (Experiment 1) or 1,174 to 3,736 μm (Experiment 2). Performance variables were analyzed with a randomized complete block design using one-way ANOVA. Improvements were most apparent for FCR with an associated 0.03 improvement in both experiments when broilers were provided feed of 1,760 or 2,172 μm (Experiment 1) or larger than 2,257 μm, compared to those receiving smaller average feed particle sizes (Experiment 2). Additionally, a 30 g improvement for ending BW and BW gain was demonstrated in Experiment 2 for broilers receiving ≥2,800 μm. However, linear relationships for 0 to 14 d FCR, ending BW, and BW gain for Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that the optimal particle size may not have been achieved during these experiments. Therefore, future research should focus on further expanding the range of particle sizes tested (beyond 3,700 μm) from 0 to 14 d to identify the optimal average feed particle size during this growth phase.  aPublisher supplied data  aMIS-322310cSpecial Research Initiativedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007229 3aanalysis of variance 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3adevelopmental stages 3adiet 3afeeds 3amales 3aparticle size 0aaverage particle size 0afeed quality 0abroiler performance 0acrumble 0afines 0apellets 0agastrointestional morphology1 aMcDaniel, ChristopherD.1 aMoritz, JosephS.1 aWamsley, Kelley G.S.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2019 June 01, v. 28, no. 2 p.420-434dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfz0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245007500202520141200277592002801689650001801717650000801735650001601743650002801759650001901787650001901806650000901825650002101834650001801855650001301873650001201886650002201898650001401920650001801934650001201952650001801964650000901982650001601991650001102007653001902018653002802037653002802065653001002093653002202103700001902125700001602144700001502160700001502175773010802190856008202298852000902380655001202389IND60661702920221119033602.0191214e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066170292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vas.2019.1000652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLühken, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3508-278510aMicrobiological air quality in free-farrowing housing systems for sows  aThis study investigates air hygienic characteristics of housing systems without fixation for lactating sows, with a focus on microbiological air quality. For animal welfare considerations, free-farrowing systems have been developed to replace those with farrowing crates (FC) and are currently available on the market. A group housing system (GH) for six lactating sows, a single loose-housing system (LH), and a conventional system with FC were tested. By maintaining similar management conditions, microbiological air quality was examined in eight batches with 148 farrowings in total with samplings at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the occupancy period of 33 days. No significant differences between the systems were observed in the concentration of total airborne bacteria (TAB), haemolytic streptococci (HS), molds, or yeasts. However, the concentrations of TAB and HS increased significantly over time. Additionally, significant correlations were detected for LH and FC between TAB and HS, and between TAB and carbon dioxide; significant correlations between TAB and inside temperature and total animal weight were revealed only in GH. Significant correlations between TAB and both the dust and inside humidity parameters were found only in FC. Given these results, it was shown that the free-farrowing systems used here do not necessarily lead to poorer microbiological air quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus 3aair 3aair quality 3aairborne microorganisms 3aanimal welfare 3acarbon dioxide 3adust 3afarrowing crates 3agroup housing 3ahumidity 3ahygiene 3alactating females 3alactation 3aloose housing 3amarkets 3amolds (fungi) 3asows 3atemperature 3ayeasts 0aAnimal hygiene 0aTotal airborne bacteria 0aHaemolytic streptococci 0aFungi 0aFarrowing systems1 aNicolaisen, T.1 aStracke, J.1 aSchulz, J.1 aKemper, N.0 tVeterinary and Animal Science.g2019 Dec., v. 8 p.100065-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23501x2451-943X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vas.2019.1000653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016700173300001400340520134100354592002801695650001901723650002001742650000701762650002201769650001301791650001101804650002001815700002301835700001901858773008801877856008401965852000902049655001202058IND60085655320221119221455.0141101e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008565532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2012.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukerjea, Rupendra10aSignificant increases in potato Starch-Synthase and Starch-Branching-Enzyme activities by dilution with buffer containing dithiothreitol and polyvinyl alcohol 50K  ap. 25-28.  aWe have recently found that the dilution of purified potato Starch-Synthases (SS) and Starch-Branching-Enzymes (SBEs), by a glycine buffer (pH 8.5), containing 1.0mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.04% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 50K, produced a striking and significant increase in activity (mIU/mL and total mIU) when diluted 1→2 to 1→10. As an example, one SS fraction diluted 1→10 went from 259 to 1470mIU/mL, giving a total of 14,700mIU. Dilutions of 1→15 usually resulted in a complete loss of activity. Removal of both DTT and PVA also gave the complete loss of activity. Individual removal of just DTT and the removal of just PVA also produced lowered activities on dilution. The addition of the DTT and the PVA back to the diluted fractions did produce an increase in the activity, but never to the extent that occurred when the samples were diluted simultaneously with both DTT and PVA together in the diluting buffer. Dilution of SBE with buffer containing both DTT and PVA, gave moderate increases, with the exception of one fraction that diluted 1→20 gave a significant increase from 18 to 382mIU/mL and a total of 7640mIU. It is concluded that there are inactive starch synthesizing enzymes in the purified fractions that are significantly activated by DTT and PVA, giving much greater amounts of enzyme activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adithiothreitol 3aenzyme activity 3apH 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3apotatoes 3astarch 3astarch synthase1 aGray, Alexander N.1 aRobyt, John F.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 367 p.25-28dElsevier Ltdx0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2012.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100001900174245010000193300001800293520179400311592002802105650001902133650001202152650003002164650001502194650001202209650001802221650001602239650002102255650001502276650002002291650001402311650001002325650001202335650001502347650001102362650001402373650001202387650004502399650002902444650002302473650002702496650003502523650002002558650002402578650005402602650005902656651002102715651001802736700001702754700001702771700002102788700002702809773008602836856008902922852000903011655001203020IND60112140720221116143401.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011214072DNAL7 a227264262pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Chan-Kook10aNationwide monitoring of mercury in wild and farmed fish from fresh and coastal waters of Korea  ap. 1360-1368.  aMercury (Hg) concentrations were monitored in wild and cultured fish collected from fresh and coastal waters in the Korean peninsula from April 2006 to August 2008 nationwide. Total Hg concentrations were reported for 5043 fish samples, including 78 species from 133 locations. Significant interspecies variation was noted in the Hg levels. The average Hg concentration in each fish species ranged from 6.31μgkg⁻¹ for mullet (Mugil cephalus) to 200μgkg⁻¹ for mandarin fish (Siniperca scherzeri). Among the species collected, the maximum concentration of Hg, 1720μgkg⁻¹, was measured in an Amur catfish (Silurus asotus). Only wild freshwater fish exceeded the WHO ingestion standard. Wild freshwater piscivorous fish samples from a large artificial upstream lake contained the highest Hg levels. Hg concentrations were compared between fish groups categorized as wild and farmed fish from freshwater and coastal waters. Although the wild freshwater fish had similar size ranges, their Hg concentrations were higher than those of the other groups. Compared to the feed of farmed marine and freshwater fishes, the prey of wild freshwater fish had a higher Hg concentration, and the total Hg concentrations in freshwater and associated sediment samples were higher than those in coastal water and associated sediment samples. In the freshwater environment, piscivorous fish bioaccumulated two times more Hg than carnivorous and omnivorous fish and four times more than planktivorous fish. The difference in Hg concentrations among trophic groups might have been due to differences in the size of fish, in addition to the variations among different trophic groups. These data will be useful for developing the fish consumption advisory as a management measure to reduce Hg exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMugil cephalus 3aSilurus 3aWorld Health Organization 3acarnivores 3acatfish 3acoastal water 3afarmed fish 3afish consumption 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3aingestion 3alakes 3amercury 3amonitoring 3amullet 3asediments 2aAnimals 2aAquaculturexstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aMercuryxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aRisk Assessment 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aKorean Peninsula 0aKorea (South)1 aLee, Tae-Woo1 aLee, Kyu-Tae1 aLee, Jong Hyeon,1 aYi, Ch'ang-bok,d1919-0 tChemosphere.g2012 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.1360-1368dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03884naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245017800171520220500349592002802554650002302582650002302605650001702628650001502645650004502660650002102705650002602726650001302752650002102765650002902786653001602815653002502831653001002856653002002866653002002886653001202906653001402918700002102932700002302953700002502976700001703001700001703018700006103035700001803096700006403114773010603178856008503284852000903369655001203378IND60750274120221121091929.0211030e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075027412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2021.1268622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, Ravindra10aDual role of a dedicated GAPDH in the biosynthesis of volatile and non-volatile metabolites- novel insights into the regulation of secondary metabolism in Trichoderma virens  aTrichoderma virens produces viridin/viridiol, heptelidic (koningic) acid, several volatile sesquiterpenes and gliotoxin (Q strains) or gliovirin (P strains). We earlier reported that deletion of the terpene cyclase vir4 and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, designated as vGPD) associated with the “vir” cluster abrogated the biosynthesis of several volatile sesquiterpene metabolites. Here we show that, the deletion of this GAPDH also impairs the biosynthesis of heptelidic acid (a non-volatile sesquiterpene), viridin (steroid) and gliovirin (non-ribosomal peptide), indicating regulation of non-volatile metabolite biosynthesis by this GAPDH that is associated with a secondary metabolism gene cluster. To gain further insights into the details of this novel form of regulation, we identified the terpene cyclase gene responsible for heptelidic acid biosynthesis (hereafter designated as has1) and prove that the expression of this gene is regulated by vGPD. Interestingly, deletion of has1 impaired biosynthesis of heptelidic acid (HA), viridin and gliovirin, but not of volatile sesquiterpenes. Deletion of the vir cluster associated terpene cyclase gene (vir4), located next to the vGPD gene, did not impair biosynthesis of HA, viridin or gliovirin. We thus unveil a novel circuitry of regulation of secondary metabolism where an HA-tolerant GAPDH isoform (vGPD) regulates HA biosynthesis through the transcriptional regulation of the HA-synthase gene (which is not part of the “vir” cluster). Interestingly, impairment of HA biosynthesis leads to the down-regulation of biosynthesis of other non-volatile secondary metabolites, but not of volatile secondary metabolites. We thus provide evidence that the “vir” cluster associated, HA-tolerant GAPDH in T. virens participates in the biosynthesis of volatile sesquiterpenes as a biosynthetic enzyme, and regulates the production of non-volatile metabolites via regulation of HA biosynthesis. The orthologue of the “vir” cluster in Aspergillus oryzae was earlier reported to synthesize HA by another group. Our study thus proves that the same gene cluster can code for unrelated metabolites in different species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aTrichoderma virens 3abiosynthesis 3agliotoxins 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3amultigene family 3anonribosomal peptides 3aresearch 3asesquiterpenoids 3atranscription (genetics) 0aTrichoderma 0aSecondary metabolism 0aGAPDH 0aGene regulation 0aHeptelidic acid 0aViridin 0aGliovirin1 aPachauri, Shikha1 aGururajaiah, Deepa1 aSherkhane, Pramod D.1 aKhan, Zareen1 aGupta, Sumit1 aBanerjee, Kaushik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5026-23701 aKumar, Ashish1 aMukherjee, Prasun K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3209-06560 tMicrobiological research.g2021 Dec., v. 253 p.126862-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2021.1268623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04244naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100002400186245015000210300001200360506007600372520211200448592002802560506003702588650002702625650002102652650002302673650001802696650001402714650001702728650001102745650001502756650002002771650002602791650002402817650001202841650001702853650001702870650001502887650001002902650002002912650000902932650001802941650001102959650002202970650002202992650001803014650004903032650004203081650001103123650000903134650001503143650002103158650002903179650003203208650001703240650001603257700002103273700001903294700001703313773016103330856004603491852000903537655001203546IND50061043420221207075607.0140121e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006104342DNAL7 a229671952pmid7 aPMC34993942pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-9-1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoefkens, Christine10aExplaining the effects of a point-of-purchase nutrition-information intervention in university canteens: a structural equation modelling analysis  ap. 649.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The importance of canteen meals in the diet of many university students makes the provision of simple point-of-purchase (POP) nutrition information in university canteens a potentially effective way to promote healthier diets in an important group of young adults. However, modifications to environments such as the posting of POP nutrition information in canteens may not cause an immediate change in meal choices and nutrient intakes. The present study aimed at understanding the process by which the POP nutrition information achieved its effects on the meal choice and energy intake, and whether the information was more effective in changing the meal choice of subgroups of university canteen customers. METHODS: The POP nutrition-information intervention used a one-group pretest-posttest design. A sample of 224 customers of two university canteens completed the baseline and 6-months follow-up surveys. A multi-group structural equation modelling analysis was used to test mediation effects of individual difference variables (liking, understanding and use of the information, subjective knowledge and attitude) on the energy intake from canteen meals, moderated by the objective nutrition knowledge and motivation to change diet. RESULTS: Significant relations were identified between liking of the information and its use on one hand and a positive effect in attitude towards healthy canteen meals on the other hand. Motivation to change diet and sufficient objective nutrition knowledge were required to maintain a recommended energy intake from canteen meals or to lead to a decrease in energy intake. Participants with greater objective nutrition knowledge had a greater understanding of the POP nutrition information which also resulted in a more effective use of the information. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that nutrition-information interventions may be more effective when using nutrition information that is generally liked by the target population in combination with an educational intervention to increase objective nutrition knowledge.

Exergoeconomic analysis is performed using the specific exergy costing (SPECO) method. The results show that among these cycles, although the LiBr–H2O cycle has the highest first law efficiency, but unit cost of electricity produced by turbine for LiBr–H2O cycle is more than that for Rankine cycle. This value is lowest for the NH3–H2O cycle. Moreover, the NH3–H2O cycle has the highest and the LiBr–H2O cycle has the lowest exergy destruction cost rate. The generator, the absorber and the boiler in all considered cycles have the maximum value of sum of cost rate associated with capital investment, operating and maintenance, exergy destruction and exergy losses. Therefore, these components should be taken into consideration from exergoeconomic viewpoint. In parametric study, it is observed that in the constant generator temperature, as the generator pressure increases, unit cost of power produced by turbine for LiBr–H2O and Rankine cycles decreases. This value for Rankine cycle is lower than for LiBr–H2O cycle whereas Rankine cycle efficiency is less than the efficiency of LiBr–H2O cycle. Also, in LiBr–H2O cycle, at constant temperature of the generator, the value of exergy destruction cost rate is minimized and exergoeconomic factor is maximized at particular values of generator pressure and the more absorber pressure results the minimum value of total exergy destruction cost rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aeconomic investment 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aexergy 3aheat 3atemperature 0aLiBr–H2O 0aAbsorption power cycle 0aExergoeconomic 0aRankine 0aNH3–H2O 0aExergy destruction cost rate1 aRanjbar, Faramarz1 aYari, Mortaza0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Dec., v. 88 p.657-668dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011600165300002000281500001900301520096700320592002801287650002501315650002101340650001501361650001901376650001701395650000901412700001801421700001401439700001801453700005201471700005401523700005701577700005701634773013201691856008401823852000901907655001201916IND60712021220221119030035.0201009e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071202122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c029182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Xiang10aFabrication of High-Density and Superuniform Gold Nanoelectrode Arrays for Electrochemical Fluorescence Imaging  ap. 13493-13499.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanoelectrode arrays have been widely used in electroanalytical applications. The challenge is to develop low-cost and simple approaches to the fabrication of superuniform and ultrasmall nanoelectrode arrays for improving analytical performance and imaging resolution. Here, superuniform and high-density gold nanoelectrode arrays with tunable electrode diameters and interelectrode distances have been fabricated by electrodeposition, followed by a simple mechanical polishing process. The fabricated free-standing arrays have a high density (10⁸ cm–²) of nanoelectrodes (60, 140, and 200 nm in diameter), and can be used as closed bipolar electrode arrays to image electrochemical heterogeneity with micrometer spatial resolution. With the help of a confocal microscope, individual nanoelectrodes can be visualized and resolved from the reflected light. Thus, the nanoelectrode arrays are promising in electrochemical imaging with high spatial resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectroplating 3afluorescence 3agold1 aLi, Zhong-Qiu1 aZhou, Yue1 aPan, Jian-Bin1 aLi, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1682-16851 aWang, Kang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5170-55431 aXu, Jing-Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9579-93181 aXia, Xing-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9831-40480 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 92, no. 19 p.13493-13499dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c029183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010900168300001600277520126500293592002801558650002401586650001901610650001801629650002801647650002401675650001601699650001901715653003601734653001501770653001701785653002101802653001901823700001901842700001601861700001301877700001701890700001801907773009701925856008602022852000902108655001202117IND60582370520221116165358.0171006e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058237052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.08.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yongjia10aNumerical simulations on the temperature gradient and thermal stress of a thermoelectric power generator  ap. 915-927.  aThermoelectric generator is a device taking advantage of the temperature difference in thermoelectric material to generate electric power, where the higher the temperature difference of the hot-cold ends, the higher the efficiency will be. However, higher temperature or higher heat flux upon the hot end will cause strong thermal stress which will negatively influence the lifecycle of the thermoelectric module. This phenomenon is very common in industrial applications but seldom has research work been reported. In this paper, numerical analysis on the thermodynamics and thermal stress performance of the thermoelectric module has been performed, considering the variation on the thickness of materials; the influence of high heat flux on thermal efficiency, power output, and thermal stress has been examined. It is found that under high heat flux imposing upon the hot end, the thermal stress is so strong that it has a decisive effect on the life expectation of the device. To improve the module’s working condition, different geometrical configurations are tested and the optimum sizes are achieved. Besides, the side effects on the efficiency, power output, and open circuit voltage output of the thermoelectric module are taken into consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric generators 3aelectric power 3aheat transfer 3aindustrial applications 3amathematical models 3atemperature 3athermal stress 0aThermoelectric power generation 0aEfficiency 0aPower output 0aStructure design 0aThermal stress1 aMing, Tingzhen1 aLi, Xiaohua1 aPan, Tao1 aPeng, Keyuan1 aLuo, Xiaobing0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2014 Dec., v. 88 p.915-927dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245019200173520189400365592002802259650001202287650001302299650002102312650002002333650002102353650001602374650001602390650001502406650002202421650002202443650002102465650002202486650001302508650002102521650001402542650001402556650001602570650001502586650001802601651001002619653001802629653002202647653002202669653000702691700001502698700001302713700001702726700001702743700001702760700001302777700001902790773011902809856008802928852000903016655001203025IND60759045820221119203204.0220207e20220220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075904582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1521622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Yuanzheng10aInteractions between anthropogenic pollutants (biodegradable organic nitrogen and ammonia) and the primary hydrogeochemical component Mn in groundwater: Evidence from three polluted sites  aAnthropogenic pollutants (organic nitrogen and ammonia) can change the dynamic balances of hydrogeochemical components of groundwater, and this can affect the fates of the pollutants and groundwater quality. The aim of this paper is to assess the long-term impact of pollutants on groundwater component concentrations and species in three sites that has been polluted with illegal discharge wastewater containing organic nitrogen and ammonia, in order to reveal the interactions between nitrogen species and Mn. We analyzed semi-monthly groundwater data from three sites in northwestern China over a long period of time (2015–2020) by using statistical analyses, correlation analyses, and a correlation co-occurrence network method. The results showed that wastewater entering groundwater from surface changed the hydrogeochemical component concentrations and species significantly. The main form of inorganic nitrogen species changed from nitrate to ammonia. The Mn concentration increased from undetectable (<0.01 mg/L) to 1.64 mg/L (the maximum), which surpassed the guideline value suggested by China and WHO. The main mechanism for Mn increase is the reductive dissolution of Mn oxide caused by the oxidation of organic nitrogen. Mn‑nitrogen species interaction complicates the transformation of nitrogen components. Chemoautotrophic denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) mediated by Mn are the major mechanisms of nitrate attenuation when dissolved oxygen is greater than 2 mg/L. Mn oxides reductive dissolution and reoxidation of Mn by nitrate reduction cause Mn to circulate in groundwater. The results provide field evidence for interactions between nitrogen species transformation and Mn cycle in groundwater. This has important implications for pollution management and groundwater remediation, particularly monitored natural attenuation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abiodegradability 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3aguidelines 3ahydrogeochemistry 3along term effects 3amanganese oxides 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3aorganic nitrogen 3aoxidation 3apollution 3aremediation 3awastewater 3awater quality 3aChina 0aPolluted site 0aOrganic pollution 0aAmmonia pollution 0aMn1 aHan, Yifan1 aLu, Hong1 aDu, Qingqing1 aXia, Xuelian1 aTeng, Yanguo1 aZuo, Rui1 aWang, Jinsheng0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 20, v. 808 p.152162-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1521623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245010800175520100400283592002801287650001901315650002001334650001601354650001201370651001001382653002301392653001801415653001001433773009401443856008101537852000901618655001201627IND60725193020221119210403.0210124e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072519302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2020.1052752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyekale, Abayomi Samuel10aDataset on cocoa production and climate change adaptation strategies in Ahafo Ano North District, Ghana  aSustainable cocoa production is susceptible to changes in some climatic parameters. This survey was carried out to understand the perceptions of cocoa farmers on climate change, its impacts on cocoa production and their adaptation methods. Stratified sampling method was used to select the farmers and data were collected with structured questionnaires. Stratification of the district was done based on existing seven administrative divisional offices which comprise of six area councils and one town council. Cocoa farmers were sampled within each stratum with sample size proportional to estimated number of farmers. During the survey, 378 cocoa farmers were interviewed from Abu-Bone (60), Anyinasuso (65), Biakoye (42), Kwasu-Abu (89), Subriso (35), Suponso (20) and Tepa (67). The dataset had been shared with this article and it is valuable for understanding the perceptions of cocoa farmers on climate change, cocoa production efficiency and determinants of climate change adaptation choices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3asample size 3asurveys 3aGhana 0aAdaptation methods 0aVulnerability 0aCocoa0 tData in Brief.g2020 Apr., v. 29 p.105275-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.1052753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245011000207300001200317506007600329520168600405592002802091596007802119596011102197506003702308650002202345650002002367650000802387650001102395650001002406650001702416650002102433650001302454650002502467650001402492650001702506700002502523700001902548700001702567700002202584700001902606700002002625700001902645773010302664856008202767852000902849655001202858IND60555977620221207103612.0210827e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055597762DNAL7 a266168342pmid7 aPMC46637252pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-015-0826-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawrenson, Tom10aInduction of targeted, heritable mutations in barley and Brassica oleracea using RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease  ap. 258.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The RNA-guided Cas9 system represents a flexible approach for genome editing in plants. This method can create specific mutations that knock-out or alter target gene function. It provides a valuable tool for plant research and offers opportunities for crop improvement. RESULTS: We investigate the use and target specificity requirements of RNA-guided Cas9 genome editing in barley (Hordeum vulgare) and Brassica oleracea by targeting multicopy genes. In barley, we target two copies of HvPM19 and observe Cas9-induced mutations in the first generation of 23 % and 10 % of the lines, respectively. In B. oleracea, targeting of BolC.GA4.a leads to Cas9-induced mutations in 10 % of first generation plants screened. In addition, a phenotypic screen identifies T₀ plants with the expected dwarf phenotype associated with knock-out of the target gene. In both barley and B. oleracea stable Cas9-induced mutations are transmitted to T₂ plants independently of the T-DNA construct. We observe off-target activity in both species, despite the presence of at least one mismatch between the single guide RNA and the non-target gene sequences. In barley, a transgene-free plant has concurrent mutations in the target and non-target copies of HvPM19. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the use of RNA-guided Cas9 to generate mutations in target genes of both barley and B. oleracea and show stable transmission of these mutations thus establishing the potential for rapid characterisation of gene function in these species. In addition, the off-target effects reported offer both potential difficulties and specific opportunities to target members of multigene families in crops.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/J004553/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (GB)  aBB/L014130/1cBBSRC and Engineering and Physics Research Council (EPSRC) Synthetic Biology Research Centre0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica oleracea 3aHordeum vulgare 3aRNA 3abarley 3acrops 3agene editing 3amultigene family 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3atransfer DNA1 aShorinola, Oluwaseyi1 aStacey, Nicola1 aLi, Chengdao1 aØstergaard, Lars1 aPatron, Nicola1 aUauy, Cristobal1 aHarwood, Wendy0 tGenome biology.g2015 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.258-258dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0826-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245016400211300002000375500001900395520190500414592002802319650001602347650002502363650002502388650001902413650003102432650002202463650002102485650001302506650002002519650002402539650001302563700007002576700007402646700006302720773013102783856008402914852000902998655001203007IND60712021320210421000000.0201009e20200826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071202132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c029422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCid-Barrio, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5426-811510aAssessment of the Potential and Limitations of Elemental Mass Spectrometry in Life Sciences for Absolute Quantification of Biomolecules Using Generic Standards  ap. 13500-13508.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) has been widely used in Life Sciences for the absolute quantification of biomolecules without specific standards, assuming the same response for generic compounds including complex biomolecules. However, contradictory results have been published on this regard. We present the first critical statistical comparison of the ICP–MS response factors obtained for 14 different relevant S-containing biomolecules (three peptides, four proteins, one amino acid, two cofactors, three polyethylene glycol (PEG) derivatives, and sulfate standard), covering a wide range of hydrophobicities and molecular sizes. Two regular flow nebulizers and a total consumption nebulizer (TCN) were tested. ICP–MS response factors were determined though calibration curves, and isotope dilution analysis was used to normalize the results. No statistical differences have been found for low-molecular-weight biocompounds, PEGs, and nonhydrophobic peptides using any of the nebulizers tested. Interestingly, while statistical differences were still found negligible (96–104%) for the proteins and hydrophobic peptide using the TCN, significantly lower response factors (87–40%) were obtained using regular flow nebulizers. Such differential behavior seems to be related mostly to hydrophobicity and partially to the molecular weight. Findings were validated using IDA in intact and digested bovine serum albumin solutions using the TCN (98 and 100%, respectively) and the concentric nebulizer (73 and 97%, respectively). Additionally, in the case of a phosphoprotein, results were corroborated using the P trace in parallel to the S trace used along the manuscript. This work seems to suggest that ICP–MS operated with regular nebulizers can offer absolute quantification using generic standards for most biomolecules except proteins and hydrophobic peptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aanalytical chemistry 3abovine serum albumin 3ahydrophobicity 3aisotope dilution technique 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3aphosphoproteins 3apolyethylene glycol 3asulfates1 aCalderón-Celis, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0331-15951 aCosta-Fernández, José Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8671-53001 aEncinar, Jorge Ruiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6245-57700 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 26, v. 92, no. 19 p.13500-13508dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c029423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245018100207300001800388500001900406520213500425592002802560650001302588650001002601650003502611650001602646650001302662650001202675650001302687650001302700650000702713650002402720650002002744650001402764700002102778700002202799700005502821700002002876773011402896856008403010852000903094655001203103IND60731766320221119124112.0210323e20210312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073176632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c001032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiki, Ryotaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6972-218910aMultinuclear NMR Study on the Formation and Polyol-Induced Deformation Mechanisms of Wormlike Micelles Composed of Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide and 3-Fluorophenylboronic Acid  ap. 3438-3445.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe had previously confirmed a glucose-responsive decrease in the viscosity of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and phenylboronic acid (PBA) wormlike micelle (WLM) systems. However, the mechanisms of the formation of WLMs and the decrease in viscosity with glucose addition have not been determined. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms using 3-fluorophenylboronic acid (3FPBA) based on ¹¹B NMR and ¹⁹F NMR analyses. The system in 60 mM CTAB/60 mM 3FPBA at pH 7.4 demonstrated high viscoelasticity, and the formation of WLMs in the system was confirmed by rheological characteristics. The ¹¹B NMR spectrum at pH 7.4 revealed that 3FPBA existed in a neutral form with sp²-hybridized boron; however, the ¹¹B signal disappeared in the presence of CTAB. In contrast, ¹⁹F NMR studies indicated that the quaternary ammonium ion of CTAB interacts with the phenyl group of 3FPBA in the sp² form via cation−π interactions. PBA derivatives react with various polyols; thus, we investigated the change in the viscous system after the addition of sugar and sugar alcohols. The viscosity of the WLMs decreased with increased polyol concentration, especially those of fructose and mannitol, in which the decrease was apparent at 40–160 mM polyols. The ¹⁹F NMR spectra revealed that polyol addition induced decrease in the sp² form of 3FPBA and increase in the sp³ form of 3FPBA. Based on the results, we propose the following mechanism of the polyol response: (1) The WLMs are stabilized by CTAB and 3FPBA in the sp² form using cation−π interactions as the driving force. (2) When polyol is added to the system, the sp² form of 3FPBA decreases and its sp³ form increases. (3) This change means that the structural component of WLMs decreases, which induces the disruption of WLMs, and the viscosity decreases. The formation and deformation mechanisms of the WLMs determined in this study are notable because 3FPBA interacts as a neutral compound, whereas CTAB often interacts with anionic aromatic compounds to form WLMs. Without ¹⁹F NMR measurements, these mechanisms would not have been discovered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aboron 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adeformation 3afructose 3aglucose 3amannitol 3amicelles 3apH 3aphenylboronic acids 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity1 aYamauchi, Tomoya1 aKawashima, Kosuke1 aEgawa, Yuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3317-91021 aSeki, Toshinobu0 tLangmuir.g2021 Mar. 12, v. 37, no. 11 p.3438-3445dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c001033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245010300214300001800317500001900335520147900354592002801833650001501861650001901876650001901895650003501914650001401949650001001963650001701973650000901990650001301999650001302012650002502025650002202050650002302072650001702095650002502112650002002137650002702157650001602184650001602200700002702216700006502243700005702308700006502365773011402430856008402544852000902628655001202637IND60731766420210903000000.0210323e20210308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073176642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c001042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoto-Cruz, Jackeline1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0151-337210aBiofabrication of Gold Nanotriangles Using Liposomes as a Dual Functional Reductant and Stabilizer  ap. 3446-3455.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNegatively charged liposomes accomplished both functions as a reducing and stabilizing agent in the synthesis of gold nanotriangles (GNTs). Liposomes are based on a mixture of phospholipids phosphatidylcholine/phosphoglycerol, and they were used as a template phase to perform the GNTs. The method was evaluated under different conditions such as temperature, reaction time, phosphoglycerol chain length, and precursor concentration. Isotropic and anisotropic gold nanoparticles are formed simultaneously during the synthesis. Therefore, by combining centrifugation and depletion flocculation strategies, the sample was concentrated in terms of GNTs from 15% crude to 80% by using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). As a result, a green colored dispersion was obtained containing highly purified, well-defined, negatively charged GNTs, where the edge length of most particles is centered in the range of 60–80 nm with an average thickness of 7.8 ± 0.1 nm. By this purification process, it was possible to highly increase the yield in terms of GNTs. Other surfactants [cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Tween 20, and dodecyldimethylammonium bromide] were evaluated during the purification stage, and both CTAB and CTAC show similar results to those obtained by using SDS. These GNTs are potential candidates for future applications in molecular imaging, photothermal therapy, drug delivery, biosensing, and photodynamic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3abiofabrication 3acentrifugation 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3achlorides 3adrugs 3aflocculation 3agold 3aisotropy 3ananogold 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotothermotherapy 3apolysorbates 3apurification methods 3areducing agents 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3astabilizers 3atemperature1 aConejo-Valverde, Paolo1 aSáenz-Arce, Giovanni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1848-79801 aDou, Hongjing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5850-91741 aRojas-Carrillo, Oscar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1305-76150 tLangmuir.g2021 Mar. 08, v. 37, no. 11 p.3446-3455dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c001043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012800176300001200304520123400316592002801550650001701578650001401595650001101609650001901620650002201639650001501661650002401676650001601700650004401716650002101760650000701781650001501788650001201803650002001815700002301835700002501858700002001883700002701903700002101930773008601951856008402037852000902121655001202130IND60085655820221119215718.0141101e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008565582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatzenellenbogen, Ewa10aStudies on the O-antigen of Hafnia alvei PCM 1224 structurally and serologically related to the O-antigen of H. alvei 481-L  ap. 5-9.  aMild hydrolysis of the lipopolysaccharide of Hafnia alvei PCM 1224 at pH 4.2 cleaved partially the O-polysaccharide chain by the glycosyl phosphate linkages to yield a phosphorylated hexasaccharide representing the repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide and higher oligosaccharides consisting of two or more repeating units.

Proper management of IBD requires both early diagnosis and novel therapies and management programs. Many reports have suggested that Chinese medicine has unique properties favorable to the treatment of IBD. However, there are no systematic analyses on this topic.This review summarizes recent studies that assessed the effects and mechanisms of Chinese medicine in the treatment of IBD in order to fully understand the advantages of Chinese medicine in the management of IBD.A literature search was conducted using peer-reviewed and clinical databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Springer LINK, Wan-fang database, the Chinese Biomedicine Database, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Keywords used were inflammatory bowel disease (including Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) and Chinese medicine. All selected articles were from 1997 to 2021, and each were assessed critically for our exclusion criteria. Studies describing the pathogenesis of IBD, the effects and mechanisms of Chinese medicine in the treatment of IBD, in particular their roles in immune regulation, intestinal flora regulation, and improvement of intestinal barrier function, were included.This review highlights recent progress in the use of Chinese medicine in the treatment of IBD. It also provides a reference for further evaluation and exploration of the potential of classical multi-herbal Chinese medicine in the treatment of IBD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrohn disease 3aOriental traditional medicine 3adatabases 3adigestive tract 3aearly diagnosis 3aidiopathic diseases 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3apathogenesis 3aulcerative colitis 0aInflammatory bowel disease 0aChinese medicine 0aImmune regulation 0aIntestinal barrier function 0aIntestinal flora 0aAhR 0aAMPK 0aBcl-2 0aBax 0aBBR 0aBMDCs 0aBZP 0aCAM 0aCAT 0aCD 0aCDI 0aCOX-2 0aCRC 0aCRP 0aDAI 0aDCs 0aDSS 0aEGCs 0aER 0aERK1/2 0aFMT 0aFoxp3 0aGFAP 0aGSH-Px 0aHG 0aHO-1 0aIBD 0aIBS 0aIEC 0aIL 0aILA 0aiNOS 0aIRF 0aJAK-STAT 0aJAM 0aJNK 0aLPS 0aMAPK 0aMCP-1 0aMDA 0aMDP 0aMIF 0aMLCK 0aMLKL 0aMMP-2/9 0aMPO 0amTORC1 0aMUC2 0aMΦ 0aNF-κB 0aNO 0aNOD 0aNRF2 0aOSM 0aOTUs 0aPA 0aPBMCs 0aPC 0aPF 0aPI3K 0aPGE2 0aP-gp 0aPLC-γ1 0asIgA 0aRCT 0aRG-I 0aRIP3 0aROS 0aSCFAs 0aShh 0aSOCS1 0aSOD 0aTCM 0aTCMSP 0aTEER 0aTGF-β 0aTGP 0aTh cell 0aTJs 0aTLRs 0aTreg cells 0aTNF-α 0aTNBS 0aTRPC1 0aUC 0aVEGF 0aZOs1 aLuo, Hua1 aTan, Dechao1 aZhang, Siyuan1 aZhong, Zhangfeng1 aWang, Shengpeng1 aVong, Chi Teng1 aWang, Yitao0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Nov., v. 92 p.153709-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1537093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245003900163300001600202520088500218592002801103650002501131650002201156650001401178650001601192650002601208650001401234650001801248650001701266650001401283650001001297650001601307653002501323653001001348653002501358653002301383653001401406700001701420700001501437700001601452700001701468700001401485700001301499773013901512856007901651852000901730655001201739IND60772889120221117233911.0220410e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077288912DNAL7 a10.1139/cjps-2021-01292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuthbert, R.D.10aAAC Redberry hard red spring wheat  ap. 496-504.  aAAC Redberry hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has a grain yield significantly higher than the check cultivars Katepwa, and Lillian and is similar to Carberry.

However, Fe(0) is vulnerable to passivation in the presence of oxygen, which significantly decreases its surface reactivity towards the removal of refractory contaminants. Microorganisms capable of reducing ferric iron in the presence of oxygen are expected to overcome the limitation of Fe(0) passivation. However, no studies to date have shown that microorganisms are able to depassivate Fe(0) for the removal of recalcitrant compounds in the presence of oxygen. In this study, we demonstrated that the carotenoid-producing Sphingobium hydrophobicum C1 was able to significantly enhance the removal of deca-brominated diphenyl ether by depassivating Fe(0) and subsequently removing the newly formed metabolites under semi-aerobic conditions (> 4 mg/L oxygen). S. hydrophobicum C1 effectively depassivated Fe(0) and regenerated its reactivity by reducing ferric iron under semi-aerobic conditions. Some unique characteristics of S. hydrophobicum C1, including the presence of membrane-integrated carotenoids and certain cell proteins, were essential for the ferric iron reduction of S. hydrophobicum C1 in the presence of oxygen. Our results may provide new insights into the bioremediation of persistent pollutants and will contribute to future studies to enhance our understanding of microbial iron reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphingomonas 3abioremediation 3acarotenoids 3adiphenyl ethers 3airon 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3apollutants 3aproteins1 aSong, Da1 aXu, Jingjing1 aSun, Guoping1 aXu, Meiying0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2017 Dec., v. 101, no. 23-24 p.8595-8605dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8549-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007900164300001600243520136900259592002801628650000801656650001301664650002501677650001701702650001001719650002001729650002701749650003001776650001301806650002801819650001501847650003501862650002601897651001101923700001901934773010101953856008102054852000902135655001202144IND60140162320221120150410.0150526e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6014016232DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954150500872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYudin, N. S.10aMolecular genetic markers of economically important traits in dairy cattle  ap. 506-517.  aThe selection efficiency of complex quantitative economically important traits in dairy cattle depends on the identification of candidate genes responsible for these traits, as well as the determination of causative DNA polymorphism in these genes. Here, we review examples of DNA polymorphisms in coding and noncoding parts of genes that are associated with milk yield, milk fat and protein yields, milk fat and protein percentages, the biochemical composition of milk, and other milk production traits. Together with data of foreign authors, which were obtained predominantly for Holstein cattle, much attention in the review is paid to studies on Russian cattle breeds. Particular attention is dedicated to DNA polymorphisms in the genes encoding transcription factors, which can potentially affect a large number of traits. The results of association analyses are summarized in a table, and they present the progress of research in this area in recent years. Our analysis indicates that the majority of SNPs, which are associated with significant effects on milk production traits, are probably in a linkage disequilibrium with yet unknown mutations. The identification of functionally significant DNA polymorphisms and other genetic factors (epimutations, CNV) is necessary for effective marker-assisted selection and genomic selection of dairy cattle breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHolstein 3achemical composition 3adairy cattle 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amarker-assisted selection 3amilk fat 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factors 3aRussia1 aVoevoda, M.

Its southernmost breeding population in the Low Arctic occurred in Iceland but started to decline in numbers at the beginning of the 20th century ending in extirpation at the end of the same century. Climate warming has been blamed for the disappearance of this population. However, it was also exploited by humans (mainly for eggs). Thus, it is unclear what was the main driver for the population collapse. In this study, we reconstruct population dynamics in relation to changes in environmental conditions, and perform stochastic modelling of population viability considering various scenarios including presence/absence of climate warming and/or egg harvest. We found that extirpation of the studied population was attributed to synergistic effects of both climate warming and human harvest. The simulations revealed that climate warming without harvest would cause a 71% decline in population size but not lead to extirpation. Models with climate warming and egg harvesting resulted in population estimates close to the real data (decrease from 400 individuals in 1903 to 2 in 1996). This is one of the few studies documenting synergistic effect of climate warming and human exploitation on extirpation. A strong harvesting component in the explanation for the decline of the study population emphasizes the continuing need to control commercial harvest of animal species in the face of other pressures such as climate warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aeggs 3ahumans 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3apopulation viability 3aseabirds 3asynergism 3aArctic region 3aIceland 0aClimate warming 0aSeabird 0aOverexploitation 0aEgg harvest 0aDovekie 0aGrímsey1 aWojczulanis-Jakubas, Katarzyna1 aPetersen, Ævar,0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Feb. 20, v. 808 p.152167-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1521673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245008100164300001600245520157900261592002801840650004401868650003701912650001501949650002001964650001101984650001501995650001702010650001702027700001502044700002102059700001602080700001602096700001502112700002602127773009002153856008502243852000902328655001202337IND4450870320221117064449.0141111e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445087032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaiani, C.10aMilk proteins differentiation and competitive adsorption during spray-drying  ap. 983-990.  aA non invasive method was developed to differentiate native whey proteins (NWI) and native micellar casein (NMC) at the surface of high protein milk powder. Surface analyses of the powders were performed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). With this tool, it was impossible to differentiate casein and whey proteins by their C₁ₛ, O₁ₛ and N₁ₛ signature; the atomic percentage being similar. But, minerals at the surface of these proteins were significantly different. As a consequence, a calibration curve was obtained with known mixes of both proteins and was used for their differentiation. Competitive adsorption between casein and whey proteins during spray-drying was studied by a combination of different analytical methodologies (XPS, FTIR, zetasizer). The influence of the outlet air temperature on dairy proteins competition at the surface of the particle was investigated. For this purpose, three formulations were studied: 80/20, 50/50 and 20/80 (casein/whey proteins) and spray-dried at 80 and 130 °C (outlet air temperature). In formulations spray-dried at 80 °C, caseins were found overrepresented at the surface in comparison with the bulk composition. At 130 °C, the repartition between caseins and whey proteins was mostly the same at the surface and in the bulk. It was concluded that low outlet air temperatures allow the migration of surface-active components at the surface. As the spray-drying temperature increased, the surface may solidify and immobilize the proteins quickly, the surface being closer to the bulk composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aair temperature 3acasein 3adried milk 3aspray drying 3awhey protein1 aMullet, M.1 aArab-Tehrany, E.1 aJacquot, M.1 aPerroud, C.1 aRenard, A.1 aScher, Jeffrey Noyes,0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2011 July, v. 25, no. 5 p.983-990dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2010.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011700178300001800295500001900313520211200332592002802444650002502472650001602497650003902513650001202552650002002564650001302584650001702597700006202614773011402676856008402790852000902874655001202883IND60731766720221119124019.0210323e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073176672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c003192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPattnaik, Gourab Prasad10aFusogenic Effect of Cholesterol Prevails over the Inhibitory Effect of a Peptide-Based Membrane Fusion Inhibitor  ap. 3477-3489.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMembrane fusion is the primary step in the entry of enveloped viruses into the host cell. Membrane composition modulates the membrane fusion by changing the organization dynamics of the fusion proteins, peptides, and membranes. The asymmetric lipid compositions of the viral envelope and the host cell influence the membrane fusion. Cholesterol is an important constituent of mammalian cells and plays a vital role in the entry of several viruses. In our pursuit of developing peptide-based general fusion inhibitors, we have previously shown that a coronin 1-derived peptide, TG-23, inhibited polyethylene glycol-induced fusion between symmetric membranes without cholesterol. In this work, we have studied the effect of TG-23 on the polyethylene glycol-mediated fusion between 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DOPG) (60/30/10 mol %) and DOPC/DOPE/DOPG/CH (50/30/10/10 mol %) membranes and between DOPC/DOPE/DOPG (60/30/10 mol %) and DOPC/DOPE/DOPG/CH (40/30/10/20 mol %) membranes. Our results demonstrate that the TG-23 peptide inhibited the fusion between membranes containing 0 and 10 mol % cholesterol though the efficacy is less than that of symmetric fusion between membranes devoid of cholesterol, and the inhibitory efficacy becomes negligible in the fusion between membranes containing 0 and 20 mol % cholesterol. Several steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic techniques have been successfully utilized to evaluate the organization, dynamics, and membrane penetration of the TG-23 peptide. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the reduction of the inhibitory effect of TG-23 in asymmetric membrane fusion containing cholesterol of varying concentrations is not due to the altered peptide structure, organization, and dynamics, rather owing to the intrinsic negative curvature-inducing property of cholesterol. Therefore, the membrane composition is an added complexity in the journey of developing peptide-based membrane fusion inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetric membranes 3acholesterol 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amammals 3amembrane fusion 3apeptides 3apolyethylene1 aChakraborty, Hirak1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7499-57070 tLangmuir.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 37, no. 11 p.3477-3489dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c003193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002200174245009700196300001800293520135100311592002801662650001301690650003201703650002201735650001901757650001301776650001601789650001301805650002501818650005401843650003501897650002901932650002701961650001301988650003702001650002102038650002402059650002402083650003802107650005302145700001802198700002102216700003002237700001802267700002702285773008602312856008902398852000902487655001202496IND60112141320221116143347.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011214132DNAL7 a226823612pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbieri, Manuela10aFate of β-blockers in aquifer material under nitrate reducing conditions: Batch experiments  ap. 1272-1277.  aThe fate of the three environmentally relevant β-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol has been studied in batch experiments involving aquifer material and nitrate reducing conditions. Results from the about 90d long tests indicate that abiotic processes, most likely sorption, jointly with biotransformation to atenololic acid were responsible for the 65% overall removal observed for atenolol. Zero order kinetics, typical of enzyme-limited reactions, controlled the transformation of this beta blocker to its corresponding carboxylic acid. The mass balance evidences that no mineralization of atenolol occurs in the biotic experiment and that atenololic acid is more stable than its parent compound under the studied conditions. This finding stresses the importance of considering atenololic acid as target compound in the environmental studies on the fate of atenolol. For metoprolol and propranolol the results from the experiment suggest a slower sorption to be the dominant removal process, which led to final decreases in concentrations of 25–30% and 40–45%, respectively. Overall, the removals observed in the experiments suggest that subsurface processes potentially constitute an alternative water treatment for the target beta-blockers, when compared to the removals reported for conventional wastewater treatment plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3abiotransformation 3amineralization 3anitrates 3apropranolol 3asorption 3awastewater treatment 2aAdrenergic beta-Antagonistsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aAtenololxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGroundwaterxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aMetoprololxanalysisxchemistry. 2aModels, Chemical 2aNitratesxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPropranololxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry.1 aLicha, Tobias1 aNödler, Karsten1 aCarrera Ramírez, Jesús,1 aAyora, Carlos1 aSánchez-Vila, Xavier,0 tChemosphere.g2012 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.1272-1277dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245010100207300001600308506007600324520074400400592002801144506003701172650001401209650000801223650001801231650001101249650001401260650003301274650001801307650001701325650001301342650002201355650001201377651000901389700002201398700002001420700002001440700001601460773009601476856008101572852000901653655001201662IND60575841220221207124937.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057584122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-016-3147-62doi7 aPMC53290892pmcid7 a278582902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Souza, Joao10aComplete sequence and variability of a new subgroup B nepovirus infecting potato in central Peru  ap. 885-889.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe complete bipartite genome (RNA1 and RNA2) of a new nepovirus infecting potato was obtained using small RNA sequencing and assembly complemented by Sanger sequencing.

An overall accounting of net greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) was conducted of a whole rice–winter wheat rotation year of 2010–2011 in a paddy soil under biochar soil amendment at different rates from Southeast China. Fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured using a static chamber method, and the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) was estimated by the difference between net primary production (NPP) and soil CO2 emissions (RH) for both rice and winter wheat growing seasons. While no change observed in RH, NPP of both rice and winter wheat was similar between the treatments except for an increase under BSA at 10tha−1 over the control. However, seasonal total N2O emission was significantly and greatly decreased by 45.1% and 39.5% of rice growing season, and by 37.6% and 41.2% of winter wheat growing season under BSA treatment of 20tha−1 and 40tha−1 respectively over the control. Whereas, a 30.6% increase in seasonal total CH4 emission was observed only under BSA of 20tha−1 of the rice growing season. However, BSA both at 20tha−1 and 40tha−1 exerted a great reduction in both NGHGB and GHGI of wheat cropping season but of the rice season. As an overall effect, a net reduction in GHGI by 10–20% with BSA was significant across all the biochar treatments. And this reduction could be accounted mainly by the consistent decrease in N2O emission across rice and wheat growing cycles with insignificant changes in soil respiration and CH4 flux during rice season. Whereas there could be variable changes in crop yield and net ecosystem GHGs balance with biochar rates and with crop cycles, biochar soil amendment (BSA) could have a great potential to reach a low carbon intensity production with sustaining crop productivity of a whole rice and wheat rotation system in rice-based agriculture of China.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abiomass 3abovine serum albumin 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3agrowing season 3amethane 3anet ecosystem exchange 3anitrous oxide 3apaddy soils 3aprimary productivity 3arice 3arice soils 3asoil amendments 3asoil respiration 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aBSA 0aGHGs 0aGHGI 0aNEE 0aNGHGB 0aNPP 0aRH 0aBiochar 0aSoil respiration 0aEcosystem carbon balance 0aGreenhouse gas intensity 0aRice–winter wheat rotation 0aEmission trade-off1 aBian, Rongjun1 aHussain, Qaiser1 aLi, Lianqing1 aPan, Gengxing1 aZheng, Jinwei1 aZhang, Xuhui1 aZheng, Jufeng0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2013 July 01, v. 173 p.37-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014600164300001400310520232900324592002802653650003102681650001602712650001902728650002002747650001002767650002202777650001702799650002102816650002202837650001402859650001002873650004302883650001202926650001102938650001202949651001402961653001002975653001202985653001102997653001103008653001203019653001403031700001603045700001803061700001603079700002303095700002003118773011603138856008203254852000903336655001203345IND60539875020221122033558.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053987502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2015.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnibb, Wayne10aYearly, pond, lineage and family variation of hepatopancreatic parvo-like virus (HPV) copy number in banana shrimp Fenneropenaeus merguiensis  ap. 73-79.  aHepatopancreatic parvo-like virus (HPV) has been reported from a variety of shrimp species around the world, including Australia, and thought to impact negatively on production, but until now there was scant information available on variation of HPV over time, ponds and shrimp lineages or families, information that could be used to manage or reduce virus levels.Here we report HPV copy number estimated using qPCR from 1500 individual shrimp sampled over three years and encompassing 91 ponds, 21 breeding groups or lineages and 40 families.HPV copy number variation between ponds was used by farm management as a criterion to choose prospective broodstock (candidates were taken from low HPV ponds). Despite such choice, HPV levels in farmed animals were not reduced from 2011 to 2013. Accordingly, the hypothesis that HPV levels can be reduced over time simply by considering average HPV levels in ponds alone is rejected.Different lines of shrimp within the same farm had different HPV levels, but as lines were raised separately, the line differences could be due to either genetic or environmental differences, the latter including possible different rearing effects and differences in vertical transmission.There were large (up to 2–3 LOG fold) differences of HPV levels between families bred and grown together contemporaneously, and the heritability for HPV copy number was estimated to be moderate to large (0.40±0.13). Apart from genetic differences, differences of vertical transmission from dams may contribute to the between family differences, in any case we postulate that selection between families could be an effective method to reduce HPV levels.HPV levels were not genetically correlated with performance traits such as body weight or length, so selection for HPV level should not adversely affect production characteristics.This is the first evidence for an aquacultured species that viral levels, as opposed to survival/resistance to viruses, may have a substantial host genetic component. The heritability reported here for virus copy number was higher that most heritabilities reported for survival to specific pathogens such as white spot, raising the general postulate that selection for virus copy number may be more effective and repeatable than selection for survival to pathogen challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFenneropenaeus merguiensis 3abody weight 3abreeding stock 3afarm management 3afarms 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aline differences 3apathogen survival 3apathogens 3aponds 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arearing 3ashrimp 3aviruses 3aAustralia 0aVirus 0aDisease 0aShrimp 0aFamily 0aGenetic 0aVariation1 aQuinn, Jane1 aKuballa, Anna1 aPowell, Dan1 aRemilton, Courtney1 aNguyên Hồng,0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2015 June, v. 128 p.73-79dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2015.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01998naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005100169300002000220520096900240592002801209650001301237650001001250650001601260650001301276650002601289650001201315650001701327700002401344700001901368700001801387700001401405700002101419773010101440856008601541852000901627655001201636IND60577346820180109000000.0170808e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057734682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b034432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Yong Lin10aDeposition of Quantum Dots in a Capillary Tube  ap. 12560-12566.  aThe ability to assemble nanomaterials, such as quantum dots, enables the creation of functional devices that present unique optical and electronic properties. For instance, light-emitting diodes with exceptional color purity can be printed via the evaporative-driven assembly of quantum dots. Nevertheless, current studies of the colloidal deposition of quantum dots have been limited to the surfaces of a planar substrate. Here, we investigate the evaporation-driven assembly of quantum dots inside a confined cylindrical geometry. Specifically, we observe distinct deposition patterns, such as banding structures along the length of a capillary tube. Such coating behavior can be influenced by the evaporation speed as well as the concentration of quantum dots. Understanding the factors governing the coating process can provide a means to control the assembly of quantum dots inside a capillary tube, ultimately enabling the creation of novel photonic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acolor 3aevaporation 3ageometry 3alight emitting diodes 3aphotons 3aquantum dots1 aBoulogne, François1 aKim, Hyoungsoo1 aNunes, Janine1 aFeng, Jie1 aStone, Howard A.0 tLangmuir.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 31, no. 45 p.12560-12566dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b034433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132024004200167040001800209100002200227245008600249300001400335506002800349506003600377506007600413506003100489520144600520592002801966596004501994506003702039650001902076650002602095650002102121650002402142650001402166650001002180650002102190650003202211650001002243650002402253650002102277650002002298650001402318650001502332650001902347650001402366653002802380653001602408653001502424653001402439653002402453700002402477700002902501700002202530700002302552773011602575856008202691903002402773961001302797852000902810655001202819IND60539875120221207070352.0190318e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053987512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2015.05.0032chorus7 a10.1016/j.jip.2015.05.0032doi7 a10.1016/j.jip.2015.05.0032chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlinger, Ellen G.10aMixed infections reveal virulence differences between host-specific bee pathogens  ap. 28-35.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aDynamics of host–pathogen interactions are complex, often influencing the ecology, evolution and behavior of both the host and pathogen. In the natural world, infections with multiple pathogens are common, yet due to their complexity, interactions can be difficult to predict and study. Mathematical models help facilitate our understanding of these evolutionary processes, but empirical data are needed to test model assumptions and predictions. We used two common theoretical models regarding mixed infections (superinfection and co-infection) to determine which model assumptions best described a group of fungal pathogens closely associated with bees. We tested three fungal species, Ascosphaera apis, Ascosphaera aggregata and Ascosphaera larvis, in two bee hosts (Apis mellifera and Megachile rotundata). Bee survival was not significantly different in mixed infections vs. solo infections with the most virulent pathogen for either host, but fungal growth within the host was significantly altered by mixed infections. In the host A. mellifera, only the most virulent pathogen was present in the host post-infection (indicating superinfective properties). In M. rotundata, the most virulent pathogen co-existed with the lesser-virulent one (indicating co-infective properties). We demonstrated that the competitive outcomes of mixed infections were host-specific, indicating strong host specificity among these fungal bee pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApis mellifera 3aAscosphaera aggregata 3aAscosphaera apis 3aMegachile rotundata 3aevolution 3afungi 3ahost specificity 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahosts 3amathematical models 3amicrobial growth 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3aprediction 3asuperinfection 3avirulence 0aAlfalfa leafcutting bee 0aAscosphaera 0aChalkbrood 0aHoney bee 0aMultiple infections1 aVojvodic, Svjetlana1 aDeGrandi-Hoffman, Gloria1 aWelker, Dennis L.1 aJames, Rosalind R.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2015 July, v. 129 p.28-35dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2015.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245013900198300001800337506007600355520093800431592002801369506003701397650002001434650001101454650001901465650001601484650001201500650001801512650001901530650001401549650001401563700001401577700002101591700001501612700002201627773013001649856007401779852000901853655001201862IND60621935420221207081400.0181123e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062193542DNAL7 a10.1039/c8bm00851e2doi7 aPMC62468102pmcid7 a303755832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Nanjing10aMicrofluidics-enabled rapid manufacturing of hierarchical silica-magnetic microflower toward enhanced circulating tumor cell screening  ap. 3121-3125.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe emergence of microfluidic techniques provides new opportunities for chemical synthesis and biomedical applications. Herein, we first develop a microfluidics-based flow and sustainable strategy to synthesize hierarchical silica-magnetic microflower with unique multilayered structure for the efficient capture of circulating tumor cells through our engineered microfluidic screening chip. The production of microflower materials can be realized within 94 milliseconds and a yield of nearly 5 grams per hour can be achieved. The enhanced bioaccessibility of such a multilayered microflower towards cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) is demonstrated, and the cancer cell capture efficiency of this hierarchical immunomagnetic system in clinical blood samples is significantly increased compared with a standard CellSearch™ assay.

In order to check whether this is affecting the levels of this trace metal on living organisms, time-series analysis of freeze-dried soft tissue material of wild mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) covering the period from 1991 to 2001 and collected at an urban beach in the city of Vigo (NW Iberian Peninsula) was conducted. Concentrations ranged from 0.30 to 0.68ngg−1 with an average concentration of 0.47±0.10ngg−1 (n=21); these concentrations were higher than those obtained for samples collected at a control location away from anthropogenic pressure (0.31±0.10ngg−1; n=5). Platinum concentrations followed a statistically significant temporal trend (at the 0.020 level), and the excess of Pt in mussels over the 1991–2011 period compared to the control location were correlated with the European Pt autocatalyst demand (p=0.0006) and, especially, the car sales in Spain (p=0.0001). A bioaccumulation factor of ~5·103 was derived, which is greater than those previously calculated for Pt from exposure experiments, but 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than other trace elements (e.g. Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3abeaches 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3acopper 3aemissions 3afreeze drying 3alead 3amussels 3aplatinum 3asales 3atime series analysis 3aurban areas 3avehicles (equipment) 3azinc 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aBioaccumulation 0aMytilus galloprovincialis 0aUrban contamination 0aField study1 aCobelo-García, Antonio1 aBesada, Victoria1 aSantos-Echeandía, Juan1 aBellas, Juan0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 May 01, v. 514 p.366-370dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005400155245013000209520152300339592002801862650004401890650001501934650002101949650001201970650001201982650002101994650001802015650001302033650001302046650001102059650001902070650001502089650003302104650002002137650001202157650001302169650002302182650001702205650001302222650001902235653002302254653002202277653002502299700006102324700001802385700001502403700001702418700001302435700005602448773009102504856009002595852000902685655001202694IND60678268120221118041900.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067826812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1254182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Umeed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1024-085510aRice straw, biochar and calcite incorporation enhance nickel (Ni) immobilization in contaminated soil and Ni removal capacity  aAlthough rice straw (RS), biochar (BI) and calcite (CC) have proved to be effective immobilizing agents in acidic contaminated soil, we lack up-to-date scientific data regarding nickel (Ni) fractionation in soil and removal capacity in water. Therefore, an incubation study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of RS, BI and CC with three application rates (0, 1 and 2%) of RS, BI and CC on the immobilization of Ni in polluted soil. Various extraction techniques were carried out: sequential extraction procedure, the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR), extraction with CaCl₂, and the toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) techniques. Additionally, Ni sorption behavior was determined using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Results showed that adding all amendments into Ni contaminated acidic soil, enhanced soil pH, reduced the exchangeable fraction of Ni by 48%–55%, 59%–71% and 58%–66.3%, when RS, BI and CC were applied at 1% and 2% rates, respectively. According to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm results, the maximum sorption capacity was recorded using 2747 mg kg⁻¹ in 2% CC amended soil. However, biochar exhibited the maximum Ni sorption capacity (13348 mg kg⁻¹), due to its porous structure, larger surface area, and having more functional groups. Furthermore, the results of FTIR, SEM and zeta potential techniques confirmed that the immobilization and biochar’s capacity to remove Ni were more effective when compared to other immobilizing agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacid soils 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acalcite 3acalcium chloride 3afractionation 3aleaching 3amoieties 3anickel 3apolluted soils 3arice straw 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil amendments 3asoil pH 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atoxicity 3azeta potential 0aRice straw biochar 0aNi immobilization 0aNi sorption isotherm1 aShaaban, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2314-79831 aBashir, Saqib1 aGao, Ruili1 aFu, Qingling1 aZhu, Jun1 aHu, Hongqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1390-11340 tChemosphere.g2020 Apr., v. 244 p.125418-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1254183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010300164300001600267520160500283592002801888650002201916650002001938650002901958650001401987650001902001650003502020650001602055650001002071650001302081650001302094650001302107650002102120650001402141650001502155650001302170650001502183650001902198650001902217650001102236650002102247650001502268651001102283700002202294700001502316773012302331856004802454852000902502655001202511IND4526291220221123041207.0160113e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452629122DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-011-0167-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Niladri10aGIS-based Assessment and Management of Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Rönneå River Catchment, Sweden  ap. 457-466.  aEutrophication in lakes, estuaries and rivers occur due to over-enrichment with nutrients. Amongst the various nutrients Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorous (P) are the elements which are considered as the major pollutants. The present study looks into the problem of managing nutrient losses both from point sources and diffuse sources. The study was carried out in the River Rönneå catchment in South of Sweden where N and P have been assessed by creation of a pollution inventory based on GIS technology. The nutrient loads from different land use types were estimated using export coefficients and evaluated using monitoring data. A comparative analysis is done on the measured and estimated N and P leaching from diffused sources and point sources. Protective zones were suggested to decrease the P export from agricultural land, and the distribution of construction cost was analyzed among administrative regions according to the proportion of catchments, cultivated land, nutrient leaching, protective zone and length of river section within each municipality. The estimated error of the nutrient amount from landuse using GIS is 9.75% and 12.71% for N and P, respectively. The diffused sources contribute 91.53% and 94.74% of the total N and total P respectively, so the creation of a protective zone could be an effective way to decrease the nutrient export. The study demonstrates the power of GIS as a tool to analyze problems related to environmental monitoring and planning at administrative level, which could help in decision making and support for better management of the water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adecision making 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3ageographic information systems 3ainventories 3alakes 3aland use 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aplanning 3apollutants 3apollution load 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aSweden1 aAktaruzzaman, Md.1 aWang, Chen0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2012 Sept., v. 40, no. 3 p.457-466dSpringer-Verlagx0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-011-0167-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013400170520128800304592002801592650001501620650001501635650001501650650001401665650003101679650001601710650002001726650001301746650001801759650001201777650001701789650000701806650001601813651001001829653002401839653002501863653002701888653004701915700002101962700001801983700002102001700002702022773011402049856008602163852000902249655001202258IND60745165120221119172652.0220118e20220105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074516512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1266572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWahib, Sara A.10aAdsorption and recovery of lithium ions from groundwater using date pits impregnated with cellulose nanocrystals and ionic liquid  aThe study aims to prepare a novel low-cost and environmentally friendly adsorbent by using date pits (DP) impregnated with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and ionic liquid (IL), named IL-CNC@DP. The batch adsorption of lithium onto IL-CNC@DP and DP were studied at different pH values, initial lithium concentrations, and temperatures. The thermodynamics constants of the adsorption process showed that the IL-CNC@DP was exothermic, did not favor a high level of disorder, and spontaneous in nature. At pH 6, there is a significant increase in the removal efficiency where it increased to 90%. This also could be explained by the fact that electrostatic attraction forces and hydrogen bonding existed between the protonated Li⁺ and the less protonated IL-CNC@DP adsorbent surface, which enhanced the percentage of Li⁺ removal. A strong inter- and intra-hydrogen bonding (O-H) stretching absorption is seen at 3311 cm⁻¹ that occurs in cellulose components. In conclusion, the IL-CNC@DP in comparison to the DP confirmed exceptional results proving that the modification enhanced the remediation of the Li⁺ from water. Furthermore, the selectivity of IL-CNC@DP towards real groundwater samples isolated in Qatar depends upon the physicochemical characteristics of each element.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agroundwater 3aheat production 3ahydrogen 3aionic liquids 3alithium 3ananocrystals 3apH 3aremediation 3aQatar 0aAgricultural wastes 0aCellulose extraction 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aIonic liquid, Bio-based nanoscale products1 aDa’na, Dana A.1 aZaouri, Nabil1 aHijji, Yousef M.1 aAl-Ghouti, Mohammad A.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Jan. 05, v. 421 p.126657-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1266573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010900163300001600272520141100288592002801699650001601727650001501743650001501758650001901773650001801792650001701810650001001827650002001837650002201857650001901879650001401898650001801912650001301930653001101943653001501954653002301969653000901992653002102001700002702022700001902049700001502068700001702083773011802100856008202218852000902300655001202309IND60111933420221118133942.0190401e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011193342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2013.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Min-Ah10aEvaluation of nuclear ribosomal RNA and chloroplast gene markers for the DNA taxonomy of centric diatoms  ap. 163-174.  aDiatoms are highly diversified microeukaryotes with a taxonomy that has been under perpetual revision, particularly by means of molecular analyses. In this study, we evaluated typical genes to find the best molecular marker for the DNA taxonomy of centric diatoms, including Chaetoceros Ehrenberg, Cyclotella Kützing ex de Brébisson, Discostella Houk & Klee, Stephanodiscus Ehrenberg, and Thalassiosira Cleve. Our test genes included nuclear ribosomal RNA (e.g. small subunit, 5.8S, and large subunit [LSU]), and chloroplast genes (e.g. ribulose-1, 5-biphoshate carboxylase oxygenase and D1 protein of the photosystem II reaction centre core complex [psbA]). Calculated genetic divergence was highest for LSU ribosomal RNA D1-D5 (p-distance of 12.3), followed by 5.8S (7.7), ribulose-1, 5-biphoshate carboxylase oxygenase (7.4), small subunit (6.6), and psbA (3.7). The phylogenetic trees for individual genes effectively separated taxonomically tested centric diatoms with different phylogenetic resolutions; however, psbA was incongruent with others. These taxonomic resolving powers were in agreement with genetic divergences. Parsimony analysis showed that LSU evolved 1.97 times more rapidly than psbA and 1.07 times more rapidly than 5.8S. These results suggest that all of the tested genes except psbA can be used as taxonomic markers for centric diatoms and that LSU is the best molecular marker.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetoceros 3aCyclotella 3aD1 protein 3aStephanodiscus 3aThalassiosira 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aphotosystem II 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 0aDiatom 0aDivergence 0aMolecular taxonomy 0arRNA 0aChloroplast gene1 aFaria, Daphne Georgina1 aHan, Myung-Soo1 aLee, Juyun1 aKi, Jang-Seu0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2013 Oct., v. 50 p.163-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2013.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015500162300001600317520099100333592002801324650003201352650002001384650001201404650002601416650001101442653003201453653002001485653001201505653001001517653001601527653000901543700001601552700001701568700001901585700001801604773011801622856008201740852000901822655001201831IND60111933520221118133951.0190401e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011193352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2013.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Weiguo10aVariation of cytosine methylation in response to water availability in two contrasting growth types of an amphibious plant Alternanthera philoxeroides  ap. 175-181.  aWe used methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphisms (MSAP) to examine the alterations of cytosine methylation in two contrasting growth types of an amphibious plant Alternanthera philoxeroides in response to change of water availability. Using 34 pairs of selective primer combinations, we amplified 1026 and 1128 clear and reproducible bands in root and leaf of A. philoxeroides, respectively. When the aquatic types of plants were transplanted into drought culture, we found a decrease in the overall DNA methylation. When the terrestrial types of plants were transferred into flood culture, we detected a higher frequency of methylation than demethylation events. Alterations of DNA methylation were more evident in root than in leaf in response to change of water availability. When the confounding effects of variable environmental factors were removed, differences of cytosine methylation profiles were observed between two growth types of plants under common growth conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternanthera philoxeroides 3aDNA methylation 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3aleaves 0aAlternanthera philoxeroides 0aDNA methylation 0aDrought 0aFlood 0aGrowth type 0aMSAP1 aChen, Wenbo1 aQi, Xiaofeng1 aWang, Qingfeng1 aChen, Jinming0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2013 Oct., v. 50 p.175-181dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2013.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03903naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002400188245021700212300001200429506007600441520212800517592002802645506003702673650001602710650001702726650001602743650001902759650002502778650001402803650001302817650002202830650001102852650002102863650001602884650002102900650001302921650002602934650001202960650004002972650002003012650002003032650002103052700003403073700002003107700002403127773013103151856008203282852000903364655001203373IND60572634320221207050502.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057263432DNAL7 a284315342pmid7 aPMC53998402pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1670-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeinalian, Reihaneh14aThe effects of Spirulina Platensis on anthropometric indices, appetite, lipid profile and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in obese individuals: a randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial  ap. 225.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: In recent years, a great attention has been focused on Spirulina platensis as a source of potential valuable nutrients for prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. The objectives of the current study were to determine the effects of Spirulina platensis on anthropometric parameters, serum lipids, appetite and serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in obese individuals. METHODS: In the current study sixty four obese individuals aged 20–50 years were enrolled and randomly allocated into two groups of intervention and placebo. Intervention group (n = 29) received each 500 mg of the Spirulina platensis a twice-daily dosage while the control group (n = 27) received two pills daily starch for 12 weeks. Anthropometric parameters and serum VEGF and lipid profile were measured in fasting blood samples at the beginning and end of the study period. Dietary intakes were assessed by a 24-h recall method and appetite was measured using standard visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Body weight and body mass index (BMI) were decreased in intervention and placebo treated groups although the mean reduction in Spirulina platensis-treated group was significantly higher (P < 0.05). Serum total cholesterol (TC) significantly reduced in intervention group (P < 0.05). Also, treatment with Spirulina platensis significantly reduced appetite (P = 0.008). Mean serum VEGF, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglycerides did not change significantly after intervention. Serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations (HDL-c) significantly increased in both groups while no difference in mean difference of this change has been observed. CONCLUSION: Spirulina supplementation at a dose of 1 g/d for 12 weeks is effective in modulating body weight and appetite and partly modifies serum lipids. This can further confirm the efficacy of this herbal supplement in control and prevention of obesity and obesity- related disorders.

The aim was to evaluate progress in the development of plans and procedures that can be employed to collect, record and use fishing industry knowledge and data in the evidence base for managing fisheries. This was achieved by reviewing industry‐led data initiatives already undertaken or ongoing within the United Kingdom to document how these projects have/are incorporating fishing industry data into the process of management decision‐making; canvassing stakeholder opinion on data gaps and whether these could be filled by data gathered by commercial fishing vessels; establishing what issues might prevent or stimulate commercial fishing vessels in collecting data when they have the opportunity; and describing guidance on a step‐by‐step process for gathering scientific information such that fishers are empowered to collect the right data, at the right times and in the right format for their fishery. Given recent advances in the collection, interpretation and application of fisheries‐dependent data, we compare progress made in the UK to other areas of the world. We conclude that there is considerable evidence of a paradigm shift from the conventional practice of scientists asking fishers to provide data for scientific analyses towards full engagement of key stakeholders in data collection.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adecision making 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3afishing boats 3astakeholders 3aUnited Kingdom1 aKupschus, Sven1 aMackinson, Steven1 aRodmell, Dale1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0879-78221 aLee, Alexandra1 aBourke, Elizabeth1 aRossiter, Tom1 aMasters, Jim1 aHetherington, Stuart1 aCatchpole, Thomas1 aRighton, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8643-36720 tFish and fisheries.g2018 July, v. 19, no. 4 p.622-642dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867077x1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.122793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001700169245009800186300001800284500002000302520216700322592002802489650002302517650002002540650001402560650002002574650000902594650002102603650002202624650002302646650001502669650001602684650001202700650002102712650001902733650001802752700001602770700002002786700001602806700001702822700001902839773013202858856010702990852000903097655001203106IND60587510920221119060510.0180102e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058751092DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[1510:ARIASE]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, S. M.10aAssessing recovery in a stream ecosystem: applying multiple chemical and biological endpoints  ap. 1510-1527.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRecovery dynamics in a previously disturbed stream undergoing remediation was assessed by measuring several chemical and biological endpoints. Three major trophic levels (periphyton, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish communities) were analyzed along with various biological indicators of fish health including sub‐organismal (biochemical and physiological) and individual‐level responses. Ambient toxicity testing, water quality measurements, and fish bioaccumulation studies were also conducted to provide additional indicators of stream recovery. Information on chemical loading, biological exposure (bioaccumulation), and bioassays help identify the underlying or mechanistic basis of recovery, while endpoints measured on instream biota, and particularly those at higher levels of biological organization, are key responses for understanding the dynamics and ecological significance of recovery. When assessing recovery in aquatic ecosystems, it is important to conduct long‐term field studies incorporating a variety of response variables that represent a wide range of sensitivities and response time scales. The value of different endpoints for assessing recovery depends on the inherent characteristics that are related to response variability and sensitivity, specificity and causal relationships to stressors, and ecological relevance. Long‐term data sets incorporating a variety and range of these endpoints are needed to improve our understanding of natural variability in streams and provide a baseline against which effects of disturbance and subsequent recovery processes can be evaluated. The complexity of aquatic systems and their variable recovery dynamics suggest that no single measure is adequate for assessing aquatic ecosystem recovery and that a suite of chemical and biological endpoints is required for a more complete understanding of ecosystem dynamics and status during both the recovery and the post‐disturbance periods.

Sediment samples were collected at 9 sites and analyzed for eight heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Fe and Mn). PAHs, PCBs, OCPs were measured previously in the same sediment samples. Our results indicated that the highest concentrations of metals were found near urban areas due to the municipial and industrial wastewater discharges. Sediment pollution assessment was carried out using geoaccumulation index and enrichment factor, which indicate a widespread pollution by Cd, Pb, Ni and Zn in the studied sediments. For bioassays, aqueous and organic extracts were used to assess toxicity and genotoxicity in sediments by using Microtox® and SOS Chromotest, respectively. Toxicity levels were compared to metallic and organic pollutants contents. Our results highlight differences in the pattern of responses between the different assays and show no correlation with all the studied contaminants, emphasizing the influence of other contaminants not analyzed in the present study. Based on SQGs, the results of toxicity assessment indicated that adverse effects caused by Ni and Zn would be expected frequently. Nickel was found to have the highest predicted acute toxicity, followed by Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu and Cr. There was no significant relationship between sediment toxicity calculated from heavy metal concentrations (SQG approach) and those measured with bioassays. These findings support the use of integrated approachs for evaluating the environmental risks of sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute toxicity 3aadverse effects 3abioassays 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoastal water 3acopper 3agenotoxicity 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amercury 3anickel 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asurface quality 3aurban areas 3awastewater 3azinc 3aTunisia1 aElbarhoumi, Anis1 aClérandeau, Christelle1 aAl-Rawabdeh, Abdulla M.1 aAtyaoui, Atef1 aTouil, Soufiane1 aDriss, Mohamed Ridha1 aCachot, Jérôme0 tEcotoxicology.g2016 Aug., v. 25, no. 6 p.1082-1104dSpringer USx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-016-1664-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245013500164520114900299592002801448650002201476650001401498650001701512650001701529650001001546650002001556650002001576650001701596650002301613653002001636653001801656653001801674653002801692700001701720700001401737700001701751700001901768700001501787700001701802773010901819856008601928852000902014655001202023IND60737694720221119162948.0220606e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073769472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1181522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Qi10aAzo modified hyaluronic acid based nanocapsules: CD44 targeted, UV-responsive decomposition and drug release in liver cancer cells  aHerein, we demonstrate a novel UV-induced decomposable nanocapsule of natural polysaccharide (HA-azo/PDADMAC). The nanocapsules are fabricated based on layer-by-layer co-assembly of anionic azobenzene functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA-azo) and cationic poly diallyl dimethylammonium chloride (PDADMAC). When the nanocapsules are exposed to 365 nm light, ultraviolet photons can trigger the photo-isomerization of azobenzene groups in the framework. The nanocapsules could decompose from large-sized nanocapsules to small fragments. Due to their optimized original size (~180 nm), the nanocapsules can effectively avoid biological barriers, provide a long blood circulation and achieve high tumor accumulation. It can fast eliminate nanocapsules from tumor and release the loaded drugs for chemotherapy after UV-induced dissociation. Besides, HA is an endogenous polysaccharide that shows intrinsic targetability to CD44 receptors on surface of cancer cells. The intracellular experiment shows that the HA-azo/PDADMAC nanocapsules with CD44 targeting ability and UV-controlled intracellular drug release are promising for cancer chemotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood circulation 3achlorides 3adissociation 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ahyaluronic acid 3aliver neoplasms 3ananocapsules 3aphotoisomerization 0aHyaluronic acid 0aUV-responsive 0aCD44-targeted 0aControlled drug release1 aLi, Xiaorong1 aXie, Yuan1 aHu, Weicheng1 aCheng, Zhipeng1 aZhong, Hui1 aZhu, Hongjun0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 267 p.118152-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1181523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007600157300001800233520165500251592002801906650001501934650001301949650001601962650000901978650002001987650001702007650001102024650000702035650001102042650001902053650001702072650001202089700002102101700002002122700001702142700001402159700001902173773012502192856007502317852000902392655001202401IND60534897520221122050603.0160803e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053489752DNAL7 a10.1021/es500537g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zheming10aInvestigation of U(VI) Adsorption in Quartz–Chlorite Mineral Mixtures  ap. 7766-7773.  aA batch and cryogenic laser-induced time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy investigation of U(VI) adsorbed on quartz-chlorite mixtures with variable mass ratios have been performed under field-relevant uranium concentrations (5 × 10–⁷ M and 5 × 10–⁶ M) in pH 8.1 synthetic groundwater. The U(VI) adsorption Kd values steadily increased as the mass fraction of chlorite increased, indicating preferential sorption to chlorite. For all mineral mixtures, U(VI) adsorption Kd values were lower than that calculated from the assumption of component additivity possibly caused by surface modifications stemming from chlorite dissolution; The largest deviation occurred when the mass fractions of the two minerals were equal. U(VI) adsorbed on quartz and chlorite displayed characteristic individual luminescence spectra that were not affected by mineral mixing. The spectra of U(VI) adsorbed within the mixtures could be simulated by one surface U(VI) species on quartz and two on chlorite. The luminescence intensity decreased in a nonlinear manner as the adsorbed U(VI) concentration increased with increasing chlorite mass fraction–likely due to ill-defined luminescence quenching by both structural Fe/Cr in chlorite, and trace amounts of solubilized and reprecipitated Fe/Cr in the aqueous phase. However, the fractional spectral intensities of U(VI) adsorbed on quartz and chlorite followed the same trend of fractional adsorbed U(VI) concentration in each mineral phase with approximate linear correlations, offering a method to estimate of U(VI) concentration distribution between the mineral components with luminescence spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achromium 3agroundwater 3airon 3alight intensity 3aluminescence 3amixing 3apH 3aquartz 3asolubilization 3aspectroscopy 3auranium1 aZachara, John M.1 aShang, Jianying1 aJeon, Choong1 aLiu, Juan1 aLiu, Chongxuan0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 July 15, v. 48, no. 14 p.7766-7773dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes500537g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010200163300001600265520104800281592002801329650001501357650001601372650002601388650002601414650001301440650001301453650001601466650001001482650001501492650002601507650002301533650001801556650002501574700001801599700001901617700001601636773009201652856004801744852000901792655001201801IND4471748320221119152208.0120417e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447174832DNAL7 a10.1007/s00271-011-0278-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Qinghua10aBell pepper response to surface and subsurface drip irrigation under different fertigation levels  ap. 233-245.  aA two-year field experiment was conducted in 2007 and 2008 to investigate different bell pepper responses to subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) and surface drip irrigation (DI) under four nitrogen levels: 0, 75, 150, and 300 kg/ha N (N0, N75, N150, and N300, respectively). Irrigation interval was set at 4 days. Bell pepper yield under SDI was significantly higher than that under DI by 4% in 2007 (13% in 2008). Water consumption under SDI was lower than that under DI by 6.7% in 2007 (7.3% in 2008). Meanwhile, root length density under SDI was obviously higher than that under DI by 11.8% in 2007 (12.5% in 2008). The percentage of root length below 10-cm soil depth under SDI was higher than that under DI by 7%, proving that SDI promotes crop root growth and enhances downward root development. Soil N residue under SDI was lesser than that under DI. Lastly, SDI with N application of 150 kg/ha is recommended as an optimal fertigation practice in improving bell pepper yield and water-use efficiency, as well as in NO3 −-N leaching.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3afertigation 3afield experimentation 3airrigation scheduling 3aleaching 3anitrogen 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asoil depth 3asubsurface irrigation 3asurface irrigation 3asweet peppers 3awater use efficiency1 aLi, Guangyong1 aWang, Yonghong1 aHuo, Hongxu0 tIrrigation science.g2012 May, v. 30, no. 3 p.233-245dSpringer-Verlagx0342-71887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-011-0278-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012700162300001800289520102100307592002801328650001101356650002001367650001601387650001901403650001501422650000801437700002001445700001301465700001601478700005501494700001601549773017001565856008001735852000901815655001201824IND60630240620221118173820.0190206e20190108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063024062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b060422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wanru10aSelective Extraction of ECG from Tea Polyphenols by One Step in Centrifugal Contactor Separators: Modeling and Application  ap. 2027-2035.  aOne-step fractional extraction was developed to selectively extract (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) from tea polyphenols (TP) by using centrifugal contactor separators (CCSs). An efficient extraction system was constructed without reactive extractant. A model for fractional extraction was set up to study the effect of feed position, the number of stages (NTU), and phase ratio on extraction performance. Residual rate (R) was introduced to optimize the separation of low-concentration substance from complex tea polyphenols. Simulation and optimization are utilized to obtain the optimal parameters for separation of ECG from tea polyphenols. ECG has been separated by one-step fractional extraction with high purity of 98%, yield of 94%, and output of 397 g in 24 h, which is very promising for carrying out industrial production owing to continuous separation and low operation cost. The method has potential to separate objective substance with low content from multicomponent mixtures in an industrial scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3apolyphenols 3aprocess design 3aseparators 3atea1 aZhang, Panliang1 aOu, Jian1 aLiu, Fusong1 aTang, Kewen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1194-26641 aXu, Weifeng0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Jan. 08, v. 58, no. 5 p.2027-2035dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b060423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245008300215300001800298520130200316592002801618650002301646650001101669650001401680650001401694650002401708650001301732650001701745650001101762650001301773650001101786650002401797650001501821773013201836856008301968852000902051655001202060IND60768987720221118001807.0220228e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076898772DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-021-05159-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatabura, Victor Vicent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1694-169210aModelling of firmness variability of Jonagold apple during postharvest storage  ap. 1487-1498.  aThe firmness of Jonagold apples is an important quality attribute during postharvest chain. However, postharvest handlers are faced with variability in the firmness that exists within apples even of those of the same batch and cultivar. Here, Jonagold apples were stored at 1 °C and 4 °C with different controlled atmospheric gas compositions for 170 d, and then exposed to shelf-life conditions for 15 d, and other portion of apples was immediately stored to shelf-life scenario for 21 d. The firmness and ethylene emission of the apples were quantified during storage. A kinetic model equation was established to predict the firmness breakdown of apples depending on storage conditions. The model was based on a stochastic technique that incorporated biological variability in firmness. A relative sensitivity analysis was carried out to analyse the utmost stochastic parameters and fruit-specific data were obtained. The Monte Carlo method was applied to predict how the initial fruit variability in firmness within Jonagold apples propagates throughout the postharvest storage. The simulation outputs suggest that the model established in study may be useful to manage the biological variability and describe how the initial firmness variability propagates during the postharvest chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aapples 3acultivars 3aequations 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afood science 3afruits 3akinetics 3amodels 3apostharvest storage 3ashelf life0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.1487-1498dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05159-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245008600182300001800268500001100286520147500297592002801772650002601800650002501826650002001851650001701871650001401888650001501902650001701917650001101934650002101945650001701966650001901983650001502002650000902017650001202026650001502038650002502053650002002078700003502098700002702133773012802160856008102288852000902369655001202378IND60580875520221119001350.0171004e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058087552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8490-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrido-Cardenas, Jose Antonio10aAdvanced microbial analysis for wastewater quality monitoring: metagenomics trend  ap. 7445-7458.  aReview  aUrban Wastewater treatment plants (UWWTPs) have played an important and fundamental role in society for water purification of contaminated human wastewaters over the last decades. Microorganisms are very important in UWWTP as their metabolic activity significantly reduces the organic load of the UWW, although there is an uncertain gap in our knowledge regarding microbial consortium structure and their activity in UWWTP operation on a large scale. On the other hand, effluents of UWWTPs have come to be a new source of fresh water to ease water scarcity in many regions of the world, especially in intensive irrigation practices. Many concerns over health risks relating to the direct reuse of this water are very well known. However, if a proper disinfection treatment is applied, these are strongly reduced as conventional methodologies have demonstrated over the last decades. In line with this, the continuous development of new devices for analytical measurement that increase the sensitivities (limit of detection) are showing that other potential risks for both environmental and human health may be associated with UWW reuse. In this work, the most important aspects related to microorganisms in UWWTPs and UWW effluents are presented. Moreover, the new developments on genetic tools for detection of microorganisms are presented, with special emphasis on metagenomic methodology.

Benzene exposure led to changes in locomotive behavior and reproduction decline in C. elegans. Microarray followed by pathway analysis revealed that 228 genes were differentially expressed by benzene exposure, and cyp-35a2, pmk-1, and cep-1 were selected for further reproduction and multiparametric behavior analysis. Mutant analysis showed that benzene induced reproduction decline was rescued in cyp-35a2(gk317) mutant, whereas it was significantly exacerbated in pmk-1(km25) mutant, compared with the wildtype. The multiparametric behavior analysis on the mutants of selected genes revealed that each strain exhibits different response patterns, particularly, enhanced linear movement in the cyp-35a2(gk317) mutant, whereas the changes in partial body movement were observed in the pmk-1(km25) mutant by benzene exposure. A self-organizing map revealed that the pmk-1(km25) mutant group was the most densely clustered and located on the opposite side of the map of the cyp-35a2(gk317) mutant, each crossing that of the wildtype. Overall results suggest distinct roles of cyp-35a2 and pmk-1 genes in benzene-induced alterations in behavior and reproduction in C. elegans. This study also suggests computational behavior analysis is a suitable tool for addressing the integrative impact of chemical stress alongside with toxicogenomic approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3abenzene 3acrossing 3aenvironmental exposure 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3atoxicity 3atoxicogenomics1 aKim, Hungsoo1 aKim, Bo-Moon1 aChon, Tae Soo,1 aChoi, Jinhee0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 July 15, v. 48, no. 14 p.8143-8151dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes500608e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245013700177300001800314520142100332592002801753650001301781650002801794650001101822650002101833650001401854650002001868650001701888651001401905651001101919651001601930700003401946700007801980773013202058856008302190852000902273655001202282IND60768987820221118001645.0220228e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076898782DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-021-05162-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Rafaela Corrêa10aEvaluating nutrition quality of packaged foods carrying claims and marketing techniques in Brazil using four nutrient profile models  ap. 1520-1528.  aThe present study aimed to evaluate the nutrient profile of packaged foods marketed in Brazil, giving insights into healthiness of the Brazilian supermarket packaged food environment, considering different food categories and levels of industrial food processing and presence of nutrition and health claims and marketing strategies. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on the labels of pre-packed foods marketed in a home-shopping website. A stratified random sample (n = 335) was obtained to be analysed by four nutrient profile models: Food Standards Australia New Zealand’s Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion, UK Nutrient Profile from the Food Standards Agency, Nutrient profile model from Pan American Health Organization, and Nutrition Score from Unilever Food & Health Research (Unilever). Overall, the models shown agreement, besides some differences in the levels of approval. Ultra-processed foods were less healthy. Pass rates for products carrying nutrition and/or health claims have evidenced the presence of these claims may be indicative of slightly better nutritional quality. This did not apply for products with and without marketing techniques. These findings highlight the need for improvement of the supermarket packaged food environment in scenarios like Brazil by increasing efforts to reformulate products to make them healthier, together with appropriate food labelling regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3across-sectional studies 3amodels 3anutrient content 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3asupermarkets 3aAustralia 3aBrazil 3aNew Zealand1 aSouza Carneiro, João de Deus1 ade Angelis Pereira, Michel Cardoso1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9203-00360 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.1520-1528dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05162-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010300167300001800270500001100288500001500299520208200314592002802396650001702424650002602441650001302467650002502480650002802505650001102533650002902544650001402573650002902587650002202616650003302638650002102671650001302692650002102705653002002726700002702746700002002773773012802793856008102921852000903002655001203011IND60580875620221119001340.0171004e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058087562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8487-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖztürk, Sibel10aDouble promoter expression systems for recombinant protein production by industrial microorganisms  ap. 7459-7475.  aReview  a2019-12-06  aUsing double promoter expression systems is a promising approach to increase heterologous protein production. In this review, current double promoter expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins (r-proteins) by industrially important bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli; and yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, are discussed by assessing their potentials and drawbacks. Double promoter expression systems need to be designed to maintain a higher specific product formation rate within the production domain. While bacterial double promoter systems have been constructed as chimeric tandem promoters, yeast dual promoter systems have been developed as separate expression cassettes. To increase production and productivity, the optimal transcriptional activity should be justified either by simultaneously satisfying the requirements of both promoters, or by consecutively stimulating the changeover from one to another in a biphasic process or via successive-iterations. Thus, considering the dynamics of a fermentation process, double promoters can be classified according to their operational mechanisms, as: i) consecutively operating double promoter systems, and ii) simultaneously operating double promoter systems. Among these metabolic design strategies, extending the expression period with two promoters activated under different conditions, or enhancing the transcriptional activity with two promoters activated under similar conditions within the production domain, can be applied independently from the host. Novel studies with new insights, which aim a rational systematic design and construction of dual promoter expression vectors with tailored transcriptional activity, will empower r-protein production with enhanced production and productivity. Finally, the current state-of-the-art review emphasizes the advantages of double promoter systems along with the necessity for discovering new promoters for the development of more effective and adaptive processes to meet the increasing demand of r-protein industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3afermentation 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aindustry 3arecombinant proteins 3aindustrial microbiology 3ayeasts 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3achimerism 3atranscription (genetics) 3aBacillus subtilis 3aheterologous gene expression 3apromoter regions 3abacteria 3aEscherichia coli 0aPichia pastoris1 aErgün, Burcu Gündüz1 aÇalık, Pınar0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2017 Oct., v. 101, no. 20 p.7459-7475dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8487-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245019700127300001800324520131100342592002801653650002501681650002701706650001701733650001701750650001301767650001301780650000701793650001001800650002301810650002401833650001701857650001101874653001601885653002001901653001201921653001401933653001201947700001501959700002101974700002201995773015402017852000902171655001202180IND60706458420221122053321.0200807e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070645842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaik, Jaya10aImportance of Temperature in Relation to Quality Changes of Commercially Important Fishes of Indian Mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and Pink Perch (Nemipterus japonicus) during Winter Season  ap. 2839-2844.  aThe influences of temperature on quality of Indian mackerel and Pink perch were examined at chilled storage temperature. The fishes were stored in the insulated box by keeping the fishes in chilled condition to maintain the temperature 0°C fora period of 48hrs for canned products and 6 days for smoking and freezing purposes. The quality changes of fishes were examined at different time intervals 0 days, 2 days, 4 days, 6 days and up to 8 days. The quality assessment of fishes was observed with different Quality Index Method (QIM) which includes sensory observation, physicochemical and microbiological analyses. In the sensorial evaluation after 2 days of storage of the fishes which were stored in chilled condition of Pink perch was of excellent quality whereas mackerel fishes stored at chilled condition was observed with little degraded quality during the study period. The product prepared using these fishes were found to be excellent quality of end products. The pH values of fishes stored in different temperature were increased slowly during storage up to 6 days in case of mackerel and 8 days in case of pink perch. The pink perch were found less TPC counts when compared to that of mackerel. The quality index observed in the sensorial evaluation is reflected with microbial observation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNemipterus japonicus 3aRastrelliger kanagurta 3acanned foods 3acold storage 3afreezing 3amackerel 3apH 3aperch 3asensory evaluation 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3awinter 0aIce storage 0achilled storage 0aquality 0aFreshness 0aSeafood1 aRaju, C.V.1 aManjunatha, A.R.1 aKumar, K.C.

It is found that moisture content, acid lipase, and phospholipase decreases in the whole processing, but sodium chloride content and TBARS increase. Neutral lipase, LOX, and total fatty acids increase from raw ham to the end of resting and decrease subsequently. 15 VCDFLO containing six ketones, three aldehydes, three hydrocarbons, one alcohol, one carboxylic acid, and one furan are identified. The total peak area of VCDFLO increases during the entire processing and indicates 39.76–40.75% of total volatile compounds. Hexanal, 1‐octen‐3‐ol, octanal, and nonanal are the major characteristic volatiles of boneless dry‐cured hams. Therefore, VCDFLO formation is associated with lipid‐related enzymes and helpful for the aroma. Practical Applications: The pork that has high intramuscular fat content is usually selected to produce boneless dry‐cured hams, because intramuscular phospholipids, and triglycerides are important precursors to produce aroma compounds. Exploring the formation mechanism of flavor associated with lipid oxidation will be beneficial for improving the quality of hams. Therefore, this study demonstrates the relationship between lipolysis‐oxidation and the generation of flavor compounds during the processing of boneless dry‐cured hams. This study demonstrates that thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values can reveal the changed trend of volatile compounds derived from lipid oxidation (VCDFLO) very well, and that lipid‐related enzymes plays an important role in the development of VCDFLO.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0401502cNational Key R&D Program of China  aCARS‐43‐17cModern Agricultural Technical System Foundation  aLR18C200003cScience Foundation of Zhejiang Province  a31871825cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cK.C.

Its pulp has significant nutritional value while the peel and the core, in spite of being high in dietary fibre and nutrients, are generally considered to be agro-industrial waste. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect that the integrated enzymatic and shear homogenization processes have on the physicochemical stability of pineapple base suspensions (pulp, core, and peel extract). Initially, an enzymatic hydrolysis process was evaluated with a completely randomized factorial design. Independent variables: incubation time (tᵢₙc) (1–4 h) and [enzyme] (0–200 ppm). Dependent variables: viscosity (μ) and particle sizes (D[₃;₂] and D[₄;₃]). The results showed a reduction of (μ) (70.7%), D[₃;₂] (54.2%), and D[₄;₃] (61.8%) for the optimized treatment (tᵢₙc = 3.2 h and [enzyme] = 200 ppm) compared to the control (t = 0, without enzyme). The effect of the integrated enzymatic treatment with a serial homogenization process was subsequently evaluated. Independent variables: high-speed homogenization time (t₁) (15–20 min), recirculation time in high pressure homogenizer (t₂) (3–7 min), and arabic gum (AG) (0.6–1.0%). Dependent variables: total suspension solids (TSS), zeta potential (ζ), μ, spectral stability index (R), D[₃;₂], and D[₄;₃]. The application of the integrated processes of enzymatic treatment and serial homogenization was more effective to be able to obtain a stable pineapple-based suspension. The experimental optimization of multiple responses defined t₁ = 16.4 min, t₂ = 7 min, AG = 0.98%, and TSs = 15.7 ± 0.5%, ζ = − 23.1 ± 0.4 mV, µ = 221 ± 11 cP, D[₃;₂] = 56.8 ± 2 µm and D[₄;₃] = 120.6 ± 4 µm and R = 0.58 ± 0.02 were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnanas comosus 3aagricultural wastes 3adietary fiber 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzymes 3afruits 3agum arabic 3ahomogenization 3ahomogenizers 3anutritive value 3apineapples 3apulp 3aviscosity 3aworld markets 3azeta potential1 aCortés-Rodríguez, Misael1 aGaleano, Francisco Javier Castellanos1 aArango, Julio C.0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.1610-1618dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05172-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245005500164300001400219520169400233592002801927650001301955650001301968650001401981650001701995650002302012650001902035650002002054650001502074650001602089650002702105650001202132650001902144650001502163650001202178650002402190650001002214651001402224653002202238653001502260653001602275653004202291653001802333653003102351700001702382700001902399700001602418700001902434773010602453856008602559852000902645655001202654IND50067538920221118110946.0190318e20130724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006753892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Lei10aOpportunity for peri-urban Perth groundwater trade  ap. 89-99.  aGroundwater trade is widely advocated for reallocating scarce groundwater resources between competing users, and managing over-allocated and declining aquifers. However, groundwater markets are still in their infancy, and the potential benefits and opportunities need investigation, particularly where there is a need to reduce the extraction from declining aquifers.This article evaluates economic impacts of reducing groundwater extraction for irrigation use in peri-urban Perth, Australia, where irrigation, a lake-based ecosystem, and public water supply are highly dependent on a declining groundwater resource. We present an assessment of market-based water trading approaches to reduce groundwater extraction with an economic model representing diversity in returns to groundwater use across a population of irrigators.The results indicate that potential economic costs of a proportional reduction in available groundwater for irrigation are 18–21% less if groundwater trade is possible. We also evaluate a water buyback from irrigation to provide public water supply as an alternative to new infrastructure. We find that buying back up to around 50% of current irrigation allocations could create new public water supply only at the cost of $0.32–0.39 million per GL, which is less than one fifth of the costs of new desalinisation or recycled water supply options ($2–3 million per GL). We conclude that, with rapid development of computer and internet based trading platforms that allows fast, efficient and low cost multiple party trading, it is increasingly feasible to realise the economic potentials of market-based trade approaches for managing overexploited aquifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aaquifers 3acomputers 3adesalination 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic costs 3aeconomic impact 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3ainfancy 3ainfrastructure 3airrigation 3amarkets 3apublic water supply 3atrade 3aAustralia 0aGroundwater trade 0aIrrigation 0aWater trade 0aIntegrated groundwater economic model 0aWater buyback 0aIndividual-based modelling1 aConnor, Jeff1 aDoble, Rebecca1 aAli, Riasat1 aMcFarlane, Don0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 July 24, v. 496 p.89-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245020300167300001800370520148700388592002801875650002601903650002001929650002401949650002301973650001101996650001302007650001102020650002002031650001102051650001302062700002002075700002102095700002002116700002202136700002102158700002102179700002602200773008602226856008102312852000902393655001202402IND60523798620221121162759.0160626e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052379862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-016-1665-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatson, Cole W.10aSilver toxicity across salinity gradients: the role of dissolved silver chloride species (AgCl x) in Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes) early life-stage toxicity  ap. 1105-1118.  aThe influence of salinity on Ag toxicity was investigated in Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) early life-stages. Embryo mortality was significantly reduced as salinity increased and Ag⁺ was converted to AgCl₍ₛₒₗᵢd₎. However, as salinity continued to rise (>5 ‰), toxicity increased to a level at least as high as observed for Ag⁺ in deionized water. Rather than correlating with Ag⁺, Fundulus embryo toxicity was better explained (R² = 0.96) by total dissolved Ag (Ag⁺, AgCl₂ ⁻, AgCl₃ ²⁻, AgCl₄ ³⁻). Complementary experiments were conducted with medaka (Oryzias latipes) embryos to determine if this pattern was consistent among evolutionarily divergent euryhaline species. Contrary to Fundulus data, medaka toxicity data were best explained by Ag⁺ concentrations (R² = 0.94), suggesting that differing ionoregulatory physiology may drive observed differences. Fundulus larvae were also tested, and toxicity did increase at higher salinities, but did not track predicted silver speciation. Alternatively, toxicity began to increase only at salinities above the isosmotic point, suggesting that shifts in osmoregulatory strategy at higher salinities might be an important factor. Na⁺ dysregulation was confirmed as the mechanism of toxicity in Ag-exposed Fundulus larvae at both low and high salinities. While Ag uptake was highest at low salinities for both Fundulus embryos and larvae, uptake was not predictive of toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFundulus heteroclitus 3aOryzias latipes 3aembryonic mortality 3aeuryhaline species 3alarvae 3asalinity 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asodium 3atoxicity1 aBone, Audrey J.1 aAuffan, Mélanie1 aLindberg, T.

The results showed that after calcium and ultrasonic treatment, compared with the control, the firmness of apricot fruit increased by 41.53% and 3.83% at 16 d, but juice yield and water-soluble pectin (WSP) content decreased by 8.26% and 3.55%, 28.57% and 4.08%, respectively. Both calcium and ultrasonic treatment were more effective in reducing polygalacturonase (PG), β-Galactosidase (β-Gal), pectin methylesterase (PME), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activity. Moreover, fruit firmness was significantly negatively correlated with juice yield, WSP and PPO, and positively correlated with PG and β-Gal, PPO and POD. In contrast, calcium treatment was more effective than ultrasonic treatment in delaying postharvest softening of apricot.  aPublisher supplied data  aCAFYBB2017ZA004-4cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University  aCAFYBB2018GB001cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of the Central South University  a20A550011cKey Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities in Henan Province 3aapricots 3acalcium 3acatechol oxidase 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3ajuices 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3aperoxidase 3apolygalacturonase 3aultrasonic treatment 3awater solubility1 aLi, Jia1 aZong, Wei1 aSun, Wenwen1 aMo, Wenjuan1 aLi, Shaofeng0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2022 Apr., v. 59, no. 4 p.1588-1597dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-021-05170-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100002100193245011400214506007600328506003100404520112100435592002801556596003401584506003701618650002201655650001401677650002501691650001801716650002301734650001501757650001901772650000901791650001501800650002201815650001501837653003101852653002701883653003001910653001801940653003101958700001901989700002302008700002402031773010902055856008602164852000902250655001202259IND60737695320221207095112.0220606e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073769532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182212chorus7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Rakibul10aMulti-layer oil-resistant food serving containers made using cellulose nanofiber coated wood flour composites  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aCost-effective, eco-friendly, and oil and grease-resistant food serving containers were made from wood flour with cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) or lignin-containing cellulose nanofibrils (LCNF) coating layers on the surface and in the bulk. The multi-layer wet-on-wet cellulose nanofiber composites were developed using a vacuum filtration process. All composites showed excellent oil/grease resistivity according to the “kit” test passing #12, the highest possible. The surface free energy and water contact angle showed that the composites with LCNF coating were more hydrophobic than the ones coated with CNF made from bleached pulp fiber. All composites had higher flexural and tensile properties compared with commercial food containers where the mechanical properties increased with increasing binder content and had acceptable thermal stability. Overall, the cellulose nanofiber composites possess excellent mechanical and barrier properties and can be considered as a wood-flour-based (pulp-free) and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAs)-free alternative for oil-resistant commercial food serving containers.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGibbs free energy 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acontact angle 3acost effectiveness 3afiltration 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apulp fiber 3athermal stability 3awood flour 0aSustainable food container 0aCellulose nanomaterial 0aOil and grease resistance 0aWood particle 0aPoly-fluoroalkyl substance1 aTajvidi, Mehdi1 aBousfield, Douglas1 aGardner, Douglas J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 267 p.118221-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03428naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245009300170300001600263520169500279592002801974650001502002650001502017650002202032650001502054650002202069650001602091650001002107650001402117650001302131650002302144650000902167650000902176650001102185650001402196650001402210650001902224650001602243650001902259650001302278650001002291650002002301650001202321650001502333650001002348650002102358653000902379653001502388653000902403653001302412653000902425700001502434700001302449700001402462700001202476700001702488700005302505773012302558856008802681852000902769655001202778IND60597986020221120065039.0190613e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059798602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jingxia10aCa-containing amendments to reduce the absorption and translocation of Pb in rice plants  ap. 971-979.  aThe influence of three Ca-containing amendments (dolomite, slaked lime, and limestone) on soil water soluble Pb (Pb-w) levels, Pb accumulation by two rice plants (TJ-8, japonica and II-3301, indica), and the factors affecting Pb-w were investigated. Pot experiment was performed under waterlogged conditions using Pb-contaminated soil collected from an agricultural field near a mine. It was found that the soil amendments significantly reduced Pb content in the rice plants in the order dolomite > slaked lime > limestone, irrespective of rice cultivar. The Pb content of brown rice with the added soil amendments was lower than that of the recommended limit (0.2 mg kg−1, GB2762-2017) except for cultivar II-3301 with slaked lime. There was a significant positive correlation between the Pb content of the roots, stems, leaves, and grains and the soil Pb-w levels. The amendments reduced soil Eh, Fe, and Mn concentrations in the pore water and increased soil pH. The total organic carbon (TOC) in the pore water significantly decreased for II-3301 but not for TJ-8 at the ripening stage after addition of the amendments. Among soil Eh, pH, TOC, Fe, and Mn in the pore water, Fe and Mn were the most influential in lowering soil Pb-w levels. The amendments inhibited the formation of iron plaques on the root surface and reduced Pb adsorption. The Pb content of the roots was positively correlated with that in iron plaque. These findings are significant as they imply that the application of Ca-containing amendments in Pb-contaminated paddy soils near mines is an effective approach for in situ immobilization of Pb and reduction in Pb levels in the edible parts of crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aagricultural land 3abrown rice 3acalcium hydroxide 3acorrelation 3acrops 3acultivars 3adolomite 3aflooded conditions 3airon 3alead 3aleaves 3alimestone 3amanganese 3aorganic carbon 3apaddy soils 3apolluted soils 3aripening 3aroots 3asoil amendments 3asoil pH 3asoil water 3astems 3awater solubility 0aLead 0aPore water 0aLime 0aDolomite 0aRice1 aLi, Yunyun1 aHu, Cong1 aZhou, Shi1 aXu, Hao1 aZhang, Qijia1 aWang, Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4295-47450 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 637-638 p.971-979dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245013600214300001600350520104000366592002801406650002601434650001501460650001201475650002001487650002201507650001501529650001501544650001401559650001501573650001401588650001301602650001501615700001701630700002501647773014301672856008301815852000901898655001201907IND60779653220221120222601.0220613e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077965322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-022-03488-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Khalek, Amr Adel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6777-872814aThe Potential Use of Orange and Banana Peels to Minimize the Toxicological Effects of Silver Nanoparticles in Oreochromis Niloticus  ap. 985-994.  aTo evaluate the effectiveness of orange peels (OP) and banana peels (BP) in reducing the toxicity of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), Oreochromis niloticus were exposed to Ag-NPs, Ag-NPs + OP, and Ag-NPs + BP for 24, 48, and 96 h. Time-dependent toxicological impacts of Ag-NPs were recorded. The maximum Ag accumulation was in hepatic and renal tissues after 96 h. A marked decrease in red blood cell count, hemoglobin content, hematocrit ratio, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was observed after 48 and 96 h of Ag-NPs exposure. Silver accumulation resulted in severe histological alterations (ex: congestion, vacuolization, and necrotic degeneration) in gills, livers, and kidneys. The adsorptive capacity of both peels could reduce the bioavailability of Ag-NPs as indicated by decreased Ag content in tissues, insignificant change in the hematological parameters with control groups, and regressive histological alterations based on the frequency of alterations’ existence and the extent of affected parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aadsorption 3abananas 3abioavailability 3aerythrocyte count 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahistology 3ananosilver 3apollution 3atoxicity 3atoxicology1 aHamed, Aliaa1 aHasheesh, Wafaa S.F.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 May, v. 108, no. 5 p.985-994dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-022-03488-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014500169520116900314592002801483650002101511650001401532650002501546650002401571650003101595650001601626650001101642650001301653650000901666650002201675650002601697650001301723650002301736650001601759653002601775653002701801653002301828653001901851653002401870700001601894700001701910700005701927773010801984856008602092852000902178655001202187IND60682273220221119003329.0200221e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068227322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1158882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yuehua10aEmerging challenges in the thermal management of cellulose nanofibril-based supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and solar cells: A review  aIn recent years, extensive efforts have been devoted to electronic miniaturization and integration. Accordingly, heating up of electronics has become a critical problem that needs to be urgently solved by efficient and reliable thermal management. Electronic device substrates made of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) exhibit outstanding flexibility, mechanical properties, and optical properties. Combining CNFs with high-thermal-conductivly fillers is an effective thermal management technique. This paper focuses on the thermal management of electronic devices and highlights the potential of CNF-based materials for efficient thermal management of energy storage electronic such as supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and solar cells. A high-thermal-conductivity composite material for electronic devices can be obtained by combining CNFs as the framework material with carbon nanotubes, graphene, and inorganic nitrides. Moreover, The research progress in the application of CNFs-based materials for supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and solar cells is highlighted, and the emerging challenges of different CNFs-based energy storage devices are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acomposite materials 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat 3alithium batteries 3amechanical properties 3anitrides 3aoptical properties 3asolar cells 0aCellulose nanofibrils 0aEnergy storage devices 0aThermal management 0aSupercapacitor 0aLithium-ion battery1 aHao, Ningke1 aLin, Xuejiao1 aNie, Shuangxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9695-30220 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 234 p.115888-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2020.1158883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245019100171300001400362520141800376592002801794650003201822650002101854650001501875650003301890650004301923650002401966650003701990650001202027650002002039653002402059653002502083653001702108653002002125700002102145773012202166856008202288852000902370655001202379IND60619049520221118045444.0181120e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061904952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2018.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Antara A.10aExtracellular loop 3 substitutions K589N and A590S in FSH receptor increase FSH-induced receptor internalization and along with S588T substitution exhibit impaired ERK1/2 phosphorylation  ap. 57-65.  aThe interaction of follicle stimulating hormone with its specific GPCR, the follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is facilitated by the extracellular loops (ELs) which contact the transmembrane domain and relay the signal downstream. In order to determine the contribution of non conserved residues from the EL3 of FSHR in conferring specificity to FSH-FSHR interaction, they were swapped with respective residues from luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor. The triple mutant EL3M exhibited increased internalization of FSH-FSHR complexes without affecting the cAMP signaling response. Here, substitution point mutants S588T, K589N and A590S of the EL3 of FSHR were generated and characterized. None of these substitutions affected FSHR expression, FSH binding ability and cAMP production as compared to wild type FSHR. However, the high internalization of EL3M was observed to be due to the K589N and A590S substitutions. Further, all the mutants showed an impaired FSH mediated ERK phosphorylation response and the extent of impairment was most striking in case of the A590S substitution. Interestingly, S588T mutant exhibited impaired ERK phosphorylation, without change in receptor internalization, indicating that these processes can be dissociated. Thus, the FSHR specific residues K589 and A590 in the EL3 of FSHR seem to be crucial for FSH-induced internalization and ERK phosphorylation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abinding capacity 3acyclic AMP 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone receptors 3aluteinizing hormone 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 0aERK phosphorylation 0aExtracellular loop 3 0aFSH receptor 0aInternalization1 aMahale, Smita D.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 659 p.57-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2018.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013900167520111800306592002801424650001301452650001501465650001601480650001601496650001401512650001301526650001901539650001301558650001301571650002001584650002001604650001401624650001201638650001401650653003501664653003201699653001101731653001601742653003301758700001601791700001301807700001301820700001801833700001701851700001601868700001401884700002001898773010901918856008602027852000902113655001202122IND60737695620221119161815.0220606e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073769562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhulian10aBioinspired polysaccharide hybrid hydrogel promoted recruitment and chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  aCartilage regeneration by biomimetic cartilage matrix with synchronously recruited stem cells was one of ideal strategies. Inspired by catechol for proteins adhesion, dopamine modified polysaccharide hybrid hydrogel (HD-C) was prepared by integrating collagen I (Col I) and hyaluronic acid derivatives (HA-DN) with sulfhydryl modified polysaccharide hybrid hydrogel (HS-C) as control. Because of double-crosslinking architecture, HD-C hydrogel was endowed with a more compact pore structure, higher mechanical properties and water retention ability in comparison with those of HS-C hydrogel. Meanwhile, it significantly promoted the proliferation and spread of rabbit bone marrow stem cells (rBMSCs), and accelerated cartilaginous matrix secretion. RT-PCR results also verified higher related gene expression of chondrogenesis (Sox 9, Agg and Col II). Moreover, HD-C hydrogel could enhance the enrichment and migration of rBMSCs in vitro by potential functional protein adsorption mechanisms, and this phenomenon was further confirmed by more rBMSCs migration in short-term joint implantation experiments in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3abiomimetics 3abone marrow 3acartilage 3acatechol 3achondrogenesis 3acollagen 3adopamine 3agene expression 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrogels 3arabbits 3asecretion 0aPolysaccharide hybrid hydrogel 0aBiomimetic cartilage matrix 0arBMSCs 0aRecruitment 0aChondrogenic differentiation1 aCao, Hongfu1 aXu, Yang1 aLi, Xing1 aHan, Xiaowen,1 aFan, Yujiang1 aJiang, Qing1 aSun, Yong1 aZhang, Xingdong0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 267 p.118224-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.1182243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245011300128300001800241520124200259592002801501650002501529650002401554650002101578650001001599650002201609650001301631650001401644650000901658650002701667650001901694650002401713650002301737650001001760653002201770653003001792700001701822700001801839700001501857700001601872700001501888773015301903852000902056655001202065IND60706459120221122032811.0200807e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070645912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNag, Sumita12aA Comparison of Efficiency Parameters of SSR Primers and Genetic Diversity Analysis in Jute (Corchorus spp.)  ap. 2882-2885.  aJute (Corchorus spp.) is a natural bast fibre crop and has considerable commercial significance in the world after cotton, as it is a completely biodegradable, recyclable and environmental friendly lingo-cellulose fibre. For sustenance of the trade in the face of tough competition from synthetics, there is an urgent need to redesign the ongoing breeding strategy to improve both the yield and quality of jute fibre. It is therefore, essential to understand the pattern of genetic diversity in this important commercial crop species. Five Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) were amplified in 30 genotypes of both the cultivated species of jute Corchorus olitorius and Corchorus capsularis. The study was undertaken to identify the efficient SSR primers that could differentiate a set of 30 jute genotypes. Various efficiency parameters, namely: Polymorphic Information Content (PIC), Resolving Power (RP), Mean Resolving Power and Diversity Index (DI) were studied. The relationship between the parameters was studied using simple correlation coefficient. Dendrogram was constructed to find out the genetic diversity among the germplasm. These SSR markers will facilitate further studies in population genetics and utilization of this crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorchorus capsularis 3aCorchorus olitorius 3abiodegradability 3acrops 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ajute 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant breeding 3apopulation genetics 3asynthetic products 3atrade 0aCorchorus species 0aSSR and Genetic diversity1 aMitra, Jiban1 aSatya, Pratik1 aKar, C.

Elbows with double-layer wall structures were designed to present the erosion characteristics, particle breakage ratio, and pressure drop. Results indicate that the angle between the erosion center and the tangential direction of the elbow inlet is approximately 25°–30°. The elbow shape and airflow velocity have significant effects on all three evaluation indices, whereas the particle size and gas supply pressure have significant effects on the pressure drop.

O. ficus-indica is an attractive alternative biofuel feedstock due to its low water demand and high biomass productivity. Current ethanol yields from O. ficus-indica are not commercially viable due to low concentrations of released fermentable carbohydrates. Axenic strains of bacteria and fungi were isolated and characterized from a soil microbial community consortium that effectively degrades cladodes into soluble components. The consortium consisted of species representing 14 genera of eubacteria and four genera of fungi. The digestion efficiency of each axenic isolate was evaluated by measuring the release of soluble material after aerobic digestion of cladodes and direct measurement of cellulase and pectinase activities in the culture supernatants. Pectobacterium cacticida was the most effective eubacterial species identified for degrading cladodes among all isolates evaluated. Thus, P. cacticida holds great promise for increasing the release of fermentable sugars and improving overall ethanol yields.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCrassulacean acid metabolism 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3aPectobacterium cacticida 3aaerobic digestion 3abiodegradation 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3acactus pears 3acladodes 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenergy crops 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3apolygalacturonase 3asoil microorganisms 0aCactus pear 0aMicrobial consortium 0aCladode 0aFermentable sugars1 aYim, Won Cheol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7489-04351 aCushman, John C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5561-17520 tHeliyon.g2021 Aug., v. 7, no. 8 p.e07854-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e078543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011300159300002000272520148800292592002801780650001201808650001601820650002201836650002101858650002201879650001801901650001301919650002601932650002201958650001301980650000701993650001902000650001502019650001902034650002102053700001802074700002302092700002002115700001702135700001902152700001702171700001502188700001602203773012402219856007402343852000902417655001202426IND60640947320221122064227.0190505e20160721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064094732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra13435a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzeng, Tai-Wei10aPhotolysis and photocatalytic decomposition of sulfamethazine antibiotics in an aqueous solution with TiO₂  ap. 69301-69310.  aPhoto-decomposition of sulfamethazine (SMT) involves photolytic and photo-catalytic reactions, which occur simultaneously. The relative contributions of these two reactions to the overall SMT photo-decompositions by TiO₂ and the intermediates of SMT photo-decompositions were systematically examined with the effects of TiO₂ loading, and the pH and the initial SMT concentrations in the solutions. The apparent rate constants of SMT photo-decomposition reactions, which were well described by the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, ranged from 0.24 to 1.61 h⁻¹. The overall photo-decomposition efficiencies of 0.072 mM SMT were the highest at pH 5.5 with 0.5 g L⁻¹ TiO₂ due to the adsorption-induced photocatalytic decomposition of SMT on TiO₂. However, the SMT photolysis occurred more rapidly at pH 10. Two reactive species of holes and hydroxyl radicals concurrently participated in the photocatalytic decomposition of SMT, and the latter dominated the oxidative reactions of SMT on TiO₂. Eight intermediates of SMT photo-decomposition were determined using LC-MS. Their time-dependent distributions indicated that the photo-decomposition of SMT was triggered by hydroxylation on aniline and dimethylpyrimidinyl moieties, followed by the cleavage of the S–N bond of SMT. Our results illustrated that the intermediates with dimethylpyrimidinyl groups possess strong resistance to photo-decomposition and played a determinant role in the photo-decomposition of SMT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3aantibiotics 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical bonding 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3akinetics 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amoieties 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3asulfamethazine 3atitanium dioxide1 aWang, Shan-Li1 aChen, Chiing-Chang1 aTan, Chen-Chung1 aLiu, Yu-Ting1 aChen, Tsan-Yao1 aTzou, Yu-Min1 aChen, C.C.1 aHung, J.

With this aim, we carried out an extensive 3-year monitoring in ports and marinas along the coasts of both countries, which showed a widespread occurrence of both PPs, with Irgarol 1051 concentrations usually being lower than the Diuron ones. The measured concentrations were compared with regulatory Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) (Directive 2008/105/EC) and used to perform a probabilistic Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA), for a thorough evaluation of the potential adverse effects upon marine ecosystem. Irgarol 1051 amounts above the Annual Average Concentration (AA-EQS, 2.5 ng/L) were often detected in Apulia and, less frequently, in Albania. Moreover, in Apulia, sometimes the Maximum Allowable Concentrations (MAC-EQS, 16 ng/L) was exceeded. In Apulia, where levels exceeded MAC/AA-EQS, ERA found not negligible probabilities of exceeding the toxicity level (6–18 %). A less critical situation was observed for Diuron whose levels were always below the MAC-EQS (1800 ng/L) in both countries and, in Albania, also below the AA-EQS (200 ng/L). On the other hand, in Apulia, this limit was exceeded in some locations. Correspondingly, ERA determined a not negligible risk in these sites (probability of exceedance 4–7 %).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantifouling agents 3aaquatic organisms 3abiocides 3aboating 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3adiuron 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental quality 3amarinas 3amarine ecosystems 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 3aAlbania 3aItaly1 aParrella, Luisa1 aDi Landa, Giuseppe1 aMassanisso, Paolo1 aSchiavo, Simona1 aManzo, Sonia0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 July, v. 188, no. 7 p.435-435dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5419-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008000206300001600286520092500302592002801227596003301255596006301288596004601351650001801397650002101415650001501436650002701451650001501478650001001493650001401503650001201517650001501529700002201544700001601566700001601582773014301598856008301741852000901824655001201833IND60779653820221120124733.0220613e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077965382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-021-03388-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlinova, Irina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7569-323310aLong-Term Toxicity of Gadolinium to the Freshwater Crustacean Daphnia magna  ap. 848-853.  aThe lanthanides are considered emerging contaminants but information on their long-term toxicity to aquatic species under environmentally relevant conditions is scarce. We aimed to fill this gap by evaluating the long-term adverse effects of gadolinium on the freshwater model—crustacean Daphnia magna. The exposure of D. magna for up to 39 days to 0.1 mg Gd/L (a 21-days chronic toxicity NOEC value derived by us formerly) in the lake water had no negative effect (p > 0.05) on vitality, size and reproduction of parent animals as well as their offspring. Thus, assumingly the current Gd contamination levels of surface waters pose no hazard to aquatic crustaceans that in general are very sensitive to various pollutants. Moreover, presence of 0.1 mg Gd/L in the lake water even mitigated the long-term toxic effect of 0.2 mg Ni/L (studied as a model co-contaminant) to D. magna’s vitality and productivity.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRG684ceesti teadusagentuur  a2014-2020.4.01.16-0123cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aTK134cEuropean Regional Development Fund 3aDaphnia magna 3achronic toxicity 3afreshwater 3afreshwater crustaceans 3agadolinium 3alakes 3apollution 3aprogeny 3atoxicology1 aLukjanova, Aljona1 aVija, Heiki1 aKahru, Anne0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2022 May, v. 108, no. 5 p.848-853dSpringer USwJournal:jnl46145x0007-48617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-021-03388-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009200170300001400262520178500276592002802061650001702089650001102106650001502117650002202132650001302154650001502167650002002182650001402202653002402216653001902240653002302259653002602282653003402308653002002342700002002362700002502382773009702407856008502504852000902589655001202598IND60755198320221122232454.0211206e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075519832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanglais, David10aRheology of dry powders and metal injection molding feedstocks formulated on their base  ap. 13-26.  aThe influence of powder characteristics on the moldability of metal injection molding feedstock is relatively well understood, but remains difficult to quantify other than by real-scale injections. This study aims to correlate feedstock moldability performances with melt viscosity and dry powder rheology. Four stainless steel powders exhibiting different particle sizes and shapes were tested in dry conditions using an FT4 powder rheometer to obtain thirteen different powder rheology-related metrics. These powders were subsequently mixed with a wax-based binder to formulate four feedstocks that were tested in melt conditions using a rotational rheometer to characterize the injection-related rheology of the feedstock formulations. The moldability of the feedstocks was finally quantified using real-scale injections performed into a spiral mold cavity to measure the injected lengths, and the correlation between the dry and melt rheology metrics and the real-scale injection moldability was evaluated. Results showed that the feedstock melt viscosities and the injected lengths were almost perfectly correlated. Furthermore, two dry powder rheology metrics, namely, the normalized basic flow energy and the conditioned powder bulk density, showed the correlation with the feedstock moldability which is comparable to that obtained with the melt rheology. The results of this study indicate that although the feedstock melt viscosity and the dry powder rheology take fewer variables into account as compared to real-scale injections, these simplified tests (especially dry powder rheology) could be considered as rapid and reliable approaches to assessing the impact of powder characteristics on the moldability of powder-binder feedstocks used in metal injection molding.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3ainjection molding 3arheology 3arheometers 3astainless steel 3aviscosity 0aDry powder rheology 0aMelt viscosity 0aPowder flowability 0aFeedstock moldability 0aMetal injection molding (MIM) 0aMetallic powder1 aDemers, Vincent1 aBrailovski, Vladimir0 tPowder technology.g2022 Jan., v. 396 p.13-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.10.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011500163300001800278520165100296592002801947650002101975650002601996650002702022650002402049650001902073650002202092650001802114650001202132650002202144650001102166650001402177700001502191700001702206700001902223773012802242856008102370852000902451655001202460IND60580876920221119001401.0171004e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058087692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-017-8511-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Cuiying10aChemoenzymatic synthesis of 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate coupling with an ATP regeneration system  ap. 7535-7544.  a3′-Phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) is the obligate cosubstrate and source of the sulfonate group in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of heparin, a commonly used anticoagulant drug. Previously, using ATP as the substrate, we had developed a one-pot synthesis to prepare PAPS with 47% ATP conversion efficiency. During the reaction, 47% of ATP was converted into the by-product, ADP. Here, to increase the conversion ratio of ATP to PAPS, an ATP regeneration system was developed to couple with PAPS synthesis. In the ATP regeneration system, the chemical compound, monopotassium phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP⁻K⁺), was synthesized and used as the phospho-donor. By using 3-bromopyruvic acid as the starting material, the total yield of PEP⁻K⁺ synthesis was over 50% at low cost. Then, the enzyme PykA from Escherichia coli was overexpressed, purified, and used to convert the by-product ADP into ATP. When coupled the ATP regeneration system with PAPS synthesis, the higher ratio of PEP⁻K⁺ to ADP was associated with higher ATP conversion efficiency. By using the ATP regeneration system, the conversion ratio of ATP to PAPS was increased to 98% as determined by PAMN-HPLC analysis, and 5 g of PAPS was produced in 1 L of the reaction mixture. Furthermore, the chemoenzymatic synthesized PAPS was purified and freeze-dried without observed decomposition. However, the powdery PAPS was more unstable than the PAPS sodium salt in aqueous solution at ambient temperature. This developed chemoenzymatic approach of PAPS production will contribute to the synthesis of heparin, in which PAPS is necessary as the individual sulfo-donor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aambient temperature 3aanticoagulants 3aaqueous solutions 3afreeze drying 3aheparin 3aorganic compounds 3asodium 3asynthesis1 aZhao, Long1 aWei, Zhaojun1 aZhou, Xianxuan0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2017 Oct., v. 101, no. 20 p.7535-7544dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-017-8511-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006600165300001200231520044200243592002800685650001400713650001400727650002500741650001800766650001600784650001200800651002000812653002600832653001700858653001200875653001300887700001800900700001500918700001700933700001300950700001500963773011400978856008201092852000901174655001201183IND60111930220221118133041.0190401e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011193022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2012.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Qing-Hua10aChemical constituents from the ascidian Aplidium constellatum  ap. 6-8.  aChemical investigation of the South China Sea ascidian Aplidium constellatum has led to the isolation of four sterols (1–4), two carboline alkaloids (5 and 6), a ceramide (7), two furanone derivatives (8 and 9), and six nucleosides (10–15).

Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma face malnutrition, due to swallowing impairment related to the tumor site or to treatment sequalae, and may need supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) in addition to oral feeding when enteral nutrition is not feasible. Additionally, immune depression is a well-known complication in these patients. Parenteral nutrition (PN) bags contain amino acids, minerals, electrolytes and mostly lipids that provide calories in a concentrated form and are enriched with essential fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate multiple parameters of the immune responses in a cohort of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma undergoing supplemental PN with bags enriched in ω-3 or ω-9 and ω-6 fatty acids.To our knowledge, this was the first exploratory study to investigate the effects of two different PN lipid emulsions on specific immune cells function of patients with advanced head and neck squamous carcinoma. ω-3-enriched fish-oil-based- and ω-6- and ω-9-enriched olive-oil-basedSPN was administered to two groups of patients for 1 wk in the context of an observational multicentric study. Polychromatic flow cytometry was used to investigate multiple subsets of leukocytes, with a special focus on cellular populations endowed with antitumor activity.Patients treated with olive-oil-based PN showed an increase in the function of the innate (natural killer cells and monocytes) and adaptive (both CD4 and CD8 cells) arms of the immune response.An increase in the function of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response may favor antitumoral responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenteral feeding 3aface 3aflow cytometry 3ahead and neck squamous cell carcinoma 3aimmune response 3amalnutrition 3amonocytes 3aparenteral feeding 0aFatty acids 0aParenteral nutrition 0aHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma 0aImmune response 0aOlive oil 0aFish oil1 aBorioli, Valeria1 aBorsellino, Giovanna1 aPicozza, Mario1 aPellini, Raul1 aCereda, Emanuele1 aGargano, Francesca1 aCaraccia, Marilisa1 aNardi, Maria Teresa1 aBellu, Luisa1 aTondulli, Luca1 aImarisio, Ilaria1 aPozzi, Emma1 aPedrazzoli, Paolo1 aCaccialanza, Riccardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9379-35691 aBattistini, Luca0 tNutrition.g2021 June, v. 86 p.111178-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2021.1111783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02181naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245006300168300001400231520088200245592002801127596011501155650001401270650002201284650005001306650001001356650002001366650001001386650001101396650001401407650001701421700001901438700001801457700002001475700001901495700002001514773013301534856008201667961001301749852000901762655001201771IND60621931120221120081631.0181128e20180403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062193112DNAL7 a10.1094/PHP-12-17-0083-DG2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarveson, Robert10aSunflower Stalk Diseases Initiated Through Leaf Infections  ap. 82-91.  aThis article describes three distinct sunflower stalk diseases that are caused by pathogens that primarily begin as foliar infections.

Methods: The electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched up to October 2017 for observational studies on the association between serum zinc level and MetS. The standard mean difference (SMD) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of the serum zinc level for MetS versus control participants were calculated. In addition, the pooled odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) of MetS for the highest versus lowest category of serum zinc level, as well as their corresponding 95% CI, were also calculated. Results: A total of 11 observational studies (8 cross-sectional, 1 case-control, and 2 cohort studies) were included in this meta-analysis. The combined SMD demonstrated that the serum zinc level in MetS was higher than that in control participants (SMD = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03–0.19; p = 0.009). Moreover, the overall multivariable-adjusted RR showed that the increased serum zinc level was associated with a higher risk of MetS (RR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.33–2.50; p < 0.001). On the contrary, the overall multivariable-adjusted OR showed that there was no significant relationship between serum zinc level and MetS (OR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99–1.01; p = 0.841). Conclusions: Although the serum zinc level in participants with MetS was significantly higher than that in control ones, the existing evidence was still insufficient to conclude a definite relationship between serum zinc level and MetS. More well-designed prospective cohort studies are needed to elaborate the concerned issues further.  aThis work was supported by the China Scholarship Council (student ID: 201706370196) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University (2017zzts233).  aPublisher supplied data  a201706370196cChina Scholarship Council  a2017zzts233cCentral Universities of Central South University 3ablood serum 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobservational studies 3aodds ratio 3arelative risk 3azinc 0aSerum zinc 0ametabolic syndrome 0ameta-analysis 0aobservational studies1 aZhang, Dian-zhong0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2018 Nov. 17, v. 37, no. 8 p.708-715dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2018.14638763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014100164300001400305520144200319592002801761650002601789650001201815650002201827650001501849650001901864650002701883650002501910650001301935650001401948650001301962651002101975653003701996653002902033653002202062653002602084700001902110700002002129773011602149856008202265852000902347655001202356IND60111930320221118133010.0190401e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011193032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2012.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Hye Suck10aPopulation genetic structure of the Korean Pacific abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta inferred from microsatellite marker analysis  ap. 76-84.  aThe Pacific abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta, of the family Haliotidae, is one of the most important shellfish species in eastern Asia. In Korea, it is intensively caught in Jeju Island, where it is highly appreciated as seafood. However, its natural population has declined drastically in the past several decades. To investigate its genetic characteristics for conservation and management purposes, the genetic variation in four populations from Jeju Island, Korea was analyzed using 20 microsatellite loci. All populations showed very high genetic diversity and a deficit of heterozygotes. The minor but significant genetic differentiations (both FST and RST) observed were mainly due to genetic differences between populations from Pyoson and other localities, suggesting that abalone may not be panmictic. The Pyoson abalone population showed a significant difference in allelic richness that could be related to harvesting intensity and stock enhancement activity. This result was also corroborated by an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Overall, this report presents novel observations of the wild genetic population structure in H. diversicolor supertexta from Korea using microsatellite markers and provides critical information for supporting conservation strategies for this species, namely that the Pyoson abalone population should have a higher conservation priority due to its unique genetic characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis diversicolor 3aabalone 3agenetic variation 3aharvesting 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3aseafoods 3ashellfish 3avariance 3aKorean Peninsula 0aHaliotis diversicolor supertexta 0aGenetic differentiations 0aGenetic diversity 0aConservation priority1 aLee, Jang Wook1 aHong, Seong Wan0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2013 June, v. 48 p.76-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2012.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015000163300001600313520191800329592002802247650001102275650003002286650001302316650001002329650002102339650001502360650001002375650001802385650001402403650001902417650001102436650001902447650001702466650001202483650001502495650001402510650001202524650001202536650001402548650002602562650001102588651001002599653002502609653003002634653001902664653002902683653001702712653001902729700001402748700001602762700001902778700001702797700001602814700001602830773011702846856008202963852000903045655001203054IND60539872720221120215036.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053987272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2015.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarella, F.10aQuantitative histopathology of the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis L.) exposed to the harmful dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata  ap. 130-140.  aOstreopsis cf. ovata is a benthic dinoflagellate that produces palytoxin-like compounds that adversely affect both marine vertebrates and invertebrates and are reported to be responsible for human intoxication in aerosol form. In this work, a histopathological analysis accompanied by quantitative evaluation of tissue injury in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed to O. cf. ovata cells under natural and experimental conditions, provided baseline data on the health status of the mussels in terms of defensive and regressive pathological changes. We recorded a total of 15 health parameters in the digestive system, muscle, kidney and gills in mussels exposed to O. cf. ovata both in the laboratory and at sea. Animals exposed to different concentrations of O. cf. ovata cells (300, 500 and 1000cellsml−1) for 48h showed activation of the inflammatory response, which increased with the cell concentration, mainly characterized by haemocyte aggregates actively enclosing the algae, while mussel mortality was also recorded in some cases. Moreover the use of image analysis for the evaluation of digestive tubule damage revealed a pronounced increase in the lumen in terms of its area, perimeter and circularity, with a shift in a high percentage of tubules from an adsorbing profile to an atrophic profile. Animals collected from the natural environment during a summer bloom of O. cf. ovata in the Gulf of Naples (Italy) showed comparable lesions in terms of types and severity. This is the first quantitative study assessing damage to the digestive epithelia in terms of lumen modifications in mussels exposed to O. cf. ovata.The presented methodology provides a new technique for automating the evaluation of epithelial tubule modifications. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring the presence of O. cf. ovata in this area, taking into account the effects on the residing marine species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiozoa 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aaerosols 3aalgae 3adigestive system 3aepithelium 3agills 3ahealth status 3ahemocytes 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3amonitoring 3amortality 3amuscles 3amussels 3apoisoning 3aquantitative analysis 3asummer 3aItaly 0aOstreopsis cf. ovata 0aMytilus galloprovincialis 0aImage analysis 0aDigestive tubule atrophy 0aInflammation 0aGulf of Naples1 aSardo, A.1 aMangoni, O.1 aDi Cioccio, D.1 aUrciuolo, G.1 aDe Vico, G.1 aZingone, A.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2015 May, v. 127 p.130-140dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2015.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013000170300001600300520128200316536007701598592002801675596009001703650001901793650001901812650001601831650002301847650001801870650001201888650002001900650001401920650001201934650002201946650001401968650001901982653001802001653000902019653001902028653001102047653001102058700002402069700002402093700002202117700002102139773014102160856008502301852000902386655001202395IND60626036720221120184912.0181214e20181117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062603672DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2018.14654862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoradi, Maedeh10aAssociations Between Dietary Energy Density in Mothers and Growth of Breastfeeding Infants During the First 4 Months of Life  ap. 731-737.  aObjectives: Despite the overwhelming impact of dietary energy density on the quality of the entire diet, no research has investigated dietary energy density among lactating mothers. Hence, the present study was undertaken to assess the influence of maternal dietary energy density during lactation on infant growth. Method: Three hundred healthy lactating mother–infant pairs were enrolled in the study. Detailed demographic information and dietary intake data were collected from the lactating mothers. Anthropometric features such as infant weight, height, and head circumference at birth and 2 and 4 months and mother's pregnancy and postpartum weight and height were derived from health center records. Data on physical activity were reported using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: After adjusting for confounding variables, infant weight, length, weight-for-height, and head circumference at birth, 2 months, and 4 months did not show significant differences among four dietary energy density categories (all p values > 0.01). Conclusions: Our study showed no association among quartiles of dietary energy density among lactating mothers and infant weight, length, weight-for-height, and head circumference growth by 2 and 4 months of age.  aFunding was provided by Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (393883).  aPublisher supplied data  a393883cIsfahan University of Medical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003970 3abreast feeding 3aenergy density 3afood intake 3ahead circumference 3ainfant growth 3ainfants 3alactating women 3alactation 3amothers 3aphysical activity 3apregnancy 3aquestionnaires 0aBreastfeeding 0adiet 0aenergy density 0agrowth 0ainfant1 aMaracy, Mohammad R.1 aEsmaillzadeh, Ahmad1 aSurkan, Pamela J.1 aAzadbakht, Leila0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2018 Nov. 17, v. 37, no. 8 p.731-737dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2018.14654863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013000168300001400298520118700312592002801499650002401527650001101551650003001562650002501592650001001617650001401627650001401641650001501655650003001670650002401700650001301724650001101737650001101748650001201759650001101771651001901782651001401801653001901815653001801834653002401852653001701876653001101893653001801904700002301922700001901945700003001964773011501994856008202109852000902191655001202200IND60539872820221120214938.0190318e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053987282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2015.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRogers, Holly A.10aVariations in prevalence of viral, bacterial, and rhizocephalan diseases and parasites of the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus)  ap. 54-62.  aPrevalence of blue crab diseases and parasites has not been consistently monitored in the Gulf of Mexico. To establish current prevalence levels and to more fully understand population dynamics, commercial landing trends, and effects of future natural and anthropogenic disasters on animal health, we measured the prevalence of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Loxothylacus texanus, shell disease, and Vibrio spp. in blue crabs collected from Louisiana in 2013 and the beginning of 2014. We used PCR to detect WSSV and L. texanus infections, visual gross diagnosis for L. texanus externae and shell disease, and standard microbiological culture techniques and biochemical testing for Vibrio spp. We found no crabs infected with WSSV or L. texanus. Absence of L. texanus parasitization was expected based on the sampled salinities and the sampling focus on large crabs. Shell disease was present at a level of 54.8% and was most prevalent in the winter and summer and least prevalent in the spring. Vibrio spp. were found in the hemolymph of 22.3% of the crabs and prevalence varied by site, season, and sex. Additionally, three of 39 crabs tested were infected with reo-like virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallinectes sapidus 3aVibrio 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3abacterial infections 3acrabs 3ahemolymph 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3asalinity 3aspring 3asummer 3aviruses 3awinter 3aGulf of Mexico 3aLouisiana 0aCrab parasites 0aCrab diseases 0aCallinectes sapidus 0aLoxothylacus 0aVibrio 0aShell disease1 aTaylor, Sabrina S.1 aHawke, John P.1 aAnderson Lively, Julie A.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2015 May, v. 127 p.54-62dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2015.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245007200167300001800239520165900257592002801916650001901944650001901963650001401982650002001996650001502016650001902031650000902050650001102059650002102070650001502091650002802106700002302134700002802157700002502185700001702210773011102227856007502338852000902413655001202422IND60529476920171213000000.0171213e20130702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052947692DNAL7 a10.1021/ac400470n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrygolowicz-Pawlak, Ewa10aPotentiometric Sensors with Ion-Exchange Donnan Exclusion Membranes  ap. 6208-6212.  aPotentiometric sensors that exhibit a non-Hofmeister selectivity sequence are normally designed by selective chemical recognition elements in the membrane. In other situations, when used as detectors in separation science, for example, membranes that respond equally to most ions are preferred. With so-called liquid membranes, a low selectivity is difficult to accomplish since these membranes are intrinsically responsive to lipophilic species. Instead, the high solubility of sample lipids in an ionophore-free sensing matrix results in a deterioration of the response. We explore here potentiometric sensors on the basis of ion-exchange membranes commonly used in fuel cell applications and electrodialysis, which have so far not found their way into the field of ion-selective electrodes. These membranes act as Donnan exclusion membranes as the ions are not stripped of their hydration shell as they interact with the membrane. Because of this, lipophilic ions are no longer preferred over hydrophilic ones, making them promising candidates for the detection of abundant ions in the presence of lipophilic ones or as detectors in separation science. Two types of cation-exchanger membranes and one anion-exchange membrane were characterized, and potentiometric measuring ranges were found to be Nernstian over a wide range down to about 10 μM concentrations. Depending on the specific membrane, lipophilic ions gave equal response to hydrophilic ones or were even somewhat discriminated. The medium and long-term stability and reproducibility of the electrode signals were found to be promising when evaluated in synthetic and whole blood samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3ablood sampling 3adetectors 3aelectrodialysis 3afuel cells 3ahydrophilicity 3aions 3alipids 3aliquid membranes 3asolubility 3aspecific ion electrodes1 aCrespo, Gastón A.1 aGhahraman Afshar, Majid1 aMistlberger, Günter1 aBakker, Eric0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 July 02, v. 85, no. 13 p.6208-6212dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac400470n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245013400182300001400316520138100330592002801711650001101739650000801750650004301758650002601801650002201827650001401849651001101863653001101874653000901885653002201894653001401916653002201930700002501952700003301977700004102010700003502051773011602086856008202202852000902284655001202293IND60111930620221118132446.0190401e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011193062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2012.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Faria-Tavares, Juliana Sala10aGenetic relationships among accessions of mandacaru (Cereus spp.: Cactaceae) using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP)  ap. 12-19.  aAmplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was used to evaluate the genetic diversity at the DNA level of mandacaru (genus Cereus) and to differentiate between 17 accessions grown in different regions of Brazil. The six primer pairs used amplified 348 AFLP markers, of which 282 (81%) were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic fragments ranged from 62.5% for the primer combination E-AAC × M-CAG to 91.7% for E-ACT × M-CAC. The largest number of informative markers (67) was detected using the primer combination E-ACA × M-CAG, while the E-AGC × M-CTC combination revealed the lowest number of polymorphic fragments (46) in the mandacaru plantlets. The Nei's identity value between the accessions of mandacaru was 0.6348–0.8343 for plants from the Southern and Northeastern regions, 0.6348–0.6529 between accessions from the Southwestern and Northeastern regions, and 0.6193–0.6944 between accessions from the Southern and Southwestern regions. The similarity among the Southern, Northeastern, and Southwestern regions indicates that the plants of the three regions may be different species of the Cereus genus: Cereus peruvianus or Cereus repandus (Southern region), Cereus jamacaru (Northeastern region), and Cereus hildmaniannus (Southwestern region). Alternatively, the accessions may belong to one species in the process of speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCereus 3aDNA 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aplantlets 3aBrazil 0aCactus 0aAFLP 0aGenetic diversity 0aMandacaru 0aCereus peruvianus1 aMartin, Paula Garcia1 aMangolin, Claudete Aparecida1 ade Oliveira-Collet, Sandra Aparecida1 aMachado, Maria de Fátima P.S.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2013 June, v. 48 p.12-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45135x0305-19787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2012.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168300001600263520141300279536023301692592002801925596007701953650002702030650001202057650002302069650001802092650001702110650001602127650002202143650001502165650002402180650001202204650002602216650001502242650001702257653001702274653001502291653001202306653001602318653002402334700002402358700002502382700003102407773014102438856008502579852000902664655001202673IND60626036920221120185009.0181214e20181117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062603692DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2018.14667382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNour, Monica10aShort Videos Addressing Barriers to Cooking with Vegetables in Young Adults: Pilot Testing  ap. 724-730.  aObjective: Digital platforms offer innovative opportunities for nutrition education to motivate young adults to improve eating behaviors and practices. This study aimed to pilot test short educational cooking videos for dissemination through a smartphone designed to address barriers to home cooking and vegetable consumption among young adults. Method: Instructional videos (1–3 min) were produced and acceptability and perceived effectiveness for reducing barriers was investigated. Short free-response questions explored enablers of home cooking and feedback on the videos was collected through open discussion. Qualitative findings were coded using NVivo 11. Results: Three focus groups with 16 young adults (mean age = 21.1 years) were conducted. Videos were well received and 9 of 13 participants who had low motivation to cook at baseline reported an increase in motivation post–video viewing. Perception of time as a barrier was reduced for 10 of 16 participants and thematic analysis revealed that accessibility to ingredients, ability to conceptualize recipes, and cost-saving tips were key enablers to cooking with vegetables. Conclusions: Short cooking videos may be a useful tool in interventions to address barriers to vegetable preparation and consumption among young adults. Future research should identify whether improvements in attitudes and motivation translate to change in intake.  aThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

In this work, novel active and intelligent packaging nanofibers based on gelatin/ chitosan with curcumin (GA/CS/CUR) were developed via electrospinning technique. Effects of the incorporation of CUR content (0.1 %－0.3 %, m/m) on the microstructure and functional properties of the electrospun nanofibers were investigated. Morphological studies using scanning electron microscopy indicated that loading CUR can affect the average diameter of nanofiber mats, which remained around 160180 nm. The addition of an appropriate level CUR (0.2 %, m/m) led to a stronger intermolecular interaction, and thus enhanced the thermal stability and tensile strength of the obtained nanofibers. Meanwhile, the incorporation of CUR significantly improved antioxidant activity and the antimicrobial activity of GA/CS/CUR nanofibers. Moreover, the sensitivity of nanofibers to ammonia results indicated that GA/CS nanofibers containing 0.2 % CUR (GA/CS/CUR II) presented high sensitivity of colorimetric behavior to ammonia (within 3 min). These results suggest GA/CS/CUR II nanofibers has great potential as a multifunctional packaging to protect and monitor the freshness of protein-rich animal foods, such as meat and seafood.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aammonia 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical interactions 3achitosan 3acolorimetry 3acurcumin 3aelectron microscopy 3afood science 3afreshness 3agelatin 3ahumans 3ameat 3amicrostructure 3ananofibers 3aseafoods 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 0aElectrospun nanofibers 0aNH3 indicator 0aActive and intelligent packaging 0aAntibacterial and antioxidant activities1 aSun, Jishuai1 aHuang, Yequn1 aJiang, Haixin1 aHu, Yaqin1 aPang, Jie1 aWu, Chunhua0 tFood science and human wellness.g2023 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.614-621dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.064  aDNAL 7aarticle01322naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002300166245009600189300001400285520039000299592002800689653001300717653001900730653001200749653002000761653001600781653001400797773009800811856011400909852000901023655001201032IND60129401020221120232509.0151124e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012940102DNAL7 a10.1665/1082-6467(2008)17[29:MBOTMA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattiston, Roberto10aMating behavior of the mantid Ameles decolor (Insecta, Mantodea): courtship and cannibalism  ap. 29-33.  aSome observations on the mating behavior of the Mediterranean ground mantis Ameles decolor are reported.

The present study aims at investigating the detailed process of early gonadal sex differentiation of common carp by combining the expression patterns of sex related genes (cyp19a1a, foxl2, amh, dmrt1, sox9b, sycp3, dmc1) with gonadal histological changes using mono-sex female and male Yellow River carp. H&E staining, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence of gonads indicated that the ovaries and testis of common carp were both directly differentiated from undifferentiated gonads. Oogonia and spermatogonia were first observed at 40 dph (days post hatching) and 70 dph in female and male gonads, respectively. Female related genes cyp19a1a and foxl2 and male related genes amh, dmrt1 and sox9b increased significantly in 30–40 dph female, and male gonads, respectively. These suggest that the critical timing of sex determination of common carp takes place between 30 and 40 dph or possibly earlier. Meiotic marker gene dmc1 and sycp3 increased expression significantly in 55 dph female gonads while sycp3 increased expression significantly in 100 dph male gonads. Oocytes in meiosis and spermatocytes were first observed in 55 dph female and 100 dph male gonads, respectively. These indicate that the initiation time of gonadal sex differentiation is 50–55 dph in female common carp and 90–100 dph in male common carp. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the detailed process of early gonadal sex differentiation of common carp by combining the expression patterns of sex related genes with gonadal histological changes. We have identified the critical window of sex determination and the initiation times of oogenesis and spermatogenesis in the Yellow River carp. These results provide researchers with valuable information to possibly reveal the mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation of common carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aanimal ovaries 3acarp 3afemales 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahatching 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amales 3ameiosis 3amodels 3aoocytes 3aoogenesis 3aoogonia 3asex determination 3asexual development 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3aspermatogonia 3astaining 3atestes 3aYellow River 0aYellow River carp 0aAll-males 0aAll-females 0aWindow of sex determination 0aGonadal sex differentiation1 aJia, Shaoting1 aChen, Ji1 aChen, Kuangxin1 aMa, Wenge1 aWu, Xingxing1 aLuo, Hongrui1 aLi, Yongming1 aZhu, Zuoyan1 aHu, Wei0 tAquaculture.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 518 p.734825-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7348253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245016700174520108400341592002801425650002201453650001701475650002001492650002101512650001901533650002301552650001701575650001701592650001901609650002401628650000901652653002701661653002201688653000901710653002401719653001701743700001701760700001901777700002601796700002701822773009901849856008701948852000902035655001202044IND60760078220221120025628.0220404e20220530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076007822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1318672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSebastian, Neethu10aNanomolar detection of food additive tert-butylhydroquinone in edible oils based on novel ternary metal oxide embedded β-cyclodextrin functionalized carbon black  aIt is pivotal to precisely detect food preservatives to ascertain food quality and safety. In this work, we report the sensitive electrochemical detection of widely used cytotoxic food preservative tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ). A novel nanocomposite was sonochemically prepared by embedding ternary metal oxide (TMO) comprising ZnO, CuO, and MgO in β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) functionalized carbon black (CB). The properties of the prepared nanocomposite were evaluated by employing multiple characterization methods. The nanocomposite fabricated on a screen printed carbon electrode exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activity towards TBHQ detection, evident from the resultant very low detection limit of 1 nM and high sensitivity of 22.67 μA μM⁻¹ cm⁻². Moreover, the developed TBHQ sensor evinced all the important traits of a good electrochemical sensor including excellent selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and repeatability. Furthermore, for validating practical feasibility of TBHQ detection, we successfully determined this food additive in edible oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon electrodes 3acytotoxicity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3afood chemistry 3afood preservatives 3afood quality 3ahydroquinone 3ananocomposites 3asensors (equipment) 3asoot 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aFood preservative 0aTBHQ 0aTernary metal oxide 0aCyclodextrin1 aYu, Wan-Chin1 aBalram, Deepak1 aAl-Mubaddel, Fahad S.1 aTayyab Noman, Muhammad0 tFood chemistry.g2022 May 30, v. 377 p.131867-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1318673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011200161300001800273520153000291592002801821650001001849650001901859650001001878650001501888650002201903650001301925650001401938700001401952700002101966700001601987700002102003700002602024700002502050700002202075773011002097856007502207852000902282655001202291IND60529184220221118093657.0160717e20120417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052918422DNAL7 a10.1021/ac300305s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShih, Steve
C. C.10aDried Blood Spot Analysis by Digital Microfluidics Coupled to Nanoelectrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry  ap. 3731-3738.  aDried blood spot (DBS) samples on filter paper are surging in popularity as a sampling and storage vehicle for a wide range of clinical and pharmaceutical applications. For example, a DBS sample is collected from every baby born in the province of Ontario, Canada, for quantification of approximately one hundred analytes that are used to screen for 28 conditions, including succinylacetone (SA), a marker for hepatorenal tyrosinemia. Unfortunately, the conventional methods used to evaluate DBS samples for newborn screening and other applications are tedious and slow, with limited options for automated analysis. In response to this challenge, we have developed a method to couple digital microfluidics (DMF) to nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nESI-MS) for SA quantification in DBS samples. The new system is formed by sandwiching a pulled glass capillary emitter between the two DMF substrates such that the capillary emitter is immobilized without external seals or gaskets. Moreover, we introduce a new feedback control system that enables high-fidelity droplet manipulation across DBS samples without manual intervention. The system was validated by application to on-chip extraction, derivatization, and analysis of SA and other analytes from DBS samples, with comparable performance to gold-standard methods. We propose that the new methods described here can potentially contribute to a new generation of analytical techniques for quantifying analytes in DBS samples for a wide range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aderivatization 3aglass 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3aneonates 3ascreening1 aYang, Hao1 aJebrail, Mais J.1 aFobel, Ryan1 aMcIntosh, Nathan1 aAl-Dirbashi, Osama

We also analyzed the relationship between changes in the levels of innate immune elements and the degree of enhanced immune protection in the larvae at designated time points after priming. The larvae that received experimental doses (20.0, 10.0 and 5.0μg per larva) of LPS demonstrated increased resistance against lethal challenge with P. luminescens TT01; the degree and period of protection correlated positively with the priming dose. These results indicated that the P. luminescens TT01 LPS could induce typical immune priming in G. mellonella. Moreover, the levels of innate immune parameters (i.e. haemocyte density, phagocytosis, haemocyte encapsulation ability, and antibacterial activity of cell-free haemolymph) and endogenous enzyme activities (i.e. acid phosphatase, ACP; alkaline phosphatase, AKP; superoxide dismutase, SOD and lysozyme, LSZ) were significantly increased following priming of the larvae with LPS, whereas the activities of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were significantly decreased. All of the parameters examined changed in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that G. mellonella larvae could modulate their immune responses based on different doses of LPS used for priming, and that priming phenomenon in G. mellonella larvae elicited by LPS was mediated by the innate immune elements and enzyme activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGalleria mellonella 3aPhotorhabdus luminescens 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantibacterial properties 3acatalase 3aencapsulation 3aenzyme activity 3ahemocoel 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3alarvae 3alipopolysaccharides 3alysozyme 3aperoxidase 3aphagocytosis 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aLPS 0aAMPs 0aSOD 0aPOD 0aCAT 0aROS 0aLSZ 0aACP 0aAKP 0aPG 0aPTU 0aFITC 0aGIM 0aPGRP 0aPRRs 0aLipopolysaccharide (LPS) 0aPhotorhabdus luminescens TT01 0aGalleria mellonella 0aImmune parameters 0aEnzymes 0aImmune priming1 aYi, Yunhong1 aLv, Yingying1 aLi, Mei1 aWang, Jia1 aQiu, Lihong0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2015 May, v. 127 p.63-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2015.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002100166245006000187300001400247520124800261592002801509653001501537653001401552653001901566653002001585653001601605653001301621773009801634856011401732852000901846655001201855IND60129401420221120223042.0151124e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012940142DNAL7 a10.1665/1082-6467(2008)17[57:TNOSCA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowell, C.

The total carbohydrate content, pH, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined during in vitro digestion and fermentation. The change in the bacterial phase distribution after the fermentation was also analysed. The results showed that the total carbohydrate content of the CR with added FOS (FCR) significantly decreased during the simulated digestion. Meanwhile, the pH of the FCR decreased and the SCFAs concentration increased significantly compared to those of the CR during the simulated fermentation. In addition, the FCR showed the advantage of promoting beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and inhibiting harmful bacteria, such as Bacteroides and Klebsiella compared to the CR. Therefore, the FOS as a prebiotic could be recommended to produce the high-quality healthy rice food.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides 3aBifidobacterium 3aKlebsiella 3aLactobacillus 3acarbohydrate content 3adigestion 3afermentation 3afood science 3afructooligosaccharides 3ahumans 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apH 3aprebiotics 3arice 0aFructo-oligosaccharide 0aIn vitro 0aShort-chain fatty acids 0aBacterial phase distribution1 aLi, Wen1 aNi, Xiaolei1 aSun, Xinyang1 aYao, Yijun1 aFang, Yong1 aYang, Wenjian1 aHu, Qiuhui0 tFood science and human wellness.g2023 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.662-668dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23299x2213-45307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fshw.2022.07.068  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003400145245011600179300001600295500002000311520116100331592002801492650001901520650001001539650002001549650002001569650001601589650001101605650001901616650002401635650000901659650000801668650001001676651001401686700002301700700002801723700001901751773015701770856007901927852000902006655001202015IND60600910520221120190536.0180704e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060091052DNAL7 a10.1111/1467-8489.122622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunathilaka, Rajapaksha P.

Surprisingly, however, the economic consequences of climate change on plantation crops are seldom analysed. Drawing on a unique primary panel data set from a representative cross section of 35 tea estates in Sri Lanka over the period 2002–2014, this study implements a structural model of estate profit maximisation to estimate the elasticity of labour demand with respect to different components of weather. Results indicate a negative relationship between labour demand and rainfall in the south‐west monsoon, the north‐east monsoon and the second inter‐monsoon. A positive relationship is found between labour demand and rainfall in the first inter‐monsoon. Overall, predicted changes in rainfall by 2050 are anticipated to reduce labour demand by approximately 1,175,000 person‐days per year across Sri Lanka's tea plantation sector. This is likely to have considerable social and welfare implications, particularly for the Indian Tamil women who comprise the majority of the sector's workforce.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adata collection 3aeconomic impact 3alabor force 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aprofit maximization 3arain 3atea 3awomen 3aSri Lanka1 aSmart, James C.

One hundred and eighty substances (44% of the targeted compounds) were quantified in at least one sampling point. These included pharmaceuticals, industrial products, pesticides, their transformation products and other emerging compounds. Fifty-five compounds were quantified in more than 1% of the samples. Both regulated and emerging compounds were found. Among the unregulated compounds, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, perfluorinated compounds, dioxins/furans, tolyltriazole, bisphenol A, triazine transformation products, and caffeine were quantified in more than 10% of the samples analyzed. Concentrations exceeding the threshold of toxicological concern of 0.1μg/L were found for tolyltriazole, bisphenol A and some of the triazine transformation products (DEDIA).

Our results indicate that the presence and quantity of these four bacteria were low on day 1, increased rapidly after day 5, and then peaked during days 10–20. They stabilized from days 20–25 or days 25–30, then dropped to a low level at day 30.

Initial CO2 quota allocations are a matter of significant concern. How should we allocate CO₂ emissions reduction responsibilities among Chinese provinces, assuming that provinces will not or cannot trade these responsibilities among themselves? In this paper, we allocate CO₂ quota from the perspective of cost minimisation. First, we estimate the national CO₂ marginal abatement cost (MAC) function and deduce the interprovincial MAC functions. Second, we build an allocation model with nonlinear programming for cost minimisation. Finally, we obtain the allocation results under the emissions reduction target by 2030. The results are as follows. (i) The national MAC was 134.3 Yuan/t (at the constant price of 1978) in 2011, with an overall upward trend from 1990 to 2011. (ii) The interprovincial MACs differ significantly and decline gradually from east to west. Hebei has the largest emissions reduction quota, and Shandong has the largest emissions quota by 2030. (iii) Compared with other criteria of per capita, gross domestic product (GDP), grandfathering and carbon intensity, the proposed approach is the most cost‐effective in achieving the reduction target, with cost savings of 37.7, 34.5, 47.9 and 33.87 per cent, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agross domestic product 3amarginal abatement cost 3amodels 3aprices 3atrade 3aChina1 aZhu, Bangzhu1 aChevallier, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9109-02051 aXie, Rui0 tAustralian journal of agricultural and resource economics.g2018 July, v. 62, no. 3 p.457-479dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55734x1364-985X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.122613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245009500176520157800271592002801849650002001877650002501897650001501922650002501937650001901962650001501981650001801996653002402014653002502038653001902063653001502082700001802097700001902115773012002134856008802254852000902342655001202351IND60727144820221118114215.0210428e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072714482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1054232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, Abheek10aEvaluating benefits of ecologically-inspired nested architectures for industrial symbiosis  aIndustrial Symbiosis (IS), inspired by the highly effective resource utilization found in nature, advocates byproduct-exchange partnerships between industries to reduce raw material use, emissions, and waste generation while promoting economic growth. Ecological research on mutualistic ecosystems (such as plant-pollinator networks) has found a connection between high values of nestedness, a unique linkage distribution strategy, and effective resource utilization. The present work is the first to test the benefits of nested architectures for IS goals, a characteristic thus far overlooked in bio-inspired IS efforts. A generated large dataset of hypothetical-realistic Industrial Water Networks spanning the entire nestedness domain shows that highly nested designs significantly reduce resource consumption. Circumstances where these savings outweigh any additional infrastructure and operation costs are also shown, highlighting that low to moderate resource abundance and manageable geographical dispersion between participating industries (conditions that commonly generate interest in IS) are particularly favorable for nested architectures. Ecologically-similarly nested IS networks, especially those with highly connected high-throughput industries, are also found to have a reduction in negative impacts during pipeline disruptions. The results provide promising evidence that the principle of nestedness can be a powerful quantitative bio-inspired design guideline for IS, capable of simultaneously addressing environmental, economic, and resiliency concerns.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeconomic development 3aguidelines 3aindustrial symbiosis 3ainfrastructure 3anestedness 3araw materials 0aBio-inspired design 0aEco-industrial parks 0aSustainability 0aResilience1 aBrehm, Colton1 aLayton, Astrid0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2021 Apr., v. 167 p.105423-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1054233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245010100192300001600293500002000309520200100329592002802330650001902358650001102377650001902388650001202407650001902419650000902438650002602447650001302473650001302486650001302499650002302512650002502535650002002560650002002580650002702600650001202627700002002639700002002659700002002679773013002699856010702829852000902936655001202945IND60587508920221118040253.0180102e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058750892DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[0962:CBFAPA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrye, Kristofor R.10aCarbon budgets for a prairie and agroecosystems: effects of land use and interannual variability  ap. 962-979.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMidwestern grasslands have undergone dramatic changes in land use and management practices, but the effects of these changes on terrestrial carbon budgets are poorly understood. This study compared, for five years, the effects of land‐use type on components of the carbon (C) budget (above‐ and belowground net primary production [NPP], C leaching, soil surface CO₂ flux, vegetation and soil C contents, and C export from burning and grain removal) of a restored tallgrass prairie and maize agroecosystems on a silt loam soil. Interannual variation of the C budget was addressed by correlating annual fluctuations of environmental variables and soil properties with C‐budget components. The C losses we estimated, in order of increasing magnitude, were C leaching, grain C removal from the maize agroecosystems, and soil surface CO₂ flux. NPP was significantly greater for N‐fertilized maize (10.4 Mg C·ha⁻¹·yr⁻¹) than unfertilized maize agroecosystems (6.2 Mg C·ha⁻¹·yr⁻¹), and both were significantly greater than restored prairie (2.6 Mg C·ha⁻¹·yr⁻¹). Tillage did not significantly affect NPP in the maize agroecosystems, but both NPP and C loss significantly increased following prescribed burning in the prairie. Soil C content in the top 1.4 m decreased significantly during the 5‐yr study period for the maize agroecosystems, but not for the restored prairie. An estimate of ecosystem C balance (ECB), calculated as the difference between NPP and heterotrophic respiration with consideration of measurement errors, strongly suggested that restored prairies are not immediate C sinks. Estimates of ECB can potentially provide more insight than direct measurements into annual C changes within a system because of smaller errors. Collectively, these data indicate that land‐use type and management strategy have greater and longer term effects on terrestrial ecosystems than the effects of interannual climate variations or long‐term climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acorn 3aenvironmental factors 3aland use 3aleaching 3aprairies 3aprescribed burning 3aprimary productivity 3asilt loam soils 3asoil properties 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atillage1 aGower, Stith T.1 aNorman, John M.1 aBundy, Larry G.0 tEcological applications.g2002 Aug., v. 12, no. 4 p.962-979dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012%5B0962:CBFAPA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245005500162300001400217500001100231520099000242592002801232650002001260650001101280650001401291650001101305650001101316650001801327650001201345650001901357650001901376650001801395700001601413700001801429700001801447700001801465700001801483773011301501856008101614852000901695655001201704IND60596714520221119002539.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059671452DNAL7 a10.1007/s12393-018-9175-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAziz, M.G.10aMaterial Properties and Tableting of Fruit Powders  ap. 66-80.  aReview  aThe tableting of fruit powders is gaining popularity due to conveniences in its use, storage, transportation, and product formulation. Food powders are generally cohesive in nature, and their compressibility is highly correlated with the material properties of the powder. Here, the material properties of fruit powders and their respective compressibilities in relation to powder type, drying technique and their operating parameters, portion of the fruit used to produce the fruit powder, and drying aids are discussed. Among the material properties analyzed, moisture content, water activity, particle density, particle size and shape, and powder surface properties are identified as vital properties that highly influence the tableting behavior of fruit powders. The Kawakita and Lüdde model and Heckel equation are widely studied to describe the compressibility and compactibility of fruit powders. A four-parameter model fits the sigmoidal compression data of food powders well.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompressibility 3adrying 3aequations 3afruits 3amodels 3aparticle size 3apowders 3atransportation 3awater activity 3awater content1 aYusof, Y.A.1 aBlanchard, C.1 aSaifullah, M.1 aFarahnaky, A.1 aScheiling, G.0 tFood engineering reviews.g2018 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.66-80dSpringer USwJournal:J000000072x1866-79107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12393-018-9175-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011400173520168700287592002801974650001602002650002002018650002102038650001502059650001902074650001602093650001402109650001602123650001402139650002402153650001902177650001602196653003602212653001902248653001502267653001602282700002702298700002002325700002402345773009902369856008702468852000902555655001202564IND60760078620221120025625.0220110e20220501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076007862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1318712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlipour, Esmaeel10aElectrochemically activated pencil lead electrode as a sensitive voltammetric sensor to determine gallic acid  aAn electrochemical sensor for the determination of some polyphenolic compounds such as Gallic acid (GA) and Galloyl esters was developed using the activated pencil lead electrode (APLE). At first, a study has been made of the optimum conditions for electrochemical activation of the pencil lead electrode. Potentiodynamic and potentiostatic strategies were investigated for activation of the pencil lead electrode and the results show that the potentiodynamic pretreatment gives better performance toward measurement of the polyphenolic compounds. Electrochemical properties of GA were investigated using chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry; and some thermodynamic and kinetic variables such as α, n α, and D were calculated. Sensitive differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique was applied for the determination of Gallic acid and Galloyl esters in different samples. Enhanced oxidation peak currents of Gallic acid were observed at APLE when compared with non-activated PLE. The calibration graph has two linear ranges of 0.49–24.3 µM and 0.07–0.83 mM, and the obtained limit of detection for S/N = 3 was 0.25 µM. Adsorptive stripping differential pulse voltammetry (AdSDPV) was also conducted to determine Gallic acid and Galloyl esters in sub-micromolar concentration range. Using the AdSDPV method, the limit of detection was improved and calculated to be 5.2 nM. The proposed method was successfully applied for quantification of the total concentration of Gallic acid and Galloyl esters in a variety of real samples such as black and green tea, and mango juice samples, and desirable recovery values indicated the good accuracy of the developed sensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalibration 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afood chemistry 3agallic acid 3agreen tea 3amango juice 3aoxidation 3asensors (equipment) 3athermodynamics 3avoltammetry 0aActivated pencil lead electrode 0aGalloyl esters 0aPolyphenol 0aTea samples1 aMirzae Bolali, Fatemeh1 aNorouzi, Sheida1 aSaadatirad, Afsaneh0 tFood chemistry.g2022 May 01, v. 375 p.131871-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1318713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013700168300002000305520126900325592002801594650001901622650001401641650002301655650002101678650001401699650001301713650001701726650001301743650001601756700001301772700001901785700001301804700001701817700001701834700001601851773010101867856008601968852000902054655001202063IND60577345620221120173612.0170808e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057734562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b031462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jiangping10aStructural Transformation of Diblock Copolymer/Homopolymer Assemblies by Tuning Cylindrical Confinement and Interfacial Interactions  ap. 12354-12361.  aIn this study, we report the controllable structural transformation of block copolymer/homopolymer binary blends in cylindrical nanopores. Polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine)/homopolystyrene (SVP/hPS) nanorods (NRs) can be fabricated by pouring the polymers into an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) channel and isolated by selective removal of the AAO membrane. In this two-dimensional (2D) confinement, SVP self-assembles into NRs with concentric lamellar structure, and the internal structure can be tailored with the addition of hPS. We show that the weight fraction and molecular weight of hPS and the diameter of the channels can significantly affect the internal structure of the NRs. Moreover, mesoporous materials with tunable pore shape, size, and packing style can be prepared by selective solvent swelling of the structured NRs. In addition, these NRs can transform into spherical structures through solvent-absorption annealing, triggering the conversion from 2D to 3D confinement. More importantly, the transformation dynamics can be tuned by varying the preference property of surfactant to the polymers. It is proven that the shape and internal structure of the polymer particles are dominated by the interfacial interactions governed by the surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aannealing 3acomposite polymers 3amolecular weight 3ananopores 3ananorods 3aporous media 3asolvents 3asurfactants1 aWang, Ke1 aLiang, Ruijing1 aYang, Yi1 aZhou, Huamin1 aXie, Xiaolin1 aZhu, Jintao0 tLangmuir.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 31, no. 45 p.12354-12361dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b031463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03928naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001600151245014800167300001600315520252900331592002802860650002602888650002202914650001202936650001902948650001902967650001502986650001103001650001503012650002003027650001403047650002003061650001803081650001103099650002903110650001303139650000903152650001603161650001603177650001503193700002003208700001103228773012303239856008703362852000903449655001203458IND4468204720221122065334.0150810e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446820472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, R.F.10aEcological controls on net ecosystem productivity of a seasonally dry annual grassland under current and future climates: Modelling with ecosys  ap. 189-200.  aNet ecosystem productivity (NEP) of seasonally dry grasslands in Mediterranean climate zones is determined by the duration and intensity of rainy vs. dry seasons. Precipitation in these zones is expected to decline with climate change during the next century, possibly reducing NEP. Ecosystem models used to study climate change impacts on grasslands in these zones need first to simulate effects of soil wetting and drying on the duration and intensity of net C uptake and emission during rainy and dry seasons under current climate. Continuous eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CO₂ and energy exchange provide well constrained tests of such models. In this study, hourly CO₂ and energy exchange from the ecosystem model ecosys were tested against EC measurements recorded over an annual grassland at Vaira Ranch, CA in a Mediterranean climate zone during eight years (2001–2008) with variable rainy seasons. Variation in measured CO₂ and latent heat fluxes was sufficiently well simulated during each year of the study (0.7<R²<0.9) that most of the variation unexplained by the model could be attributed to uncertainty in the measurements. Interannual variation in NEP from the model was also correlated with that from EC measurements (R²=0.75). Annual NEP from both the model and EC were correlated with the duration of net C uptake, but not with the amount of precipitation, during the rainy seasons. Average annual NEP of the grassland modelled from 2001 to 2008 was 29gCm⁻²y⁻¹ with an interannual variation of ±110gCm⁻²y⁻¹ caused by that in the duration of net C uptake. During climate change (SRES A1fi and B1 under HadCM3), changes in modelled NEP were determined by changes in duration and intensity of net C uptake in rainy seasons vs. net C emission in dry seasons. In years with briefer rainy seasons, modelled NEP rose because rates of net C uptake increased with higher temperature and CO₂ concentration, while the duration of net C uptake remained limited by that of the rainy season. However in years with longer rainy seasons, modelled NEP declined because the duration of net C uptake was reduced when warming hastened phenological development and caused maturity of annual plants to be reached before the end of the rainy season. As climate change progressed, declines in annual NEP gradually exceeded rises, causing the small C sink modelled under current climate to be almost completely lost after 90 years under SRES A1fi (2±103gCm⁻²y⁻¹) and B1 (6±95gCm⁻²y⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aannual grasslands 3aannuals 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3adry season 3adrying 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aemissions 3aenergy transfer 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3anet ecosystem production 3aranching 3asoil 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awet season1 aBaldocchi, D.D.1 aMa, S.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 152 p.189-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2011.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014900167520102800316592002801344650000901372650002701381650002501408650003001433650001501463650001601478650002601494650001201520650001101532650001501543653002101558653001901579653000901598653001901607653000801626653002001634700002601654700002201680700002201702700001901724700002101743700002101764700002401785700002101809700001601830700002301846773010901869856008301978852000902061655001202070IND60793276720221118124832.0220920e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079327672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1009432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasson, Andrea10aBeyond the eco-design of case-ready beef packaging: The relationship between food waste and shelf-life as a key element in life cycle assessment  aThis study aims to compare the environmental impact of three food packaging systems (Overwrap: OW, High Oxygen Modified Atmosphere Packaging: MAP and Vacuum Skin: VS) currently used in beef meat market, including the potential waste effect that derives from shorter shelf-life in the inventory and assessment. The Life cycle Assessment method was used, and a “cradle-to-grave” approach was applied for both packaging and meat chains. The functional unit was defined as one unit of packaging containing 500 g of sliced beef. Considering only the packaging life cycle, the OW system has the best environmental performance in most of the environmental impact categories, while considering the potential food waste effects, results showed that the packaging system with the longest shelf-life (VS) represents the best environmental solution. Future eco-design approaches for packaging solutions for food products should consider the ability of reducing potential food waste, as a direct consequence of improved shelf-life.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3adesign for environment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3afood waste 3ainventories 3alife cycle assessment 3amarkets 3aoxygen 3ashelf life 0aCircular economy 0aSustainability 0aMeat 0aFood packaging 0aLCA 0aConsumer habits1 aGiovenzana, Valentina1 aFrigerio, Valeria1 aZambelli, Martina1 aBeghi, Roberto1 aPampuri, Alessia1 aTugnolo, Alessio1 aMerlini, Annachiara1 aColombo, Lorenzo1 aLimbo, Sara1 aGuidetti, Riccardo0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2022 Dec., v. 34 p.100943-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2022.1009433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245012800210300001600338520173500354592002802089650003602117650001302153650001502166650001702181650002202198650002002220650001502240650003502255650001602290650002102306650001102327650002202338650001302360650002402373650001702397650001902414650001802433650001202451650002102463650001602484651001002500700006602510700002202576773014002598856008102738852000902819655001202828IND60596714720221119002237.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059671472DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-018-0761-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirubakaran, Muniraj1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1356-044010aMODFLOW Based Groundwater Budgeting Using GIS: A Case Study from Tirunelveli Taluk, Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu, India  ap. 783-792.  aExtensive use of freshwater resources for day-to-day human consumption will cause alarming situations in environmental water balancing. Groundwater is considered as the primary source for living organism due to limited availability of surface water systems in arid and semi arid regions. An attempt is made in this study, to develop numerical simulation of groundwater flow and quantification of groundwater availability in Tirunelveli taluk using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. The study area lies between eastern longitudes of 77°32′16″ and 77°48′8″ and northern latitudes of 8°40′12″ and 8°56′34″ with a spatial extent of 558.4 sqkm. The initial input parameters of MODFLOW such as boundary conditions and layer properties are prepared from data issued by Public Works Department. The data consists of groundwater level, aquifer property and lithology. Topographic map was received from Survey of India. SRTM DEM was downloaded from USGS web archives and resampled the above data using ArcGIS environment. ModelMuse package of USGS was used to develop the quantitative three dimensional steady and transient state flow model of groundwater system, based on the available hydrological field data. The calibration process of ModelMuse simulated groundwater flow result was carried out using, field based well water level data collected for the study period using ModelMate package. The simulated results have shown the over extraction activity of groundwater resource (103.696 m³) is performed in the study area. This study also demonstrates that integration of Remote Sensing, GIS, traditional fieldwork and mathematical models is a powerful tool in understanding the demand and supply of groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Geological Survey 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3afreshwater 3ageographic information systems 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahumans 3ahydrologic models 3alatitude 3amathematical models 3apublic works 3aremote sensing 3asurface water 3asurveys 3atopographic maps 3awater table 3aIndia1 aColins Johnny, Jesudhas1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0514-21821 aSamson, Sisupalan0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2018 May, v. 46, no. 5 p.783-792dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-018-0761-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245012800202300001800330520142500348592002801773650001101801650002301812650002001835650001701855650001601872650001101888650001901899650001001918650001901928650001401947650001901961650001801980650001901998650000702017650001102024650002602035650001702061650001702078700001402095700001802109700001502127700001802142700001802160700001802178700001802196773013002214856007402344852000902418655001202427IND60621934220221122131237.0181123e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062193422DNAL7 a10.1039/c8bm00575c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhouThese authors contributed equally to this work., Quan10aStabilized calcium phosphate hybrid nanocomposite using a benzoxaborole-containing polymer for pH-responsive siRNA delivery  ap. 3178-3188.  aCalcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles present a class of promising nonviral gene delivery carriers due to their easy-preparation procedure, low toxicity and high transfection efficiency. PEGylated polyanion block copolymer was widely used to control the CaP crystal growth during CaP co-precipitation with therapeutic genes. However, there also exists a competition between the entrapped gene and polyanion in the system, which results in reduced stability and low gene entrapment efficiency. To solve this problem, herein, we demonstrate a non-anion stabilization strategy using a boroxole-containing block polymer, PEG-b-poly(benzoxaborole) (PEG-PBO), which forms pH-responsive boronic ester bonds with ribose rings of siRNA and also excellently adhers to the hydroxyapatite surface of CaP. The PEG-PBO/siRNA/CaP nanocomposites exhibited high siRNA loading efficiency, low cell cytotoxicity and excellent colloidal stability at neutral pH. The nanocomposites easily entered cancer cells mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and transferred into acidic lysosomes, where the boronic esters broke, nanoparticles dissociated, and siRNA released and escaped from lysosomes. PEG-PBO/siRNA/CaP nanocomposites showed significantly higher gene silencing efficacy than lipofectamine 2000/siRNA lipoplex in multiple cancer cells. Thus, PEG-PBO/siRNA/CaP nanocomposites possess potential for safe and effective siRNA delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acomposite polymers 3acoprecipitation 3acytotoxicity 3aendocytosis 3aesters 3agene silencing 3agenes 3ahydroxyapatite 3alysosomes 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3aribose 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 3atransfection1 aWang, Yue1 aXiang, Jiajia1 aPiao, Ying1 aZhou, Zhuxian1 aTang, Jianbin1 aLiu, Xiangrui1 aShen, Youqing0 tBiomaterials science.g2018 Nov. 20, v. 6, no. 12 p.3178-3188dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8bm00575c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001600189245011300205300001600318500002400334500002400358500001500382520090500397650002101302650002201323650004301345650001501388650002001403650001501423650002801438650002201466650002001488650001501508650002501523650001301548650002201561650002501583650002001608650004501628650001701673650001201690650001701702650001301719650002601732650003101758650006001789650001201849650003701861651001301898651002701911653002001938653001801958653001001976700001401986700001702000700001902017700001602036773011602052852000902168856008302177930003302260945002502293946001302318655001202331IND4404392220221119221354.0080414e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440439222DNAL7 a184593162pmid7 a10.1637/7980-040607-Reg2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aQ203 0aD5001 aTrock, S.C.10aEvaluation of Routine Depopulation, Cleaning, and Disinfection Procedures in the Live Bird Markets, New York  ap. 160-162.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-06  aDuring the past years surveillance for avian influenza has been conducted in the live bird markets (LBMs) in New York as well as other states along the east coast. Repeated attempts to eradicate H5 and H7 influenza from the New York markets have focused efforts on the LBMs themselves. Despite repeated mandatory market closures accompanied by cleaning and disinfecting (C/D) procedures, avian influenza virus continued to be isolated. In an effort to assess the adequacy of the C/D procedure, samples were collected in temporal proximity to the depopulation and C/D. Comparison of the pre-C/D (83% virus positive), at C/D approval (1.6% positive) and post-C/D testing (33% positive) indicate that the current procedures of C/D can be effective at eliminating these influenza viruses. However, reinfection via introduction of influenza-virus-positive birds can occur shortly after the market reopens. 3afarmers' markets 3aprotective effect 3asanitary and phytosanitary regulations 3acompliance 3arisk assessment 3apathotypes 3aepidemiological studies 3adisease detection 3adecontamination 3asanitation 3adisease surveillance 3achickens 3aInfluenza A virus 3adisease transmission 3aavian influenza 3asanitation standard operating procedures 3adisinfection 2aAnimals 2aChick Embryo 2aCommerce 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aHousing, Animalxstandards 2aInfluenza in Birdsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aPoultry 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 3aNew York 0aNew Yorkxepidemiology 0adisease control 0abird diseases 0abirds1 aGaeta, M.1 aGonzalez, A.1 aPederson, J.C.1 aSenne, D.A.0 tAvian diseases.g2008 Mar., v. 52, no. 1 p.160-162dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/7980-040607-Reg3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080619b20080704c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/05/26  aOther US 7aarticle02758naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245010600179300001600285520123300301592002801534650001001562650001901572650002201591650002101613650001201634650001801646650002501664650001101689650001301700650001501713650002401728650001301752653001901765653002201784653001501806653001601821653002401837653001601861653003301877653001901910700002101929700003301950700002001983700002002003700002002023773010102043856008702144852000902231655001202240IND60545697620221117184034.0160902e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054569762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaceda-Veiga, Alberto10aInside the Redbox: Applications of haematology in wildlife monitoring and ecosystem health assessment  ap. 322-332.  aBlood analyses have great potential in studies of ecology, ecotoxicology and veterinary science in wild vertebrates based on advances in human and domestic animal medicine. The major caveat for field researchers, however, is that the ‘rules’ for human or domestic animal haematology do not always apply to wildlife. The present overview shows the strengths and limitations of blood analyses in wild vertebrates, and proposes a standardisation of pre-analytical procedures plus some suggestions for a more systematic examination of blood smears to increase the diagnostic value of blood data. By discussing the common problems that field researchers face with blood variables, we also aim to highlight common ground enabling new researchers in the field to accurately collect blood samples and interpret and place their haematological findings into the overall picture of an ecological or eco-toxicological study. Besides showing the practicality and ecological relevance of simple blood variables, this study illustrates the suitability of blood samples for the application of cutting-edge analytical procedures for expanding the current repertoire of diagnostic tools in wildlife monitoring and ecosystem health assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3adisease diagnosis 3adomestic animals 3aecology 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental health 3ahumans 3amedicine 3amonitoring 3aveterinary medicine 3awildlife 0aBio-monitoring 0aWildlife diseases 0aBiomarkers 0aVertebrates 0aPlasma biochemistry 0aBlood smear 0aDifferential leukocyte count 0aAnimal welfare1 aFiguerola, Jordi1 aMartínez Silvestre, Albert,1 aViscor, Ginés,1 aFerrari, Nicola1 aPacheco, Mario,0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 May 01, v. 514 p.322-332dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008900156300001800245520105600263592002801319650001501347650001201362650001501374650001501389650001501404650001701419650001401436650001601450650001801466650000701484700001401491700003601505700002801541700002101569773011001590856007501700852000901775655001201784IND60529185020221118093729.0160717e20120417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052918502DNAL7 a10.1021/ac300392k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Zhange10aAdsorption of Cd2+ on Carboxyl-Terminated Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles  ap. 3764-3770.  aThe affinity of Cd²⁺ toward carboxyl-terminated species covalently bound to monodisperse superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, Fe₃O₄(np)-COOH, was investigated in situ in aqueous electrolytes using rotating disk electrode techniques. Strong evidence that the presence of dispersed Fe₃O₄(np)-COOH does not affect the diffusion limiting currents was obtained using negatively and positively charged redox active species in buffered aqueous media (pH = 7) devoid of Cd²⁺. This finding made it possible to determine the concentration of unbound Cd²⁺ in solutions containing dispersed Fe₃O₄(np)-COOH, 8 and 17 nm in diameter, directly from the Levich equation. The results obtained yielded Cd²⁺ adsorption efficiencies of ∼20 μg of Cd/mg of Fe₃O₄(np)-COOH, which are among the highest reported in the literature employing ex situ methods. Desorption of Cd²⁺ from Fe₃O₄(np)-COOH, as monitored by the same forced convection method, could be accomplished by lowering the pH, a process found to be highly reversible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium 3aconvection 3adesorption 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aequations 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3apH1 aZhu, Shun1 aMartins de Godoi, Denis Ricardo1 aSamia, Anna Cristina S.1 aScherson, Daniel0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Apr. 17, v. 84, no. 8 p.3764-3770dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac300392k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009300174300001600267500001500283520095600298592002801254650002001282650002501302650001201327650001401339650001101353650001501364650000701379650001001386650001601396650002001412650001601432653001801448700002401466700002301490700002001513700002701533773013401560856005501694852000901749655001201758IND4468045220221122011900.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446804522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02857.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamerski, Fabiane10aAssessment of variables effects on sugar cane juice clarification by carbonation process  ap. 422-428.  a2019-12-06  aThis paper reports a study of sugar cane juice carbonation and the evaluation of variables effects such as pH, carbonation time and temperature on industrially relevant parameters for the quality of sugar cane juice. Three different batches of sugar cane juice were evaluated using a complete two‐level factorial design with central point performed in triplicate. From results in this work, it can be seen that the higher sucrose concentrations and lower percentage of total soluble solids and reducing sugars were obtained in clarified juices with the maximum values for pH, time and reaction temperature (9.5, 60 min and 80 °C). The temperature favoured the removal of starch, phosphate and turbidity. Colour removal reached a maximum of 88–93% among the batches. The optimum clarification condition using carbonation procedure can be achieved between 20 and 40 min, at pH values between 8.0 and 9.5 and temperature condition at 80 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3areducing sugars 3atotal soluble solids 3asucrose 3aturbidity 3astarch 3aphosphates 3apH 3acolor 3acarbonation 3asugarcane juice 3atemperature 0aclarification1 ada Silva, Vítor R.1 aCorazza, Marcos L.1 aNdiaye, Papa M.1 ade Aquino, Arislete D.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2012 Feb., v. 47, no. 2 p.422-428dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02857.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04974naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245010000174520223800274592002802512650001202540650001902552650001502571650001402586650001302600650002102613650001802634650002202652650001402674650002202688650002702710650001402737650002302751650001702774650001902791650001802810650001502828651001902843653002702862653003102889653003602920653001302956653002102969653002302990653002303013653002603036653002803062653002903090653004003119653002903159653002903188700001903217700002103236700002103257700002103278700001903299700001703318700001803335700002103353700001803374700002003392700002003412700002303432700002203455700003003477700002003507700002003527700001703547700001103564700002103575700001903596700002003615700002003635700002303655700001803678700001803696700001803714700002003732700001803752700001903770700002703789773012303816856008803939852000904027655001204036IND60745163520221119171220.0210820e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074516352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.1096352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHood, Raleigh R.14aThe Chesapeake Bay program modeling system: Overview and recommendations for future development  aThe Chesapeake Bay is the largest, most productive, and most biologically diverse estuary in the continental United States providing crucial habitat and natural resources for culturally and economically important species. Pressures from human population growth and associated development and agricultural intensification have led to excessive nutrient and sediment inputs entering the Bay, negatively affecting the health of the Bay ecosystem and the economic services it provides. The Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) is a unique program formally created in 1983 as a multi-stakeholder partnership to guide and foster restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. Since its inception, the CBP Partnership has been developing, updating, and applying a complex linked modeling system of watershed, airshed, and estuary models as a planning tool to inform strategic management decisions and Bay restoration efforts. This paper provides a description of the 2017 CBP Modeling System and the higher trophic level models developed by the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office, along with specific recommendations that emerged from a 2018 workshop designed to inform future model development. Recommendations highlight the need for simulation of watershed inputs, conditions, processes, and practices at higher resolution to provide improved information to guide local nutrient and sediment management plans. More explicit and extensive modeling of connectivity between watershed landforms and estuary sub-areas, estuarine hydrodynamics, watershed and estuarine water quality, the estuarine-watershed socioecological system, and living resources will be important to broaden and improve characterization of responses to targeted nutrient and sediment load reductions. Finally, the value and importance of maintaining effective collaborations among jurisdictional managers, scientists, modelers, support staff, and stakeholder communities is emphasized. An open collaborative and transparent process has been a key element of successes to date and is vitally important as the CBP Partnership moves forward with modeling system improvements that help stakeholders evolve new knowledge, improve management strategies, and better communicate outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aairshed 3abrackish water 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3ahuman population 3ahydrodynamics 3aintensive farming 3alandforms 3apopulation growth 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3asocial environment 3astakeholders 3atrophic levels 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChesapeake Bay 0aChesapeake bay program 0aNOAA Chesapeake Bay office 0aEnvironmental protection agency 0aModeling 0aAirshed modeling 0aWatershed modeling 0aEstuarine modeling 0aHydrodynamic modeling 0aBiogeochemical Modeling 0aLiving Resource Modeling 0aChesapeake Assessment Scenario Tool 0aTotal Maximum Daily Load 0aChesapeake Bay Agreement1 aShenk, Gary W.1 aDixon, Rachel L.1 aSmith, Sean M.C.1 aBall, William P.1 aBash, Jesse O.1 aBatiuk, Rich1 aBoomer, Kathy1 aBrady, Damian C.1 aCerco, C.

Results showed that the gel strength, compression fracture stress and storage modulus of the double crosslinked gelatin hydrogels all reached the largest value when the concentration of TGase was 20 U/g gelatin. The double crosslinked gelatin hydrogels were also thermally stable due to the existence of the covalent crosslinks. The effect of TGase concentration on the physical properties and microstructure of the double crosslinked hydrogels were analyzed, and the differences between double crosslinked gelatin hydrogels and gelatin hydrogels single crosslinked by TGase or carrageenan were also systematically compared. This article is of great significance for expanding the application of natural polymer-based hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3afish 3afood chemistry 3agel strength 3agelatin 3ahydrogels 3amechanical stress 3amicrostructure 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3astorage modulus 3athermal stability 0aFish gelatin 0aκ-Carrageenan 0aTransglutaminase 0aDouble crosslink1 aWu, Di1 aMa, Wuchao1 aWu, Chao1 aLiu, Jia1 aDu, Ming0 tFood chemistry.g2022 May 15, v. 376 p.131873-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1318733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04275naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245021000175520225300385592002802638650002502666650002002691650002402711650002502735650001702760650001302777650001502790650001302805650000902818650002002827650000902847650001702856650001002873650001102883650001202894650002702906650002302933650002002956650002202976650001802998650001903016650001803035650001303053650002003066650001303086650001403099650002103113650001203134650001803146650002003164650002503184653001703209653001103226653001403237653001003251653000903261700003203270700003403302700003403336700002103370773009903391856009003490852000903580655001203589IND60678266820221117185356.0200210e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067826682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7348332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazelan, Zohreh10aEffects of dietary ginger (Zingiber officinale) administration on growth performance and stress, immunological, and antioxidant responses of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) reared under high stocking density  aIn the present study, the effects of ginger (Zingiber officinale) on stress, antioxidant, humoral immune and cytokine responses of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) under high stocking density were investigated. The fish were assigned into four experimental groups: LD (the fish reared at 10 g L⁻¹ and fed with the control diet), HD (the fish reared at 20 g L⁻¹ and fed with the control diet), HD-5 (the fish reared at 20 g L⁻¹ and fed with the control diet supplemented with 5 g kg⁻¹ ginger), and HD-10 (the fish reared at 20 g L⁻¹ and fed with the control diet supplemented with 10 g kg⁻¹ ginger). After 60 days of rearing, the fish at the HD treatment exhibited significantly lower growth performance compared to the LD treatment, but the fish fed the diet supplemented with 10 g kg⁻¹ (HD-10) showed growth performance comparable to the LD treatment. Under high stocking density, the fish had significantly higher cortisol and glucose levels, but ginger mitigated the stress responses. Plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase exhibited higher activities in HD, HD-5, and HD-10 treatments compared to the LD treatment. However, plasma catalase activity increased only in HD treatment. The increase in stocking density significantly increased plasma malondialdehyde levels, and ginger treatments significantly mitigated such increases. The fish at the HD treatment had significantly lower plasma lysozyme, complement and bactericidal (against Aeromonas hydrophila) activities and total immunoglobulin levels compared to those at the LD treatment; however, the dietary ginger administration inhibited these effects especially with fish fed 10 g ginger per kg diet. The fish at the HD treatment had significantly lower expression of tumor necrosis alpha (tnfa), interleukin 1 beta (il1b), and interleukin 8 (il8), and higher interleukin 10 (il10) genes. Ginger treatment, particularly at 10 g kg⁻¹ level significantly mitigated the effects of high stocking density on the cytokines. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that ginger treatment at 10 g kg⁻¹ level is beneficial to suppress stress, oxidative stress, and immunosuppression caused by high stocking density in common carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aCyprinus carpio 3aZingiber officinale 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3acomplement 3acortisol 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3afish feeding 3agenes 3aginger 3aglucose 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3aimmunoglobulins 3aimmunosuppression 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-8 3alysozyme 3amalondialdehyde 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aoxidative stress 3arearing 3astocking rate 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aPhytotherapy 0aHealth 0aNutrition 0aBlood 0aGene1 aVatnikov, Yury Anatolyevich1 aKulikov, Evgeny Vladimirovich1 aPlushikov, Vadim Gennadievich1 aYousefi, Morteza0 tAquaculture.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 518 p.734833-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7348333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300002000285520069900305592002801004650002101032650001601053650001101069650001301080650001501093650001001108650002501118700001801143700002201161700002301183773010101206856008601307852000901393655001201402IND60577345920180109000000.0170808e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057734592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b032082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuezhou10aTwisting Carbon Nanotube Ropes with the Mesoscopic Distinct Element Method: Geometry, Packing, and Nanomechanics  ap. 12323-12327.  aThe geometry and internal packing of twisted ropes composed of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered, and a numerical solution in the context of the mesoscopic distinct element method (MDEM) is proposed. Compared to the state of the art, MDEM accounts in a computationally tractable manner for both the deformation of the fiber and the distributed van der Waals cohesive energy between fibers. These features enable us to investigate the torsional response in a new regime where the twisted rope develops packing rearrangements and aspect-ratio-dependent geometric nonlinearities. MDEM emerges as a robust simulation method for studying twisted agglomerates comprising semiflexible nanofibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3adeformation 3aenergy 3ageometry 3ananofibers 3aropes 3avan der Waals forces1 aOstanin, Igor1 aGaidău, Cristian1 aDumitrica, Traian,0 tLangmuir.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 31, no. 45 p.12323-12327dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.5b032083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014400164300001300308520127000321592002801591650001101619650001301630650001601643650001901659650001301678650001901691650001501710700001301725700001801738773010401756856008101860852000901941655001201950IND60523796020221120181715.0160626e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052379602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-015-0123-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorst, T.

The wind-tunnel measurements are complimentary to the field measurements, and the dependence of the wind-tunnel mean-wind-component flow-distortion errors on wind direction agrees well with that of the field measurements. The field measurements exhibit significant overestimation of the crosswind variance and underestimation of the momentum flux with respect to an adjacent CSAT3 sonic, as well as a transfer of turbulent kinetic energy from the streamwise wind component to the cross-stream wind components. In contrast, we find attenuation of only a few percent in the vertical velocity variance and the vertical flux of sonic temperature. The attenuation of the fluxes appears to be caused to a large extent by decorrelation between the horizontal and vertical-velocity components and between the vertical velocity and sonic temperature. Additional flow distortion due to transducer shadowing reduces to some extent the overestimation, but also increases the underestimation of the IRGASON turbulence statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amomentum 3atemperature 3aturbulent flow 3avariance 3awind direction 3awind speed1 aVogt, R.1 aOncley, S.

In this study, we fabricated RUNX2, SOX9, and C/EBPα plasmid DNAs (pDNAs) and ATF4-targeting shRNA (shATF4) to induce osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The pDNAs and shATF4 were complexed with TRITC-gene regulation nanoparticles (GRN). Osteogenesis-related gene expression was reduced at early (12 h) and late (36 h) time points after co-delivery of shATF4 and SOX9 or C/EBPα pDNA, respectively, and osteogenesis was inhibited in these hMSCs. By contrast, osteogenesis-related genes were highly expressed upon co-delivery of RUNX2 and ATF4 pDNAs. DEX in GRN enhanced chondrogenic differentiation. Expression of osteogenesis-, chondrogenesis-, and adipogenesis-related genes was higher in hMSCs transfected with NPs complexed with RUNX2 and ATF4 pDNAs, shATF4 and SOX9 pDNA, and shATF4 and C/EBPα pDNA for 72 h than in control hMSCs, respectively. Moreover, delivery of these NPs also increased expression of osteogenesis-, chondrogenesis-, and adipogenesis-related proteins. These alterations in expression led to morphological changes, indicating that hMSCs differentiated into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipose cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3achondrocytes 3achondrogenesis 3agenes 3ahumans 3aosteoblasts 3aplasmids 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atransfection 0apDNA 0ashRNA 0aMulti-lineage 0aMSC 0aGene regulation nanoparticles1 aYi, Se Won1 aOh, Hyun Jyung1 aLee, Jung Sun1 aPark, Ji Sun1 aPark, Keun-Hong0 tBiomaterials.g2018 Sept., v. 177 p.1-13dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.05.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005400146245008000200300001800280520107600298592002801374650001501402650001701417650001801434650001901452650001601471700005301487700001701540700005401557773017001611856008001781852000901861655001201870IND60630239020221118175111.0190206e20181231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063023902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b048532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1023-957110aNovel Robust Least-Squares Estimator for Linear Dynamic Data Reconciliation  ap. 2071-2083.  aDynamic data reconciliation (DDR) is used to reduce the uncertainties in process measurement. Conventional data reconciliation theories and methods are based on least-squares estimation, whose conditions are hard to meet in real-world applications. Since least-squares estimators can be made robust by equivalent weight, many works concentrated on robust estimators and their performance in data reconciliation. However, robust least-squares algorithm is still unable to detect gross errors in low-redundancy variables. In this article, our work takes a step further in improving the robustness of the Huber estimator by taking structural redundancy into consideration. Modifications on influence function and weight function are made by involving local redundancy and rejection interval. The detectivity of gross error in low-redundant variables is increased. Combined with the above improvement and then taking advantage of online filtering, a novel robust dynamic data reconciliation algorithm is proposed. Case studies demonstrate the superiority of this methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aleast squares 3aprocess design 3auncertainty1 aZhang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0249-05471 aFeng, Yiping1 aRong, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6779-29680 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 Dec. 31, v. 58, no. 5 p.2071-2083dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b048533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245010200129300001800231520187900249592002802128650002302156650002002179650003702199650001802236650003002254650001002284650001602294650001402310650002002324650002602344650001102370650001702381650001402398650001602412650001602428650001902444650001602463650001802479650001902497650001002516650000902526650002002535650001102555650002402566650001002590651001002600653001302610653001302623653001502636653001902651700001502670700001602685773015402701852000902855655001202864IND60706456020221121235933.0200807e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070645602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagar, G.

Chickpea wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceri is one of the most important disease in India. Yield losses vary between 10 to 100% depending on varietal susceptibility and agroclimatic conditions. Considering, the importance of disease the present study was undertaken during, Rabi 2010–11. Pot culture experiment conducted at Department of Plant Pathology, College of Agriculture, Latur and field experiment was conducted in wilt sick plot at ARS Badnapur to asses fungicidal seed treatment on wilt incidence. Results revealed that all fungicidal applied as seed treatment, significantly reduced the wilt incidence in chick pea. However, Propiconazole (25% EC) was found most effective with significantly least wilt incidence (2.00%), followed by Penconazole (3.53%), Thiophenate methyl (3.66%), Hexaconazole (4.37%); while Kasugumycin was found least effective with highest (76.54%) wilt incidence. Test pathogen inoculated soil using chickpea cv. JG-62 to evaluate the effect of different seed treatments wilt disease. Result revealed of pot culture experiment that seed treatment with Carbendazim + Thiram was most superior with least wilt incidence (16.63%), highest wilt control (80.49%), vigour index (1410.7) and dry matter (20.95g), followed by Carbendazim + SAAF, with wilt incidence of 17.43 per cent and wilt control of 79.80 per cent, over untreated control (86.56% wilt incidence).

The Brucella reservoir associated with livestock brucellosis poses a significant threat to public health, and awareness of the seroprevalence and spatial distribution of livestock brucellosis is valuable for the prevention and control of diseases caused by Brucella, especially human brucellosis. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle in China. We retrieved 88 studies related to the seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle in China in which samples were harvested between 2008 and 2018. The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that the overall seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle herds in China was 1.9% during the selected period, rising from 1.6% in 2008–2012 to 2.6% in 2013–2018. In Northern China, where the traditional agropastoral areas with more developed animal breeding industry are located, the brucellosis seroprevalence was >10%. In contrast, the seroprevalence of brucellosis in Southern China reached only 5.5%. At the provincial level, the highest brucellosis seroprevalence in dairy cattle was estimated at >30% in Jilin province, followed by Shanxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou, each with a prevalence of 10–20%. Additionally, the seroprevalence of brucellosis in some local areas was >30% or even >50%, indicating that Brucella infection was highly endemic in dairy herds in China. Our data may facilitate the prevention and control of brucellosis in domestic animals in China. Further epidemiological surveillance and the administration of a comprehensive monitoring program to determine the risk factors associated with brucellosis incidence in humans and domestic animals are recommended to refine brucellosis control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucella 3aanimal breeding 3abrucellosis 3adairy cattle 3adairy herds 3adisease control 3ahumans 3aindustry 3ameta-analysis 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3asystematic review 3azoonoses 3aChina 0aBrucellosis 0aPrevalence 0aSystematic review 0aMeta-analysis 0aChina 0aDairy cattle1 aCheng, Jiajia1 aWang, Miaomiao1 aChen, Xiaohong1 aWang, Haoxian1 aGe, Yu1 aNi, Hongbo1 aZhang, Xiao-Xuan1 aWen, Xiaobo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7302-15960 tActa tropica.g2019 Jan., v. 189 p.117-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03562naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245013400201500001100335520159800346592002801944596008101972596004702053650001402100650002002114650002402134650002502158650001802183650002302201650000902224650001202233650000902245650002202254650001702276650002402293650002302317700005802340700002802398700006002426700006202486700005702548700001702605700005502622700002002677700005702697700002102754700005702775773011702832856007402949852000903023655001203032IND60779651020221120191103.0220613e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077965102DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.134492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeslehurst, Nicola1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8656-231910aAssociation between maternal adiposity measures and adverse maternal outcomes of pregnancy: Systematic review and meta‐analysis  aREVIEW  aMaternal obesity increases pregnancy‐related risks. Women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m² are considered to be at risk and should receive additional care, although approximately half will have uncomplicated pregnancies. This systematic review aimed to identify early pregnancy measures of adiposity associated with adverse maternal health outcomes. Searches included six databases, reference lists, citations, and contacting authors. Screening and quality assessment were carried out by two authors independently. Random effects meta‐analysis and narrative synthesis were conducted. Seventy studies were included with a pooled sample of 89,588 women. Meta‐analysis showed significantly increased odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with higher waist circumference (WC) categories (1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.88) and per unit increase in WC (1.31, 95% CI 1.03, 1.67). Women with GDM had higher WC than controls (mean difference [MD] 6.18 cm, 95% CI 3.92, 8.44). WC was significantly associated with hypertensive disorders, delivery‐related outcomes, metabolic syndrome, and composite pregnancy outcomes. Waist to hip ratio was significantly associated with GDM, hypertensive disorders, and delivery‐related outcomes. Fat mass, neck circumference, skinfolds, and visceral fat were significantly associated with adverse outcomes, although limited data were available. Our findings identify the need to explore how useful adiposity measures are at predicting risk in pregnancy, compared with BMI, to direct care to women with the greatest need.  aPublisher supplied data  aNIHR200173cNIHR Applied Research Collaboration North East and North Cumbria  aCDF‐2019‐11‐ST2‐0011cNIHR Academy 3aadiposity 3abody mass index 3aconfidence interval 3agestational diabetes 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolic syndrome 3aneck 3aobesity 3arisk 3asystematic review 3avisceral fat 3awaist circumference 3awaist-to-hip ratio1 aNgongalah, Lem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6920-76221 aBigirumurame, Theophile1 aNguyễn, Giang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9536-04921 aOdeniyi, Adefisayo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1834-26961 aFlynn, Angela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8438-15061 aSmith, Vikki1 aCrowe, Lisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9814-21241 aSkidmore, Becky1 aGaudet, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7527-53541 aSimon, Alexandre1 aHayes, Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6442-41500 tObesity reviews.g2022 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.e13449-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949851x1467-78817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.134493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245017800158300002000336520169700356592002802053650001502081650001502096650002002111650001702131650001202148650001902160650002202179650001902201650002802220650001902248650001702267700002002284700001302304700001702317700001502334700001202349700001402361700001602375773013402391856007502525852000902600655001202609IND60538892520221118030113.0160815e20130717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053889252DNAL7 a10.1021/ja405170j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Caishun10aIntramolecular RET Enhanced Visible Light-Absorbing Bodipy Organic Triplet Photosensitizers and Application in Photooxidation and Triplet–Triplet Annihilation Upconversion  ap. 10566-10578.  aResonance energy transfer (RET) was used for the first time to enhance the visible light absorption of triplet photosensitizers. The intramolecular energy donor (boron-dipyrromethene, Bodipy) and acceptor (iodo-Bodipy) show different absorption bands in visible region, thus the visible absorption was enhanced as compared to the monochromophore triplet photosensitizers (e.g., iodo-Bodipy). Fluorescence quenching and excitation spectra indicate that the singlet energy transfer is efficient for the dyad triplet photosensitizers. Nanosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy has confirmed that the triplet excited states of the dyads are distributed on both the energy donor and acceptor, which is the result of forward singlet energy transfer from the energy donor to the energy acceptor and in turn the backward triplet energy transfer. This ‘ping-pong’ energy transfer was never reported for organic molecular arrays, and so it is useful to study the energy level of organic chromophores. The triplet photosensitizers were used for singlet oxygen (¹O₂) mediated photooxidation of 1,5-dihydroxylnaphthalene to produce juglone. The visible light absorption of the new visible light-absorbing triplet photosensitizers are higher than the conventional monochromophore based triplet photosensitizers, as a result, the ¹O₂ photosensitizing ability is improved with the new triplet photosensitizers. Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion with these triplet photosensitizers was also studied. Our results are useful to design the triplet photosensitizers showing strong visible light absorbance and for their applications in photocatalysis and photodynamic therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ajuglone 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotooxidation 3aphotosensitizing agents 3asinglet oxygen 3aspectroscopy1 aZhao, Jianzhang1 aWu, Shuo1 aWang, Zilong1 aWu, Wanhua1 aMa, Jie1 aGuo, Song1 aHuang, Ling0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 July 17, v. 135, no. 28 p.10566-10578dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja405170j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245012300155300001800278520153500296592002801831650001401859650001501873650001301888650001401901650001001915650002001925650001901945650002101964650001501985650001602000650001002016650001802026650002402044653001902068653000902087653003502096700002302131700002202154700002202176700001902198700003102217773013202248856007102380852000902451655001202460IND60663027720221117235823.0190909s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066302772DNAL7 a10.1071/RD183562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaini, Monika10aIsolation and culture of epithelial cells from stored buffalo semen and their use for the production of cloned embryos  ap. 1581-1588.  aThe aim of the present study was to isolate somatic cells from semen, a non-invasive source of donor somatic cells, for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) experiments. The study had two parts: (1) isolation and culture of somatic cells from semen, which was stored at 4°C; and (2) investigating the SCNT competence of semen-derived somatic cells. We successfully cultured somatic cells from freshly ejaculated semen, which was stored for different times (0, 4, 12, 24, 72 and 144h after semen collection) at 4°C, using a Percoll gradient method. Up to 24h storage, 100% cell attachment rates were observed; cell attachment rates of 66% were observed for the 72 and 144h storage groups. The attached cells observed in all groups examined were proliferated (100%). Cultured cells exhibited epithelial cell morphology and culture characteristics, which was further confirmed by positive expression of cytokeratin 18, an epithelial cell-type marker. We compared the SCNT competence of semen-derived epithelial cells and skin-derived fibroblasts. The cleavage rate, blastocyst production rate, total number of cells in blastocysts and the apoptotic index of blastocysts were similar for embryos produced from semen-derived epithelial cells and skin-derived fibroblasts, indicating that semen-derived epithelial cells can serve as donors for SCNT experiments. In conclusion, we demonstrate a method to culture epithelial cells from stored semen, which can be used to produce cloned embryos of breeding bulls, including remote bulls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablastocyst 3abreeding 3abuffaloes 3abulls 3acell structures 3acultured cells 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afibroblasts 3asemen 3asomatic cells 3astorage temperature 0abreeding bulls 0aSCNT 0asemen-derived epithelial cells1 aSelokar, Naresh L.1 aRajendran, Rasika1 aKumar, Dharmendra1 aKumar, Pradeep1 aYadav, P.

Observations reveal that during pollution episodes in autumn, fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) concentrations have not decreased, and particularly, ozone (O₃) concentrations have increased remarkably from 2013 to 2015 in Beijing. Additionally, a concurrence of O₃ and particulate pollution with high secondary aerosol contributions has been observed frequently, indicating high atmospheric oxidizing capacity (AOC) during particulate pollution. The WRF-Chem model simulations show elevated O₃ concentrations and high fractions of oxygenated secondary aerosols (OSA) in PM₂.₅ (0.53–0.73) during the severe pollution period. During daytime there exhibits an AOC-sufficient regime with the persistently high OSA fraction and an AOC-deficient regime with varied OSA fractions, separated by the O₃ level of 80 μg m⁻³.

Samples were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS in positive and negative mode using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) and a relatively new software (MS-DIAL) was employed for the processing of the data which includes detection of peaks, MS/MS spectra deconvolution, identification of detected lipids and alignment of peaks through the analyzed samples.The studied performance parameters such as precision, recoveries of isotopically labeled internal standards and endogenous lipids, number of extracted lipids, and complexity of employed procedure showed that extraction with IPA:H₂O 90:10 v/v performs similar to the Matyash protocol and better than Bligh & Dyer as well as IPA:H₂O 75:25 v/v. However, less complex monophasic protocol which is simpler to implement and can be executed in plastic rather than glass, make the monophasic IPA:H₂O 90:10 v/v protocol an excellent alternative to the classical biphasic protocols for reversed phase LC-MS lipidomics studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acomputer software 3aglass 3ahuman cell lines 3aisotope labeling 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aExtraction 0aLipidomics 0aMass spectrometry 0aData-independent acquisition 0aHela cells 0aLipid profiling1 aSanwald, Corinna1 aSchlotterbeck, Jörg1 aDrotleff, Bernhard1 aLämmerhofer, Michael,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1318-09740 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2019 Feb. 07, v. 1048 p.66-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11651x0003-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2018.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006000187245014600247300001800393506007600411520087800487592002801365506003701393650001901430650001301449650003001462650002101492650001701513650001301530650001601543650001901559700002701578700002301605700002201628700002001650700003001670700006501700700002101765700006201786773017001848856008002018852000902098655001202107IND60630239220221207141120.0190206e20190114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063023922DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b049442doi7 aPMC63696472pmcid7 a307741932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamdin, Mahinder1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8476-703510aHigh Pressure Electrochemical Reduction of CO₂ to Formic Acid/Formate: A Comparison between Bipolar Membranes and Cation Exchange Membranes  ap. 1834-1847.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA high pressure semicontinuous batch electrolyzer is used to convert CO₂ to formic acid/formate on a tin-based cathode using bipolar membranes (BPMs) and cation exchange membranes (CEMs). The effects of CO₂ pressure up to 50 bar, electrolyte concentration, flow rate, cell potential, and the two types of membranes on the current density (CD) and Faraday efficiency (FE) for formic acid/formate are investigated. Increasing the CO₂ pressure yields a high FE up to 90% at a cell potential of 3.5 V and a CD of ∼30 mA/cm². The FE decreases significantly at higher cell potentials and current densities, and lower pressures. Up to 2 wt % formate was produced at a cell potential of 4 V, a CD of ∼100 mA/cm², and a FE of 65%. The advantages and disadvantages of using BPMs and CEMs in electrochemical cells for CO₂ conversion to formic acid/formate are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3acathodes 3acation-exchange membranes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aformates 3aformic acid 3aprocess design1 aMorrison, Andrew R.

These onions are stored for longer periods till demand in domestic and export markets increases. To suggest the best storage practice the crop's respiration rate needs to be found. Closed system type experimentation was conducted for CO-3 variety of small onions to predict the change in concentration of gases inside the bottles during storage. The change in concentration of gas is found to follow the exponential decay function for O₂ consumption and exponential growth function for CO₂ evolution. The predictive modelling is done using the software Origin Pro V 8.0724. The respiration rate of O₂ are 0.052±0.03, 0.196±0.07, 0.416±0.03, 4.862±0.31 and 5.691±0.41 ml kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40ºC respectively. The respiration rate of CO₂ are 0.042±0.38, 0.165±0.05, 0.3814±0.07, 4.759±0.24, 5.62±0.47 ml kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ at 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40ºC, respectively. The respiration quotient of the CO-3 small onions ranges between 0.81 ± 0.06 to 0.99 ± 0.12 and it increases with increase in temperature. A simple program was developed for calculating the respiration rate by SAS 9.1.3 which will calculate the respiration rate in fraction of seconds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa var. aggregatum 3abottles 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acell respiration 3acomputer software 3aexports 3agases 3amarkets 3amodels 3aonions 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3atemperature 0aSmall onion 0arespiration rate 0aclosed system 0apredictive modelling1 aSinija, V.

It can cause hepatic injury and lead to multiple organs dysfunction to its addicts. Only a few reports exist on the metabolic changes and mechanisms in the liver of heroin-addicted mice with hepatic injury.Twelve adult male Kunming mice (30–40 g) were divided into two groups randomly. The mice in the heroin-addicted group were injected subcutaneously in the first ten days with an increased dosage of heroin from 10 mg/kg to 55 mg/kg. The dosage was then stabilized at 55 mg/kg for three days. The control group was injected with the same amount of saline in the same manner. The hepatic injury was confirmed through the combination of histopathological observation and aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determination. The withdrawal symptoms were recorded and used for assessment of heroin addiction. Eventually, liver metabolic biomarkers of heroin-addicted mice with hepatotoxicity were measured using UHPLC-MS/MS.Biochemical analysis and histopathological observation showed that heroin-addicted mice had a liver injury. The liver metabolites of heroin-addicted mice changed significantly. Metabonomics analysis revealed 41 metabolites in the liver of addicted heroin mice as biomarkers involving 34 metabolic pathways. Among them, glutathione metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, vitamin B2 metabolism, riboflavin metabolism, and single-carbon metabolism pathways were markedly dispruted.Heroin damages the liver and disrupts the liver's metabolic pathways. Glutathione, taurine, riboflavin, 4-pyridoxate, folic acid, and methionine are important metabolic biomarkers, which may be key targets of heroin-induced liver damage. Thus, this study provides an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of heroin-induced hepatotoxicity and potential biomarkers of liver damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalanine transaminase 3abiomarkers 3afolic acid 3aglutathione 3ahepatotoxicity 3aheroin 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3amales 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amethionine 3aphenotype 3ariboflavin 3ataurine 0aUHPLC-MS/MS 0aMetabolite 0aBiomarker1 aLi, Jieyan1 aCao, Haijie1 aWang, Qiuhong1 aZhou, Zhengzheng1 aZhao, Hu1 aKuang, Haixue0 tLife sciences.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 287 p.120103-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2021.1201033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002000133245009100153300001600244300003000260520108200290650002301372650001201395650002301407650002301430650001001453650001601463650001801479650002201497650001101519650001101530650000901541650001601550650002501566650003401591650004101625650004401666650002501710700001701735700001701752773009601769852001301865939003301878945000801911946001301919852000901932655001201941991631183580742620221118104556.0870917e198612  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870018422DNAL7 a30980832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDickerson, R.N.10aNet protein anabolism with hypocaloric parenteral nutrition in obese stressed patients  ap. 747-755.  ap. 747-755. ill., charts.  aExtract: Thirteen obese patients requiring parenteral nutrition for postoperative complications were studied prospectively to evaluate the efficacy of hypocaloric, high-protein parenteral feeding. Nonprotein caloric intake averaged 881 kcal/d or 51.5% of the patients' measured resting energy expenditure. Protein intake averaged 2.13 +/- 0.59 g/kg IBW. Serum albumin and TIBC increased significantly (2.8 +/- 0.5 g/dL to 3.2 +/- 0.4 g/dL, p less than 0.01, and 196 +/- 39 micrograms/dL to 248 +/- 49 micrograms/dL, p less than 0.05, respectively), and subjects lost weight (120.0 +/- 60.0 kg to 109.7 +/- 32.5 kg, p less than 0.05). Nitrogen balance studies in eight subjects suggested nitrogen equilibrium or positive balance can be achieved (+2.4 +/- 1.9 g/d). All patients exhibited complete tissue healing of wounds and abscess cavities and closure of fistulae. In obese, protein-depleted surgical patients net protein anabolism and clinical efficacy can be achieved with hypocaloric, high-protein feeding.

We evaluated the effects of buffering capacity of yogurt, gastric pH, and microbial cell disruption on beta-gal activity and lactose digestion. Three times more acid was required to acidify yogurt than to acidify milk. Yogurt beta-gal was stable at pH 4.0 but inactivated at lower pH. When yogurt was sonicated to disrupt microbial cell structure, only 20% activity remained after incubation at pH 4.0 for 60 min. In vivo gastric pH remained greater than 2.7 for 3 h after ingestion of yogurt. Acidified milk alone or with disrupted yogurt microorganisms caused twice as much lactose malabsorption as did acidified milk containing intact yogurt microorganisms. The results provide a possible explanation for the survival of beta-gal activity from yogurt in the GI tract.(author) 3ayogurt 3alactose 3adigestibility 3amicroorganisms 3abeta-galactosidase 3alactose intolerance 3astomach 3apH 2aAdult 2aBuffers 2aCell Membranexphysiology 2aCell Wallxphysiology 2aDairy Products 2aDigestion 2aGalactosidasesxmetabolism 2aGastric Acidity Determination 2aHumans 2aLactobacillusxultrastructure 2aLactosexmetabolism 2aLactose Intolerancexmetabolism 2aMale 2aSonication 2aStreptococcusxultrastructure 2aYogurt 2abeta-Galactosidasexmetabolism1 aBollweg, G.L.1 aLevitt, M.D.1 aSavaiano, D.A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1987 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.432-436x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19871022c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245012900166300001600295500001500311520158500326650002101911650002001932650002601952650001601978650001401994650002902008650002702037650002702064650001902091651001002110653001502120653002702135653002702162700001302189700001602202700001602218773008702234852000902321930003302330945002502363946001102388655001202399IND4366854820221118104620.0050131e20041130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436685482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCarraminana, J.J.10aHigh prevalence of multiple resistance to antibiotics in Salmonella serovars isolated from a poultry slaughterhouse in Spain  ap. 133-139.  a2019-12-05  aSalmonellosis is a major foodborne infection in Spain, and strains that are resistant to a great variety of antibiotics have become a major public health concern. The aim of this study was to determine the level of antibiotic resistance in 133 Salmonella isolates obtained from a poultry slaughterhouse in Zaragoza (NE Spain). Antimicrobial resistance testing was performed by disk diffusion method using 19 antibiotics. Results were interpreted following the NCCLS criteria. Overall, the highest percentage of resistance was found to the following antimicrobial agents: sulfadiazine (96.2%), neomycin (53.4%), tetracycline (21.8%), and streptomycin (11.3%). All isolates were found to be resistant to one or more of the antibiotics tested. Multiple resistance was observed in 87 strains (65.4%). We found 23 different patterns of resistance in Salmonella Enteritidis. Resistance to sulfadiazine was the most common single resistance. The most frequent patterns of multiresistant strains were neomycin + sulfadiazine and neomycin + tetracycline + sulfadiazine. S. 4,5,12:b: showed the highest percentages of resistance to the tested drugs, with five different resistance patterns found. Ampicillin + chloramphenicol + streptomycin + sulphonamides + tetracycline (ACSSuT) resistance pattern, commonly associated with S. Typhimurium DT 104, was not detected in strains of the same phage type from broilers. The appearance of substantial multiresistance in foodborne Salmonella isolates suggests the need for more prudent use of antibiotics by farmers, veterinarians, and physicians. 3abroiler chickens 3aslaughterhouses 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aserotypes 3amultiple drug resistance 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3afood pathogens 3aSpain 0aSalmonella 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aRota, C.1 aAgustin, I.1 aHerrera, A.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2004 Nov. 30, v. 104, no. 1-2 p.133-139x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20060626b20060702c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/06/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03171naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009600145300001600241520154200257650000901799650002901808650001601837650001401853650001501867650001001882650002101892650001401913650001601927650000901943650001201952650001601964650001901980650001501999650001402014650002102028650001202049650002102061650001602082650002302098650001802121650002202139650000902161650001102170650001102181650002602192650002002218650001402238650001502252650002902267650001102296650001302307653001902320653001502339700001702354773008202371852000902453930003302462945001302495946001302508655001202521IND2201285920221118104608.0991025e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220128592DNAL7 a101946802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoder, K.J.10aDry matter intake and milk yield and composition of cows fed yeast prepartum and postpartum  ap. 605-610.  aThirty-six multiparous and 12 primiparous Holstein cows were utilized in a completely randomized design to characterize the effects of feeding yeast cultures (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and enzymes on dry matter intake and milk yield and composition. The prepartum diet consisted of a total mixed ration containing chopped grass hay, corn silage, and grain pellet. The postpartum diet consisted of a total mixed ration containing corn silage, legume silage, chopped legume hay, and grain pellet. Treatments consisted of 1) whey control, 10 g/d; 2) enzyme, 10 g/d; 3) yeast; 15 g/d; and 4) Biomate Yeast Plus (20 g/d; Chr. Hansen BioSystems, Inc., Milwaukee, WI). Treatments were top-dressed at feeding time. Cows were housed in a tie-stall barn, had continuous access to fresh water, and were fed once daily at 0800 h for ad libitum intake. Daily intake and arts were recorded beginning 28 d prior to the expected calving date through wk 13 of lactation. Daily milk yield and weekly milk samples were collected through wk 13 of lactation. Body weight and body condition score were recorded once every 2 wk throughout the experiment. Urine samples were collected at 30, 60, and 90 d of lactation and were analyzed for allantoin and creatinine. Least squares means for intake, milk yield, and milk composition were unaffected by treatment. The allantoin to creatinine ratio was not affected by treatment. Yeast cultures with or without enzyme had no direct effects on prepartum or postpartum dry matter intake or milk yield and composition. 3acows 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afeed intake 3alactation 3amilk yield 3afeeds 3amilk composition 3apregnancy 3aparturition 3awhey 3aenzymes 3abody weight 3abody condition 3acreatinine 3aallantoin 2aAllantoinxurine 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEdible Grain. 2aCreatininexurine 2aDiet 2aEating 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPregnancy 2aProbiotics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 2aSilage 2aZea mays 0aurine analysis 0adry matter1 aHolden, L.A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.605-610x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03415naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245010300146300001600249500001500265520143200280650001501712650002301727650002301750650001001773650002001783650001001803650001601813650001701829650002201846650002601868650002101894650001401915650001801929650000901947650001901956650002301975650003901998650001602037650001202053650002402065650002102089650001602110650002302126650005902149650002202208650003802230650001102268650002602279650002102305650002202326650002002348650002802368650001102396650001402407650002202421650003002443653002002473653001502493700001802508700001702526773008202543852000902625930003302634945001302667946001302680655001202693IND2201285020221118105222.0991025e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220128502DNAL7 a101946712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuyler, M.T.10aMetabolic and yield responses of multiparous holstein cows to prepartum rumen-undegradable protein  ap. 527-536.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of concentration of rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) in prepartum diets on performance and metabolic measures were determined. Pregnant, nonlactating cows were assigned to one of three dietary treatments that differed in concentrations of crude protein and RUP. The crude protein and RUP percentages (dry matter basis in the diets were 11.7 and 3.1%, 15.6 and 6.8% and 20.6 and 10.6% which were identified as low, medium, and high protein diets, respectively. Dietary treatments were initiated 6 wk prior to expected calving date and were fed until parturition. All cows were fed similar postpartum diets through wk 10 of lactation. Prepartum intakes of dry matter and rumen-degradable protein were similar among treatments. Yields of milk, protein, and fat were not affected by prepartum RUP. Concentrations of plasma urea N in cows fed the medium and high protein diets were elevated during the prepartum period even though intakes of rumen-degradable protein were similar for cows on all treatments. Cows fed the medium and high protein diets had greater prepartum concentrations of Val, Ile, and Leu but not other essential amino acids in plasma. Dietary treatments did not affect prepartum or postpartum contents of triglycerides in liver or plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Thus, supplemental RUP fed to cows for 6 wk prepartum affected protein metabolism but not measures of energy metabolism. 3adairy cows 3adigestible protein 3amilk protein yield 3arumen 3anutrient intake 3aliver 3afatty acids 3ablood lipids 3aenergy metabolism 3aessential amino acids 3atriacylglycerols 3apregnancy 3acrude protein 3aurea 3amilk fat yield 3aprotein metabolism 2aAmino Acids, Essentialxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aTriglyceridesxmetabolism 0ablood chemistry 0amilk yield1 aKincaid, R.L.1 aDostal, D.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.527-536x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02604naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245012300144300001600267520107400283650001101357650001501368650001301383650002201396650001501418650001801433650002001451650001201471650002701483650002501510650003101535650001601566650002301582650002501605650003301630650003601663650004501699650002001744650002601764650000901790650002201799650001701821653002701838653001501865700001301880700001901893773008201912852000901994930003302003945001302036946001302049655001202062IND2201284820221118105149.0991025e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220128482DNAL7 a101946692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, S.J.10aShort communication: lack of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 expression by bovine embryos and primordial germ cells  ap. 516-519.  aThe objective of this study was to determine whether stage-specific embryonic antigen-1, a cellular marker commonly used to identify murine undifferentiated embryonic cells, is also a useful marker for bovine pluripotent cells. Expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 was examined by indirect immunohistochemistry on bovine preimplantation embryos and on primordial germ cells contained in the genital ridge. Expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 was not observed in any of the cleavage-stage bovine embryos examined, including one-cell, two-cell, four-cell, eight-cell. morula, and blastocyst stages, nor in tissue sections of bovine genital ridges collected from embryos on d 34, 37, and 40 of gestation. As expected, expression of stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 was detected on murine preimplantation embryos and on murine teratocarcinoma cells. Results of this study indicate that, unlike in the mouse, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 is not a useful cellular marker for pluripotent bovine embryonic cells or bovine primordial germ cells. 3acattle 3agerm cells 3aantigens 3aprotein synthesis 3abiomarkers 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo (animal) 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aAntibody Specificity 2aLewis X Antigenxanalysis. 2aBiomarkers. 2aCattlexembryology 2aCell Differentiation 2aEmbryo, Mammalianxchemistry 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aGene Expression 2aGerm Cellsxchemistry 2aMice 2aMorulaxchemistry 2aTime Factors 0abiochemical techniques 0aevaluation1 aShim, H.1 aAnderson, G.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.516-519x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01969naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011000123300001600233520101500249650001401264650001901278650001201297650001301309650000801322650001601330650001201346650001401358653000801372653000901380653002201389700001601411700001801427773008201445852000901527930003301536945001301569946001301582655001201595IND2201283920221118105216.0991025e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220128392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrgo, C.10aEffect of freezing point and texture regulating parameters on the initial ice crystal growth in ice cream  ap. 460-465.  aThe objective of this research was to derive information on the technological influences on the ice recrystallization in ice cream after the freezer outlet during the sensitive temperature range from the freezing point to -8 degrees C. The parameters studied were the total solids content and sucrose concentration. which determine the freezing point of the ice cream mix as well as the overrun, mix viscosity, and the fat content, which influence the texture of the ice cream. For the recrystallization experiments, the ice cream samples, taken directly after the continuous ice cream freezer, were treated at defined temperature time combinations. In the temperature range investigated, none of the parameters had a significant effect on the ice recrystallization. The contradictory results compared with previous research can be explained by the different experimental conditions and can reemphasize the importance of the hardening conditions as an influencing factor for the ice crystal sizes in ice cream. 3aice cream 3afreezing point 3atexture 3acrystals 3aice 3atemperature 3asucrose 3aviscosity 0afat 0asize 0arecrystallization1 aKoxholt, M.1 aKessler, H.G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Mar., v. 82, no. 3 p.460-465x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03029naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245010400147300001800251520169800269650001501967650001701982650001701999650002002016650002202036650001302058650001602071650002102087650002602108650001202134650002302146650001102169650001102180650002602191650001702217653001702234653001502251653001502266653001902281700001802300700001902318700001602337700001702353773008502370852000902455930003302464945001302497946001302510655001202523IND2199076620221118105224.0990603e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219907662DNAL7 a98912722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriggens, N.C.10aEffects of feed composition and stage of lactation on the short-term feeding behavior of dairy cows  ap. 3268-3277.  aTwenty Holstein-Friesian cows were assigned to one of four feeding groups throughout lactation in a full change-over experiment using two total mixed diets. The low concentrate total mixed diet contained 100 g of concentrate/kg of fresh matter, and the high concentrate total mixed diet contained 300 g of concentrate/kg of fresh matter. The remainder of the total mixed diet was grass silage. The two changeover groups switched total mixed diets at 153 d of lactation; the other two treatment groups remained on their assigned diets throughout lactation. For analysis of short-term feeding behavior, four periods of 3 wk each were identified. The midpoints of these periods were -102, -18, 18, and 102 d from the changeover. The concentrate content of the total mixed diet significantly affected dry matter intake and all short-term feeding behavior variables. Cows that consumed the high concentrate total mixed diet had fewer but longer visits to the feeders and ate more feed per visit than did cows consuming the low concentrate total mixed diet. With one exception, no significant effect of stage of lactation was detected for any of the short-term feeding behavior variables. Despite a highly significant decline in dry matter intake as lactation progressed for cows consuming the high concentrate total mixed diet, there were no interactions between total mixed diet and stage of lactation for any of the short-term feeding behavior variables. Large differences in feeding behavior were detected between cows consuming the same total mixed diet. These last two findings suggest that the use of short-term feeding behavior variables to predict daily intake is unlikely to be successful. 3adairy cows 3aconcentrates 3agrass silage 3alactation stage 3afeeding frequency 3aduration 3afeed intake 3alactation number 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEating 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aTime Factors 0aeating rates 0adry matter 0agreen feed 0acomplete feeds1 aNielsen, B.L.1 aKyriazakis, I.1 aTolkamp, B.1 aEmmans, G.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Dec., v. 81, no. 12 p.3268-3277x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02962naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245010200161300001400263520170300277650000901980650000901989650003401998650001802032650001002050650001302060650004602073650002502119650001302144650001502157650002202172650003502194650002502229653002802254700001702282700001402299700001302313700001502326773008502341852000902426930003302435945002502468946001102493655001202504IND4369229920221118105219.0050423e20050320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436922992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMotokawa, K.10aMutations in feline immunodeficiency (FIV) virus envelope gene V3-V5 regions in FIV-infected cats  ap. 33-40.  aThe envelope (Env) gene V3-V5 regions of the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) encode the neutralizing epitopes. Since mutations in these regions induce resistance to viral neutralizing antibodies, they may influence the effects of vaccines. To examine the in vivo mutation rate in these regions, we cloned cDNA for the Env gene V3-V5 regions from the PBMC of experimentally FIV-infected cats, and compared the deduced amino acid sequences. Blood or plasma from an FIV Shizuoka strain-infected cat was inoculated into a second group of SPF cats, and their blood or plasma was inoculated into the third group. The amino acid sequence encoded by the viral gene of the first cat was compared with those encoded by the viral genes of a total of eight cats in the second and third groups (two and six cats, respectively). The amino acid sequences in two cats in the second and third groups were 100% homologous and in one cat in the third group was 98.3% homologous to that in the first infected cat. Five cats had the same sequence, which was 97.8% homologous to that in the first infected cat. Three kittens, born 2 months after the inoculation of the FIV Aomori-2 strain into the mother cat, were anti-FIV negative at 4 weeks after birth, but became seropositive at 33 weeks after birth, confirming FIV infection. Comparison of the encoded amino acid sequences of the viral gene in two cats at 48 weeks after birth showed 100% homology to that of the virus inoculated into the mother cat, and the remaining one cat had a single residue substitution, resulting in 99.4% homology. These results suggest that the FIV Env gene V3-V5 regions are stably maintained for at least 1-2 years after infection. 3acats 3apets 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3acoat proteins 3agenes 3amutation 3afeline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3aantibodies 3acomplementary DNA 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aHohdatsu, T.1 aImori, A.1 aArai, S.1 aKoyama, H.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Mar. 20, v. 106, no. 1-2 p.33-40x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/06/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03129naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245008400149300001600233500001500249520133800264650001501602650002201617650002301639650001501662650002401677650002001701650002801721650001901749650002701768650001801795650000901813650002101822650001001843650001301853650001701866650001801883650001901901650001101920650001201931650001301943650002101956650001101977650001701988650002402005650002102029650002002050650002802070650002002098650001402118650002702132650002202159650002802181651001602209653001302225653001502238700001802253700002202271773008202293852000902375930003302384945001302417946001302430655001202443IND2199668420221118104317.0990709e199901  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219966842DNAL7 a100220232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinkelman, A.M.10aEstimation of heritabilities and correlations associated with milk color traits  ap. 215-224.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters associated with milk color traits of dairy cattle. The data consisted of test day records of 9516 first lactation dairy cows and the records of 6358 of these cows that went on to produce a second lactation. Friesians, Jerseys, and crossbred cows were included in the data. Test day records included measures of milk, fat, and protein as well as milk color measured as absorbance at 450 nm. From these measurements, fat color and beta-carotene yield were calculated. Analyses were performed both within and across breeds. Jerseys produced more beta-carotene than did Friesians, and milk and fat from Jerseys had more intense color. Lactation model estimates for the heritabilities of milk color traits ranged from 0.33 to 0.44 (across breed), 0.40 to 0.49 (Friesians), and 0.17 to 0.31 (Jerseys). In all analyses, the heritability estimates associated with beta-carotene yield were lower than the estimates associated with the color of milk or fat. Genetic correlations between beta-carotene yield and the production traits were positive, but genetic correlations between fat color and production traits were generally negative. Genetic correlations between milk color and milk and protein yields were negative, and the correlations with fat yield were close to zero. 3adairy cows 3abreed differences 3amilk protein yield 3acrossbreds 3agenetic correlation 3alactation curve 3aAyrshire (cattle breed) 3aheterozygosity 3aphenotypic correlation 3abeta-carotene 3amilk 3alactation number 3acolor 3amilk fat 3aheritability 3arepeatability 3amilk fat yield 3aJersey 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aHeterozygote 2aLactationxgenetics 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aModels, Genetic 2aPhenotype 2aPigmentationxgenetics 2aSpectrophotometry 2abeta Carotenexanalysis 3aNew Zealand 0afriesian 0amilk yield1 aJohnson, D.L.1 aMacGibbon, A.K.H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Jan., v. 82, no. 1 p.215-224x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20040603b00000000c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03775naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245011900146300001600265500001500281520174000296650001502036650002302051650001602074650001202090650001702102650001702119650003002136650003102166650001702197650001802214650002102232650000902253650001202262650001902274650001302293650002302306650002802329650002402357650002702381650002302408650007202431650001202503650003002515650002402545650005202569650002302621650000902644650001102653650001102664650001902675650002802694650002002722650003002742653002102772653001802793653001302811653001502824653003102839700001602870700001702886773008202903852000902985930003302994945001303027946001303040655001203053IND2199666520221118104850.0990709e199901  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219966652DNAL7 a100220182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMackle, T.R.10aEffects of branched-chain amino acids and sodium caseinate on milk protein concentration and yield from dairy cows  ap. 161-171.  a2019-12-05  aOur study investigated the separate and combined effects of branched-chain amino acids (AA) and sodium caseinate on milk protein concentration and yield. Four Holstein cows (112 d in milk) were abomasally infused with water, branched-chain AA (150 g/d), sodium caseinate (600 g/d), or branched-chain AA plus sodium caseinate (44 and 600 g/d, respectively) according to a 4 X 4 Latin square design with 8-d treatment periods. Cows were fed a dry diet based on alfalfa hay and concentrates for ad libitum intake. The ration was formulated to exceed requirements for metabolizable energy and protein using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. Neither daily dry matter intake (24.2 +/- 0.4 kg/d; average +/- SEM) nor milk yield (32.9 +/- 0.4 kg/d) was affected by any of the infusion treatments Infusion of branched-chain AA had no effect on any milk production parameters, despite a 50% increase in their concentrations. Modest increases in milk protein concentration (0.1%) and milk protein yield (62 g/d) resulted from the infusion of sodium caseinate or branched-chain AA plus sodium caseinate. True protein and whey protein concentrations in milk were also marginally increased by infusion of sodium caseinate and branched-chain AA plus sodium caseinate, and infusion of branched-chain AA, sodium caseinate, or both elevated milk nonprotein N content. Plasma urea N concentrations were elevated by the sodium caseinate and branched-chain AA plus sodium caseinate treatments. No treatment effects on other plasma metabolites or hormones were observed. Our results show no benefit of supplementation with branched-chain AA and only modest effects of sodium caseinate on milk protein concentration and yield in well-fed cows. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3afatty acids 3alactose 3ablood lipids 3asomatotropin 3abranched chain keto acids 3abranched chain amino acids 3ablood plasma 3ablood glucose 3abinding proteins 3aurea 3ainsulin 3amilk fat yield 3aabomasum 3aad libitum feeding 3amilk protein percentage 3aprotein composition 2aAbomasumxdrug effects 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aCaseinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDiet 2aEating 2aFemale 2aInsulinxblood 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMedicago sativa 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 0asodium caseinate 0adairy protein 0ainfusion 0amilk yield 0ainsulin-like growth factor1 aDwyer, D.A.1 aBauman, D.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Jan., v. 82, no. 1 p.161-171x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03843naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245015600148300001600304500001500320520170500335650002102040650002302061650002602084650002102110650002002131650001302151650002602164650001002190650001402200650002502214650001102239650000902250650001602259650002402275650001802299650001202317650003302329650001202362650002402374650001602398650005102414650005602465650001102521650001802532650003802550650001102588650002202599650001402621650002102635650002002656650002502676650004902701653001602750653001502766653001302781653001902794653001502813653002102828653002102849700002102870700001202891700001602903700001602919773008202935852000903017930003303026945001303059946001303072655001203085IND2201326920221118105018.0991027e199904  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220132692DNAL7 a102124612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchimidely, P.10aInfluence of feed intake and source of dietary carbohydrate on milk yield and composition, nitrogen balance, and plasma constituents of lactating goats  ap. 747-755.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of diet (synchronized or not synchronized for the degradation rate of the carbohydrate and N fractions) and amount of feed offered [2.40 +/- 0.10 or 2.00 +/- 0.10 kg of dry matter (DM)/d] on milk yield and composition, N balance, and some plasma constituents was studied using 32 multiparous dairy goats (100 +/- 16 d in milk) that were fed a mixed diet for 9 wk. Diets were 40% concentrate with rapidly degraded starch and rapidly degraded N or highly digestible fibers and slowly degraded N. Nitrogen balance was determined at wk 4 and 8. Goats that were fed greater amounts of DM had higher yields of milk, fat-corrected milk, and protein, but lower milk fat concentrations during the whole trial. Raw milk yield was higher at wk 4 and from wk 6 to 7 for goats consuming the rapidly degraded diet than for goats fed the slowly degraded diet at a high feed intake. Concentrations of milk fat tended to be greater for goats fed the rapidly degraded diet at wk 5, 7, and 8. At wk 5 and 6, an interaction between feed intake and diet was observed for milk protein concentration. Nitrogen digestibility, milk N, and N balance were increased for goats fed at high intakes. The output of N in urine and the efficiency of N use for milk output was greater, and N balance was lower, for goats fed the rapidly degraded diet. Plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and urea (wk 2 to 6) were lower, and insulin concentrations were transiently increased, for goats fed at high intakes. Goats fed the rapidly degraded diet compared with goats fed the slowly degraded diet had higher plasma concentrations of urea, which may indicate inefficient use of ruminal N. 3anitrogen balance 3amilk protein yield 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3anitrogen content 3ablood chemistry 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3agoats 3alactation 3adietary carbohydrate 3astarch 3aurea 3afeed intake 3amilk fat percentage 3adigestibility 3ainsulin 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aBody Weight 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aLactation 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aStarchxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 0afatty acids 0aefficiency 0amilk fat 0aurine analysis 0amilk yield 0amilk composition 0anutrient sources1 aLloret-Pujol, M.1 aBas, P.1 aRouzeau, A.1 aSauvant, D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Apr., v. 82, no. 4 p.747-755x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01941naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001900154245009300173300001400266500002400280520087300304650001801177650002401195650003001219650002701249650001501276650001801291650001201309650001001321650001901331650001801350650001101368773014601379852000901525856005701534655001201591IND4456225920221118105101.0110408e198801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445622592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1988.tb02267.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAly, Christoph10aFiltration rates of mosquito larvae in suspensions of latex microspheres and yeast cells  ap. 55-61.  aIncludes references  aFiltration rates of fourth instars of Aedes aegypti L., Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann, Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) were determined by quantifying removal rates of suspended latex microspheres or yeast cells.

  1 aAngen, O.10aSerological characterization of Danish Haemophilus parasuis isolates  ap. 255-258.  a2019-12-05  aA total of 103 Danish Haemophilus parasuis field isolates was collected from diseased pigs in connection with routine diagnostics. The isolates were serotyped using indirect haemagglutination (IHA) and for 57 of the isolates the serotyping was also performed by immunodiffusion. Serovar 5 was the most prevalent (36%), followed by serovar 4 (13%) and serovar 13 (22%), whereas 15% of the strains were nontypeable by IHA. Serovars 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 12, 14, and 15 were only represented by a small number of isolates. Most of the Danish isolates belong to serovars, which earlier have been shown to be virulent. The strains could be divided into two groups depending on whether they were isolated from cases with systemic disease (polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis) or if they only were found in the lower respiratory tract. The most marked differences were observed for serovar 4, which had a higher prevalence in respiratory disease compared to systemic infection, and for the nontypeable isolates, which were mainly found in cases of systemic infection. 3ameningitis 3aseroprevalence 3aswine diseases 3aserotypes 3arespiratory tract diseases 3astrain differences 3aarthritis 3aHaemophilus parasuis 3avirulence 3abacterial infections 3aswine 3aDenmark 0apolyserosis 0astrains1 aSvensmark, B.1 aMittal, K.R.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2004 Nov. 15, v. 103, no. 3-4 p.255-258x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20060626b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02729naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245014400148300001600292500001500308520154100323650001201864650002601876650001401902650001201916650002501928650002001953650001401973650002301987650002302010650001302033650002302046650002502069653001202094700001602106700002002122773008702142852000902229930003302238945002502271946001102296655001202307IND4366905220221118105106.0050203e20041115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436690522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVancraeynest, D.10aGenotypic and phenotypic screening of high and low virulence Staphylococcus aureus isolates from rabbits for biofilm formation and MSCRAMMs  ap. 241-247.  a2019-12-05  aAt rabbit flock level, two types of Staphylococcus aureus infections can be distinguished. In the first type, caused by low virulence strains, the infection remains limited to a small number of animals. The second type of infection is caused by the high virulence strains, which spread throughout the rabbitry. The pathogenetic capacity of a particular S. aureus strain is attributed to a combination of extracellular factors and invasive properties such as adherence and biofilm formation. Twenty eight high virulence and 34 low virulence S. aureus isolates recovered from rabbits between 1998 and 2003 were used to study slime production on Congo red Agar (CRA) and prevalence of bap, icaA and icaD associated with biofilm formation. Furthermore these strains were screened for the presence of bbp, clfA, clfB, cna, ebpS, eno, fnbA, fnbB and fib encoding microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs). The presence of icaA and icaD was not correlated with slime production on CRA. Bap was absent in all strains. All rabbit S. aureus strains harboured clfA and clfB. The prevalences of ebpS, eno, fnbA and fib did not reveal striking differences between high and low virulence strains. FnbB prevalence in high virulence isolates was lower than in low virulence isolates and cna was absent in high virulence strains. It was remarkable that only high virulence strains were positive for bbp. Further research is necessary to elucidate the significance of bbp in the pathogenesis of high virulence strains. 3arabbits 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aphenotype 3abiofilm 3aextracellular matrix 3arabbit diseases 3avirulence 3abacterial adhesion 3astrain differences 3agenotype 3amicrobial genetics 3abacterial infections 0astrains1 aHermans, K.1 aHaesebrouck, F.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2004 Nov. 15, v. 103, no. 3-4 p.241-247x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20060626b20060702c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/19  aNon-US 7aarticle01468naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245006900144300001600213520028700229650000900516650002600525650001700551650002700568650001700595650002100612650001600633650001100649650001300660650001700673650001500690700001900705700001800724700001700742700001800759700001300777700001700790700002300807700001500830773008700845852000900932930003300941945002500974946001100999655001201010IND4366905420221118105030.0050203e20041115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436690542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A high degree of genetic similarity (> 0.82) was determined for isolates from the Western Hemisphere. Genome similarity was greatest among isolates collected within a country. Among isolates collected in Central America and the Caribbean, burrowing nematodes from Belize and Guatemala were genetically more distant. However, the genome of the isolate from Ivory Coast was most dissimilar (> 0.30). These results suggest that African and American burrowing-nematode isolates may have had different origins or that they have been geographically isolated for a sufficient amount of time to have accumulated genetic changes detectable by RAPD analysis. No relationship was found between the genomic similarity and extent of reproduction or damage to banana or citrus roots. Morphometric analysis involving eight of the isolates indicated that they were morphologically identical and values for morphometric parameters were well within the range previously published for banana and citrus parasitic burrowing nematodes. 3ahost range 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3areproduction 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3ageographical variation 3agenetic distance 3aMusa 3abody measurements 3agenetic variation 3aRadopholus 3aCitrus limon 3aroots 3abiogeography 3aCentral America 3aCote d'Ivoire 3aFlorida 3aCaribbean 0adamage 0agenetic similarity 0amorphometrics 0aanatomy and morphology1 aKaplan, D.T.1 aOpperman, C.H.0 tJournal of nematology.g1999 June, v. 31, no. 2 p.232-239x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02004naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013400127300001600261520085300277650002701130650002501157650003001182650002301212650001701235650001601252650001901268650001401287650002401301650001401325650001601339650001601355650002101371651002001392700001901412700001501431773008001446852000901526930003301535945001301568946001301581655001201594IND2321640920221118101214.0010619e200012  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232164092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, S.P.10aEffect of field crops on population densities of Pratylenchus neglectus and P. thornei in southeastern Australia. 1.

Host status was assessed on the basis of either final P. neglectus densities in soil or multiplication rate under different crops. Both techniques gave consistent results for crop and cultivar ranking, and it was therefore concluded that, in these trials, final population density could be used for screening cultivars for resistance to P. neglectus. Differences were observed among crops and cultivars for host suitability to P. neglectus. Chickpea, wheat, and canola were good hosts, while barley, oat, durum wheat, medic, and vetch were moderate hosts. Field pea, faba bean, and triticale were poor hosts. A range in host suitability was observed for wheat, barley, and oat cultivars. 3aPratylenchus neglectus 3aPratylenchus thornei 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3apopulation density 3areproduction 3afield crops 3apasture plants 3acultivars 3avarietal resistance 3ascreening 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3ahost preferences 3aSouth Australia1 aHollaway, G.J.1 aHunt, C.H.0 tJournal of nematology.g2000 Dec., v. 32, no. 4S p.591-599x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02707naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245011600210300001600326520140600342653000901748653001001757653003301767653007801800700001801878700003101896700002101927700002601948700002001974700002001994700002102014700002102035773010802056852000902164856009202173930003302265946001102298655001202309IND4405698420221118101241.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440569842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02750.x2doi7 aPMC25666212pmcid7 a182057912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Mi-Yeon10aHeterogeneity of lymphoid tissue inducer cell populations present in embryonic and adult mouse lymphoid tissues  ap. 166-174.  aLymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells have a well established role in secondary lymphoid tissue development. Here, we report on the heterogeneity of LTi cells based on their CD4 and chemokine receptor expression. The CD4⁻ LTi-cell population has a similar phenotype to the CD4⁺ population, with similar chemokine-receptor-expressing subsets. In both embryonic and adult spleen the CD4⁻ LTi-cell population is comparable as a proportion of total splenocytes to its CD4⁺ counterpart. In contrast, different proportions of CD4⁺ and CD4⁻ LTi cells are found in different lymph nodes. Both CD4⁺ and CD4⁻ LTi cells share the anatomical location and are associated with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1-positive stromal cells in spleen and lymph nodes. The numbers of both CD4⁺ and CD4⁻ LTi cells in adult spleen are augmented in the presence of B cells. With the exception of CD4, there is a strong correlation coefficient (0·89) for gene expression between the two populations. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of individual CD4⁺ and CD4⁻ LTi cells shows that a similar proportion in embryonic and adult spleen co-expressed both CXCR5 and CCR7 or CXCR5 alone: 84·6% for adult CD4⁺ and 87·6% for adult CD4⁻; 95·3% for embryonic CD4⁺ and 91·5% for embryonic CD4⁻. Consistently fewer CCR7 single-positive cells were found in the CD4⁺ and CD4⁻ fractions in the embryo. 0aCCR7 0aCXCR5 0alymphoid tissue inducer cell 0atumour necrosis factor and tumour necrosis factor receptor family members1 aRossi, Simona1 aWithers, D.

In both experiments, 21-day-old seedlings were transplanted individually into 15-cm-diam. plastic pots containing a steam-sterilized mixture of equal parts loam and sandy loam. Seedlings were inoculated with 5,000 M. javanica eggs/plant 30 days later. After 120 days, fresh root weight, disease index (1-9 scale), the number of eggs/pot (Pf), eggs/g fresh root, and a reproductive factor (Rf) were determined. Results of both the growth chamber and the outdoor tests were similar. Species were grouped into host suitability categories according to Rf, and they were also grouped into resistance categories based on the sum of gall index, gall size, and percentage of the root system that was galled. Only A. salicina was a poor host and was resistant to M. javanica. Acacia farnisiana, A. gerrardii subsp. negevensis var. najdensis, and A. saligna were excellent hosts and highly susceptible. Both A. nilotica and A. stenophylla were classified as good hosts and highly susceptible, while A. ampliceps, A. ehrenbergiana, A. gerrardii subsp. negevensis var negevensis, A. sclerosperma, A. seyal, A. tortilis, and A. tortilis subsp. spirocarpa were also good hosts but were classified as susceptible rather than highly susceptible. This is the first report on the susceptibility of Acacia species to M. javanica in Saudi Arabia, including some new hosts worldwide. 3aweight 3aforest trees 3areproduction 3aAcacia 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3adisease resistance 3ahost preferences 3agalls 3ascreening 3aroots 3aMeloidogyne javanica 0adamage 0aexotic trees 0anative trees 0abiological resistance1 aAref, I.M.0 tJournal of nematology.g2000 Dec., v. 32, no. 4S p.609-613wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02605naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001700151245013800168300001600306500001500322520113600337650002301473650001901496650003001515650003401545650002001579650002701599650002601626650001301652650001901665650003601684650002201720650002001742650001001762650001601772650001901788653003601807653001801843700001901861700001701880700002101897700001801918773009501936852000902031930003302040945001302073946001302086655001202099IND2205192020221118100759.0000608e199909  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220519202DNAL7 a192708992pmid7 aPMC26203812pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotter, M.J.10aReduced susceptibility of Brassica napus to Pratylenchus neglectus in plants with elevated root levels of 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate  ap. 291-298.  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of canola (Brassica napus) as a crop suppressive to Pratylenchus neglectus is in part due to the release of nematicidal isothiocyanates, particularly 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate, from degrading root tissues. However, many cultivars of canola are relatively susceptible to P. neglectus and will fail to reduce soil populations of the nematode. A survey of B. napus accessions and closely related species revealed limited scope to decrease the susceptibility of canola through conventional intercrossing. Susceptibility to P. neglectus was not related to the total glucosinolate levels, but there were significant, negative correlations (r = -0.619, -0.517; P less than 0.001) between root levels of 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate (isothiocyanate precursor) and plant susceptibility to P. neglectus: plants containing more than a certain threshold level of 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate should reduce the susceptibility of the plants during the growing season while also increasing the nematicidal impact of the degrading root tissues, thereby improving the suppressive benefits of the crop when used in rotation with cereals. 3aBrassica oxyrrhina 3aBrassica nigra 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3aBrassica juncea 3aPratylenchus neglectus 3aresistance mechanisms 3agenotype 3aBrassica napus 3achemical constituents of plants 3aBrassica carinata 3apest resistance 3aroots 3abreak crops 3aglucosinolates 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris 0adisease break1 aVanstone, V.A.1 aDavies, K.A.1 aKirkegaard, J.A.1 aRathjen, A.J.0 tJournal of nematology.g1999 Sept., v. 31, no. 3 p.291-298wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03281naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009000145300001800235520187600253650001502129650001502144650001602159650002002175650002402195650001702219650001702236650000902253650001202262650001102274650000702285650002002292650004702312650001202359650002302371650004602394650003602440650001102476650002202487650001402509650002402523650002502547650002302572653001502595773008502610852000902695930003302704945001302737946001302750655001202763IND2197269220221118101319.0990226e199809  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219726922DNAL7 a97852462pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, W.R.10aReview: effect of protein nutrition on ovarian and uterine physiology in dairy cattle  ap. 2533-2539.  aMilk production and dry matter intake of dairy cows are stimulated in response to increased intake of dietary protein, but, unfortunately, decreased fertility is often associated with this nutritional strategy. Ruminally degradable protein or ruminally undegradable protein in excess of requirement can contribute to reduced fertility in lactating cows. Dietary protein nutrition or utilization and the associated effects on ovarian or uterine physiology have been monitored with urea nitrogen in plasma or milk; concentrations above 19 mg/dl have been associated with altered uterine pH and reduced fertility in dairy cows. The uterine pH changed dynamically and inversely with plasma urea nitrogen, signaling possible changes in the uterine milieu. Mechanisms for reduced fertility include exacerbation of negative energy balance and reduced plasma progesterone concentrations when cows were fed rations that were high in ruminally degradable intake protein. Alternatively, changes in uterine secretions that are associated with high protein intake and elevated plasma urea nitrogen might be detrimental to embryos. Bovine endometrial cells in culture respond directly to increasing urea concentrations with alteration in pH gradient but respond most notably with increased secretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). Increased uterine luminal PGF2 alpha interferes with embryo development and survival in cows, thus providing a plausible link between elevated plasma urea nitrogen concentrations and decreased fertility. Poor fertility in high producing dairy cows reflects the combined effects of a uterine environment that is dependent on progesterone and rendered suboptimum by the antecedent effects of negative energy balance or postpartum health problems and that is further compromised by the effects of urea resulting from intake of high dietary protein. 3adairy cows 3amilk yield 3afeed intake 3adietary protein 3apostpartum interval 3ablood plasma 3aprogesterone 3aurea 3aammonia 3auterus 3apH 3aconception rate 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aFemale 2aOvaryxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aProgesteronexblood 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aUterusxphysiology 0adry matter0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2533-2539x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02474naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001300151245007500164300001600239520121600255650002401471650001601495650001601511650001801527650002801545650002701573650002301600650002001623650003001643650002301673650002101696650003001717650001301747650002201760653002301782653002301805653001001828700001601838773009401854852000901948930003301957945001301990946001302003655001202016IND2321121820221118101312.0010520e200012  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232112182DNAL7 a192709922pmid7 aPMC26204762pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, H.10aEffects of rhizobacteria on soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines  ap. 377-388.  aRhizobacteria were isolated from the rhizoplane and rhizosphere of soybean plants from fields in Arkansas and tested for their effect on numbers of soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines). In initial greenhouse tests in heat-treated silt loam soil, 138 of the 201 bacterial isolates tested had no influence on numbers of cysts and eggs + second-stage juveniles (J2) of H. glycines, 36 reduced (suppressive isolates) and 27 increased (enhancing isolates) numbers of cysts and (or) eggs + J2 when compared to the controls (P less than or equal to 0.05). When 20 suppressive and five enhancing isolates were retested in the same soil, the results were highly variable and inconclusive. The 25 isolates were then evaluated in vitro for their effects on eggs and J2 of H. glycines. No clear relationship was detected between the inhibition of egg hatch or immobilization of J2 in vitro and antagonistic activity toward nematodes in vivo. Amendment of the soil with 0.1% (w/w) peptone or casein hydrolysate did not improve the effects of suppressive isolates on numbers of H. glycines. Nineteen of the 25 isolates were identified based on analysis of fatty acid methyl esters, and they are in 11 different genera. 3aHeterodera glycines 3aGlycine max 3arhizosphere 3asoil bacteria 3acell suspension culture 3anematicidal properties 3apopulation density 3anematode larvae 3abiological control agents 3abiological control 3anematode control 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3apeptones 3aculture filtrates 0acasein hydrolysate 0aorganic amendments 0ahatch1 aRiggs, R.D.0 tJournal of nematology.g2000 Dec., v. 32, no. 4 p.377-388wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02942naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010400167300001600271500002400287520170100311650002202012650001302034650001502047650001202062650000902074650002502083650002102108650001302129650001302142650002802155650000902183650001702192650001502209651001502224651001202239651001102251700001702262700001602279700001602295700002402311773009202335852000902427856004802436655001202484IND4417079620221118101258.0090228e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441707962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-008-9080-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, Nicolas12aA comparison of crop data measured by two commercial sensors for variable-rate nitrogen application  ap. 145-161.  aIncludes references  aNitrogen (N) fertilizer rates applied spatially according to crop requirements can improve the efficiency of N use. The study compares the performance of two commercial sensors, the Yara N-Sensor/FieldScan (Yara International ASA, Germany) and the GreenSeeker (NTech Industries Inc., Ukiah, California, USA), for assessing the status of N in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.). Four experiments were conducted at different locations in Quebec and Ontario, Canada. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was determined with the two sensors at specific growth stages. The NDVI values derived from Yara N-Sensor/FieldScan correlated with those from GreenSeeker, but only at the early growth stages, where the NDVI values varied from 0.2 to 0.6. Both sensors were capable of describing the N condition of the crop or variation in the stand, but each sensor had its own sensitivity characteristics. It follows that the algorithms developed with one sensor for variable-rate N application cannot be transferred directly to another sensor. The Yara N-Sensor/FieldScan views the crop at an oblique angle over the rows and detects more biomass per unit of soil surface compared to the GreenSeeker with its nadir (top-down) view of the crop. The Yara N-Sensor/FieldScan should be used before growth stage V5 for corn during the season if NDVI is used to derive crop N requirements. GreenSeeker performed well where NDVI values were >0.5. However, unlike GreenSeeker, the Yara N-Sensor/FieldScan can also record spectral information from wavebands other than red and near infrared, and more vegetation indices can be derived that might relate better to N status than NDVI. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3afertilizer rates 3aindustry 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3asoil 3aspring wheat 3avegetation 3aCalifornia 3aOntario 3aQuebec1 aWang, Zhijie1 aMa, Bao-Luo1 aBelec, Carl1 aVigneault, Philippe0 tPrecision agriculture.g2009 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.145-161dSpringer USx1385-22567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-008-9080-2 7aarticle02908naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001600151245010900167300001600276500001500292520166200307650001401969650001701983650002002000650002202020650002602042650003002068650001902098650002102117650002402138650001302162650002302175650001002198650001002208653002302218653002102241653001102262700001502273773009402288852000902382930003302391945001302424946001302437655001202450IND2321121520221118101309.0010520e200012  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232112152DNAL7 a192709892pmid7 aPMC26204672pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThies, J.A.10aHeat stability of resistance to Meloidogyne incognita in Scotch Bonnet peppers (Capsicum chinense Jacq.)  ap. 356-361.  a2019-12-05  aStability of resistance to Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White) Chitwood was determined in pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacq. And C. annuum L.) at 24, 28, and 32 degrees C. Reactions of the C. annuum cultivars Charleston Belle and Keystone Resistant Giant and the C. chinense cultigens PA-426 and PA-350 to M. incognita were compared. Charleston Belle is homozygous for the N gene that confers resistance to M. incognita in C. annuum, and Keystone Resistant Giant is the susceptible recurrent parent of Charleston Belle. PA-426 is homozygous for a single dominant resistance gene that is allelic to the N gene, and PA-350 is susceptible. Root galling, egg-mass production, numbers of eggs per g fresh root, and reproductive factor of M. incognita increased for all pepper genotypes as temperature increased. Severity of root galling and nematode reproduction were less for PA-426 and Charleston Belle compared to PA-350 and Keystone Resistant Giant at all temperatures. However, both PA-426 and Charleston Belle exhibited a partial loss of resistance at the higher temperatures. For example, at 32 degrees C, the numbers of M. incognita eggs per g fresh root and the reproductive index for PA-426 and Charleston Belle were in the susceptible range. Nevertheless, the gall index for both cultivars was still within the resistant range. Both PA-350 and Keystone Resistant Giant exhibited highly susceptible reactions at 28 and 32 degrees C. Although the resistances of PA-426 and Charleston Belle were somewhat compromised at high temperatures, cultivars possessing these resistances will still be useful for managing M. incognita under high soil temperatures. 3acultivars 3areproduction 3aCapsicum annuum 3aCapsicum chinense 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aheat stability 3asoil temperature 3avarietal resistance 3agenotype 3apopulation density 3agalls 3aroots 0agenetic resistance 0aresistance genes 0an gene1 aFery, R.L.0 tJournal of nematology.g2000 Dec., v. 32, no. 4 p.356-361wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02541naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002800128245012200156300001800278500001500296520088700311650001501198650002301213650001601236650002301252650001701275650002201292650002201314650001601336650001801352650001801370650001901388650002701407650002101434650001601455650001201471650001101483650006001494650001101554650002401565650001401589650001301603650001701616651001601633651001601649653002001665653001901685700001901704700002101723700002201744700002001766773008501786852000901871930003301880945001301913946001301926655001201939IND2197336720221118100706.0990302e199810  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219733672DNAL7 a98122802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsseldonk, M.A.P.M. van10aEffects of information technology on dairy farms in the Netherlands: an empirical analysis of milk production records  ap. 2752-2759.  a2019-12-05  aThis study empirically quantified the effects of the adoption of an automated concentrate feeder, on-line measurement of milk production, and activity measurement on milk production and reproduction.

The use of an automated concentrate feeder improved the annual carrier production of milk, milk protein, and milk fat (102, 4.95, and 5.52 kg per cow, respectively). In contrast, on-line measurement of milk production did not significantly affect milk production records. Calving interval was shortened by 5.7 d after the adoption of an activity measurement system but was not affected by the adoption of an automated concentrate feeder or by the measurement of on-line milk production. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3adairy herds 3aindividual feeding 3aconcentrates 3aphysical activity 3aautomated feeders 3ainformation 3adata analysis 3adairy farming 3amilk fat yield 3ainformation technology 3acalving interval 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairyingxmethodsxstatistics & numerical dataxtrends. 2aFemale 2aInformation Systems 2aLactation 2aRecords. 2aReproduction 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands 0amilk production 0amilk recording1 aHuirne, R.B.M.1 aDijkhuizen, A.A.1 aTomaszewski, M.A.1 aHarbers, A.G.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.2752-2759x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245011300170300001400283520143700297650001801734650001301752650001401765650001401779653001001793653001001803700001801813700002001831700002201851700002101873700002101894700002501915773015101940852000902091856006902100930003302169946001102202655001202213IND4385654320221118100657.0061203e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438565432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-006-2678-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObrenovich, Mark E. 10aRelative suppression of the sodium-dependent Vitamin C transport in mouse versus human lens epithelial cells  ap. 53-62.  aVitamin C is a major antioxidant and UV absorbent in the human lens. In the rodent lens, the levels are very low for unknown reasons. Searching for clues to explain this suppression, we investigated the comparative uptake of Vitamin C in cultured human and mouse lens epithelial cells. When compared to human HLE-B3 lens epithelial cells, ¹⁴C-ASA uptake was 4- to 10-fold impaired in confluent mouse lens 17EM15 (p < 0.0001) and 21EM15 (p < 0.001) cells, respectively. High glucose concentrations reduced the uptake by 30-50% in all cells (p < 0.005). Incubation of cells with 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-ascorbic (F-ASA), i.e. a probe specific for the sodium-dependent Vitamin C uptake (SVCT2), revealed a 10-fold uptake suppression into mouse 17EM15 relative to human HLE-B3 and JAR choriocarcinoma cells (a control), that could be overcome by overexpressing hSVCT2 using two different promoter constructs. The relative Vitamin C uptake differences suggest either low expression of SVCT2, molecular differences between the transporters themselves or their biological regulation, since a recent study has shown that exogenous feeding of ascorbic acid to rats increased only modestly lenticular uptake (Mody et al., Acta Ophthalmol Scand 83: 228-223, 2005). Elucidation of the mechanism by which SCVT2 activity is suppressed in mouse lens may help unravel a major question of evolutionary significance for night vision in nocturnal animals. 3aascorbic acid 3adiabetes 3aglycation 3aoxidation 0aaging 0aSVCT21 aFan, Xingjun 1 aSatake, Makoto 1 aJarvis, Simon M. 1 aReneker, Lixing 1 aReddan, John R. 1 aMonnier, Vincent M. 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2006 Dec., v. 293, no. 1-2 p.53-62dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-006-2678-73electronic resource  a20061203b20070102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02830naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015100165300001400316520174800330650002302078650001602101653002702117653002002144700002302164700001802187700001902205700002502224773011702249852000902366856008502375930003302460946001102493655001202504IND4393992620221118101221.0070812e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439399262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-007-9457-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigo, Ramon.10aRelationship between (Na + K)-ATPase activity, lipid peroxidation and fatty acid profile in erythrocytes of hypertensive and normotensive subjects  ap. 73-81.  aOxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenic mechanism of essential hypertension. Lipid peroxidation can alter the cellular structure of membrane-bound enzymes by changing the membrane phospholipids fatty acids composition. We investigated the relationship between (Na + K)-ATPase activity, lipid peroxidation, and erythrocyte fatty acid composition in essential hypertension. The study included 40 essential hypertensive and 49 healthy normotensive men (ages 35-60 years). Exclusion criteria were obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and any current medication. Patients underwent 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the plasma and erythrocytes as 8-isoprostane or malondialdehyde (MDA), respectively. Antioxidant capacity was measured as ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) in the plasma and as reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG ratio) in erythrocytes. (Na + K)-ATPase activity and fatty acids were determined in erythrocyte membranes. Hypertensives had higher levels of plasma 8-isoprostane, erythrocyte MDA, and relative percentage of saturated membrane fatty acids, but lower plasma FRAP levels, erythrocyte GSH/GSSG ratio, (Na + K)-ATPase activity and relative percentage of unsaturated membrane fatty acids, compared with normotensives. Day-time systolic and diastolic blood pressures correlated positively with lipid peroxidation parameters, but negatively with (Na + K)-ATPase activity. These findings suggest that the modulation of (Na + K)-ATPase activity may be associated with changes in the fatty acid composition induced by oxidative stress and provide evidence of a role for this enzyme in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension. 3alipid peroxidation 3afatty acids 0aEssential hypertension 0a(Na + K)-ATPase1 aBächler, Jean P. 1 aAraya, Julia 1 aPrat, Hernán 1 aPassalacqua, Walter 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2007 Sept., v. 303, no. 1-2 p.73-81dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-007-9457-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02295naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245011700173300001600290520120300306650001301509653002201522653000801544653002001552653001201572653001201584653001001596700002001606700002101626700002301647773015301670852000901823856006901832930003301901946001101934655001201945IND4387063720221118101147.0070122e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438706372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-006-9251-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRinta-Valkama, Johanna 10aPodocyte-associated proteins FAT, alpha-actinin-4 and filtrin are expressed in Langerhans islets of the pancreas  ap. 117-125.  aNephrin is a crucial podocyte molecule in the kidney glomerular filtration barrier and it is also expressed in Langerhans islet beta cells of the pancreas. Recently, genetic mapping of proteinuric kidney disease genes and animal models have revealed further important molecules for the kidney filtration function including alpha-actinin-4, podocin, FAT, and NEPH1. This study was addressed to explore the pancreatic expression of the podocyte molecules podocin, FAT, alpha-actinin-4, NEPH1, NEPH2, filtrin/NEPH3, synaptopodin and CD2 associated protein (CD2AP). The mRNA and protein expressions were studied by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, and localization in the pancreas was investigated by immunofluorescence. Of the nephrin-associated podocyte proteins, filtrin/NEPH3, FAT, and alpha-actinin-4 were found to be expressed in the pancreas at the gene and protein level and localized to Langerhans islets. Immunoreactivity with the podocin antibody was detected mostly in the exocrine pancreas. NEPH1 and synaptopodin expression was detected only at the mRNA level. Further studies are needed to unravel the functional role of these podocyte-associated molecules in the pancreatic Langerhans islets. 3apancreas 0apodocyte proteins 0aFAT 0aalpha-actinin-4 0apodocin 0afiltrin 0aNEPH31 aPalmén, Tuula 1 aLassila, Markus 1 aHolthöfer, Harry 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2007 Jan., v. 294, no. 1-2 p.117-125dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-006-9251-23electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245014000164300001400304520138000318650001801698650001501716650001301731650002101744653001101765653001501776700001701791700001301808700001501821700001401836700002301850773015101873852000902024856006902033930003302102946001102135655001202146IND4387227020221118101149.0070128e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438722702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-006-9268-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajaraman, G. 10aRole of cytosolic liver fatty acid binding protein in hepatocellular oxidative stress: effect of dexamethasone and clofibrate treatment  ap. 27-34.  aThe presence of cysteine and methionine groups together with an ability to bind long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) oxidation products makes liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) an attractive candidate against hepatocellular oxidative stress. In this report, we show that pharmacological treatment directed at modulating L-FABP level affected hepatocellular oxidant status. L-FABP expressing 1548-hepatoma cells, treated with dexamethasone or clofibrate, decreased and increased intracellular L-FABP levels, respectively. Oxidative stress was induced by H₂O₂ incubation or hypoxia-reoxygenation. The fluorescent marker, dichlorofluorescein (DCF), was employed to measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hepatocellular damage was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a significant increase in DCF fluorescence with higher LDH release compared to control cells. Clofibrate treatment, however, resulted in a significant decrease in both parameters (p < 0.05). Drug treatments did not affect cytosolic activites of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), or catalase suggesting that the differences between treated and control cells may likely be associated with varying L-FABP levels. We conclude that L-FABP may act as an effective endogenous cytoprotectant against hepatocellular oxidative stress. 3adexamethasone 3aclofibrate 3ahepatoma 3aoxidative stress 0aL-FABP 0ahepatocyte1 aWang, G.

This study was designed to elucidate whether high dose vancomycin (VCM) induces oxidative stress in liver and to investigate the protective effects of erdosteine, an expectorant agent. Twenty-two young Wistar rats were divided into three groups as follows: control group, VCM, and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administered intraperitoneally in the dosage of 200 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine was administered orally administered once a day at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. The activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase as well as the concentration of malondialdehyde, as an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were measured to evaluate oxidative stress in homogenates of the liver. VCM administration increased malondialdehyde levels (p < 0.001), superoxide dismutase (p < 0.01) and catalase (p < 0.001) activities. Erdosteine co-administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased malondialdehyde levels (p < 0.001), superoxide dismutase (p < 0.01) and catalase (p < 0.001) activities in liver tissue when compared with VCM alone. It can be concluded that erdosteine may prevent VCM-induced oxidative changes in liver by reducing reactive oxygen species. 3ahepatotoxicity 3amalondialdehyde 0aantioxidant enzymes 0avancomycin1 aCam, Hakan 1 aOlgar, Seref 1 aTunc, Sevket Ercan 1 aArslan, Cagatay 1 aUz, Efkan 1 aYilmaz, H.

Patch clamp of murine proximal tubule (TKPTS) cells revealed that BK (10 nM) produced an increase in an outwardly rectifying current from a basal level of 2.9 ± 0.6 to 13.8 ± 1.1 pA/pF following addition of BK (n = 8; p < 0.001). The shift in reversal potential seen with BK on changing the intracellular solution to 152 mM chloride and significant inhibition of the current by 100 μM 4,4'-di-isothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) suggested that BK activated a chloride current. BK-induced current was blocked by B2 receptor antagonist but not by B1 antagonist or pertussis toxin indicating that the current was mediated by B2 receptors possibly through Gq activation. TMB-8 completely blocked the BK-calcium rise in fura-2 studies but did not block the BK-chloride response indicating that BK-mediated chloride current is calcium-independent. BK-induced current was dependent on phospholipase C (PLC) since U73122, a PLC-β blocker (10 μM) blocked it completely. Furthermore, chloride conductance was not modulated by bisindolylmaleimide, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), but was enhanced by dibutyryl cAMP. We conclude that BK-induced rise in chloride current is mediated by B2 receptors and dependent on PLC activation but not dependent on calcium rise. Furthermore, the current can be modulated by cAMP but not PKC. 3abradykinin 0achloride current 0aproximal tubule1 aStimers, Joseph R. 1 aMayeux, Philip R. 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2007 Mar., v. 297, no. 1-2 p.1-8dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-006-9315-33electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02062naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009600123300001600219520102100235650002701256650002201283650001401305650002401319650002001343650002701363650002301390650002101413650003001434650001001464653001601474700001801490700002001508773009201528852000901620930003301629945001301662946001301675655001201688IND2329042320221118101148.0020924e200106  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232904232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, J.10aEffects of host resistance and temperature on development of Globodera tabacum solanacearum  ap. 132-136.  aPenetration and development of juveniles of tobacco cyst nematode (Globodera tabacum solanacearum) on a resistant (NC567) and a susceptible (K326) cultivar of flue-cured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) were determined in root zone chamber experiments.

Differences in resistance between the two cultivars remained stable across tested temperatures. 3aGlobodera solanacearum 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acultivars 3avarietal resistance 3anematode larvae 3abiological development 3apopulation density 3asoil temperature 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3ashape 0apenetration1 aJohnson, C.S.1 aEisenback, J.D.0 tJournal of nematology.g2001 , v. 33, no. 2/3 p.132-136wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20021201b20021209c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02445naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245009200124300001600216500001500232520109100247650002401338650001501362650002701377650003001404650001801434650002101452650001401473650003101487650002501518650002201543650001201565650001801577653001901595653001401614653002801628653002201656653002801678653002501706700001701731700001901748700002301767700001601790773007701806852000901883930003301892945001301925946001301938655001201951IND2329041920221118100943.0020924e200106  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232904192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBekal, S.10aPhenotypic and molecular analysis of a Pasteuria strain parasitic to the sting nematode  ap. 110-115.  a2019-12-05  aPasteuria strain S-1 was found to parasitize the sting nematode Belonolaimus longicaudatus. S-1 spores attached to several strains of B. longicaudatus from different geographical locations within the United States. However, they did not adhere to any of the following species: Heterodera schachtii, Longidorus africanus, Meloidogyne hapla M. incognita, M. javanica, Pratylenchus brachyurus, P. scribneri, P. neglectus, P. penetrans, P. thornei, P. vulnus, and Xiphinema spp. The 16S rRNA genes from Pasteuria strain S-1 and P. penetrans strain Pp from Senegal were obtained by PCR amplification. A DNA sequence analysis showed that the S-1 16S rRNA had 96% or less similarity to the 16S rRNA genes from all previously reported Pasteuria species. Diverse phylogenetic methods all provided robust support for an association of Pasteuria strain S-1, Pasteuria strain NA parasitic to H. glycines, and P. penetrans strain Pp, to the exclusion of P. ramosa. In addition, our study showed intraspecific variation within P. penetrans as inferred by its 98% similarity to P. penetrans strain Pp. 3aPasteuria penetrans 3ahost range 3aspore-forming bacteria 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aribosomal DNA 3agenetic distance 3aphylogeny 3aBelonolaimus longicaudatus 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3astrains 3achemotaxonomy 0amicroparasites 0aparasites 0ahost strain differences 0a16s ribosomal dna 0amolecular sequence data 0apasteuria strain s-11 aBorneman, J.1 aSpringer, M.S.1 aGiblin-Davis, R.M.1 aBecker, Jo.0 tJournal of nematology.g2001 , v. 33, no. 2/3 p.110-115x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20021201b20021209c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03218naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014000126300001600266500001500282520188800297650001802185650001902203650002602222650002102248650002102269650001702290650002502307650001502332650000902347650002102356650001602377653001602393653002602409653002802435653003202463700002402495700001402519700001602533700001902549700001502568773009902583852000902682930003302691945001302724946001102737655001202748IND2052600820221118100946.0960814e19960412ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205260082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordoni, A.10aMetabolism of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids in cultured cardiomyocytes: effect of different N-6 and N-3 fatty acid supplementation  ap. 217-222.  a2019-12-05  aThe metabolites of linoleic (LA) and alpha-linolenic (ALA) acids are involved in coronary heart disease. Both n-6 and n-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) are likely to be important in prevention of atherosclerosis since the common risk factors are associated with their reduced 6-desaturation. We previously demonstrated the ability of heart tissue to desaturate LA. In this study we examined the ability of cultured cardiomyocytes to metabolize both LA and ALA in vivo, in the absence and in the presence of gamma linolenic acid (GLA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) alone or combined together. In control conditions, about 25% of LA and about 90% of ALA were converted in PUFAs. GLA supplementation had no influence on LA conversion to more unsaturated fatty acids, while the addition of n-3 fatty acids, alone or combined together, significantly decreased the formation of interconversion products from LA. Using the combination of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs, GLA seemed to counterbalance partially the inhibitory effect of EPA and DHA on LA desaturation/elongation. The conversion of ALA to more unsaturated metabolites was greatly affected by GLA supplementation. Each supplemented fatty acid was incorporated to a significant extent into cardiomyocyte lipids, as revealed by gas chromatographic analysis. The n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio was greatly influenced by the different supplementations; the ratio in GLA+EPA+DHA supplemented cardiomyocytes was the most similar to that recorded in control cardiomyocytes. Since important risk factors for coronary disease may be associated with reduced 6-desaturation of the parent EFAs, administration of n-6 or n-3 EFA metabolites alone could cause undesirable effects. Since they appear to have different and synergistic roles, only combined treatment with both n-6 and n-3 metabolites is likely to achieve optimum results. 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3adocosenoic acids 3aisotope labeling 3acell culture 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3amyocardium 3arats 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolites 0acomposition 0afatty acid elongation 0afatty acid desaturation 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aLopez-Jimenez, J.A.1 aSpano, C.1 aBiagi, P.L.1 aHorrobin, D.F.1 aHrelia, S.0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g1996 Apr. 12, v. 157, no. 1/2 p.217-222x0300-81777nnas  aDNAL  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02642naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245005300142300001600195520149600211650001101707650002001718650001501738650002101753650002201774650001801796650001001814650001901824650001101843650001401854650002501868650002501893650002301918651001201941653002801953700001701981700001601998700001702014773008702031852000902118930003302127945002502160946001102185655001202196IND4369796020221118100937.0050512e20050410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436979602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBreard, E.10aBluetongue virus in the French Island of Reunion  ap. 157-165.  aThis paper records the results of a bluetongue virus (BTV) serological survey and reports the first isolation of BTV on the French Island of Reunion. In January 2003, the French Island of Reunion, located off the coast of Madagascar, reported an outbreak of disease in cattle that resembled clinical bluetongue (BT) in sheep. The suspected causal agent was isolated and identified as epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer virus (EHDV). However, because of the similarity in the clinical signs to those of BT, a retrospective survey against BTV was carried out using sera collected in 2002. Results revealed the presence of antibody in all sera tested indicating that BTV has been resident on the Island since 2002, and probably earlier. Although up to July 2003 no clinical BT had ever been reported in sheep, BTV viral RNA was amplified by RT-PCR from a single sheep blood collected in February that year, which strongly suggested that BTV was currently circulating on the Island. Following a second outbreak of disease in August 2003, this time involving a flock of Merino sheep, infectious BTV was finally isolated, and identified by both traditional and molecular techniques as serotype 3. The nucleotide and amino-acid sequences of the RT-PCR products amplified for BTV segments 7 and 10 from the sheep blood collected in February and August from different areas of the Island, were sufficiently diverse as to suggest that they were of different origins and/or different BTV serotypes. 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3abluetongue 3aBluetongue virus 3adisease outbreaks 3aserodiagnosis 3asheep 3asheep diseases 3aMerino 3aserotypes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3amicrobial genetics 3aReunion 0amolecular sequence data1 aSailleau, C.1 aHamblin, C.1 aZientara, S.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Apr. 10, v. 106, no. 3-4 p.157-165x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02397naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012100163300001400284520136500298650001101663653003701674653001701711653002001728700001801748700001701766700001401783700002001797773011601817852000901933856008501942930003302027946001102060655001202071IND4398529220221118101010.0071209e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439852922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-007-9587-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Gui-Fen 10aAlteration of mitochondrial oxidative capacity during porcine preadipocyte differentiation and in response to leptin  ap. 83-91.  aMitochondrial apparatus is a fundamental aspect in cell, serving for amino acid biosynthesis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and ATP production. In this article, we investigated the change of mitochondrial oxidative capacity during porcine adipocyte differentiation and in response to leptin. Rhodamine 123 staining analysis showed about 2-fold increase of mitochondrial membrane electric potential in differentiated adipocyte in comparison with preadipocyte. The mRNA expression of Cytochromes c (Cyt c), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), and malate dehydrogenases (MDH) increased markedly (P < 0.05), but that of UCP2 decreased (P < 0.05). Moreover PGC-1α and UCP3 was very low and showed no changes during the adipocyte differentiation. The protein expression of Cyt c and the enzyme activity of Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) increased with preadipocyte differentiation, but cellular ATP level decreased. Furthermore, at the level of 10 and 100 ng/ml leptin not only selectively increased the gene expression of PGC-1α, CPT1, Cyt c, UCP2, and UCP3 (P < 0.05), but also enhanced COX enzyme activity which related to mitochondrial FAO. There is no change of Mitochondrial membrane electric potential and ATP level in cell treated by leptin. These results suggested Mitochondrial is not only critical in FAO, but also play an important role in adipogenesis. 3aleptin 0aMitochondrial oxidative capacity 0aPreadipocyte 0aDifferentiation1 aYu, Tai-Yong 1 aWen, Xu-Hui 1 aLi, Ying 1 aYang, Gong-She 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2008 Jan., v. 307, no. 1-2 p.83-91dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-007-9587-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02706naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009000167300001600257520172200273650002501995653005102020653001502071653001802086700002102104700002202125773011902147852000902266856008502275930003302360946001102393655001202404IND4393991920221118101009.0070812e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439399192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-007-9474-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurakami, Masaru 10aExpression and transcriptional activity of alternative splice variants of Mitf exon 6  ap. 251-257.  aMicrophthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) is a tissue-specific transcription factor. At least nine distinct mouse isoform mRNAs are encoded by alternative splicing of the first exon of Mitf (Mitf-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -H, -J, -M, and -mc), while exons 2-9 of all Mitf isoforms examined to date are identical. In addition, alternative splice variants of exon 6a encoding 6 amino acid proximal to the basic region of the protein are known in Mitf-A, -H, and -M. In this study, we identified alternative splice variants of exon 6a in other Mitf isoforms (Mitf-E, -J, and -mc) in melanocytes, mast cells, macrophages, and heart. We also compared the transcriptional activity of Mitf variants containing exon 6a to that of Mitf variants that did not contain exon 6a. PCR-RFLP analysis revealed that expression of Mitf with exon 6a was comparable with that of Mitf without exon 6a, irrespective of the specificity of the first exon, or cell type, although Mitf isoforms with different first exons were expressed in a cell type-dependent manner. Luciferase-based reporter assays revealed that transcription of Tyrosinase, which is known Mitf-regulated gene, was elicited more efficiently by expression of Mitf isoforms containing exon 6a, compared to isoforms that did not contain exon 6a. However, when transcription of Tyrp-1, Mmcp-6, and PAI-1 was examined, no significant differences were detected between Mitf isoforms with exon 6a and those without exon 6a, except for Tyrp-1 transcription by Mitf-D/E isoform. These results reveal a diverse pattern of gene expression and different transcriptional activities of Mitf isoforms, suggesting discrete regulation of gene transcription in specific tissues by Mitf. 3aalternative splicing 0aMicrophthalmia-associated transcription factor 0aExpression 0aTranscription1 aIwata, Yasuhiro 1 aFunaba, Masayuki 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2007 Sept., v. 303, no. 1-2 p.251-257dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-007-9474-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02663naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012500160300001400285520155300299650001601852653002001868653001901888653001301907653001601920700001901936700002101955700001801976700001901994700001802013700001602031773011602047852000902163856008502172930003302257946001102290655001202301IND4397122820221118100549.0071028e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439712282DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-005-9014-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lijun.10aSimvastatin attenuates hypertrophic responses induced by cardiotrophin-1 via JAK-STAT pathway in cultured cardiomyocytes  ap. 65-71.  aCardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is a cytokine involved in the growth and survival of cardiac cells via activation of the Janus activated kinase/signal transducer activator of transcription (JAK/STAT). Statins, 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have effects that extend beyond cholesterol reduction and inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and cardiac hypertrophy. However, whether stains also can inhibitin vitromyocardial hypertrophy or not still remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of simvastatin on the hypertrophy of cultured rat cardiomyocytes induced by CT-1 and to investigate whether this effect was mediated via JAK-STAT signaling pathway.Methods and Results: Primary cardiomyocytes from 2-day-old (P2) rats were cultured, stimulated with CT-1, and treated with various concentration of simvastatin. Incorporation of [³H] leucine, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting techniques were used to investigate cardiacmyocyte size, ANP mRNA and JAK-STAT protein expression. Simvastatin was proved, in a dose-independent manner, to decrease cardiacmyocytes size as well as protein synthesis, and inhibit ANP mRNA synthesis and JAK-STAT protein expression induced by CT-1 in cardiacmyocytes.Conclusion: These results suggest that simvastatin can ameliorate cardiacmyocytes hypertrophyin vitrovia JAK-STAT signaling pathways. The present study provides a novel understanding and alternative therapeutic strategy for cardiac hypertrophy 3ahypertrophy 0acardiotrophin-1 0acardiacmyocyte 0aJAK-STAT 0asimvastatin1 aZhao, LianYou 1 aZheng, QiangSun 1 aShang, FuJun 1 aWang, XianMei 1 aWang, Lifeng.1 aLang, Bing 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2006 Mar., v. 284, no. 1-2 p.65-71dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-005-9014-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02839naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245012200144300001400266500001500280520139100295650002101686650002301707650001401730650002501744650002701769650002201796650002101818650003701839650002401876650001101900651001201911653004101923653001401964653002101978653003101999653002202030653001202052653001902064700001302083700001502096700001602111700001602127700001502143773008502158852000902243930003302252945002502285946001102310655001202321IND4369742820221118100540.0050509e20050425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436974282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In 2000, equine influenza virus was detected in a nasal swab from a non-vaccinated horse using a rapid diagnostic kit, but was not successfully isolated. Partial direct sequencing of the haemagglutinin (HA1) gene, indicated that the virus was a European lineage H3N8 subtype strain representative of strains isolated in several European countries during 2000. In 2002, two equine influenza viruses were isolated from nasal swabs both taken from unvaccinated horses with acute respiratory symptoms housed at the same stables. Antigenic characterisation using a panel of ferret antisera suggested that these isolates also belonged to the European lineage of H3N8 viruses. Analysis of deduced HA1 amino acid sequences confirmed that the HA1 of both isolates were identical and belonged to the European lineage. However, from phylogenetic analysis, both strains appeared to be more closely related to viruses isolated between 1989 and 1995 than to viruses isolated more recently in Europe. These results suggested that viruses with fewer changes than those on the main evolutionary lineage may continue to circulate. The importance of expanding current equine influenza surveillance efforts is emphasised. 3aequine influenza 3astrain differences 3aphylogeny 3alongitudinal studies 3ahemagglutination tests 3adisease outbreaks 3aInfluenzavirus A 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aantigenic variation 3ahorses 3aGermany 0aviral diseases of animals and humans 0aevolution 0aOrthomyxoviridae 0arespiratory tract diseases 0agenetic variation 0astrains 0ahorse diseases1 aDaly, J.1 aStiens, G.1 aKreling, K.1 aKreling, I.1 aLudwig, H.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Apr. 25, v. 107, no. 1-2 p.13-21x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20060626b20060702c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/06/16  aNon-US 7aarticle01955naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009200129300001600221500001500237520076400252650001401016650001601030650003001046650002201076650002401098650001301122650001501135650001501150650002601165650002301191650002001214650002501234650002101259650002001280651001901300653001701319653002301336773009401359852000901453930003301462945001301495946001301508655001201521IND2331702120221118100552.0030401e200212  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233170212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoenning, S.R.10aTolerance to Hoplolaimus columbus in glyphosate-resistant, transgenic soybean cultivars  ap. 370-373.  a2019-12-05  aTransgenic soybean cultivars, resistant to glyphosate herbicide in maturity groups V and VI, were evaluated for tolerance to the Columbia lance nematode, Hoplolaimus columbus, in field experiments conducted in 1998 and 1999.

Dexamethasone markedly increased basal and insulin-stimulated IRS-1 content 4 to 5-fold (p < 0.01). A similar level of increase was observed for IRS-1 pY content. However, dexamethasone treatment had no effect on IRS-1 pS content. Further, dexamethasone reduced the cellular content of GLUT-1 when insulin and glucose were absent (p < 0.05), but did not significantly affect the expression of GLUT-4 in the presence of insulin (p > 0.05). We conclude that dexamethasone treatment impairs insulin signalling by a mechanism independent of serine-phosphorylation-mediated IRS-1 depletion, or of impairment of GLUT-1 expression. Instead, dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance may be mediated via reduced cellular content of IRS-1 accompanied by parallel reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation in IRS-1. 3asignal transduction 0adexamethasone, insulin receptor substrate-1 0aphosphorylated tyrosine (pY) 0aphosphorylated serine (pS) residues 0aglucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4)1 aBadal, Simone 1 aMorrison, Seian 1 aRagoobirsingh, Dalip 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2007 Mar., v. 297, no. 1-2 p.171-177dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-006-9344-y3electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02291naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245012000176300001600296520131000312650001901622650000901641653005001650653002201700773015301722852000901875856008501884930003301969946001102002655001202013IND4393740420221118101114.0070805e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439374042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-007-9416-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathew, Thazhumpal Chacko 10aDiversity in the surface morphology of adjacent epithelial cells of the choroid plexus: an ultrastructural analysis  ap. 235-239.  aIt is generally known that the luminal surface of the choroidal epithelial cells is covered with a luxuriant coat of slender microvilli and cilia. However, extensive ultrastructural studies on the surface morphology of choroidal epithelial cells are lacking. This study, therefore, is focused on the detailed surface morphology of the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle of adult Wistar rats using transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The animals were anesthetized, perfused with 0.9% oxygenated saline followed by 3% gluteraldehyde and the choroid plexus was processed for routine electron microscopy. The results of the ultrastructural observations presented in this study show that even the neighboring choroidal epithelial cells may express distinct morphology. In addition to the usually described morphology of choroidal epithelial cells, in this study, the presence of cells with uniform small blebs, crenulated or doughnut shaped structures, large mature blebs, or cells with an extensive network of fibers were observed. Although, dissimilar surface morphology of adjacent choroidal epithelial cells may indicate their distinct functional status, further studies are necessary to understand the physiological relevance of the varied surface morphology of choroidal epithelial cells. 3achoroid plexus 3arats 0aScanning and transmission electron microscopy 0aLateral ventricle0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2007 July, v. 301, no. 1-2 p.235-239dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-007-9416-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03211naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245019800158300001600356500001500372520167700387650002502064650002202089650001602111650001802127650001902145650002602164650002302190650002602213650003802239650002902277650002602306650001002332653001602342653002702358653002202385700001302407700001302420700001302433700001402446700001502460700001202475700001602487700001302503773008702516852000902603930003302612945002502645946001102670655001202681IND4369503420221118101113.0050504e20050225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436950342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOkada, M.10aSerological diagnosis of enzootic pneumonia of swine by a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a monoclonal antibody and recombinant antigen (P46) of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae  ap. 251-259.  a2019-12-05  aTo facilitate the control of enzootic pneumonia (EP) of swine caused by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the complement fixation (CF) test has been used for the detection of M. hyopneumoniae antibodies. However, the CF test is a cumbersome and time-consuming technique and cross-reactivity are major drawbacks associated with this method. To circumvent these drawbacks, we have developed a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), consisting of purified monoclonal antibody (Mab) against the 46 kDa surface antigen (P46) of M. hyopneumoniae and recombinant P46 protein expressed in Escherichia coli, for the detection of antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae in serum samples from pigs experimentally inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae and from naturally infected pigs, and compared the practical usefulness of ELISA using the CF test. In experimentally inoculated pigs, the CF and ELISA antibodies were detected at almost the same time, and a good correlation was demonstrated between the CF test and the ELISA. In a survey conducted on field samples, the seropositivity by ELISA in pigs of age 2-6 months was increased. At the time of slaughter, approximately 80% of the animals were seropositive for ELISA. However, a gradual decrease in the prevalence of ELISA positive samples was observed in sows with increasing parity. No correlation was seen between the results obtained with the two methods in the clinical samples. The CF test appears to have limited value for the diagnosis of EP in conventional herds because nonspecific reactions were frequently observed. Therefore, this ELISA is a useful alternative to the CF test currently used for the diagnosis of EP. 3arecombinant antigens 3adisease detection 3ablood serum 3aserodiagnosis 3aswine diseases 3aMycoplasma pneumoniae 3aantibody detection 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3afield experimentation 3aswine 0amethodology 0aimmunologic techniques 0adisease diagnosis1 aAsai, T.1 aFuto, S.1 aMori, Y.1 aMukai, T.1 aYazawa, S.1 aUto, T.1 aShibata, I.1 aSato, S.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Feb. 25, v. 105, no. 3-4 p.251-259x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/06/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02354naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245015600145300001600301500001500317520108300332650001201415650001801427650002301445650002101468650001001489650001701499650001801516650001701534650002401551650004801575650001901623650001101642653001801653700001701671700001801688700001701706700002001723773008701743852000901830930003301839945002501872946001101897655001201908IND4369502820221118101138.0050504e20050225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436950282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Of 4 adult and 16 juvenile orally dosed rabbits M. paratuberculosis organisms were recovered bacteriologically from two and three animals, respectively, using the BACTEC radiometric culture system. Tissue sites from which the bacteria were recovered included the mesenteric lymph nodes, ileocaecal valve, vermiform appendix, caecum, proximal colon and jejunum. Body weight loss, reduced abdominal fat and mild lesions were observed at necropsy in four infected rabbits. Diarrhoea and persistent faecal shedding of bacteria were not observed.

Parasitism by the host-specific, entomopathogenic nematode Thripinema nicklewoodi may provide a much-needed alternative to current control strategies. Infection does not cause death of the host; rather, the result is sterilization that leads to suppression of F. occidentalis populations. We describe a simple rearing method and the results from studies aimed at providing details on its biology--both essential first steps to examining its biological control potential. All F. occidentalis life stages are susceptible to infection, but to varying degrees (most susceptible to least susceptible): female pupae, second instar larvae, first instar larvae, male pupae, adult females, adult males. Nematodes emerge from female and male F. occidentalis for approximately 15 and 9 days, with approximately 14 and 7 nematodes emerging per day, respectively. Females and males are short-lived outside of the host, with mean survival rates ranging between 7 and 86 hours. Transmission does not occur in the soil but rather on or within plant structures that are preferred microhabitats visited by F. occidentalis. Results from a dose-response study suggest that augmentative applications of T. nicklewoodi may be useful to generate increased infection rates and subsequent suppression of F. occidentalis populations. 3aAllantonematidae 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aparasitism 3adevelopmental stages 3abiological development 3amortality 3ainfection 3adose response 3abiological control agents 3aparasites 3arearing 3abiological resistance 0aparasites of insect pests 0ainfection site1 aHeinz, K.M.0 tJournal of nematology.g2002 Dec., v. 34, no. 4 p.332-339wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02822naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245019500165300001400360520165600374650000902030653003102039653002202070653002602092653002802118653001802146653001302164700001702177700001702194773015102211852000902362856006902371930003302440946001102473655001202484IND4388439120221118101032.0070304e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438843912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-006-9298-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, Sean 10aIncreased glucose oxidation in H-FABP null soleus muscle is associated with defective triacylglycerol accumulation and mobilization, but not with the defect of exogenous fatty acid oxidation  ap. 59-67.  aHeart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) is a major fatty acid-binding factor in skeletal muscles. Genetic lack of H-FABP severely impairs the esterification and oxidation of exogenous fatty acids in soleus muscles isolated from chow-fed mice (CHOW-solei) and high fat diet-fed mice (HFD-solei), and prevents the HFD-induced accumulation of muscle triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here, we examined the impact of H-FABP deficiency on the relationship between fatty acid utilization and glucose oxidation. Glucose oxidation was measured in isolated soleus muscles in the presence or absence of 1 mM palmitate (simple protocol) or in the absence of fatty acid after preincubation with 1 mM palmitate (complex protocol). With the simple protocol, the mutation slightly reduced glucose oxidation in CHOW-muscles, but markedly increased it in HFD-muscles; unexpectedly, this pattern was not altered by the addition of palmitate, which reduced glucose oxidation in both CHOW- and HFD-solei irrespective of the mutation. In the complex protocol, the mutation first inhibited the synthesis and accumulation of TAGs and then their mobilization; with this protocol, the mutation increased glucose oxidation in both CHOW- and HFD-solei. We conclude: (i) H-FABP mediates a non-acute inhibition of muscle glucose oxidation by fatty acids, likely by enabling both the accumulation and mobilization of a critical mass of muscle TAGs; (ii) H-FABP does not mediate the acute inhibitory effect of extracellular fatty acids on muscle glucose oxidation; (iii) H-FABP affects muscle glucose oxidation in opposing ways, with inhibition prevailing at high muscle TAG contents. 3amice 0afatty acid binding protein 0aglucose oxidation 0afatty acid metabolism 0atriglyceride metabolism 0anull mutation 0afat diet1 aErol, Erdal 1 aBinas, Bert 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2007 Feb., v. 296, no. 1-2 p.59-67dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-006-9298-03electronic resource  a20070304b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02484naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245013600141300001600277520128600293650001901579650002501598650002301623650001001646650003101656650001601687650001401703650001201717650004101729650001401770650001601784650001501800650001401815650003701829653001301866700001801879773008701897852000901984930003301993945002502026946001102051655001202062IND4369502420221118100756.0050504e20050225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436950242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLun, S.C.10aPutative mannose-specific phosphotransferase system component IID represses expression of suilysin in serotype 2 Streptococcus suis  ap. 169-180.  aIn this study, we generated a genomic mutant library from a North American strain of serotype 2 Streptococcus suis using the pGh9:ISS1 transposition vector. Suilysin is the hemolysin made by S. suis. A hyper-hemolytic mutant was identified by screening for hemolytic phenotype using media with human blood. The hyper-hemolytic phenotype was characterised by a quantitative hemolysis microplate method. The use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter also showed that suilysin gene expression was greater in the mutant. DNA sequence analysis of 3.8 kb surrounding the ISS1 insertion site revealed four open reading frames (ORFs) with three consecutive ORFs that belong to a putative mannose-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS). The S. suis gene homologous to mannose permease IID, manN, was interrupted by the transposon. A complementation test showed that manN repressed the expression of suilysin and the absence of manN was responsible for the hyper-hemolytic phenotype. However, both wild type and isogenic hyper-hemolytic mutant S. suis fermented mannose, glucose and lactose. Thus, despite its potential roles in carbohydrate transport, phosphorylation and metabolism, the manN homologue in the putative mannose-specific PTS regulates gene expression in S. suis. 3aswine diseases 3abacterial infections 3aStreptococcus suis 3aswine 3agene expression regulation 3amutagenesis 3aserotypes 3amannose 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3ahemolysis 3atransposons 3ahemolysins 3aphenotype 3agenetic techniques and protocols 0asuilysin1 aWillson, P.J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Feb. 25, v. 105, no. 3-4 p.169-180x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/06/15  aNon-US 7aarticle03364naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245008800146300001600234500001500250520147800265650001501743650002301758650001801781650001201799650001801811650002201829650001601851650001301867650001501880650001901895650001401914650001601928650002401944650001801968650001901986650002802005650001702033650001602050650004702066650001202113650002302125650001802148650002102166650001902187650005502206650002602261650001102287650001402298650002802312650002002340650001302360653001602373653001502389653001902404653001302423700001802436700001802454700001502472700001702487773008202504852000902586930003302595945001302628946001302641655001202654IND2200886420221118100759.0991001e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088642DNAL7 a100689622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhiman, T.R.10aConjugated linoleic acid content of milk and cheese from cows fed extruded oilseeds  ap. 412-419.  a2019-12-05  aExtruded oilseeds were fed to 24 dairy cows to study the influence on the conjugated linoleic acid content of milk and cheese. Cows were fed one of three diets that contained forage and grain in a ratio of 47:53. A control diet containing 13.5% soybean meal was compared with diets containing 12% full fat extruded soybeans or 12% full fat extruded cottonseed. The control, extruded soybean, and extruded cottonseed diets contained 2.73, 4.89, and 4.56% fatty acids, respectively. Measurements were made during the last 5 wk of the 8-wk experiment. The DM intakes and 3.5% fat-corrected milk yields were higher for cows fed the extruded soybean and extruded cottonseed diets than for cows fed the control diet. A tendency for lower fat and protein contents in the milk of cows fed the extruded soybean and extruded cottonseed diets was detected. Most of the C18 fatty acids were increased in the milk and cheese when extruded soybeans and cottonseeds were fed. The conjugated linoleic acid content in milk and cheese increased a mean of 109% when full fat extruded soybeans were fed and increased 77% when cottonseeds were fed compared with the conjugated linoleic acid content when the control diet was fed. Processing the milk into cheese did not alter the conjugated linoleic acid content. The conjugated linoleic acid content of milk and cheese can be increased by the inclusion of full fat extuded soybeans and full fat extruded cottonseeds in the diets of dairy cows. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3alinoleic acid 3alactose 3aenergy intake 3amozzarella cheese 3abody weight 3asoybeans 3acottonseed 3aprotein intake 3aextrusion 3afeed intake 3amilk fat percentage 3ahydrogenation 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein percentage 3asoybean meal 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEdible Grain. 2aCheesexanalysis 2aCottonseed Oil 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aLinoleic Acidxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSoybeans 0afatty acids 0adry matter 0asolids not fat 0amilk fat1 aHelmink, E.D.1 aMcMahon, D.J.1 aFife, R.L.1 aPariza, M.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.412-419x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02938naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245012300147300001600270520146700286650001501753650001301768650002701781650002001808650001001828650000901838650001101847650001001858650001101868650002001879650003201899650001201931650002201943650002301965650000901988650001101997650002302008650004702031650002802078650003402106650002002140650005602160700001602216700001402232700001202246773008202258852000902340930003302349945001302382946001302395655001202408IND2200886720221118100808.0991001e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088672DNAL7 a100689642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnowles, S.O.10aSignificance of amount and form of dietary selenium on blood, milk, and casein selenium concentrations in grazing cows  ap. 429-437.  aOrganic selenized yeast enriched with selenoamino acids or inorganic sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) was administered per os three times weekly as a drench for 133 d to previously unsupplemented cows that were grazing low Se pastures. Treatment groups received the equivalent of 2 or 4 mg of Se/d of either supplement form. Control cows did not receive a drench. Samples of blood and milk were collected regularly throughout the trial. Selenium concentrations in blood, milk, casein, and liver and glutathione peroxidase activity in blood and liver are reported as responses per milligram of Se intake. Mean blood Se concentrations in treated cows increased steadily and, by d 133, were 4.7 to 8.8 times that in controls. Selenized yeast was 2 to 3 times more effective than was Na2SeO4, and low Se intakes were 27% more efficient per milligram of Se administered than were high Se intakes at increasing milk Se concentration. Casein Se content mirrored that of milk; among all treated and control cows and throughout the trial, the molar ratio of Se in casein as a percentage of the Se in whole milk was constant at 71 +/- 1.2%. The Se concentration in liver biopsies taken on d 133 was indicative of total Se intake during the trial and ranged from 920 to 3920 nmol of Se/kg of fresh weight. These results demonstrate the differing efficacy of organic and inorganic Se dietary supplements to increase dairy cow Se status and to enhance Se content of milk and casein. 3adairy cows 3aselenium 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aenzyme activity 3ablood 3amilk 3acasein 3aliver 3ayeasts 3abioavailability 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxanalysis 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aGlutathionexblood 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aLiverxchemistryxenzymology. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexanalysisxblood.1 aGrace, N.D.1 aWurms, K.1 aLee, J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.429-437x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02828naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007700129300001600206500001500222520161700237650002301854650001501877650001201892650002601904650001601930650002501946650001201971650001101983650002601994650002302020650001602043650002002059653001602079653000802095700002302103700001802126700001602144700001502160700001602175700001702191773008202208852000902290930003302299945001302332946001302345655001202358IND2200885420221118100821.0991001e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoblentz, W.K.10aDegradation of forage proteins by in situ and in vitro enzymatic methods  ap. 343-354.  a2019-12-05  aThe overall objective of these two studies was to evaluate the efficacy of using the proteolytic enzyme from Streptomyces griseus to estimate concentrations of ruminally degradable protein (RDP) in a wide array of forages. In the first study, alfalfa and prairie hays that previously had been evaluated in vivo for RDP were incubated in a replicated 3 X 3 factorial combination of enzyme concentrations (6.6, 0.66, and 0.066 activity units/ml of incubation medium) and incubation times (2, 4, and 48 h). Two treatment combinations (6.6 activity units for 4 h and 0.066 activity units for 48 h) yielded respective RDP estimates for alfalfa and prairie hay that were close to the known in vivo values. In the second study, 20 diverse forages were evaluated for RDP by using the in situ technique. These forages also were evaluated for RDP with the two enzyme concentrations identified in the first study, but incubation times were expanded to include 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h at the high concentration and 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 54 h at the low concentration. At the high enzyme concentration, r2 statistics from linear regressions of enzymatic estimates of RDP on corresponding estimates obtained by the in situ procedure were high (r2 greater than or equal to 0.898) at all incubation times; in addition, slopes (range = 0.88 to 1.00) and intercepts (range = -9.4 to 3.5%) approached unity and 0, respectively. At the lower enzyme concentration, r2 statistics were still good (>0.81), but slopes (0.59 to 0.67) and intercepts (18.5 to 21.9%) for all incubation times did not meet the respective goals of unity and 0. 3adigestible protein 3aestimation 3agrasses 3alaboratory techniques 3aproteinases 3aStreptomyces griseus 3aalfalfa 3asteers 3aproximate composition 3arumen fermentation 3aalfalfa hay 3aenzyme activity 0acannulation 0ahay1 aAbdelgadir, I.E.O.1 aCochran, R.C.1 aFritz, J.O.1 aFick, W.H.1 aOlson, K.C.1 aTurner, J.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.343-354x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02826naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245015900124300001600283500001500299520156400314650001501878650001701893650002801910650001201938650002001950650002101970650001801991650002402009650001302033650001502046650001902061650001502080650001502095653001202110653002102122653002702143653001102170700001902181700001802200773008202218852000902300930003302309945001302342946001302355655001202368IND2200883320221118100810.0991001e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeuer, C.10aPostpartum body condition score and results from the first test day milk as predictors of disease, fertility, yield, and culling in commercial dairy herds  ap. 275-304.  a2019-12-05  aThe study used field data from a regular herd health service to investigate the relationships between body condition scores or first test day milk data and disease incidence, milk yield, fertility, and culling. Path model analysis with adjustment for time at risk was applied to delineate the time sequence of events. Milk fever occurred more often in fat cows, and endometritis occurred between calving and 20 d of lactation more often in thin cows. Fat cows were less likely to conceive at first service than were cows in normal condition. Fat body condition postpartum, higher first test day milk yield, and a fat to protein ratio of >1.5 increased body condition loss. Fat or thin condition or condition loss was not related to other lactation diseases, fertility parameters, milk yield, or culling. First test day milk yield was 1.3 kg higher after milk fever and was 7.1 kg lower after displaced abomasum. Higher first test day milk yield directly increased the risk of ovarian cyst and lameness, increased 100-d milk yield, and reduced the risk of culling and indirectly decreased reproductive performance. Cows with a fat to protein ratio of >1.5 had higher risks for ketosis, displaced abomasum, ovarian cyst, lameness, and mastitis. Those cows produced more milk but showed poor reproductive performance. Given this type of herd health data, we concluded that the first test day milk yield and the fat to protein ratio were more reliable indicators of disease, fertility, and milk yield than was body condition score or loss of body condition score. 3adairy cows 3aendometritis 3amilk protein percentage 3aketosis 3abovine mastitis 3alactation number 3adairy farming 3amilk fat percentage 3aabomasum 3amilk yield 3abody condition 3amilk fever 3aprediction 0aculling 0amilk composition 0amilk recording results 0aratios1 aSchukken, Y.H.1 aDobbelaar, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.275-304x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03254naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245009800158300001600256500001500272520165100287650001401938650001801952650001901970650001001989650001501999650002502014650002202039650001102061650003702072650001402109650003002123650002302153650001702176650002302193650001002216650001202226650001302238650002602251650001402277650002102291650001702312650002202329651001602351653001502367653001902382653001702401700001402418700001402432700001402446700001502460773008702475852000902562930003302571945002502604946001102629655001202640IND4369797820221118100734.0050512e20050410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436979782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSeo, K.S.10aComparison of vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolates from human, poultry and pigs in Korea  ap. 225-233.  a2019-12-05  aVancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen. Since 1989, a rapid increase in the incidence of enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis by VRE has been reported. The use of avoparcin in animal husbandry is reportedly associated with the appearance of VRE. In this study, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was established to detect and differentiate resistant types of enterococci, which specifically amplify the four van genes that encode vancomycin resistance elements. Using this method, we investigated the incidence rates and types of VRE from two types of farms: those that had used avoparcin and those that had not used avoparcin. A total of 1091 animal fecal samples were collected from 70 pig farms and 32 poultry farms. A total of 425 enterococci were isolated from the fecal samples. Among the 425 isolates, six showed a pattern of high-level vancomycin resistance (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration, MIC: 64-256 microgram/ml). Out of six high-level VRE, three were isolated from poultry farms that had used avoparcin and three were not. The six high-level VRE harbored the vanA gene. Sixty-seven of 425 isolates that showed a pattern of low-level vancomycin resistance (MIC: 4-8 microgram/ml) were associated with the presence of vanC-1 or vanC-2/3 gene. We also performed a repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) method to compare the genetic relatedness between the high-level VRE of six animal isolates and 31 human isolates. None of the animal isolates had a similar rep-PCR pattern as the human isolates but similarities between human VRE isolates were observed. 3aphylogeny 3aglycopeptides 3aswine diseases 3afarms 3abacteremia 3abacterial infections 3adisease detection 3ahumans 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3ahospitals 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astrain differences 3aEnterococcus 3amicrobial genetics 3aswine 3apoultry 3azoonoses 3aantibiotic resistance 3aavoparcin 3apoultry diseases 3aendocarditis 3adisease incidence 3aSouth Korea 0avancomycin 0ahuman diseases 0aepidemiology1 aLim, J.Y.1 aYoo, H.S.1 aBae, W.K.1 aPark, Y.H.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2005 Apr. 10, v. 106, no. 3-4 p.225-233x0378-11357nnas  aDNAL  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03192naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245010700145300001600252520079700268650001501065650002201080650001301102650001801115650002101133650001901154650002101173650002001194650001901214650001601233650001501249650002401264650002801288650001201316650001601328650002101344650002301365650002501388650000701413650000901420650001601429650002601445650002201471650003301493650002401526650001201550650003001562650002101592650001601613650001101629650003401640650003201674650002201706650003801728650001101766650001701777650002101794650003101815650004901846650002801895650005601923650002501979650003702004650001602041653001502057653002302072653001602095700001802111700001602129700001702145700001302162700001302175773008202188852000902270930003302279945001302312946001302325655001202338IND2200884720221118100547.0991001e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088472DNAL7 a100689552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, B.L.14aThe impact of a monensin controlled-release capsule on subclinical ketosis in the transition dairy cow  ap. 333-342.  aAn experiment was designed to examine subclinical ketosis in periparturient dairy cows and the antiketogenic effects of monensin. Subclinical ketosis was induced through a 10% feed restriction and was quantitatively determined using a blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) threshold of 1200 micromole/L. Monensin decreased the BHBA concentration by 35% and increased the glucose concentration by 15%. No effect of monensin on milk production was detected, but rumen fermentation was altered. Monensin decreased the acetate to propionate ratio, decreased the butyrate concentration, and increased pH. The lower concentration of BHBA in blood and higher concentration of blood glucose in cows treated with a monensin controlled-release capsule decreased subclinical ketosis in early lactation cows. 3adairy cows 3apostpartum period 3amonensin 3ablood glucose 3aprepatent period 3aenergy balance 3alactation number 3alactation stage 3abody condition 3abody weight 3amilk yield 3amilk fat percentage 3amilk protein percentage 3alactose 3afeed intake 3aprepartum period 3arumen fermentation 3avolatile fatty acids 3apH 3aurea 3ablood serum 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aammonium nitrogen 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAmmoniaxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weight 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aDelayed-Action Preparations 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFood Deprivation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKetosisxdrug therapyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMonensinxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRumenxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aUreaxblood 0adry matter 0acontrolled release 0aketogenesis1 aMcBride, B.W.1 aSandals, D.1 aLeslie, K.E.1 aBagg, R.1 aDick, P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1999 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.333-342x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03607naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002600157245008900183300001800272500002400290520183000314650001602144650001502160650001502175650002002190650001002210650002202220650001202242650002302254650002202277650001402299650001202313650008002325650005902405650003802464650001302502650004202515650005702557650003702614650001502651700002202666700002102688700002402709700002002733700002202753700002302775700002402798700002802822773011602850852000902966856007802975655001203053IND4411255220221118100535.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441125522DNAL7 a187759522pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/ern2202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLochmanová, Gabriela10aCytokinin-induced photomorphogenesis in dark-grown Arabidopsis: a proteomic analysis  ap. 3705-3719.  aIncludes references  aHigh concentrations of cytokinins (CKs) in the cultivation medium can induce partial photomorphogenesis in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. However, no significant increases in endogenous CK levels have been found in de-etiolated mutants, suggesting that either parallel pathways are involved in the light and CK responses, or changes in the sensitivity to CKs occur during photomorphogenesis. Here it is shown that even modest increases in endogenous CK levels induced by transgenic expression of the CK biosynthetic gene, ipt, can lead to many typical features of light-induced de-etiolation, including inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and partial cotyledon opening. In addition, significant changes in expression of 37 proteins (mostly related to chloroplast biogenesis, a major element of light-induced photomorphogenesis) were detected by image and mass spectrometric analysis of two-dimensionally separated proteins. The identified chloroplast proteins were all up-regulated in response to increased CKs, and more than half are up-regulated at the transcript level during light-induced photomorphogenesis according to previously published transcriptomic data. Four of the up-regulated chloroplast proteins identified here have also been shown to be up-regulated during light-induced photomorphogenesis in previous proteomic analyses. In contrast, all differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins (the second largest group of differentially expressed proteins) were down-regulated. Changes in the levels of several tubulins are consistent with the observed morphological alterations. Further, 10 out of the 37 differentially expressed proteins detected have not been linked to either photomorphogenesis or CK action in light-grown Arabidopsis seedlings in previously published transcriptomic or proteomic analyses. 3aArabidopsis 3acotyledons 3aetiolation 3agene expression 3agenes 3amass spectrometry 3amutants 3aphotomorphogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aseedlings 3atubulin 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytokininsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDarkness 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aMorphogenesisxradiation effects 2aProteomics1 aZdráhal, Zbyněk1 aKonečná, Hana.1 aKoukalová, Šárka1 aMalbeck, Jiří1 aSouček, Přemysl1 aVálková, Martina1 aKiran, Nagavalli S.1 aBrzobohatý, Břetislav0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2008 Oct., v. 59, no. 13 p.3705-3719dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern2203Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03343naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245009800148300001800246500001500264520171400279650002401993650001902017650001302036650001602049650002102065650001002086650001402096650002002110650001102130650001202141650003202153650001702185650004202202650002002244650001802264650002202282650001102304650002102315650002202336650002602358650002902384650002202413653003002435653001102465653003102476653001902507653001502526700001402541700001502555700001802570773008502588852000902673930003302682945001302715946001302728655001202741IND2197266520221118101454.0990226e199809  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219726652DNAL7 a97852382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerselman, M.J.10aEnergy expenditure by dry and lactating alpine does estimated by entry rate of carbon dioxide  ap. 2469-2474.  a2019-12-05  aFour dry and four lactating (wk 6 of lactation) Alpine does [50.5 +/- 2.2 and 45.9 +/- 2.2 kg of initial body weight (BW), respectively] that consumed a 67% alfalfa diet for ad libitum intake were used 1) to compare estimates of CO2 entry rate (via continuous infusion of NaH13CO3 into the peritoneum) based on continuous saliva collection with simpler, more reliable, and less laborious sampling of urine, serum, or breath; 2) to determine effects of lactation state on CO2 entry rate and total heat production, and 3) to compare three published equations used to predict total heat production (megajoules per kilogram of BW0.75) from CO2 entry rate (liters of CO2 per kilogram of BW0.75) based on saliva samples. The entry rate of CO2 calculated from 13CO2 concentration in saliva was less variable than that determined from urine, serum, or breath samples (SE = 2.0, 4.7, 4.2, and 5.6 L/kg of BW0.75 per d, respectively); therefore, saliva samples were used to estimate total heat production. The entry rate of CO2 was 34% greater for lactating does than for dry does. Total heat production calculated from each equation was linearly related to metabolizable energy intake. Estimated heat production during feed deprivation was 0.196, 0.431, and 0.311 MJ/kg of BW0.75 per d, and estimated metabolizable energy used for maintenance was 475, 755, and 818 kJ/kg of BW0.75 per d for the three published equations. In conclusion, saliva appeared to be more suitable to estimate CO2 entry rate than did urine, serum, or breath; CO2 entry rate was appreciably greater for lactating does than for dry does; and published equations to predict total heat production from CO2 entry rate warrant careful consideration. 3aenergy requirements 3acarbon dioxide 3asampling 3ablood serum 3aisotope labeling 3agoats 3alactation 3aheat production 3asaliva 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature Regulation 2aBreath Tests 2aCarbon Dioxidexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aEnergy Intake 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivation 2aGoatsxmetabolism 2aLactationxphysiology 2aNutritional Requirements 2aSalivaxchemistry 0aenergy cost of production 0abreath 0aenergy cost of maintenance 0aurine analysis 0adry period1 aSahlu, T.1 aHart, S.P.1 aGoetsch, A.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2469-2474x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03428naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245012100148300001800269500001500287520149100302650001601793650001901809650001801828650002201846650001301868650003101881650001501912650002301927650001301950650001101963650002501974650001801999650001702017650002802034650002002062650001202082650001702094650002702111650001802138650001602156650002302172650001802195650002402213650001202237650001602249650001202265650002302277650000902300650004202309650001102351650003802362650001102400650001702411650001402428650002002442650002202462653001302484653002202497653001502519700001902534773008502553852000902638930003302647945001302680946001302693655001202706IND2197265920221118101417.0990226e199809  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219726592DNAL7 a97852372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhorasani, G.R.10aEffect of added dietary fat on performance, rumen characteristics, and plasma metabolites of midlactation dairy cows  ap. 2459-2468.  a2019-12-05  aEffects of supplemental Jet-Sploded canola seed in the diets of dairy cows on milk yield and composition and blood metabolite concentrations were investigated. Twenty multiparous and 5 primiparous midlactation Holstein cows were assigned to treatments following a 3-wk covariate period; cows were then on the treatments for 70 d. Ten of the cows had previously been fitted with rumen cannulas. Five concentrate mixtures containing 0, 7.5, 15, 22, or 29% Jet-Sploded canola seed (Simons Feed Co., Quimby, IA) (equivalent to 0, 2.66, 5.33, 7.81, and 10.30% added fat, respectively) were formulated by substituting Jet-Sploded canola seed for barley and canola meal. Diets consisted of 25% alfalfa silage, 25% whole-crop oat silage, and 50% of one of the concentrate mixtures (dry matter basis). An increase in the amount of dietary fat from Jet-Sploded canola seed did not influence feed intake, milk yield or composition, or milk component yields. The inclusion of Jet-Sploded canola seed in the diet increased long-chain fatty acids and inhibited de novo synthesis of medium-chain fatty acids in milk. Mean total volatile fatty acids in the rumen and propionate concentration were reduced in a linear fashion by treatment. The inclusion of Jet-Sploded canola seed in the diets of midlactation cows altered rumen and blood metabolite concentrations; however, these changes had minimal effects on yield responses with the exception of milk fatty acid composition and milk protein content. 3adietary fat 3amilk fat yield 3adigestibility 3aammonium nitrogen 3arapeseed 3abranched chain fatty acids 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aglucagon 3abarley 3avolatile fatty acids 3acrude protein 3ablood plasma 3amilk protein percentage 3alactation stage 3alactose 3asomatotropin 3along chain fatty acids 3ablood glucose 3afeed intake 3arumen fermentation 3arapeseed meal 3amilk fat percentage 3ainsulin 3acholesterol 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aLactation 2aMilkxchemistry 2aRumenxmetabolism 0amilk fat 0aprotein digestion 0amilk yield1 aKennelly, J.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2459-2468x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03405naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245014000145300001800285500001500303520152700318650001501845650002301860650001301883650001201896650001701908650002101925650001101946650001601957650001601973650001901989650002402008650001802032650002802050650001402078650001702092650004702109650001202156650002302168650004602191650002402237650001402261650002502275650001102300650001102311650001702322650001802339650001402357650002402371650002102395650003002416650002202446650001102468653002202479653001502501653002002516700001702536700001302553773008502566852000902651930003302660945001302693946001302706655001202719IND2197264720221118100726.0990226e199809  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219726472DNAL7 a97852342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Mara, F.P.10aEffect of amount of dietary supplement and source of protein on milk production, ruminal fermentation, and nutrient flows in dairy cows  ap. 2430-2439.  a2019-12-05  aAn experiment with a multiple Latin square design using 36 midlactation Friesian cows was carried out to determine the effect of fish meal or soybean meal in a supplement fed at two amounts (3.5 or 7 kg/d) with grass silage. The diets were also fed to four ruminally and duodenally cannulated cows to determine digestibility, ruminal fermentation, and nutrient flows. Dry matter intake, milk production, milk constituent yields, and concentrations of protein and lactose were significantly increased by the supplements when provided at 7 kg/d. The supplement containing fish meal increased milk production, protein and lactose yields, and milk protein concentration, but the increases were smaller than those obtained by increasing the amount of supplement fed. Neither the type nor the amount of supplement fed affected digestibility of dry matter or organic matter, and few significant effects on ruminal fermentation were observed. Supplements fed at the higher allowance significantly increased the flow of dry matter, organic matter, all nitrogenous components, and amino acids to the duodenum. The supplement containing fish meal significantly increased the duodenal flow of nonammonia nonmicrobial N and some amino acids. Results indicated that an increase in the concentration of supplement in the diet is more effective in increasing milk production, protein concentration and yield, and flow of amino acids to the duodenum than is increasing the concentration of ruminally undegradable protein in the supplement. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aduodenum 3alactose 3asoybean meal 3afeed supplements 3acasein 3aamino acids 3afeed intake 3amilk fat yield 3amilk fat percentage 3adigestibility 3amilk protein percentage 3afish meal 3agrass silage 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestion 2aDuodenumxmetabolism 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aFish Products 2aLactation 2aLactosexmetabolism 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aMilk Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSilage 0aprotected protein 0adry matter 0amilk production1 aMurphy, J.J.1 aRath, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2430-2439x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01323naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008700133300001100220520043200231650001200663650002100675650002500696650001200721650001500733653001500748653001200763700001900775773013600794852000900930939003300939945000800972946002900980655001201009991631161340742620221118100707.0851017e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859260652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRickerl, D.H.10aProper soil fertility levels necessary for economical production by winter legumes  ap. 14.  aExtract: The results of this study indicate that adequate phosphorus and suitable pH levels are critical for economical nitrogen production by winter legumes.

To this end, the effects of the histamine receptor antagonists dexbrompheniramine (H1 receptor antagonist), cimetidine (H2 receptor antagonist), and terfenadine (H1 receptor antagonist) on feeding and drinking patterns of pygmy goats were investigated. Two experiments using dexbrompheniramine [1 and 2 mg/kg of body weight (BW)0.75], two experiments using cimetidine (16 and 32 mg/kg of BW0.75), and two experiments using terfenadine (5 and 11.5 mg/kg of BW0.75) were performed to assess the type and location (periphery or central nervous system) of the histamine receptors involved in the mediation of prandial drinking by pygmy goats. The H1 receptor antagonists dexbrompheniramine (2 mg/kg of BW0.75) and terfenadine (11.5 mg/kg of BW0.75) significantly reduced water intake, but cumulative feed intake did not change. Consequently, the ratio of water intake to feed intake decreased. In contrast, the H2 receptor antagonist did not affect either water or feed intake. Dexbrompheniramine at 2 mg/kg of BW0.75 and terfenadine at 11.5 mg/kg of BW0.75 also decreased draft frequency and decreased the water intake associated with meals. Results showed that blockage of peripheral H1 histamine receptors attenuates the association between water and feed intake in pygmy goats. Therefore, the stimulating effect of feed intake on water intake appears to depend on activation of peripheral H1 histamine receptors. 3ahistamine 3adrinking 3acimetidine 3aantagonists 3agoats 3afeed intake 3afeeding behavior 3areceptors 2aAnimals 2aBrompheniraminexpharmacology 2aCimetidinexpharmacology 2aDrinkingxphysiology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGoatsxphysiology 2aHistamine H1 Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aHistamine H2 Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aReceptors, Histamine H1xphysiology 2aTerfenadinexpharmacology 0aantihistamines 0adexbrompheniramine 0awater intake 0ah2 histamine receptor antagonist 0aingestion 0aterfenadine1 aPrete, E. del.1 aScharrer, E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2369-2375x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03233naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245008100147300001800228500001500246520162700261650001501888650002301903650001701926650000901943650001201952650001301964650001201977650002101989650001902010650002202029650001302051650002002064650001502084650002202099650002202121650001202143650001102155650003102166650001102197650001402208650005402222650001802276651001202294653001702306653002502323653001202348653001202360653002102372653001502393700001602408700001502424700001502439773008502454852000902539930003302548945001302581946001302594655001202607IND2197260620221118100721.0990226e199809  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219726062DNAL7 a97852252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeishauser, T.10aAnalysis of survivorship after displaced abomasum is diagnosed in dairy cows  ap. 2346-2353.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this study was to analyze the survivorship of dairy cows after displaced abomasum was diagnosed. Survivorship from the calving preceeding diagnosis of displaced abomasum to removal from the herd was investigated for cows that were diagnosed with displaced abomasum compared with herdmates. For cows that were diagnosed with displaced abomasum, factors that affected survivorship from the diagnosis of the disease to removal were investigated. Data from a total of 135 cows that had been diagnosed with displaced abomasum and 373 controls matched by herd and lactation number were available from a database at the University of Guelph. The hazard rate of removal from the herd was estimated using proportional hazard regression adjusted for intraherd correlation. Diagnosis of displaced abomasum significantly increased the hazarad rate of removal from the herd. For cows that were diagnosed with displaced abomasum the hazard rate of removal increased as parity increased. However, the hazard rate decreased with recurrent displaced abomasum and with higher days in milk at diagnosis of the disease. Although the 305-d milk production of cows that were diagnosed with displaced abomasum was lower during the lactation when the disease was diagnosed, 305-d milk production was not associated with removal of cows with that disease from the herd. Milk production during subsequent lactations did not differ between cows that were diagnosed with displaced abomasum and control cows. Low milk production during the subsequent lactations increased the hazard of removal of cows with that disease from the herd. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aendometritis 3arisk 3aketosis 3alameness 3asurgery 3alactation number 3amilk fat yield 3aretained placenta 3aabomasum 3abovine mastitis 3amilk fever 3adisease diagnosis 2aAbomasumxsurgery 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxmortality 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aStomach Diseasesxmortalityxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aSurvival Rate 3aOntario 0adisplacement 0acorrelation analysis 0aculling 0ahazards 0areplacement rate 0amilk yield1 aShoukri, M.1 aKelton, D.1 aLeslie, K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2346-2353x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01292naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245006200135300001600197500001500213520049600228650001000724650001100734650001100745650001100756650001400767653001600781653001200797653001200809773008200821852000900903939003300912945000800945946001300953655001200966991631160730742620221118101257.0851009e198503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859260432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRing, R.J., Jr.10aVariability of inflation and income across income classes  ap. 203-209.  a2019-12-04  aExtract: To determine whether inflation affects families more at lower than at higher income levels, inflation and income changes between 1972-73 and 1982 were estimated for 12 income classes. Inflation was independent of income, and lower incomes grew faster than prices. Thus, living standards increased for the "average" poor family. However, these averages mask adverse effects on a significant portion of the low-income population. Inflation in a "necessities index" was also estimated. 3afoods 3aincome 3aenergy 3aprices 3ainflation 0aconsumption 0ahousing 0aindexes0 tSocial science quarterly.g1985 Mar., v. 66, no. 1 p.203-209x0038-49417nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19851009c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle01329naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245009600134300001400230520029000244650001100534650002200545650001500567650002300582650001700605650002200622650003000644651001500674653001100689700001900700700001400719700001600733700001800749773012500767852000900892939003300901945000800934946001300942655001200955991631160300742620221118101322.0851009e198304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859260512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLansford, R.R.14aThe on-farm economic impacts of the declining Ogalla Aquifer for the New Mexico High Plains  ap. 31-36.  aExtract: The purpose of this paper is to present estimates of the impacts over a 40-year planning horizon on agriculture under alternative sets of assumptions regarding public policy (management strategies), water and energy costs and availability, and irrigation management practices. 3aenergy 3acosts and returns 3airrigation 3awater conservation 3awater supply 3aissues and policy 3aadministrative management 3aNew Mexico 0aimpact1 aGollehon, N.R.1 aMapel, C.1 aCreel, B.J.1 aBen-David, S.0 tJournal of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers.g1983 Apr., v. 47, no. 1 p.31-36x0003-116X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19851009c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle01861naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245006500168300001300233500002400246520075000270650001201020650001501032650001501047650001301062650001601075650001601091650002101107650000901128650003001137650001501167650001101182650001501193650001101208650002101219650001601240650001101256650001101267773010401278852000901382856004801391655001201439IND4434635820221118101314.0100326e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443463582DNAL7 a10.1134/S001387381001001X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieńkowski, A.

Over the past few years, the importance of this pathway in plant-pathogen interactions has been increasingly highlighted. UPS is involved in almost every step of the defence mechanisms in plants, regardless of the type of pathogen. In addition to its proteolytic activities, UPS, through its 20S RNase activity, may be part of a still unknown antiviral defence pathway. Strikingly, UPS is not only a weapon used by plants to defend themselves, but also a target for some pathogens that have evolved mechanisms to inhibit and/or use this system for their own purposes. This article attempts to summarize the current knowledge on UPS involvement in plant-microbe interactions, a complex scheme that illustrates the never-ending arms race between hosts and microbes. 3adefense mechanisms 3ahosts 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3aplant proteins 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein degradation 3aribonucleases 2aBiocatalysis 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiologyxvirology. 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complexxmetabolism 2aProtein Stability 2aUbiquitinxmetabolism1 aBADAOUI, SALOUA1 aCandresse, Thierry.1 aGERMAN-RETANA, SYLVIE0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2010 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.293-308dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2009.00596.x 7aarticle04197naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100001900192245008900211300001800300500002400318506007600342520224600418506003702664650002902701650002502730650002702755650001802782650003002800650002402830650002502854650002502879650003202904650001902936650002602955650000902981650001402990650001103004650001003015650003803025650001303063650002803076650003003104650002503134650001303159650001103172650003103183650003003214650001403244650003503258700002203293700001903315700001703334773013203351852000903483856009103492655001203583IND4369619920221207142444.0050505e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436961992DNAL7 a158703352pmid7 aPMC10875682pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.5.2467-2472.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaddick, J.

It was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. The available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. Ten lesions were treated, and infected dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. Duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. The baseline microbiota were composed primarily of Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Actinomyces israelii, and Actinomyces gerencseriae. None of these taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus mitis. The microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (P < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, {szligbeta}-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and {szligbeta}-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. The genotypic diversity of S. oralis and A. naeslundii was significantly (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. There was significantly (P < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. We propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. The surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and pH perturbations.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aActinomyces gerencseriae 3aActinomyces israelii 3aActinomyces naeslundii 3aLactobacillus 3aStreptococcus intermedius 3aStreptococcus mitis 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aStreptococcus oralis 3aStreptococcus parasanguinis 3ablood proteins 3anutrient availability 3apulp 3asialidase 3asugars 3ateeth 2aAcetylglucosaminidasexmetabolism 2aBiofilms 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDental Cavity Preparation 2aDentinxmicrobiology 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNeuraminidasexmetabolism 2aPhenotype 2abeta-Galactosidasexmetabolism1 aBrailsford, S.

Objective: This study evaluated calcium intake from ages 5 to 9 y as a function of mother-daughter beverage choices and as a predictor of bone mineral status. Design: Intakes of energy, calcium, milk, sweetened beverages, fruit juices, and non-energy-containing beverages were measured with the use of three 24-h dietary recalls in 192 non-Hispanic white girls aged 5, 7, and 9 y and their mothers. Calcium intakes from ages 5 to 9 y were categorized as either meeting or falling below recommended adequate intakes (AIs). The girls' bone mineral status was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at age 9 y. Results: The mean 5-y calcium intake was related to bone mineral density at age 9 y (beta = 0.27, P < 0.001). The girls who met the AI for calcium were not heavier (P = 0.83) but had higher energy intakes (P < 0.0001) than did the girls who consumed less than the AI. Compared with the girls who consumed less than the AI, the girls who met the AI consumed, on average, almost twice as much milk (P < 0.0001), had smaller decreases in milk intake (P < 0.01), and consumed 18% less sweetened beverages (P < 0.01) from ages 5 to 9 y; the 2 groups did not differ significantly in juice and non-energy-containing beverage intakes. The girls who met the AI were also served milk more frequently than were the girls who consumed less than the AI (P < 0.0001) and had mothers who drank milk more frequently (P < 0.01) than did the mothers of the girls who consumed less than the AI. Conclusions: These findings provide new longitudinal evidence that calcium intake predicts bone mineral status during middle childhood and reflects mother-daughter beverage choice patterns that are established well before the rapid growth and bone mineralization observed in adolescence. 3aAdequate Intakes 3abeverages 3abone density 3abone mineralization 3acalcium 3achildhood 3adiet recall 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aenergy intake 3afruit juices 3agirls 3amilk 2aAnimals 2aBeverages 2aBone Density 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aHumans 2aMilk 2aMother-Child Relations1 aMitchell, Diane C.1 aSmiciklas-Wright, Helen1 aMannino, Michelle L.1 aBirch, Leann L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Apr., v. 79, no. 4 p.698-706dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009300175300001400268500002400282520173800306650001102044650001502055650001502070650001402085650001402099650001102113650001602124650001602140650001202156650001202168651001102180700002302191700002302214773012202237852000902359856005502368655001202423IND4447929920221118100457.0110125e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444792992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-1984.2010.00300.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCONSOLARO, HÉLDER10aBreakdown of distyly and pin-monomorphism in Psychotria carthagenensis Jacq. (Rubiaceae)  ap. 24-32.  aIncludes references  aRubiaceae contains the largest number of distylous species in the Angiosperms, but the evolution and control of distyly is poorly understood in this group. Atypical distylous populations and species have been described in this family and associated with disturbance, pollination failure and impaired reproductive success. Some of these atypical taxa belong to Psychotria, the largest genus in the family. In the present study, we investigate the pollination and breeding biology of Psychotria carthagenensis Jacq., a widely distributed species that has been described as typically distylous. Fieldwork was carried out mainly at the Panga Ecological Station, in Uberlândia, MG, Brazil. We carried out phenological observations, floral biology studies and hand pollination experiments within the Panga Ecological Station population. We complemented these data with herbarium and field surveys from elsewhere in Brazil. The studied population bloomed at the beginning of the rains (September-December). The main pollinators were Bombus and small Halictidae bees. The Panga Ecological Station population presented pin-monomorphism with only two thrum individuals in more than 100 flowering individuals surveyed. Hand pollinations at the Panga Ecological Station showed self-compatibility and intramorph compatibility. Typical distyly and isoplethy were found in other areas and both morphs appeared in herbarium material. However, pin-monomorphism was also observed elsewhere in Brazil. Typical distyly, pin-monomorphism and homostyly observed concurrently in Brazilian populations of P. carthagenensis indicate that alternative reproductive strategies, probably favoring selfing, appear to have developed independently in this species. 3aBombus 3aHalictidae 3aPsychotria 3aevolution 3aflowering 3amorphs 3apollination 3apollinators 3aselfing 3asurveys 3aBrazil1 aSILVA, SIMONE C.S.1 aOLIVEIRA, PAULO E.0 tPlant species biology.g2011 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.24-32dBlackwell Publishing AsiawJournal:jnl59273x0913-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-1984.2010.00300.x 7aarticle03642naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245011800143300001800261500001500279520146700294650002101761650001901782650001801801650002201819650002301841650001501864650002301879650002501902650001701927650002301944650002001967650001701987650002802004650001802032650002002050650001602070650001802086650000902104650002302113650001602136650002202152650001402174650002102188650000702209650000902216650001702225650001202242650002402254650001602278650002302294650000902317650003802326650001402364650001102378650001702389650003102406650001302437650001402450650002502464650002202489650001702511653001602528653001302544653002302557653001102580653001802591700001702609700001602626700001802642773008402660852000902744930003302753945001302786946001302799655001202812IND2196487620221118100055.0990114e199807  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219648762DNAL7 a97107722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolver, E.10aSynchronization of ruminal degradation of supplemental carbohydrate with pasture nitrogen in lactating dairy cows  ap. 2017-2028.  a2019-12-05  aTwelve Holstein cows in early to midlactation (8 fitted with ruminal cannulas) were used to test the hypothesis that the synchronization of the rate of ruminal degradation of supplemental carbohydrate and N from fresh pasture would increase the amount of N retained for growth and milk production. A concentrate based on ground shelled corn was fed either at the time that pasture was fed at 0900 and 1700 h (synchronous) or 4 h after pasture was fed at 1300 and 2100 h (asynchronous). The crossover design included a 6-d adjustment period and a 10-d milk sampling period. Nitrogen balance was determined during the last 5 d of each period. Cows fed the synchronous diet had a lower mean ruminal pH. Peak ammonia concentration at 3 and 5 h after pasture feeding in the morning was reduced by approximately 33% of values obtained from cows fed the asynchronous diet. The diurnal pattern of blood urea N concentration was similar to that of ruminal ammonia, but mean daily concentrations of blood urea N did not differ between diets. Nitrogen retained for milk production and growth was not influenced by diet, and no differences in milk production, composition, or efficiency were observed. Based on changes in ruminal concentrations of ammonia, synchronous ruminal release of supplemental carbohydrate with pasture N appeared to improve the capture of ruminal N; however, these changes were transient and did not change the N status or performance of dairy cows. 3anitrogen balance 3amilk fat yield 3adigestibility 3aammonium nitrogen 3asomatic cell count 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3avolatile fatty acids 3aconcentrates 3aDactylis glomerata 3aliveweight gain 3ablood plasma 3amilk protein percentage 3aPoa pratensis 3afeed conversion 3abody weight 3ablood glucose 3acorn 3arumen fermentation 3afeed intake 3afeeding frequency 3alactation 3adiurnal activity 3apH 3aurea 3arumen fluids 2aAnimals 2aBlood Urea Nitrogen 2aBody Weight 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDiet 2aDietary Carbohydratesxmetabolism 2aDigestion 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLactation 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0afatty acids 0aDactylis 0anitrogen retention 0atiming 0agreen fodders1 aMuller, L.D.1 aVarga, G.A.1 aCassidy, T.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 July, v. 81, no. 7 p.2017-2028x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02116naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001300151245012400164300001600288500001500304520083300319650001801152650003001170650001401200650003301214650002301247650002601270651001001296651001001306653001501316653002201331653002801353653002801381653001001409653002501419653002001444700001501464700001701479773009401496852000901590930003301599945001301632946001301645655001201658IND2328945120221118095920.0020917e200112  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232894512DNAL7 a192658792pmid7 aPMC26205112pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabo, A.10aPhylogenetic relationships based on ribosomal DNA data for four species of cyst nematodes from Italy and one from Syria  ap. 183-190.  a2019-12-05  aPhylogenetic analysis of new ribosomal DNA (rDNA) data for Heterodera mediterranea, H. hordecalis, H. carotae, and H. fici from Italy and H. ciceri from Syria, along with published data for other species, showed high bootstrap support for the following relationships: ((((((H. carotae H. cruciferae) H. goettingiana) (((H. trifolii H. ciceri) H. mediterrnea) ((H. avenae H. latipons) H. fici))) (Cactodera betulae H. hordecalis)) (Globodera rostochiensis G. pallida)).

A clade comprised of Cactodera betulae and H. hordecalis is only distantly related to the other species in the analysis. 3aribosomal DNA 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aphylogeny 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aHeterodera carotae 3aHeterodera hordecalis 3aSyria 3aItaly 0aHeterodera 0aheterodera ciceri 0aheterodera mediterranea 0amolecular sequence data 0acysts 0anucleotide sequences 0aheterodera fici1 aVovlas, N.1 aFerris, V.R.0 tJournal of nematology.g2001 Dec., v. 33, no. 4 p.183-190wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03027naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245009700148300001600245500002400261500001500285520113300300650001301433650001801446650001701464650001101481650002201492650002201514650001201536650001901548650002001567650001101587650001001598650001301608650002501621650001401646650002201660650001301682650001301695650002401708650005501732650002301787650002301810650005801833650002201891650002501913650002801938650002101966650002901987650002902016650003702045650002302082650003402105653001502139653001102154700002302165700001702188700001802205700001802223773011502241852000902356655001202365IND4373166620221118095839.0050810e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437316662DNAL7 a150206382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillejo, C.10aPectin esterase gene family in strawberry fruit: study of FaPE1, a ripening-specific isoform  ap. 909-918.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPectin esterases (PE, EC 3.1.1.11) catalyse the demethylation of pectin. As a result of its activity, structural interactions among cell wall components during cell wall turnover and loosening are affected. In plants, PEs are typically encoded by a gene family. This family has been studied in strawberry (Fragariaxananassa Duch.) in order to investigate the role of distinct PE genes during fruit ripening and senescence. By a combination of a PCR-based library screening and RT-PCR four different strawberry PE cDNAs, termed FaPE1 to FaPE4, have been isolated. Differential expression of each FaPE gene in various organs and during fruit development was revealed by northern blot. FaPE1 is specifically expressed in fruit, showing an increasing expression during the ripening process up to a maximum in the turning stage. Concerning hormone regulation, auxin treatment increased FaPE1 mRNA levels in green fruit, whereas exogenous ethylene decreased FaPE1 mRNA levels in ripe and senescing fruits. It is proposed that this repression of FaPE1 expression could be involved in textural changes occurring during fruit senescence. 3aethylene 3amessenger RNA 3astrawberries 3afruits 3acomplementary DNA 3aFragaria ananassa 3apectins 3apectinesterase 3agene expression 3aauxins 3agenes 3aripening 3acell wall components 3ascreening 3aNorthern blotting 3afruiting 3ahormones 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aFragariaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFruitxenzymology 2aIsoenzymesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlant Leavesxenzymology 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0asenescence 0aplants1 aFuente, J.I. de la1 aIannetta, P.1 aBotella, M.A.1 aValpuesta, V.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2004 Apr., v. 55, no. 398 p.909-918dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002800135245008800163300001600251500002400267520144300291650001301734650000901747650001601756650001201772651000901784700001901793700002501812700002001837773009301857852000901950856003801959655001201997IND4442231820221118095846.0100910s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444223182DNAL7 a10.1071/CP093252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolatabad, Saeed Safari10aBiplot analysis for multi-environment trials of maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids in Iran  ap. 700-707.  aIncludes references  aAdapted maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids should be identified and chosen based on multi-environment trials analysing several traits. The objectives of this study were to identify mega-environments and suitable adapted maize hybrids based on both mean grain yield and grain yield stability and were to evaluate the 14 maize hybrids based on several desirable traits. Biplot analysis determined one mega-environment and two sectors that consist of one location in each sector for maize in Iran. The mega-environment included Kerman (KRM), Kermanshah (KSH), Moghan (MGN), Dezfol A (DZF A), Karaj (KRJ), Darab (DRB), Dezfol B (DZF B), Shiraz B (SHZ B), and Esfahan (ESF), where hybrid OSSK 602 was the best performing hybrid. The first sector included Khoramabad (KHM) where BC 678 was the best hybrid, and the second sector included Shiraz A (SHZ A) where ZP 599 was the hybrid with the highest performance. OSSK 602 was the best hybrid among all of the studied hybrids followed by ZP 677 and ZP 684. The genotype×trait biplot indicated that ZP 677 and OSSK 602 had greater thousand-kernel weight and grain number, whereas ZP 684 had longer day to maturity and larger cob diameter. KSC 700, KSC 704, and BC 678 had higher ear height and more days to tasseling than other hybrids. The genotype×trait biplot graphically displayed the interrelationships among traits and it was used in identifying hybrids that are good for some particular traits. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3aIran1 aChoukan, Rajab1 aHervan, Eslam Majidi1 aDehghani, Hamid0 tCrop & pasture science.g2010, v. 61, no. 9 p.700-707dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP09325 7aarticle03118naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245012400147300001800271500001500289520149700304650001501801650001201816650000901828650000901837650002101846650002201867650001701889650002801906650001501934650002401949650003201973650001202005650001102017650004202028650002402070650001102094650004302105650005802148650001402206650001702220650006402237650005902301653002602360653002202386653001502408773008502423852000902508930003302517945001302550946001302563655001202576IND2197336120221118095906.0990302e199810  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219733612DNAL7 a98122742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, M.H.10aEffect of supplemental dietary vitamin E and zinc on reproductive performance of dairy cows and heifers fed excess iron  ap. 2693-2699.  a2019-12-05  aWe tested the hypothesis that the incidence of retained fetal membranes could be reduced by limiting oxidative stress. Sixty-four primigravid heifers (56 Holstein and 8 Jersey) and 80 multiparous cows (64 Holstein and 16 Jersey) were used. A combination of vitamin E or Zn and Fe was fed in a 2 X 2 X 2 factorial arrangement during the last 42 d prepartum. Amounts of supplements per animal were 1000 IU of vitamin E (d,l alpha-tocopheryl acetate), 0.8 g of Zn (Zn-Met and ZnSO4), and 12 g of Fe (FeSO4(.)7H2O) for Holsteins and 9 g for Jerseys. Neither vitamin E nor Zn directly affected the incidence of retained fetal membranes, but plasma (alpha-tocopherol was lower when fetal membranes were retained >12 h or when vitamin E was not supplemented. Iron had no direct negative effects on reproductive performance, but cows receiving additional Fe had lower unsaturated iron-binding capacity, which, in turn, was also lower in cows that retained fetal membranes. Days to first observed estrus were reduced by supplementation with either vitamin E or Zn. Vitamin E reduced days to first artificial insemination (AI) and tended to reduce days open. Supplemental Zn tended to reduce days to first AI but did not affect days open. Milk production during the first 12 wk and AI per conception were not affected by supplementation with either vitamin E or Zn. Both vitamin E and Zn reduced days to first observed estrus, indicating improved reproductive health during the early postpartum period. 3adairy cows 3aheifers 3azinc 3airon 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aretained placenta 3ablood plasma 3aartificial insemination 3amilk yield 3apostpartum interval 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxprevention & control 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aIron, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aPlacenta, Retainedxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aPregnancy 2aReproduction 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aZincxadministration & dosagexbloodxtherapeutic use. 0airon binding capacity 0avitamin e acetate 0adry period0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.2693-2699x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02701naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012800145300001800273520147600291650001201767650002701779650002001806650004401826650002301870650002401893650001401917650003101931650003001962650003601992650002402028650002502052650002502077650002002102700001602122773008502138852000902223930003302232945001302265946001302278655001202291IND2197335020221118100405.0990302e199810  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219733502DNAL7 a98122632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelloque, J.10a1H-nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the conformational changes related to the foaming properties of beta-lactoglobulin  ap. 2580-2587.  abeta-Lactoglobulin (beta-LG) is a whey protein with foaming ability that can be used as a food ingredient. The structural changes that occur during foaming cannot be easily assessed. In combination with deuterium exchange, 1H-NMR allows new insight into the structural features of beta-LG during foaming. beta-Lactoglobulin was dissolved in D2O and forced to foam. During foaming, the amide protons of exposed in residues were exchanged for deuterium atoms, which do not appear in the 1H-NMR spectrum. Protein in solutions that had produced unstable foams showed no exchange beyond that found in unfoamed controls, indicating that the structure had remained intact. Protein in solutions that had produced stable foams showed extensive exchange. Protons of both Trp19 and Met107 exchanged with deuterium, indicating that most of the interior had been exposed to solvent. Most of the beta-LG structure was recovered after collapse of the foam. In the early steps of foaming, apparently only random coil or other exposed regions are involved in foam stabilization. More vigorous shear stress forces induce further unfolding of the beta-strands. This unfolding is suggested to be a dynamic, reversible equilibrium between an open and closed conformation of beta-strands that allows not only for interaction of the protein with the air phase but also for some secondary structure to be retained and the original structure to be recovered. Freeze-dry foaming is also discussed. 3afoaming 3amolecular conformation 3adeuterium oxide 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3abeta-lactoglobulin 2aChemistry, Physical 2aDeuterium 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactoglobulinsxchemistry 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Denaturation 2aProtein Folding1 aSmith, G.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Oct., v. 81, no. 10 p.2580-2587x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03240naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001500181245006500196300001800261500002400279500001500303520170700318650002102025650001002046650002502056650002102081650002602102650001002128650002302138650002002161650001802181650001502199650002302214650002202237650001902259650001902278650001302297651001102310653002702321653001902348773008902367852000902456856008502465856007702550930003302627945002502660946001302685655001202698IND4383964220221118100320.0060929s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438396422DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606008538132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF600 0aF110 0aJ5001 aWojcik, P.10aSchattenmorelle' Tart Cherry Response to Boron Fertilization  ap. 1709-1718.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of the experiment was to examine the effects of soil and foliar applications of boron (B) on tart cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) tree vigor, yield, and fruit quality. The study was conducted during 2003-2004 on mature 'Schattenmorelle' tart cherry trees grown at a commercial orchard in central Poland on coarse-textured soil with low B content. Trees were supplied with B as foliar sprays or via soil application. Foliar B sprays were performed: (1) in the spring, at the white bud stage, when 5%-10% of flowers were at full bloom, and 5 d after petal fall, at a rate of 0.2 kg B ha-1 per each spray treatment; and (2) in the fall, approximately six weeks before the natural leaf fall, at a rate of 0.8 kg B ha-1. Soil B application was made at the bud-break stage at a rate of 2 kg ha-1. Trees untreated with B served as a control. Spring and fall B sprays increased flower B concentrations, but had no effect on summer leaf B status. Leaf B concentrations of trees with B supplied to the soil were higher than those of the control trees. However, soil B application had no influence on flower B level. Vigor and yield of tart cherry trees were not influenced by B fertilization. Also, mean fruit weight and titratable acidity of fruit did not differ among treatments. Fruit of trees with B supplied to the soil had higher soluble solids concentration (SSC) than those of the control plants. In conclusion, high yield of tart cherry can be obtained on soils with water-soluble B concentrations as low as 0.32 mg kg-1. It is also postulated that at low soil-B availability, under conditions of low-light intensity during fruit ripening, soil-B application increases SSC in tart cherry fruit. 3aland application 3avigor 3atotal soluble solids 3afertilizer rates 3anutrient availability 3aboron 3afoliar application 3alight intensity 3afruit quality 3acrop yield 3atitratable acidity 3aboron fertilizers 3asoil fertility 3aPrunus cerasus 3acherries 3aPoland 0afertilizer application 0asoluble solids0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 9 p.1709-1718dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606008538133Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3electronic resource  a20061026b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/10/13  aOther US 7aarticle02708naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001500197245004300212300001800255500002400273500001500297520081000312650001901122650001601141650001801157650001501175650002201190650002501212650001901237650002301256650005501279650005001334650006601384650004501450650002401495650005201519650002601571651001201597653002301609653002601632653004301658653002001701653003401721653001501755700001401770700001901784700001801803700001701821773009101838852000901929856007501938930003302013945002502046946001102071655001202082IND4383958220221118100357.0060929e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438395822DNAL7 a168902542pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aF600 0aF7001 aZidorn, C.10aStilbenoids from Tragopogon orientalis  ap. 2182-2188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA phytochemical investigation of Tragopogon orientalis L.

The chemosystematic impact of the occurrence of stilbene derivatives in T. orientalis is discussed. 3aphytochemicals 3astilbenoids 3achemotaxonomy 3aTragopogon 3aspectral analysis 3aantioxidant activity 3aplant taxonomy 3achemical structure 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFree Radical Scavengersxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMolecular Structure 2aStilbenesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aTragopogonxchemistry 3aAustria 0adihydrorhaponticin 0aTragopogon orientalis 0aTragopogon pratensis subsp. orientalis 0amethoxyphtalide 0a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 0aAsteraceae1 aGrass, S.1 aEllmerer, E.P.1 aOngania, K.H.1 aStuppner, H.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Oct., v. 67, no. 19 p.2182-2188dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.06.0313electronic resource  a20061007b20061102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/10/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03677naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245009500179300001600274500002400290520187300314650002002187650001502207650001402222650002302236650001602259650002002275650003102295650001002326650001502336650001602351650001502367650001802382650001002400650001802410650002902428650001002457650001202467650002302479650001802502650003002520650003802550650001702588650003102605650002802636650002602664650003002690650004002720650003102760650005002791700001702841700002002858700002702878773010102905852000903006856004803015655001203063IND4458174220221118095601.0110520e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445817422DNAL7 a214997202pmid7 a10.1007/s10886-011-9949-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiang10aWheat Gene Expression is Differentially Affected by a Virulent Russian Wheat Aphid Biotype  ap. 472-482.  aIncludes references  aAn improved understanding of the complex interactions between plants and aphids is emerging. Recognition of aphid feeding in plant tissues involves production of several defense response signaling pathways and downstream production of defense and detoxification compounds. Feeding by Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), a serious pest of cereal crops worldwide, induces foliar deformity and chlorophyll loss during compatible wheat-D. noxia interactions. Experiments described here revealed significant differences in level and pattern of gene expression in defense response signaling and metabolic pathways between compatible and incompatible D. noxia-wheat interactions. The jasmonate (JA)-signaling genes LOX, AOS, and AOC were significantly more upregulated (~3- to 7 fold) in incompatible interactions than in compatible interactions (~2.5 to 3.5 fold) as early as 1 h post D. noxia infestation (hpi). Cellulose synthase, responsible for strengthening plant cell walls via cellulose production, was also more upregulated in incompatible interactions (4 to 7 fold) than in compatible interactions (1 to 3.5 fold). In contrast, glycolysis and citric acid cycle genes were significantly downregulated (~1.5 to 2 fold) in incompatible interactions and upregulated or less downregulated in compatible interactions from 6 to 72 hpi. Differences in expression of JA-signaling genes between feeding site tissues and non-feeding site tissues suggest that D. noxia defense response signals in wheat are restricted primarily to aphid feeding sites in the initial 6 hpi. This is the first report of differential upregulation of plant genes at 1 hpi in incompatible interactions involving aphid herbivory. Early wheat plant defense responses in incompatible D. noxia interactions at 1, 3, and 6 hpi appear to be important aspects of D. noxia resistance in wheat. 3aDiuraphis noxia 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acellulose synthase 3achlorophyll 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglycolysis 3agrain crops 3aherbivores 3ajasmonic acid 3apests 3aplant tissues 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3awheat 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aBase Sequence 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPentose Phosphate Pathway 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aTriticumxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology.1 aMeng, Jianye1 aStarkey, Sharon1 aSmith, Charles Michael0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2011 May, v. 37, no. 5 p.472-482dSpringer-Verlagx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-011-9949-9 7aarticle02741naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011000165300001600275500002400291520158600315650002501901650001901926650001001945650002201955650001801977650001601995650001402011650001002025650001702035650002602052650001602078650001202094650002102106651000902127700001802136700002202154773009802176852000902274856004802283655001202331IND4425366720221118095623.0090829e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442536672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-009-9581-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuedeling, Eike10aClimate change effects on winter chill for tree crops with chilling requirements on the Arabian Peninsula  ap. 219-237.  aIncludes references  aFruit production systems that rely on winter chill for breaking of dormancy might be vulnerable to climatic change. We investigated decreases in the number of winter chilling hours (0-7.2°C) in four mountain oases of Oman, a marginal area for the production of fruit trees with chilling requirements. Winter chill was calculated from long-term hourly temperature records. These were generated based on the correlation of hourly temperature measurements in the oases with daylength and daily minimum and maximum temperatures recorded at a nearby weather station. Winter chill was estimated for historic temperature records between 1983 and 2008, as well as for three sets of synthetic 100-year weather records, generated to represent historic conditions, and climatic changes likely to occur within the next 30 years (temperatures elevated by 1°C and 2°C). Our analysis detected a decrease in the numbers of chilling hours in high-elevation oases by an average of 1.2-9.5 h/year between 1983 and 2008, a period during which, according to the scenario analysis, winter chill was sufficient for most important species in most years in the highest oasis. In the two climate change scenarios, pomegranates, the most important tree crop, received insufficient chilling in 13% and 75% of years, respectively. While production of most traditional fruit trees is marginal today, with trees barely fulfilling their chilling requirements, such production might become impossible in the near future. Similar developments are likely to affect other fruit production regions around the world. 3achilling requirement 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adormancy breaking 3afruit growing 3afruit trees 3amountains 3aoases 3apomegranates 3aproduction technology 3atemperature 3aweather 3aweather stations 3aOman1 aGebauer, Jens1 aBuerkert, Andreas0 tClimatic change.g2009 Sept., v. 96, no. 1-2 p.219-237dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9581-7 7aarticle02079naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013000165300001600295500002400311520103400335650001401369650002101383650001201404650001301416650001601429650001001445650001101455650001101466651001001477700001801487700001801505700002001523773011701543852000901660856004801669655001201717IND4424941420221118100055.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442494142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-009-9407-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph John, K.10aTuber morphology, germination behaviour and propagation efficiency in three edible Momordica (Cucurbitaceae) species of India  ap. 861-868.  aIncludes references  aTuber morphology and propagation efficiency in three dioecious, tuber bearing Momordica species of India were investigated. Tuber morphology of M. dioica and M. sahyadrica is different from that of M. subangulata ssp. renigera. M. dioica and M. sahyadrica develop taproot tuber with shoot sprouts only at caudex region, whereas M. subangulata ssp. renigera has both taproot and adventitious tubers with shoot sprouts all over tuber surface. Tubers of M. dioica and M. sahyadrica are perennating whereas, in M. subangulata ssp. renigera they serve as both perennating and propagation structures. M. dioica and M. sahyadrica had prolonged tuber dormancy of 4-5 months whereas, M. subangulata ssp. renigera had short dormancy period of about 2 months. Cutting of tuberous roots is a highly efficient method for multiplication in M. subangulata spp. renigera, whereas whole tubers or longitudinal splits in to two or at best four equal halves with a portion of the apical meristem may work in the case of M. dioica and M. sahyadrica. 3aMomordica 3aapical meristems 3acutting 3adormancy 3agermination 3aroots 3ashoots 3atubers 3aIndia1 aAntony, V.

To improve the conversion efficiency in high concentrations of substrate and 2-propanol, selection of a PAR mutant library and the subsequent rearrangement of mutations were attempted. With only a single selection round and following the manual combination of advantageous mutations, PAR was successfully adapted for the conversion of high concentrations of substrate with concentrated 2-propanol.

Recent studies document how plant invasions may contribute to increased arthropod abundances in detritus-based food webs. An obvious mechanism for this phenomenon--a bottom-up effect resulting from elevated levels of detritus from the invasive plant litter--has not been explicitly studied. We examined the effects of an annual grass invasion on ground arthropod assemblages in the coastal sage scrub (CSS) of southern California. Bottom-up food web theory predicts that the addition of detritus would increase generalist-feeding arthropods at all trophic levels; accordingly, we expected increases in fungi, Collembola, and common predators such as mites and spiders. For the common ant taxa, habitat alteration may also be important for predicting responses. Thus we expected that Forelius mccooki and Pheidole vistana, the most common ant species, would decline because of changes in soil temperature (F. mccooki) and habitat structure (P. vistana) associated with litter. We studied trends observationally and conducted a 3-year experiment in which we manipulated litter quantity. In contrast to other published studies, most detritus-based arthropod taxa declined in areas of high grass invasion, and, within trophic levels, responses often varied idiosyncratically. For the two most common taxa, a native ant (F. mccooki), and predatory mites in the Anystidae, we experimentally linked declines in abundance to increased levels of invasive grass litter. Such declines, especially those exhibited by the most common ant taxa, could have cascading effects on the CSS ecosystem, where ants are numerically dominant and thus may have broad influences on food web and ecosystem properties. Our results highlight that accurately predicting arthropod responses to invasive plant litter requires careful consideration of the structural and food resources provided by detritus to each particular food web.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnystidae 3aCollembola 3aPheidole 3aTetranychidae 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3afood webs 3afoods 3afungi 3agrasses 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ainvasive species 3aobservational studies 3aplant litter 3aplant response 3apredatory mites 3ashrublands 3asoil temperature 2aAnimals 2aArthropodsxclassificationxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aPoaceaexphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSoil 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTemperature 3aCalifornia 0aMediterranean Region1 aBolger, Douglas T.1 aHolway, David A.0 tOecologia.g2009 Oct., v. 161, no. 4 p.697-708dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1425-7 7aarticle02878naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245014800178300001600326500002400342500001500366520119800381650001301579650001901592650002401611650002801635650001101663650001501674650001001689650001901699650001601718650001601734650001601750650001601766650001301782650001101795650002801806650001101834650002901845650004401874650004501918650004501963650002402008653001602032653001602048700002002064700002302084700002402107773010602131852000902237856007802246655001202324IND4432677020221118100308.0100213e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443267702DNAL7 a200229772pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcp1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Makoto10aSelective Excitation of Photosystems in Chloroplasts Inside Plant Leaves Observed by Near-Infrared Laser-Based Fluorescence Spectral Microscopy  ap. 225-238.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aIn this study, we produced selective images of photosystems in plant chloroplasts in situ. We used a spectroimaging microscope, equipped with a near-infrared (NIR) laser that provided light at wavelengths mainly between 800 and 830 nm, to analyze chlorophyll autofluorescence spectra and images from chloroplasts in leaves of Zea mays at room temperature. Femtosecond laser excitation of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells revealed a spectral shape that was attributable to PSII and its antenna in the centers of grana spots. We found that a continuous wave emitted by the NIR laser at a wavelength as long as 820 nm induced chlorophyll autofluorescence with a high contribution from PSI through a one-photon absorption mechanism. A spectral shape attributable to PSI and its antenna was thus obtained using continuous wave laser excitation of chloroplasts in bundle sheath cells. These highly pure spectra of photosystems were utilized for spectral decomposition at every intrachloroplast space to show distributions of PSI and PSII and their associated antenna. A new methodology using an NIR laser to detect the PSI/PSII ratio in single chloroplasts in leaves at room temperature is described. 3aZea mays 3aimage analysis 3abundle sheath cells 3afluorescence microscopy 3alasers 3aabsorption 3agrana 3aphotosystem II 3awavelengths 3amicroscopes 3atemperature 3achlorophyll 3aantennae 3aleaves 2aChloroplastsxchemistry 2aLasers 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxanalysis 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxanalysis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aZea maysxchemistry 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aShiina, Takashi1 aTerazima, Masahide1 aKumazaki, Shigeichi0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2010 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.225-238dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcp1823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02179naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245007200161300001600233500002400249520118000273650001201453650001101465650002701476650002001503650001601523650001001539650002601549650001101575650001301586650002401599650002501623773012701648852000901775856004501784655001201829IND4404641120080502231909.0080418e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440464112DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2007000802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrueck, Holger10aEffects of nitrogen supply on water-use efficiency of higher plants  ap. 210-219.  aIncludes references  aThe worldwide increase of food demand and reduced sweet-water availability in some important food-producing regions raised interest in more efficient water use, which has become one of the central research topics in agriculture. Improved irrigation management and reduced bare-soil evaporation have highest priority to increase agronomic water-use efficiency (WUE). Compared to these technical (irrigation) and basic (crop production) management options, effects of nutrient management on WUE were less frequently considered. Twenty-nine publications on nitrogen (N) effects on biomass WUE of container-grown plants are considered in this review. Most of them indicate positive N effects on WUE, and relevance of N effects on intrinsic WUE and unproductive water and carbon loss is discussed. A plot of 90 published data of percent decreases of WUE and dry mass under variable N supply is presented. Extrapolation of biomass WUE from leaf measurements of intrinsic WUE is critically reviewed. The positive correlation between WUE and dry-mass formation suggests that physiological rather than stomatal effects are more important in order to explain positive N effects on WUE. 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acontainer-grown plants 3acrop production 3aevaporation 3afoods 3airrigation management 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anutrient management 3awater use efficiency0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2008 Apr., v. 171, no. 2 p.210-219dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200700080 7aarticle02787naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245015200161300001600313500002400329500001500353520161300368650001301981650001101994650002002005650001202025650002102037650001202058650001502070650001002085650002302095650001802118650001002136650002002146650001202166653001502178700002202193773010502215852000902320856004802329655001202377IND4429369320221118100321.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442936932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-008-9221-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaz, Mehmet10aChanges in the digestive enzymes and hormones of gilthead seabream larvae (Sparus aurata, L. 1758) fed on Artemia nauplii enriched with free lysine  ap. 523-535.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aVariations in digestive enzymes and hormones during the larval development of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) fed on live prey (Artemia nauplii) enriched with free lysine were investigated for 16 days (from day 24 to day 40). Prior to initiation of the experiment, newly hatched larvae were transferred from incubators to fiber glass tanks (300 l) with black walls and fed the same diet until day 24. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The amount of free lysine in the Artemia nauplii was increased by adding a 5.3 mM free amino acid solution to the culture water during a 16-h enrichment period. Larvae were sampled four times at four-day intervals, for 16 days. Larvae fed on the control group had lower growth than those fed on the lysine group at the end of the study but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). The highest trypsin activity and lap/leu-ala peptidase ratios were observed in the control group (P < 0.05). Significant differences between bombesin activities of the treatment groups were not found in the fifth minute after the start of feeding (P > 0.05) but were significant in the fifteenth minute (P < 0.05). Significant differences between the CCK levels of the treatment groups were found (P < 0.05). In conclusion, three main ideas are presented in this study. First, Artemia nauplii can successfully be enriched with free lysine. Second, bombesin (GRP) and cholecystokinin (CCK) activity can be stimulated by free lysine. Third, the mechanisms controlling adaptation of the activity of the trypsin to the amount of dietary protein were not activated until day 40. 3abombesin 3alysine 3adietary protein 3atrypsin 3afree amino acids 3aArtemia 3alive feeds 3aglass 3alarval development 3aSparus aurata 3atanks 3acholecystokinin 3anauplii 0aadaptation1 aTürkmen, Mustafa0 tAquaculture international.g2009 Dec., v. 17, no. 6 p.523-535dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-61207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-008-9221-7 7aarticle02237naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017300126300001600299520114800315650002501463650002701488650002101515650001701536650002201553650002501575650002701600650001701627650001501644651001501659653001601674700002301690773009401713852000901807930003301816945001301849946001301862655001201875IND2038866920221118100304.0940418e199312  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203886692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardner, J.10aPenetration, development, and reproduction of Heterodera schactii on Fagopyrum esculentum, Phacelia tanacetifolia, Raphanus sativus, Sinapis alba, and Brassica oleracea  ap. 695-702.  aThe penetration, development, and reproduction of a California population of the sugarbeet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, was observed on cultivars of cabbage (Brassica oleracea), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus), and white mustard (Sinapis alba). With the exception of the nonhost, phacelia, all were readily penetrated by second-stage juveniles of H. schachtii. After 38 days at 25 C, no cysts were observed on phacelia cv. Angelia or on the oilseed radish cv. Nemex and Pegletta. Cyst production was low (< 2.5 cysts/plant) on the buckwheat cv. Tardo and Prego and most of the oilseed radish cultivars. Cyst production was intermediate (5-14 cysts/plant) on most of the white mustard cultivars, and high on cabbage (20-110 cysts/plant). In microplot studies conducted over 133 days (approx. 450 degree-days, base 8 C), the reproductive index for H. schachtii was greater than 1.0 for cultivars of phacelia, oilseed radish, and white mustard as well as in fallow treatments, indicating the need for further research on the use of these crops under field conditions. 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aPhacelia tanacetifolia 3aRaphanus sativus 3aSinapis alba 3aBrassica oleracea 3aHeterodera schachtii 3abiological development 3areproduction 3atrap crops 3aCalifornia 0apenetration1 aCaswell-Chen, E.P.0 tJournal of nematology.g1993 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.695-702wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02995naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245013300191300001600324500002400340520156300364650001101927650001301938650001301951650001901964650001401983650001701997650003302014650001602047650002502063650006002088650006702148650006202215650002802277650001402305650002902319700002702348700002202375773010002397852000902497856005502506655001202561IND4460321720221118100231.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446032172DNAL7 a214888782pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03716.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Chun-Miao10aPhylogeny-based developmental analyses illuminate evolution of inflorescence architectures in dogwoods (Cornus s. l., Cornaceae)  ap. 850-869.  aIncludes references  a• Inflorescence architecture is important to angiosperm reproduction, but our knowledge of the developmental basis underlying the evolution of inflorescence architectures is limited. Using a phylogeny-based comparative analysis of developmental pathways, we tested the long-standing hypothesis that umbel evolved from elongated inflorescences by suppression of inflorescence branches, while head evolved from umbels by suppression of pedicels. • The developmental pathways of six species of Cornus producing different inflorescence types were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histological analysis. Critical developmental events were traced over the molecular phylogeny to identify evolutionary changes leading to the formation of umbels and heads using methods accounting for evolutionary time and phylogenetic uncertainty. • We defined 24 developmental events describing the developmental progression of the different inflorescence types. The evolutionary transition from paniculate cymes to umbels and heads required alterations of seven developmental events occurring at different evolutionary times. • Our results indicate that heads and umbels evolved independently in Cornus from elongated forms via an umbellate dichasium ancestor and this process involved several independent changes. Our findings shed novel insights into head and umbel evolution concealed by outer morphology. Our work illustrates the importance of combining developmental and phylogenetic data to better define morphological evolutionary processes. 3aCornus 3aancestry 3abranches 3ainflorescences 3aphylogeny 3areproduction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3auncertainty 2aBiological Evolution 2aCornusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aInflorescencexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aMeristemxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aOrganogenesisxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aReproductionxphysiology1 aXiang, Qiu-Yun (Jenny)1 aFranks, Robert G.0 tnew phytologist.g2011 Aug., v. 191, no. 3 p.850-869dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03716.x 7aarticle02002naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001900151245010000170300001600270520108100286650001901367650002601386650001801412650001401430650002301444653001701467700001601484700001701500773007901517852000901596930003301605945001301638946001301651655001201664IND2038865320221118100303.0940418e199312  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203886532DNAL7 a192798232pmid7 aPMC26194362pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyczepir, A.P.10aDynamics of concomitant populations of Meloidogyne incognita and Criconemella xenoplax on peach  ap. 659-665.  aThe interaction between Meloidogyne incognita and Criconemella xenoplax on nematode reproduction and growth of Lovell peach was studied in field microlots and the greenhouse. Meloidogyne incognita suppressed reproduction of C. xenoplax in both field and greenhouse experiments. Tree growth, as measured by trunk diameter, was reduced (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the presence of M. incognita as compared with C. xenoplax of the uninoculated control trees 26 months following inoculation. A similar response regarding dry root weight was also detected in greenhouse-grown seedlings after 5 months. The presence of C. xenoplax did not affect Lovell tree growth. A synergistic effect causing a reduction (P less than or equal to 0.05) in tree growth was recorded 26 and 38 months following inoculation. The presence of M. incognita increased levels of malonyl-1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid content in leaves of trees grown in field microplots 19 months after inoculation.

The infested no irrigation treatment in the pot experiment had the lowest yield among soil water treatments. 3aHeterodera glycines 3aGlycine max 3airrigated conditions 3acrop yield 3asoil water potential 0asoil water regimes1 aScott, H.D.1 aRiggs, R.D.0 tJournal of nematology.g1994 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.329-335x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02861naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001700151245011000168300001600278500001500294520165100309650001701960650002001977650002101997650000802018650003002026650002402056650002202080650002202102650002502124650002002149653001102169653002202180700001602202700001902218700001502237700001502252773008002267852000902347930003302356945001302389946001302402655001202415IND2044407620221118100229.0950202e199409  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204440762DNAL7 a192798922pmid7 aPMC26195012pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinochet, P.10aReproductive fitness and random amplified polymorphic DNA variation among isolates of Pratylenchus vulnus  ap. 271-277.  a2019-12-05  aThe reproductive fitness of seven isolates of Pratylenchus vulnus from different geographical areas and hosts was assessed in monoxenic cultures (carrot), and greenhouse cultures (plum, sour orange, and quince). The genetic makeup of the different isolates was compared by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR). The apple (PvAP-S) and apricot (PvAT-F) isolates reproduced less in monoxenic cultures than the rose (PvRO-S) and walnut (PvWA-A and PvWA-U) isolates. On plum, the rose isolate (PvRO-S) reproduced better than the apple (PvAP-S) and walnut isolate from the United States (PvWA-U). On sour orange, the apple (PvAP-S), unknown origin (PvU-UK), and walnut isolate from Argentina (PvWA-A) multiplied well, whereas the walnut isolate from the United States (PvWA-U), apricot (PvAT-F), and rose (PvRO-S) did not. On quince, the apple (PvAP-S) and walnut (PvWA-U) isolates showed a higher reproduction than the one from unknown origin (PvU-UK). RAPD-PCR patterns among the seven P. vulnus isolates were similar, although high intraspecific variability was detected. Very few bands of P. neglectus were shared by any population of P. vulnus. A high degree of similarity was found among the patterns corresponding to the rose (PvRO-S), apple (PvAP-S), walnut from the United States (PvWA-U), and unknown origin (PvUK-U) isolates. The apricot isolate (PvAT-F) was the most dissimilar among the seven isolates. No correlation could be established between the genetic variation of P. vulnus detected by RAPD-PCR and reproductive fitness. Results demonstrate high genetic variability between geographically separated populations of P. vulnus. 3areproduction 3aCydonia oblonga 3aCitrus aurantium 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aPratylenchus vulnus 3aPrunus cerasifera 3agenetic variation 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 0aPrunus 0aprunus munsoniana1 aCenis, J.L.1 aFernández, C.1 aDoucet, M.1 aMarull, J.0 tJournal of nematology.g1994 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.271-277x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02000naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138100001700156245007400173300001600247500002400263520114700287650001001434650001201444650002301456650002001479650001401499700002201513773010701535852000901642856005901651655001201710IND4447862520221118100321.0110125e199706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444786252DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.1997.060-89060.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKOMERS, PETR10aDung pellets used to identify the distribution and density of dik-dik  ap. 124-132.  aIncludes references  aEstimates of the population density of elusive animals based on counts of dung deposits are often inaccurate. We report a refinement of this technique for territorial ungulates which exploits variation in pellet characteristics between individuals. In a study of Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirki) we found that pellet size and shape were less variable within individuals than between individuals. These findings were used to census a Kenyan population entirely on the basis of uniquely identifiable pellet groups, without any prior knowledge of the identity and location of individuals. The estimates were later compared with the results of an extensive capture and radio telemetry study. Population density estimated by the pellet-matching method and by telemetry differed by less than 5%. In addition, only one border of 18 territories was incorrectly assigned, and only one territory was not detected. This represents a significant improvement in accuracy over indiscriminate dung counting techniques. We suggest that this method may also provide an accurate and non-intrusive way of estimating population density in other solitary ungulates. 3afeces 3apellets 3apopulation density 3aradio telemetry 3aungulates1 aBROTHERTON, PETER0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g1997 June, v. 35, no. 2 p.124-132dBlackwell Science Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1997.060-89060.x 7aarticle02586naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007300173300001400246500002400260520141900284650001301703650002601716650002301742650002401765650002201789650002301811650001901834650000801853650002301861650001201884650001101896650001201907650002001919650002101939650001101960700002301971773011801994852000902112856005502121655001202176IND4401611420221118095722.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440161142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-697X.2008.00101.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabreen, Shamima10aCadmium phytoextraction capacity in eight C₃ herbage grass species  ap. 27-32.  aIncludes references  aGrasses are excellent candidates for phytoremediation because of their high biomass production, high adaptability and low management cost. This study assesses interspecific variation of cadmium (Cd) phytoextraction capabilities in eight C₃ grass species. Populations of 30-day-old C₃ grass species - namely, Agrostis alba, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Dactylis glomerata, Festuca arundinacea, Festuca pratensis, Lolium multiflorum, Lolium perenne and Poa pratensis- were grown hydroponically for 15 days with different concentrations of Cd (0, 5, 10 and 50 μM). For each species, shoot biomass, the proportion of growth inhibition (GI, %), shoot Cd concentration and accumulation, shoot nutrient uptake, and the proportion of uptake inhibition (UI, %) of nutrient minerals were evaluated. Effects of Cd application included stunted growth. The GI increased from 5% to 70% with an increase in Cd concentrations. For all Cd treatments, L. multiflorum showed the highest shoot dry biomass. Shoot Cd concentrations negatively affected mineral nutrient uptake. The highest Cd treatment caused UI of various elements of 37-95%. Under 50-μM Cd treatment, Cd accumulation varied by 20 times among species, and L. multiflorum showed the highest Cd accumulation (116.46 μg plant⁻¹). Our results indicate that L. multiflorum exhibited high degrees of both Cd tolerance and Cd phytoextraction capacity among grass species. 3aAgrostis 3aAnthoxanthum odoratum 3aDactylis glomerata 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aFestuca pratensis 3aLolium multiflorum 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa 3abiomass production 3acadmium 3aforage 3agrasses 3anutrient uptake 3aphytoremediation 3ashoots1 aSugiyama, Shu-ichi0 tGrassland science.g2008 Mar., v. 54, no. 1 p.27-32dBlackwell Publishing AsiawJournal:jnl53903x1744-697X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-697X.2008.00101.x 7aarticle02050naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002500138245015300163300001800316520084500334650001301179650002301192650001301215650002101228650006601249650004401315650001301359650001601372650001401388700002301402773014201425852000901567856007801576930003301654946001301687655001201700IND4405554720221118095726.0080509e20080601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440555472DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.227142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKricheldorf, Hans R.10aSyntheses of multicyclic poly(ether sulfone)s from 5,5',6,6'-tetrahydroxy-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl spirobisindane and 4,4'-bis(4-chlorophenyl) sulfones  ap. 3732-3739.  a5,5',6,6'-Tetrahydroxy-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl spirobisindane (TTSBI) was polycondensed with 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (DCDPS) or with 4,4'-bis(4-chlorophenyl sulfonyl) biphenyl (BCSBP) in DMSO. Concentration and feed ratio were optimized to avoid gelation and to obtain a maximum yield of multicyclic polyethers free of functional groups. Regardless of these reaction conditions, only low fractions of perfect multicycles were obtained from DCDPS apparently due to steric hindrance of ring closure. Under the same conditions high fractions of perfect multicycles were achieved with the longer and more flexible DCSBP. The reaction products were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, ¹H-NMR spectroscopy viscosity, and DSC measurements. Relatively low glass transition temperatures (Tgs [almost equal to] 160-175 °C) were found. 3abiphenyl 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3agelation 3aglass transition 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aBornhorst, Kirstin0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 June 01, v. 46, no. 11 p.3732-3739dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.227143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03236naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245009000177300001800267500002400285520155500309650002501864650001301889650001101902650001401913650001501927650001101942650001601953650001701969650002101986650001302007650002202020650001602042650002802058650001702086650001902103650002202122650001902144650001002163650003902173650002502212650002602237650001402263650004002277650004702317650001702364650003902381700002402420700002202444773011702466852000902583856007802592655001202670IND4395575820221118095720.0070930e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439557582DNAL7 a177282962pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, Eric M.10aMeasurement of diffusion within the cell wall in living roots of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 3005-3015.  aIncludes references  aTo quantify the diffusion constant of small molecules in the plant cell wall, fluorescence from carboxyfluorescein (CF) in the intact roots of Arabidopsis thaliana was recorded. Roots were immersed in a solution of the fluorescent dye and viewed through a confocal fluorescence microscope. These roots are sufficiently transparent that much of the apoplast can be imaged. The diffusion coefficient, Dcw, of CF in the cell wall was probed using two protocols: fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence loss following perfusion with dye-free solution. Diffusion coefficients were obtained from the kinetics of the fluorescent transients and modelling apoplast geometry. Apoplastic diffusion constants varied spatially in the root. In the elongation zone and mature cortex, Dcw=(3.2±1.4)x10⁻¹¹ m² s⁻¹, whereas in mature epidermis, Dcw=(2.5±0.7)x10⁻¹² m² s⁻¹, at least an order of magnitude lower. Relative to the diffusion coefficient of CF in water, these represent reductions by approximately 1/15 and 1/195, respectively. The low value for mature epidermis is correlated with a suberin-like permeability barrier that was detected with either autofluorescence or berberine staining. This study provides a quantitative estimate of the permeability of plant cell walls to small organic acids--a class of compounds that includes auxin and other plant hormones. These measurements constrain models of solute transport, and are important for quantitative models of hormone signalling during plant growth and development. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aapoplast 3aauxins 3aberberine 3acell walls 3acortex 3adiffusivity 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahormones 3ahydrologic models 3amicroscopes 3aorganic acids and salts 3apermeability 3aphotobleaching 3aplant development 3aplant hormones 3aroots 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aDiffusion 2aFluoresceinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching 2aPermeability 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxmetabolism.1 aFrazer, Nicholas L.1 aBaskin, Tobias I.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Sept., v. 58, no. 11 p.3005-3015dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm1553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02242naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002100138245013600159300001800295520108900313650002301402650002101425650001101446650002201457650001901479700001701498700001901515700001601534700001901550700001801569700001801587773014201605852000901747856007801756930003301834946001301867655001201880IND4405553320221118095730.0080509e20080601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440555332DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.226962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Young Kwan10aAlternating fluorene copolymers containing isothianaphthene derivatives: A study of their aggregation properties and small band gap  ap. 3573-3590.  aSeveral fluorene copolymers containing isothianaphthene units (P1, P2, and P3) or similar derivatives (P4 and P5) have been synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Suzuki polymerization. The monomers containing isothianaphthene were prepared by a ring-closure reaction with Lawesson's reagent. Strong photoluminescence (PL) quenching in the film state was observed for P1 and P2, which was mainly due to the enhanced quinoid character formed by introducing the isothianaphthene unit. Their energy levels of the compounds were determined using cyclic voltammetry. Among the polymers tested, the polymer containing both an isothianaphthene and a selenophene unit, P2, showed the smallest band gap of 1.85 eV. The influence of structural variation on the band gap of the polymer chains was further investigated by optimizing the geometries of several model monomers. Our results based on the optical and electrochemical properties combined with theoretical calculations showed that polymers containing isothianaphthene have small band gaps, rigid conformations, and strong tendencies to aggregation. 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aphotoluminescence 3apolymerization1 aKim, Hyoseok1 aPark, Jong-Hwa1 aLee, Jaemin1 aLee, Sang-Kyu.1 aLee, Yoon Sup1 aShim, Hong-Ku0 tJournal of polymer science.g2008 June 01, v. 46, no. 11 p.3573-3590dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.226963Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01490naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245005100130300001600181520079100197650001500988650002401003650002201027653002701049773008001076852000901156930003301165945001301198946001301211655001201224IND2036873720221118095811.0940125e199309  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203687372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEisenback, J.D.10aInteractive multimedia for teaching nematology  ap. 367-373.  aThe availability of interactive multimedia authoring software programs promises to revolutionize the teaching of nematology.

An interactive multimedia presentation that supplements lectures in an introductory course is presented as an example of the application of this technology for teaching nematology. 3anematology 3aeducational methods 3acomputer software 0amultimedia instruction0 tJournal of nematology.g1993 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.367-373x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940202b19940204c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle04744naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100001800184245015400202300001600356500002400372506007600396520204500472506003702517650002002554650002102574650001302595650003802608650003702646650003802683650002002721650001702741650001102758650001402769650001402783650001302797650001302810650001402823650001302837650003602850650002402886650005102910650002402961650006402985650006303049650007903112650007803191650003603269650001103305650006103316650001103377650002703388650003503415650003603450650001103486650000903497650003203506650003103538651001103569700002603580700002103606700002703627700001903654700002303673700002303696700002603719773013703745852000903882856008303891655001203974IND4449782220221207144543.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444978222DNAL7 a212481832pmid7 aPMC30415992pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.110.0039132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Kurt Z.10aVitamin A supplementation modifies the association between mucosal innate and adaptive immune responses and resolution of enteric pathogen infections  ap. 578-585.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The efficacy of vitamin A supplementation on diarrheal disease morbidity may reflect the divergent effects that supplementation has on pathogen-specific immune responses and pathogen-specific outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We examined how vitamin A supplementation modified associations between gut-cytokine immune responses and the resolution of different diarrheal pathogen infections. DESIGN: Stools collected from 127 Mexican children who were 5-15 mo old and enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled vitamin A supplementation trial were screened for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and Giardia lamblia. Fecal concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Hazard models that incorporated categorized cytokine variables (ie, nondetectable, less than the median of detectable concentrations, and at least the median of detectable concentrations) were fit to the length of pathogen infections stratified by treatment group. RESULTS: Vitamin A-supplemented children with fecal MCP-1 or IL-8 concentrations less than the median of detectable concentrations and IL-10 concentrations of at least median concentrations had longer durations of EPEC infection than did children in the placebo group. In supplemented children, detectable fecal TNF-α or IL-6 concentrations were associated with shorter ETEC infection durations, whereas MCP-1 concentrations of at least the median were associated with longer infection durations. Children in this group who had IL-4, IL-5, or IFN-γ concentrations of at least median detectable concentrations had shorter durations of G. lamblia infection. CONCLUSION: The effect of supplementation on associations between fecal cytokine concentrations and pathogen infection resolution depends on the role of inflammatory immune responses in resolving specific pathogen infections.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGiardia lamblia 3achemoattractants 3achildren 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmune response 3ainterleukins 3amodels 3amorbidity 3apathogens 3aplacebos 3aproteins 3ascreening 3avitamins 2aAdaptive Immunityxdrug effects 2aCytokinesxanalysis 2aDiarrhea, Infantilexdrug therapyximmunology. 2aDietary Supplements 2aEnterobacteriaceaexdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aEnterobacteriaceae Infectionsxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aEnteropathogenic Escherichia colixdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia colixdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aFecesxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aGiardia lambliaxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aHumans 2aImmunityxdrug effects 2aImmunity, Innatexdrug effects 2aImmunity, Mucosalxdrug effects 2aInfant 2aMale 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aVitamin Axtherapeutic use 0aMexico1 aSantos, José Ignacio1 aRosado, Jorge L.1 aEstrada-Garcia, Teresa1 aHaas, Meredith1 aAl Mamun, Abdullah1 aDuPont, Herbert L.1 aNanthakumar, Nanda N.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 93, no. 3 p.578-585dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.110.0039133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02108naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001500151245005900166300001600225500001500241520109300256650002901349650003001378650002201408650002101430650004201451650001701493653003101510653002601541700001601567773009501583852000901678930003301687945001301720946001301733655001201746IND2036877720221118095406.0940125e199309  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203687772DNAL7 a192798012pmid7 aPMC26193942pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBird, A.F.10aFeeding of the nematode Acrobeloides nanus on bacteria  ap. 493-499.  a2019-12-05  aInformation on the effect of bacteria-feeding nematodes on bacterial populations in the soil is sparse. We have isolated, cultured, and microscopically examined bacteria and nematodes coexisting within an agricultural soil and have studied their feeding relationship. The bacterium Pseudomonas corrugata isolate 2140R is a biocontrol agent against the pathogenic fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. The nematode Acrobeloides nanus is a cosmopolitan, bacteria-feeding organism widespread in agricultural and arid soils throughout Australia. Using light and electron microscopy, we observed the ingestion and breakdown of P. corrugata in the pharynx of A. nanus and bacterial passage through the nematode intestine as well as the accumulation of fluorescent compounds from ingested and broken P. fluorescens in the lumen of the nematode's intestine. We also observed A. nanus feeding, growing, and reproducing on the Gram-positive bacterium Clavibacter toxicus, the causative agent of the disease annual ryegrass toxicity, and detected crushed bacteria in the nematode's intestine. 3aPseudomonas mediterranea 3abiological control agents 3aTriticum aestivum 3afeeding behavior 3aGaeumannomyces graminis var. graminis 3aAcrobeloides 0abacteria feeding nematodes 0aPseudomonas corrugata1 aRyder, M.H.0 tJournal of nematology.g1993 Sept., v. 25, no. 3 p.493-499wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdTLX  aOther US 7aarticle02780naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010900126300001800235500001500253520166400268650001201932650001601944650002001960650002301980650001602003650002502019650002302044650001102067650002002078653001002098653001502108653002302123653000902146700001802155700001702173700001502190773008502205852000902290930003302299945001302332946001302345655001202358IND2197258820221118095600.0990226e199809  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219725882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoutrou, R.10aSimple tests for predicting the lytic behavior and proteolytic activity of lactococcal strains in cheese  ap. 2321-2328.  a2019-12-05  aThe variations of the autolytic and proteolytic potential of lactococci need to be taken into account because these variations probably influence the development of organoleptic properties during cheese ripening. To predict lytic capacity, proteolytic potential, and specificity of cell surface-associated proteinase, we developed simple tests that were applied to 26 industrial strains and a few reference strains of Lactococcus lactis. The tests allowed us to measure the autolytic capacity of lactococci in a buffer or in a pseudo curd under conditions that were close to those of cheese ripening and to evaluate global peptidase activity, proteinase activity, and specificity using casein or casein hydrolysate as a substrate. We confirmed the variability of the autolytic capacity of lactococci and classified the strains into three groups by low, moderate, or high lytic capacity according to their behavior in the buffer and in pseudo curd tests. Validation of the latter was obtained by the observation of similar lytic behavior in the two reference strains of Lactococcus lactis, AM2 and NCDO763, which were highly autolytic and poorly autolytic, respectively, both in our tests and in previously reported cheese experiments. The global activities of peptidases and proteinase varied from 1 to 6 among the strains. Most of the proteinases that were isolated from the highly proteolytic industrial strains hydrolyzed beta-casein preferentially and, consequently, are more like the PI-type proteinase than the PIII-type. We used simple, rapid methods to test a large number of strains to predict their lytic behavior and proteolytic activity in cheese. 3abuffers 3aproteinases 3acheese ripening 3astrain differences 3aproteolysis 3abiochemical pathways 3aLactococcus lactis 3acasein 3aenzyme activity 0alysis 0apeptidases 0aenzyme specificity 0acurd1 aSepulchre, A.1 aGripon, J.C.1 aMonnet, V.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2321-2328x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03186naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245018600145300001800331500001500349520118000364650001501544650002601559650001901585650002901604650002601633650002101659650002001680650001201700650001101712650005701723650006601780650006101846650001101907650004101918650005801959650005402017650003802071650001402109650005202123650004002175650005102215650004302266653000902309653002802318653001302346653002502359653002102384700002002405700001902425773008402444852000902528930003302537945001302570946001302583655001202596IND2196864820221118100349.0990205e199808  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219686482DNAL7 a97493962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoddie, R.L.10aGermicidal activity of a chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide teat dip and a sodium chlorite teat dip during experimental challenge with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae  ap. 2293-2298.  a2019-12-05  aThree postmilking teat dips were tested for efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae in two separate studies using experimental challenge procedures that were recommended by the National Mastitis Council. The first study evaluated a a barrier teat dip product containing chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide as the germicidal agent, and the second study evaluated a sodium chlorite product with a barrier component as well as a sodium chlorite product without a barrier component. The chlorous acid-chlorine dioxide teat dip reduced new intramammary infections (IMI) caused by Staph. aureus by 91.5% and reduced new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 71.7%. The barrier dip containing sodium chlorite reduced new IMI caused by Staph. aureus and Strep. agalactiae by 41.0 and 0%, respectively. The nonbarrier dip containing sodium chlorite reduced new IMI caused by Staph. aureus by 65.6% and reduced new IMI caused by Strep. agalactiae by 39.1%. Teat skin and teat end conditions were evaluated before and after the second study; no deleterious effects among dipped quarters compared with control quarters were noted for the two sodium chlorite products. 3adairy cows 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3audder quarters 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aanti-infective agents 3achlorine dioxide 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aChloridesxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aChlorine Compoundsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aDisinfectantsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aFemale 2aMammary Glands, Animalxmicrobiology 2aMastitis, Bovinexmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aOxidesxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aSkinxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aSolutions 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxprevention & control 2aStaphylococcus aureusxdrug effects 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxprevention & control 2aStreptococcus agalactiaexdrug effects 0askin 0aexperimental infections 0ateat dip 0aantimicrobial agents 0abarrier teat dip1 aNickerson, S.C.1 aAdkinson, R.W.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1998 Aug., v. 81, no. 8 p.2293-2298x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle
