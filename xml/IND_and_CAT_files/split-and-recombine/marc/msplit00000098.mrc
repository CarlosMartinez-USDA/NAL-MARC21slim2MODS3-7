Current and potential biofuel production systems were evaluated from a long-term continuous no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) field trial under differing harvest strategies and nitrogen (N) fertilizer intensities to determine overall environmental sustainability. Corn and switchgrass grown for bioenergy resulted in near-term net greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions of -29 to -396 grams of CO2 equivalent emissions per megajoule of ethanol per year as a result of direct soil carbon sequestration and from the adoption of integrated biofuel conversion pathways. Management practices in switchgrass and corn resulted in large variation in petroleum offset potential. Switchgrass, using best management practices produced 3919±117 liters of ethanol per hectare and had 74±2.2 gigajoules of petroleum offsets per hectare which was similar to intensified corn systems (grain and 50% residue harvest under optimal N rates). Co-locating and integrating cellulosic biorefineries with existing dry mill corn grain ethanol facilities improved net energy yields (GJ ha-1) of corn grain ethanol by > 70%. A multi-feedstock, landscape approach coupled with an integrated biorefinery would be a viable option to meet growing renewable transportation fuel demands while improving the energy efficiency of first generation biofuels.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanicum virgatum 3aZea mays 3aagricultural land 3abest management practices 3abiofuels 3abiorefining 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn 3acropping systems 3aenergy efficiency 3aethanol 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apetroleum 3atransportation 3aUnited States1 aVogel, Kenneth P.1 aVarvel, Gary E.1 aFollett, Ronald F.1 aMitchell, Rob't B.q(Robert B.),1 aJin, Virginia L.0 tPloS one.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 9, no. 3 p.e89501-e89501wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/585823Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089501  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Schmer%20-%20Log%20296012%20-%20Energy%20potential%20.%20.%20.%20et%20al%202014%20PLOS%20ONE%20.%20.%20.%20submit%2003-10-2014.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007700171300001400248520089900262592002801161650001901189650001201208650002601220650001801246651001201264653001801276653001801294653000701312653002201319653000901341700001801350773012301368856008501491852000901576655001201585IND60619588520221119163759.0190318e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061958852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuuskonen, Janna10aSoil sampling with drones and augmented reality in precision agriculture  ap. 25-35.  aSoil sampling is an important tool to gather information for making proper decisions regarding the fertilization of fields. Depending on the national regulations, the minimum frequency may be once per five years and spatially every ten hectares. For precision farming purposes, this is not sufficient. In precision farming, the challenge is to collect the samples from such regions that are internally consistent while limiting the number of samples required. For this purpose, management zones are used to divide the field into smaller regions. This article presents a novel approach to automatically determine the locations for soil samples based on a soil map created from drone imaging after ploughing, and a wearable augmented reality technology to guide the user to the generated sample points. Finally, the article presents the results of a demonstration carried out in southern Finland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3aplowing 3aprecision agriculture 3asoil sampling 3aFinland 0aSoil analysis 0aMixed reality 0aAR 0aPrecision farming 0aRPAS1 aOksanen, Timo0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2018 Nov., v. 154 p.25-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245012800159300002000287520135600307592002801663650003701691650002101728650001701749650001501766650001301781650001601794650001101810650001301821650002201834650002201856650001201878650003301890650001901923650001601942700001701958700001301975700001501988700001302003700001902016700001602035700001402051773012702065856008102192852000902273655001202282IND60556283020221119150953.0161102e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055628302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b019192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bi10aUsing the Novel Method of Nonthermal Plasma To Add Cl Active Sites on Activated Carbon for Removal of Mercury from Flue Gas  ap. 11837-11843.  aA new method using nonthermal plasma to add Cl active sites on activated carbon was proposed to improve the efficiency of activated carbon (AC) for removal of mercury from flue gas. The experiments were conducted via a lab-scale dielectric barrier discharge nonthermal plasma system and a vertical adsorption reactor. The results showed that the nonthermal plasma treatment with a small amount of Cl₂ successfully added Cl active sites on AC and greatly increased the mercury removal efficiency of AC by chemisorption in a very short treatment time. The increase in Cl₂ concentration for AC treatment promoted the efficiency of AC. The capacity of mercury adsorption positively correlated with the content of Cl₂ for AC treatment, which depends on the number of Cl active sites on activated carbon. The treated AC maintained a high mercury removal efficiency within a temperature range of 30–210 °C. SO₂ and H₂O in flue gas inhibited the removal of mercury by AC, while HCl had a promotional effect. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated the chemisorption of mercury was attributed to the C–Cl groups generated on AC surfaces during Cl₂ nonthermal plasma treatment. The C–Cl groups as active sites had strong adsorption energy for mercury, which converted elemental mercury to HgCl₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivated carbon 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3achlorine 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3ahydrochloric acid 3amercuric chloride 3amercury 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature1 aZeng, Xiaobo1 aXu, Ping1 aChen, Juan1 aXu, Yang1 aLuo, Guangqian1 aXu, Minghou1 aYao, Hong0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 50, no. 21 p.11837-11843dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b019193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006500156300001600221520102400237592002801261650000801289650001201297650002601309650001901335650001001354650002001364650000901384650001501393650003201408650001501440773010101455856007301556852000901629655001201638IND60480601520221122065108.0160128e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048060152DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.124722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOw, David W.14aThe long road to recombinase‐mediated plant transformation  ap. 441-447.  aThe use of site‐specific recombinases to manipulate eukaryotic genomes began nearly three decades ago. Although seemingly parallel efforts were being made in animal and plant systems, the motivation for its development in plants was unique to, at least at the time, crop bioengineering issues. The impetus behind site‐specific deletion in plants was to remove antibiotic resistance genes used during transformation but unnecessary in commercial products. Site‐specific integration in plants was more than academic curiosity of position effects on gene expression, but a necessary step towards developing the serial stacking of DNA to the same chromosome locus – to insure that bioengineered crops can be improved over time through transgene additions without inflating the number of segregating loci. This article is not a review of the literature on site‐specific recombination, but a first person account of the series of events leading to the development of a gene stacking transformation system in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimals 3aantibiotic resistance 3abioengineering 3acrops 3agene expression 3aloci 3amotivation 3asite-specific recombination 3atransgenes0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2016 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.441-447dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.124723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245006600166520177800232592002802010650002402038650002002062650001302082650002102095650001502116650002202131650001602153650001102169650001602180650001602196650002202212650001202234651002802246700002002274700003002294700002502324773011902349856007302468852000902541655001202550IND60653378920221119070015.0190714e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337892DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiccolroaz, Sebastiano10aExploring and Quantifying River Thermal Response to Heatwaves  aMost of the existing literature on river water temperature focuseds on river thermal sensitivity to long-term trends of climate variables, whereas how river water temperature responds to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, still requires in-depth analysis. Research in this direction is particularly relevant in that heatwaves are expected to increase in intensity, frequency, and duration in the coming decades, with likely consequences on river thermal regimes and ecology. In this study we analyzed the long-term temperature and streamflow series of 19 Swiss rivers with different hydrological regime (regulated, low-land, and snow-fed), and characterized how concurrent changes in air temperature and streamflow concurred to affect their thermal dynamics. We focused on quantifying the thermal response to the three most significant heatwave events that occurred in Central Europe since 1950 (July&ndash;August 2003, July 2006, and July 2015). We found that the thermal response of the analyzed rivers contrasted strongly depending on the river hydrological regime, confirming the behavior observed under typical weather conditions. Low-land rivers were extremely sensitive to heatwaves. In sharp contrast, high-altitude snow-fed rivers and regulated rivers receiving cold water from higher altitude hydropower reservoirs or diversions showed a damped thermal response. The results presented in this study suggest that water resource managers should be aware of the multiple consequences of heatwave events on river water temperature and incorporate expected thermal responses in adaptive management policy. In this respect, additional efforts and dedicated studies are required to deepen our knowledge on how extreme heatwave events can affect river ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive management 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3aissues and policy 3ariver water 3arivers 3astream flow 3awater power 3awater temperature 3aweather 3aCentral European region1 aToffolon, Marco1 aRobinson, Christopher T.,1 aSiviglia, Annunziato0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 17, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245015000170300001400320500001400334520129100348592002801639650002401667650001301691650001501704650002301719650001501742650001401757700002301771700002301794700002301817700002001840773013901860856007901999852000902078655001202087IND60722644720221121013717.0210107s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264472DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2020-00302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGuigan, Charles J.10aQuantifying the effects of pop-up satellite archival tags on the swimming performance and behavior of young-adult mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus)  ap. 32-39.  aNAL-light  aPop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) have been used to demonstrate habitat utilization and large-scale migrations of aquatic species and are a critical tool to manage highly migratory fish populations. Use of PSATs has increased in recent years; however, few studies have investigated the physiological and behavioral effects of carrying a PSAT. To address this gap, young-adult mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus; 25–35 cm fork length) were tagged with miniature PSATs and assessed in a two-part experiment utilizing swim tunnel respirometry and behavioral analysis of free-swimming individuals. Swim tunnel respirometry revealed significant reductions in the critical and optimal swimming speeds of tagged fish (10.2% and 20.9%, respectively), as well as significant reductions in maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope (16.1% and 21.4%, respectively). In contrast, mean and maximum velocity, acceleration, total distance traveled, survival, and feeding success of free-swimming tagged fish showed no impacts of tagging compared with untagged conspecifics held in the same tank. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering multiple methodologies to assess the impacts of tagging fish and provide insight into the data collected by PSATs deployed on wild fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoryphaena hippurus 3ahabitats 3ametabolism 3amigratory behavior 3asatellites 3awild fish1 aSchlenker, Lela S.1 aStieglitz, John D.1 aBenetti, Daniel D.1 aGrosell, Martin0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2021, v. 78, no. 1 p.32-39dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2020-00303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245012300151300001600274520185600290592002802146650002602174650001202200650002302212650002302235650001802258650001702276650002602293650001202319650001302331650001402344650001402358650002202372650001602394700002402410700002502434700002902459700001402488700002402502700002202526700001702548700002302565700002102588700001902609700002302628700001602651700002202667700002702689700001602716773010102732856007302833852000902906655001202915IND60480601620221122051757.0160128e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048060162DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.124032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jin10aMultiplexed, targeted gene editing in Nicotiana benthamiana for glyco‐engineering and monoclonal antibody production  ap. 533-542.  aBiopharmaceutical glycoproteins produced in plants carry N‐glycans with plant‐specific residues core α(1,3)‐fucose and β(1,2)‐xylose, which can significantly impact the activity, stability and immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals. In this study, we have employed sequence‐specific transcription activator‐like effector nucleases (TALENs) to knock out two α(1,3)‐fucosyltransferase (FucT) and the two β(1,2)‐xylosyltransferase (XylT) genes within Nicotiana benthamiana to generate plants with improved capacity to produce glycoproteins devoid of plant‐specific residues. Among plants regenerated from N. benthamiana protoplasts transformed with TALENs targeting either the FucT or XylT genes, 50% (80 of 160) and 73% (94 of 129) had mutations in at least one FucT or XylT allele, respectively. Among plants regenerated from protoplasts transformed with both TALEN pairs, 17% (18 of 105) had mutations in all four gene targets, and 3% (3 of 105) plants had mutations in all eight alleles comprising both gene families; these mutations were transmitted to the next generation. Endogenous proteins expressed in the complete knockout line had N‐glycans that lacked β(1,2)‐xylose and had a significant reduction in core α(1,3)‐fucose levels (40% of wild type). A similar phenotype was observed in the N‐glycans of a recombinant rituximab antibody transiently expressed in the homozygous mutant plants. More importantly, the most desirable glycoform, one lacking both core α(1,3)‐fucose and β(1,2)‐xylose residues, increased in the antibody from 2% when produced in the wild‐type line to 55% in the mutant line. These results demonstrate the power of TALENs for multiplexed gene editing. Furthermore, the mutant N. benthamiana lines provide a valuable platform for producing highly potent biopharmaceutical products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aalleles 3aantibody formation 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aglycoproteins 3ahomozygosity 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutants 3amutation 3anucleases 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 3aprotoplasts1 aStoddard, Thomas J.1 aDemorest, Zachary L.1 aLavoie, Pierre‐Olivier1 aLuo, Song1 aClasen, Benjamin M.1 aCedrone, Frederic1 aRay, Erin E.1 aCoffman, Andrew P.1 aDaulhac, Aurelie1 aYabandith, Ann1 aRetterath, Adam J.1 aMathis, Luc1 aVoytas, Daniel F.1 aD'Aoust, Marc‐André1 aZhang, Feng0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2016 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.533-542dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.124033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02770naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001800159245008300177300001600260500000900276520160800285592002801893650002201921650001601943650002101959650001501980650001201995650002102007650001702028650002502045650002702070650003602097650002302133773014702156852000902303856009602312655001202408IND2046648220221119094200.0191125e199505  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204664822DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900030002x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, D. L.10aSpring Wheat Straw Production and Composition as Influenced by Topsoil Removal  ap. 649-654.  aepub  aWind and water erosion have resulted in reduced crop productivity and created soil management problems. Management of crop residues can be effective for soil erosion control, but influences of soil erosion on crop residue production is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine total residue production and residue N and P concentration and content for 8 yr as influenced by topsoil removal and additions of N and P fertilizer for a spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow system. Total straw production for the first increment of P increased ≈ 14% for 0.00- and 0.06-m soil removal treatments compared with ≈ 33% for 0.12- and 0.18-m soil removal treatments. Total straw production was increased more than total grain production with the addition of N and P fertilizer. Total straw production for 0.12- and 0.18-m soil removal treatments needed at least 20 kg P ha⁻¹ and 35 kg N ha⁻¹ to equal or exceed that for 0.00-m soil removal treatment with no fertilizer additions. Total straw N content decreased 33% as soil removal increased from 0.00 to 0.18 m. While total straw P content was considerably less than total straw N content, both decreased about 32% for 0.18 m compared with 0.00-m soil removal treatments. Greater total straw N and P content for the 0.00-m soil removal treatment was due to greater total straw production as well as greater N and P concentrations. Consequently, cycling of N and P may be reduced for eroded soils due to low quantities of residue as well as low N and P concentrations in the residues.

The results show that PHA based denitrification (PBD) of real wastewater can be a viable alternative, especially for wastewater with low COD/N ratio, without the need for external carbon source addition. High nitrate removal capacity of about 40–50mgN/L with a low COD/N requirement of about 4–5, were observed. It was found that entrapped particulate organic matter contributed additional reducing power, on top of the storage materials, thus allowing for the high nitrate reduction capacity. Daily removal rates were similar to those of extensive treatment systems (0.24–0.31grN/L reactor*d). Large differences in storage yield and composition between biomass grown on synthetic and municipal wastewater were observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abiomass 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3aparticulates 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3ayields 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aBiofilms 2aBiological Oxygen Demand Analysis 2aChromatography, Gas 2aDenitrificationxphysiology 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPolyhydroxyalkanoatesxmetabolism 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aIsrael 0aBacterial storage polymers 0aPHA 0aAnaerobic storage 0aDenitrification with PHA as the electron donor 0aTwo sludge system for wastewater treatment1 aBeliavsky, Michael1 aTarre, Sheldon1 aGreen, Michal0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Mar., v. 132 p.28-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.11.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245013900169300001600308520139000324592002801714650001801742650001801760650001301778650001601791650001601807650001401823650001701837650001601854650002801870650001501898650001501913650001101928650001301939650001201952650004201964650001102006650001402017650000902031650001102040650002402051650001002075700002302085700002002108773011702128856008102245852000902326655001202335IND60573990020221121014129.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057399002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-016-0780-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Liangliang10aBacteriological analysis of saliva from partially or fully engorged female adult Rhipicephalus microplus by next-generation sequencing  ap. 105-113.  aTick-borne diseases are a major epidemiological problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial composition of saliva obtained from engorged adult Rhipicephalus microplus females. Saliva samples collected from partially or fully engorged adult female ticks were analysed using an ultra-high-throughput Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing system. To elucidate the possible routes of bacterial transmission, the bacterial flora from whole ticks were also investigated. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the predominant phyla in all samples, and Acinetobacter, Rickettsia, Escherichia and Coxiella were the major genera. Microbial diversity in saliva samples from partially engorged ticks was more complex than that of samples from fully engorged individuals. The comparison of saliva and whole-tick samples suggests that bacteria in saliva also colonize the tick’s body. We believe that some bacterial genera, such as Dermacoccus, Achromia, SMB53, Sutterella, Providencia, Mycoplana, Oscillospira, and Agrobacterium, were found and reported in ticks for the first time. The Coxiella and Rickettsia detected in this study might be tick-borne pathogens, suggesting health risks associated with exposure to R. microplus in humans and animals. These findings may serve as the basis for developing strategies to control ticks and tick-borne diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aAgrobacterium 3aCoxiella 3aDermacoccus 3aEscherichia 3aMycoplana 3aOscillospira 3aProvidencia 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aRickettsia 3aSutterella 3aadults 3abacteria 3afemales 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahumans 3apathogens 3arisk 3asaliva 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks1 aPoźniak, Błażej1 aCheng, Tian-Yin0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2017 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.105-113dSpringer International Publishingx0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-016-0780-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03850naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005900138245012600197500002000323520234500343592002802688596005902716596005702775650001302832650001102845650000902856650001502865650002002880650002102900650001902921650001402940650001702954650003202971650001803003650001703021650002203038650001503060650001703075700006203092700006003154773010803214856007303322852000903395655001203404IND60790668620221119182836.0220826e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079066862DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.3342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeymans, Adrien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3685-224010aCombining cross‐section images and modeling tools to create high‐resolution root system hydraulic atlases in Zea mays  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRoot hydraulic properties play a central role in the global water cycle, in agricultural systems productivity, and in ecosystem survival as they impact the canopy water supply. However, the existing experimental methods to quantify root hydraulic conductivities, such as the root pressure probing, are particularly challenging, and their applicability to thin roots and small root segments is limited. Therefore, there is a gap in methods enabling easy estimations of root hydraulic conductivities in diverse root types. Here, we present a new pipeline to quickly estimate root hydraulic conductivities across different root types, at high resolution along root axes. Shortly, free‐hand root cross‐sections were used to extract a selected number of key anatomical traits. We used these traits to parametrize the Generator of Root Anatomy in R (GRANAR) model to simulate root anatomical networks. Finally, we used these generated anatomical networks within the Model of Explicit Cross‐section Hydraulic Anatomy (MECHA) to compute an estimation of the root axial and radial hydraulic conductivities (kₓ and kᵣ, respectively). Using this combination of anatomical data and computational models, we were able to create a root hydraulic conductivity atlas at the root system level, for 14‐day‐old pot‐grown Zea mays (maize) plants of the var. B73. The altas highlights the significant functional variations along and between different root types. For instance, predicted variations of radial conductivity along the root axis were strongly dependent on the maturation stage of hydrophobic barriers. The same was also true for the maturation rates of the metaxylem vessels. Differences in anatomical traits along and across root types generated substantial variations in radial and axial conductivities estimated with our novel approach. Our methodological pipeline combines anatomical data and computational models to turn root cross‐section images into a detailed hydraulic atlas. It is an inexpensive, fast, and easily applicable investigation tool for root hydraulics that complements existing complex experimental methods. It opens the way to high‐throughput studies on the functional importance of root types in plant hydraulics, especially if combined with novel phenotyping techniques such as laser ablation tomography.  aPublisher supplied data  aF.4524.20.cBelgian Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique  a1208619FcBelgian Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique 3aZea mays 3acanopy 3acorn 3aecosystems 3afluid mechanics 3ahydrologic cycle 3ahydrophobicity 3aphenotype 3aroot anatomy 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3aroot pressure 3aroot systems 3asimulation models 3atomography 3awater supply1 aCouvreur, Valentin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1087-39781 aLobet, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5883-45720 tPlant direct.g2021 July, v. 5, no. 7 p.e00290-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.3343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100002000153245007100173300001600244520078900260592002801049650001901077650001601096653002201112653001901134653001101153653003101164653001401195653001501209653001601224653001101240653004701251653001801298653004301316700002701359773011901386852000901505856008201514655001201596991620947520742620221121061847.0181030e197304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7391674532DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517573043004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Mary L.10aProperties of Durable-Press Cotton Fabrics Related to Swellability  ap. 218-227.  aFabrics with a wide range of durable-press properties were prepared by treating cotton printcloth with dimethyloldi hydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) by pad-dry-cure, mild-cure, and steam-cure processes and with formaldehyde by vapor-phase, Form D, and Form W processes.

Li-S batteries have been attracted increasing attention owing to the high theoretical capacity of element sulfur (S, 1672mAhg⁻¹). Nevertheless, the insulation nature of the S element and polysulfide shuttle effect, resulting in low S utilization and poor cycling stability, are the main obstacles to widespread practical utilization of Li-S batteries. To tackle these issues, a well-designed hybrid cathode, consisted of S-infused activated carbon fiber (ACF) cloth and a thin TiO2 wrapping layer (TiO2-ACF/S), is developed in this work with the TiO2 wrapping layer as a polysulfide chemisorption layer, while the ACF cloth being a conductive network. Compared to the pure S and ACF/S cathodes, the TiO2-ACF/S hybrid cathode, with a high S loading of about 3.0mgcm⁻², displays an improved initial specific capacity (915mAhg⁻¹ at 0.2C), cycle stability (capacity retention of 77% after 100 cycles, 702mAhg⁻¹), and rate ability (438mAhg⁻¹ at 5C). The enhanced electrochemical performances of TiO2-ACF/S hybrid cathode are attributed to the synergistic effects from TiO2 (polysulfide chemisorption material), ACF (electronically conductive material) and S (high hosting capacity of Li ions).  aPublisher supplied data 0a：activated carbon fiber cloth 0atitanium dioxide 0acathode materials 0alithium-sulfur batteries 0aenergy storage1 aZhang, Kun1 aHan, Yunzhao1 aYuan, Kai1 aSong, Qiang1 aWang, Jian-gan1 aShen, Chao1 aLiu, Xingrui1 aWei, Bingqing0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.415-421dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008200171300001600253520107100269592002801340650001901368650002201387650001101409650002301420653002501443653002601468653002201494653002301516700002001539700002201559773009801581856008501679852000901764655001201773IND60573720420221118101532.0170724e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372042DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2016.12392942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandon, Adam C.13aAn Augmented Norm Activation Model: The Case of Residential Outdoor Water Use  ap. 903-918.  aUnderstanding the factors that influence voluntary conservation is critical for developing effective residential water conservation policy. Previous work drawing on Schwartz’s Norm Activation Model (NAM) has been useful to understand some of these factors. However, one’s relationship with the broader community impacted by consumptive decisions has often been overlooked. Similarly, scholars have emphasized the importance of contextual factors not captured in the NAM. In this study we hypothesize and test an augmented NAM that incorporates community attachment, along with contextual variables (sociodemographic and household infrastructure), to understand the factors that lead to the development of moral obligations to conserve water and their relationship with residential outdoor water use. Results indicate personal norms, defined as a moral obligation to conserve water, are negatively related to outdoor water use, and that community attachment is a predictor of personal norms. Contextual factors are found to have an influence on outdoor water use.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3awater conservation 0aCommunity attachment 0anorm activation model 0aoutdoor water use 0awater conservation1 aKyle, Gerard T.1 aKaiser, Ronald A.0 tSociety & natural resources.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 30, no. 8 p.903-918dRoutledgex1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2016.12392943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245015900176300001400335500001100349520089100360592002801251650002301279650005201302650002501354650002601379650001801405650001301423650001201436700002801448700002201476700002101498700001701519700001801536700002001554700002001574700001901594700001901613773014301632856008301775852000901858655001201867IND60723079520221121173739.0211118e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072307952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02958-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayamohan, Harikrishnan10aSARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a review of molecular diagnostic tools including sample collection and commercial response with associated advantages and limitations  ap. 49-71.  aReview  aThe unprecedented global pandemic known as SARS-CoV-2 has exercised to its limits nearly all aspects of modern viral diagnostics. In doing so, it has illuminated both the advantages and limitations of current technologies. Tremendous effort has been put forth to expand our capacity to diagnose this deadly virus. In this work, we put forth key observations in the functionality of current methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. These methods include nucleic acid amplification–, CRISPR-, sequencing-, antigen-, and antibody-based detection methods. Additionally, we include analysis of equally critical aspects of COVID-19 diagnostics, including sample collection and preparation, testing models, and commercial response. We emphasize the integrated nature of assays, wherein issues in sample collection and preparation could impact the overall performance in a clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aanalytical chemistry 3adiagnostic techniques 3anucleic acids 3apandemic 3aviruses1 aLambert, Christopher J.1 aSant, Himanshu J.1 aJafek, Alexander1 aPatel, Dhruv1 aFeng, Haidong1 aBeeman, Michael1 aMahmood, Tawsif1 aNze, Ugochukwu1 aGale, Bruce K.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 413, no. 1 p.49-71dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02958-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013300167506002800300520140400328592002801732506003701760650002501797650001801822650001701840650001701857650001301874650003301887650001301920650002501933700002701958700002201985773009202007856008002099852000902179655001202188IND60785217420221207131947.0220617e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078521742DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2306242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANISA, WITRI NUR 10aSelection of tomato breeding lines based on morphological traits associated with high yield potential in double-cross population  aResource is Open Access  aAnisa WN, Afifah EN, Murti RH. 2022. Selection of tomato breeding lines based on morphological traits associated with high yield potential in double-cross population. Biodiversitas 23: 2973-2980. Low tomato production is a global problem. Plant breeding has been intensified to develop high-yield varieties and meet the high production of vegetable crops. Selection is an essential part of plant breeding to evaluate desirable traits of breeding lines. This study aimed to identify tomato breeding lines with high yield potential from 13 breeding lines and 2 commercial tomatoes. Collected data were analyzed using analysis of variance, post hoc, path, and principal component analysis. Results showed that 9 tomato lines, namely, BV-1, BV-2, BV-3, BV-6, BV-7, BV-9, BV-11, BV-12, and BV-13 had a high yield potential based on the number of fruits per plant and fruit weight. Given their high path coefficient value and significant correlation (P<0.05) with the yield potential, these two characteristics are highly recommended to be used as selection criteria for the high yield potential of tomato plants. The following characteristics had a high value of heritability: fruit weight, fruit length, fruit diameter, fruit firmness, fruit locules, fruit pericarp thickness, total soluble solid, number of flowers per bunch, number of fruits per bunch, number of fruits per plant, and harvesting age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3afruit quality 3afruit weight 3aheritability 3apericarp 3aprincipal component analysis 3atomatoes 3atotal soluble solids1 aAFIFAH, ENIK NURLAILI 1 aMURTI, RUDI HARI 0 tBiodiversitas.g2022 June, v. 23, no. 6dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2306243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245011300195300001600308506007600324520182100400592002802221506003702249650002002286650001802306650001102324650001102335650000902346650001802355650001502373650001402388650003102402650001002433650002102443650001902464650001302483650001302496650001702509650002002526650001002546700001602556700001802572700002302590700001702613700001102630700001602641773010102657856007302758852000902831655001202840IND60480601820221207120513.0160128e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048060182DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.124252doi7 aPMC47551972pmcid7 a261332322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Libo10aShoot bending promotes flower bud formation by miRNA‐mediated regulation in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.)  ap. 749-770.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFlower induction in apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) trees plays an important life cycle role, but young trees produce fewer and inferior quality flower buds. Therefore, shoot bending has become an important cultural practice, significantly promoting the capacity to develop more flower buds during the growing seasons. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in plant growth, flower induction and stress responses. In this study, we identified miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of bud growth, and flower induction and development, as well as in the response to shoot bending. Of the 195 miRNAs identified, 137 were novel miRNAs. The miRNA expression profiles revealed that the expression levels of 68 and 27 known miRNAs were down‐regulated and up‐regulated, respectively, in response to shoot bending, and that the 31 differentially expressed novel miRNAs between them formed five major clusters. Additionally, a complex regulatory network associated with auxin, cytokinin, abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) plays important roles in cell division, bud growth and flower induction, in which related miRNAs and targets mediated regulation. Among them, miR396, 160, 393, and their targets associated with AUX, miR159, 319, 164, and their targets associated with ABA and GA, and flowering‐related miRNAs and genes, regulate bud growth and flower bud formation in response to shoot bending. Meanwhile, the flowering genes had significantly higher expression levels during shoot bending, suggesting that they are involved in this regulatory process. This study provides a framework for the future analysis of miRNAs associated with multiple hormones and their roles in the regulation of bud growth, and flower induction and formation in response to shoot bending in apple trees.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMalus domestica 3aabscisic acid 3aapples 3aauxins 3abuds 3acell division 3acytokinins 3aflowering 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agibberellic acid 3agrowing season 3ahormones 3amicroRNA 3aplant growth 3astress response 3atrees1 aZhang, Dong1 aZhao, Caiping1 aLi, Youmei,d1956-1 aMa, Juanjuan1 aAn, Na1 aHan, Mingyu0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2016 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.749-770dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.124253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006300138245011900201500002000320520174800340592002802088596005402116596002802170596005202198650001602250650002602266650001602292650001202308650000902320650001102329650001302340650001202353650001502365650002102380650002202401650002602423650001302449650002902462650002602491700006602517700005802583773010802641856007302749852000902822655001202831IND60790668820221119182359.0220826e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079066882DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.3332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVetrici, Mariana A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5528-890810aDouglas‐fir LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (PmLEC1) is an active transcription factor during zygotic and somatic embryogenesis  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDouglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is one of the world's premier lumber species and somatic embryogenesis (SE) is the most promising method for rapid propagation of superior tree genotypes. The development and optimization of SE protocols in conifers is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the molecular basis of embryogenesis and limited sequence data. In Arabidopsis, the LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (AtLEC1) gene is a master regulator of embryogenesis that induces SE when expressed ectopically. We isolated the LEC1 homologue from Douglas‐fir, designated as PmLEC1. PmLEC1 expression in somatic embryos and developing seeds demonstrated a unique, alternating pattern of expression with the highest levels during early stages of embryogenesis. PmLEC1 protein accumulation during seed development correlated with its transcriptional levels during early embryogenesis; however, substantial protein levels persisted until 2 weeks on germination medium. Treatment of mature, stratified seeds with 2,4‐epibrassinolide, sorbitol, mannitol, or NaCl upregulated PmLEC1 expression, which may provide strategies to induce SE from mature tissues. Sequence analysis of the PmLEC1 gene revealed a 5′ UTR intron containing binding sites for transcription factors (TFs), such as ABI3, LEC2, FUS3, and AGL15, which are critical regulators of embryogenesis in angiosperms. Regulatory elements for these and other seed‐specific TFs and biotic and abiotic signals were identified within the PmLEC1 locus. Most importantly, functional analysis of PmLEC1 showed that it rescued the Arabidopsis lec1‐1 null mutant and, in the T2 generation, led to the development of embryo‐like structures, indicating a key role of PmLEC1 in the regulation of embryogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Lethbridge Research Operating Funds  cNSERC‐IPS Scholarship  cUniversity of Victoria Research Operating Funds 3aArabidopsis 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3agermination 3aintrons 3aloci 3alumber 3amannitol 3amutants 3aplus trees 3aseed development 3asequence analysis 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asorbitol 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aYevtushenko, Dmytro P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8628-390X1 aMisra, Santosh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4729-77210 tPlant direct.g2021 July, v. 5, no. 7 p.e00333-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.3333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002300157245014700180300001400327520123300341592002801574650001601602650001501618650002701633650002601660650001201686650002301698650002601721650001701747650001101764650001601775651001101791653003401802653002401836653003001860653002801890700002401918700002301942700001901965700001601984700002402000773011102024856009202135852000902227655001202236IND60536696620221119143604.0190412e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGumiere, Silvio J.10aMapping soil hydraulic conductivity and matric potential for water management of cranberry: Characterisation and spatial interpolation methods  ap. 29-40.  aSpatial interpolation methods are required for analysing the effects of soil hydraulic properties on irrigation management. This study was conducted to determine which interpolation methods are best suited to map these properties. During the summer of 2012 we mapped the spatial variability of soil physical properties, soil matric potential, water table depth and yield of two cranberry fields located near Quebec City, Canada. Three spatial interpolation methods, inverse distance weighting (IDW), thin plate splines (TPS) and kriging with external drift (KED), were compared by means of cross-validation. The best interpolation method for a given property was used to produce maps and perform HYDRUS 1D simulations for the purpose of irrigation management. Results show that even in highly constructed fields, such as for cranberries, spatial patterns of soil hydraulic properties exist. The TPS method was the best interpolation method based on the cross-validation analyses and generated maps. Spatial variability of crop yield showed a strong relationship with soil hydraulic properties and simulations suggest that irrigation can be reduced by 75% when accounting for the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acranberries 3acrop yield 3ahydraulic conductivity 3airrigation management 3akriging 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil matric potential 3asoil surveys 3asummer 3awater table 3aQuebec 0aSpatial interpolation methods 0aSpatial variability 0aSoil hydraulic properties 0aIrrigation and drainage1 aLafond, Jonathan A.1 aHallema, Dennis W.1 aPériard, Yann1 aCaron, Jean1 aGallichand, Jacques0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Dec., v. 128 p.29-40dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001600151245011400167300001800281520147200299592002801771650001001799650002101809650001301830650001101843650002201854650001701876650001201893650001001905650001001915650001101925650002101936650000701957650001601964650000901980651001201989700001702001700001302018700001702031773010002048856008702148852000902235655001202244IND4475765920221120204923.0150808e20110624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447576592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeckmyn, G.10aSimulating C cycles in forest soils: Including the active role of micro-organisms in the ANAFORE forest model  ap. 1972-1985.  aA soil module was developed to improve on the ecosystem-scale simulations of forest models. The module includes simulations of bacteria, mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi. The inclusion of these soil organisms allows for the simulation of several soil biological processes in a more mechanistic way. In this paper the soil module is used in combination with the forest model ANAFORE (ANAlysing Forest Ecosystems) a stand-scale forest model that simulates wood tissue development, carbon (C) and water (HâO) fluxes dynamically from physiological principles. Although the main purpose of this paper is the model description, a showcase run of the new soil model was performed using a Bayesian parameterization procedure for 16 forest sites (pedunculate oak, beech, Scots pine and poplar) on different soils in Belgium. Emphasis was on the soil organic horizons formation. The results show that one single parameter set could be used for the different forests in the study, and yielded reasonably close fits for most sites concerning pH and formation of the humus layer. Although running the Bayesian procedure to obtain good input parameter distributions was time-consuming (several months), runs using the developed parameter set are reasonably fast (days). These results are promising. However, the high uncertainty of both the input and the output of the model indicates that it is mainly useful as an experimental tool, rather than a predictive instrument.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPinus sylvestris 3abacteria 3acarbon 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest soils 3aforests 3afungi 3ahumus 3amodels 3aorganic horizons 3apH 3auncertainty 3awood 3aBelgium1 aCampioli, M.1 aMuys, B.1 aKraigher, H.0 tEcological modelling.g2011 June 24, v. 222, no. 12 p.1972-1985dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001900159245005900178300001600237500000900253500001500262520084900277592002801126650001301154650002201167650002201189650002901211650001501240650001701255650002501272650001501297651002901312653002001341700002201361700001501383773014701398852000901545856009601554655001201650IND2046650120221119094353.0191125e199505  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204665012DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900030006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaffer, M.

Simulation of these effects would help identify important information gaps for the region and elsewhere and help in the understanding of basic soil-plant processes and interactions that occur. The N Tillage Residue Management model was tested on nine field sites across the north-central USA. The 119 site-years of data simulated 78% (R² of 0.78) of observed corn yield variability for a wide range of eroded soils. Slightly better predictions were made (R² values of 0.82 and 0.80) for loess-derived soils and soils in the eastern (wetter) study areas, respectively. Till-derived soils and soils in the western (drier) areas had R² values of 0.75 and 0.77, respectively. Crop yield predictions were most responsive to soil physical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3asimulation models 3aland productivity 3asoil physical properties 3acrop yield 3asoil erosion 3aenvironmental impact 3aprediction 3aMidwestern United States 0acrop production1 aSchumacher, T.

Quantitation was based on multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) using the precursorâproduction combination for the determination of 11 analytes. The analysis was performed on an Eclipse Plus Cââ column (I.D. 4.6mmÃ100mm, 3.5Î¼m particle size). An electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem interface in the negative mode was employed prior to mass spectrometric detection. With the optimized conditions, the 11 biomarkers were detected properly within 3min. Limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.6 to 2.6ng/ml. The average recoveries ranged from 95.42 to 101.11% with RSDsâ¤2.23%. The applicability of this analytical approach was confirmed by the successful analysis of 3 samples.

Due to their amorphous structure, hierarchical architecture and interconnected porosity, as well as the synergistic effect between their compositions, the as-prepared CQU-Chen-Co-Gly-3-1 thin sheets exhibit excellent pseudocapacitive performance and remarkable cycling stability in an alkaline medium, holding great promise in supercapacitors (SCs). The electrochemical properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6.0M KOH solution. The CQU-Chen-Gly-Co-3-1-based electrode exhibited a specific discharge capacity as high as 879.1Cg⁻¹ at 1Ag⁻¹ and even 547.7Cg⁻¹ at a high rate of 20Ag⁻¹ through a voltage range of 0.35V, and average discharge capacitance of 2511.6 and 1564.8Fg⁻¹ at 1 and 20Ag⁻¹, respectively. The materials also exhibited superior charge–discharge stability and maintained 99.5% of its initial capacitance after 2000 continuous charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 10Ag⁻¹. This simple design and facile synthesis provides an effective strategy to construct SCs electrode materials with enhanced battery-type of capacitive performance and shows promising potential for a wide range of applications in energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCobalt-glycine complex 0aThin sheets 0aAmorphous structure 0aHydrothermal synthesis 0aSupercapacitor 0aElectrochemical energy storage1 aChen, Lingyun1 aXu, Han1 aZhang, Qing1 aZhao, Chenglan1 aXuan, Liying1 aJiang, Yuqian1 aYuanyuan,0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.462-473dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245009200171300001400263500001400277520062600291592002800917650002500945650002500970650001300995650001301008651001901021700002401040700002201064700003101086773013901117856007901256852000901335655001201344IND60722645420221121064128.0210107s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264542DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2020-02372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatterson, William F.10aEye lens Δ¹⁴C validates otolith-derived age estimates of Gulf of Mexico reef fishes  ap. 13-17.  aNAL-light  aWe tested whether Δ¹⁴C values of eye lens protein (crystallin) formed in early life could be utilized to validate marine bony fish age estimates via the bomb radiocarbon chronometer.

Energy conversion in the EMG from wind to electrical energy is implemented via the cyclic fixed-axis rotation, whereas that in the TENG is controlled by reciprocating translation driven by the coaxial rotation of the contact-separation structure. However, it is essential, albeit difficult, for TENG to generate a major portion of the wind energy-based electricity by improving the secondary transformation efficiency and reducing wear abrasion. Here, an arrayed contact-separation structure is fabricated with doped and surface-modified friction silicone rubber, large-area arc-shaped substrates, and a Reuleaux triangle plate-cam with local freedom. When the WEH works in one cycle, the TENG runs 12 times. Compared with the single contact-separation structure, the modified friction material significantly increases the output performance of the hybrid enhanced TENG by 104 % and the arrayed cam structure triples the output energy of TENG in a cycle. The maximum output power of the WEH is 54.78 mW at 90 rpm, to which the EMG and TENG contribute approximately 51.57 mW and 3.21 mW, respectively. The share of TENG output energy rivals the results induced by sliding mode TENG in those hybrid energy harvesters of current research. Furthermore, a WEH with an enhanced TENG is experimentally demonstrated by simulating earthquake, fire, and wind speed monitoring. The results indicate the immense potential of the proposed WEH in terms of power supply capability and long-term operation reliability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aearthquakes 3aelectric generators 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aenergy conversion 3afriction 3arubber 3asilicone 3awind power 3awind speed 0aUbiquitous ambient energy 0aWind energy harvester 0aHybrid enhancement 0aElectrical property 0aUnattended monitoring1 aZou, Jie1 aSong, Jinsha1 aHe, Jian1 aHou, Xiaojuan1 aYu, Junbin1 aHan, Xiaotao1 aFeng, Chengpeng1 aHe, Huicheng1 aChou, Xiujian0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 254 p.115151-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1151513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006800153245014700221300001600368520117900384592002801563653003201591653003201623653003601655653002701691653002301718700001701741700001701758700001901775773010301794856008701897852000901984655001201993IND60594057620221118114314.0180510e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059405762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarmisollé, Waldemar A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0031-537110aAmine-appended polyaniline as a water dispersible electroactive polyelectrolyte and its integration into functional self-assembled multilayers  ap. 435-444.  aWe present an effective and simple method for the synthesis of poly(3-aminobenzylamine) (PABA) using a chemical oxidation strategy in aqueous solution. The polymer was characterized by NMR, LDI-TOF mass spectrometry, UV-visible, XPS and ATR-FTIR spectroscopies. Stable acidic dispersions were employed for the construction of layer-by-layer assembled films with polyanions, which effectively act as dopants of the electroactive component as revealed by spectroscopic analysis. The assembled films were electroactive in neutral solutions, probably owing to the combination of the doping effect by the polyanions and the self-doping effect of the protonated amino groups of the PABA backbone. These layers showed an electrocatalytic effect on the ascorbic acid oxidation. The advantages of employing PABA instead of polyaniline include improved electroactivity in neutral solution, good processability owing to its higher solubility in acidic solutions and increased interaction with anionic counterparts, which may propel its integration with electroactive biomolecules or conducting nanomaterials for the design of bioelectrochemical devices and energy storage applications.  aPublisher supplied data 0apolyaminobenzylamine (PABA) 0apolyelectrolyte multilayers 0alayer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies 0aelectroactive polymers 0apolyaniline (Pani)1 aMaza, Eliana1 aMoya, Sergio1 aAzzaroni, Omar0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.435-444dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01981naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008600171300001600257520096200273592002801235650001201263650001101275650001501286650003201301651001301333653001601346653001501362653003201377653002201409653002001431773009801451856008501549852000901634655001201643IND60573721120221118103124.0170724e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057372112DNAL7 a10.1080/08941920.2016.12734192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamm, Joseph A.10aTrust, Trustworthiness, and Motivation in the Natural Resource Management Context  ap. 919-933.  aTrust is critical for natural resource management (NRM). In recognition of this, a noteworthy body of literature has investigated the construct but is, as yet, still developing. The current research proposes and tests an increasingly complete model that integrates the major advances in not only the NRM literature but in the social psychological literature addressing trust more generally as well. To that end, the current analyses were conducted with a large sample of Michigan hunters (n = 23,954). The results suggest that, as hypothesized, the theoretical model is a statistically defensible account of trust in this context and suggest that both trustworthiness and motivation have important roles to play in driving cooperation intention and behavior. Thus, the current work suggests that although it is important for NRM institutions to attend to their trustworthiness, they should not ignore the motivation that arises from benefits they provide.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahunters 3amodels 3amotivation 3anatural resource management 3aMichigan 0aCooperation 0amotivation 0anatural resource management 0atrust-as-attitude 0atrust-as-choice0 tSociety & natural resources.g2017 Aug. 3, v. 30, no. 8 p.919-933dRoutledgex1521-07237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2016.12734193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245013700175520153100312592002801843650001901871650001601890650001401906650001701920650001701937650001801954650000701972650001301979650000901992650002502001653003502026653002502061653002702086653002202113653002502135700001602160700001802176700001902194700001702213700001802230773009102248856005602339852000902395655001202404IND60793849920221123022855.0220921e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079384992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1364412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lingling,14aThe role of structural evolution in the complexation and flocculation of heavy metals by the microbial product poly-γ-glutamic acid  aThe process and mechanism of heavy metal flocculation with extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secreted by microorganisms, are crucial to their fate in natural environment, wastewater treatment and soil bioremediation applications. However, the structural features of EPS and the relationship between these features and the flocculation process and mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, structural features of the microbial product poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) complexed with the heavy metal ions Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺ were characterized and the evolution of these features was identified as having a key role in the flocculation process and mechanism. The secondary structure of the γ-PGA-Pb complex changed significantly, while that of the γ-PGA-Cu complex was only slightly altered. The significant structural change in γ-PGA-Pb was found to be responsible for the combination of residual COOH and Pb²⁺, promoting the bridging of inter-colloids and faster growth of hydrodynamic diameter. If the conformation changed sufficiently, such as with the γ-PGA-Pb complex in the pH range 4.6–6.2, pH had no impact on the conversion ratio. The unchanged structure of γ-PGA-Cu prevented the flocculation process, although the coordination mode of γ-PGA-Cu resulted in a higher biosorption capacity. This in-depth molecular-level study provides insight into the γ-PGA flocculation mechanism, promoting the use of γ-PGA and γ-PGA producing microorganisms for application in various remediation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3aevolution 3aflocculation 3aheavy metals 3ahydrodynamics 3apH 3apolymers 3asoil 3awastewater treatment 0aPoly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) 0aFlocculation process 0aFlocculation mechanism 0aCoordination mode 0aStructural evolution1 aLiu, Yamin,1 aLiu, Huiming,1 aShi, Qing-Shan1 aPeng, Ru-Qun1 aXie, Xiao-Bao0 tChemosphere.g2022 Dec., v. 308 p.136441-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136441  aDNAL 7aarticle03906naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015200176300001800328520124800346536044701594592002802041596013202069596021002201650000902411650001702420650001202437650001602449650001102465650001502476650000702491650002602498650001202524650001302536650000902549650001902558650001902577650001802596650002402614650001802638650001802656650001802674650002702692651001402719653001202733653001302745653001202758653001702770653000802787653001702795653002302812700002702835700002002862700002202882700002302904700002502927700002102952700002902973773014803002856008503150852000903235655001203244IND60614827120190311000000.0181002e20181110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061482712DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2018.14670062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolungevicius, Jonas14aThe effects of agrogenic transformation on soil profile morphology, organic carbon and physico-chemical properties in Retisols of Western Lithuania  ap. 1910-1923.  aThe aim of this study was to determine changes in the morphological, physical and chemical properties of Retisols caused by their agrogenic transformation. The study carried out on Retisols on relatively natural and agrogenically affected land in 2016. Soil samples taken from the genetic horizons of all profiles to measure soil organic carbon, pH, hydromorphic and physical properties. Due to long-term, deep ploughing, the sequence of soil horizons in the Retisol profile had changed from O–Ah–El–ElBt to Ahp–ElBt. Intensive soil liming changed chemical properties and morphological features of Retisol. The clay and silt particles leached out of from the Ah and El horizons to the deeper layers due to illuviation and podsolization. The content of SOC in the 0–30 cm layer of the Ah horizon of agrogenically affected Retisol was 1.0%, and in the forest Retisol – 1.7%; however, forest Retisol was more acidic. Ploughing and no tillage management caused a reduction in total porosity, water holding capacity and plant available water content compared with the other land-uses. We conclude that the use of ploughless tillage on Retisol is not identical to the conditions of natural soil formation and soil fertility maintenance.  aThis work was supported by the “The influence of long-term contrasting intensity resources management on genesis of different soils and on other agro-ecosystems components”,, funded by the Research Council of Lithuania.

Brown rice was rich in dietary fibers, mainly insoluble dietary fiber (IDF). After the ult-enzymatic treatment, the IDF content and particle size of brown rice flour decreased, and the soluble dietary fiber (SDF) content increased. The ult-enzymatic treatment significantly influenced the pasting, thermal and rheological properties of rice flour, probably due to the changes of proximate composition and particle size distribution. Accordingly, the ult-enzymatic rice noodles with smooth surface and small air cell microstructure had better texture and cooking qualities, and slightly higher starch digestibility when compared to the untreated rice noodles. The glycemic index (GI) of the ult-enzymatic rice noodles with higher starch relative crystallinity was significantly lower than that of the polished ones. The correlation analyses exhibited that the SDF was beneficial to the reduction of starch digestibility, while had less damage to the texture of rice noodles. These results indicated that the ult-enzymatic treatment was a promising way to improve the textural properties of brown rice noodles and maintain a lower starch digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abrown rice 3acrystal structure 3adietary fiber 3adigestible carbohydrates 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic treatment 3aglycemic index 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aproximate composition 3arice flour 3astarch 3atexture 3aultrasonic treatment 0aBrown rice noodles 0aUltrasound 0aEnzymatic 0aTexture 0aStarch digestibility1 aLin, Zexue1 aLiu, Lu1 aQin, Wanyu1 aWang, Aixia1 aWang, Fengzhong1 aTong, Li-Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9935-02750 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 July, v. 146 p.111543-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1115433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245012000163300001600283520171300299592002802012650003502040650002102075650001202096650002302108650001302131650001402144650001602158650002602174650001502200650001602215650001502231650001202246650001702258650000902275650001202284650001602296650002802312650003502340650001802375700002202393700002202415700002102437700001802458700002702476700002902503700001802532773010102550856007302651852000902724655001202733IND60480602820221121224906.0160128e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048060282DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.124242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilner, Sara Giulia12aA multiparental cross population for mapping QTL for agronomic traits in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum)  ap. 735-748.  aMultiparental cross designs for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) provide an efficient alternative to biparental populations because of their broader genetic basis and potentially higher mapping resolution. We describe the development and deployment of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) obtained by crossing four elite cultivars. A linkage map spanning 2664 cM and including 7594 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was produced by genotyping 338 RILs. QTL analysis was carried out by both interval mapping on founder haplotype probabilities and SNP bi‐allelic tests for heading date and maturity date, plant height and grain yield from four field experiments. Sixteen QTL were identified across environments and detection methods, including two yield QTL on chromosomes 2BL and 7AS, with the former mapped independently from the photoperiod response gene Ppd‐B1, while the latter overlapped with the vernalization locus VRN‐A3. Additionally, 21 QTL with environment‐specific effects were found. Our results indicated a prevalence of environment‐specific QTL with relatively small effect on the control of grain yield. For all traits, functionally different QTL alleles in terms of direction and size of genetic effect were distributed among parents. We showed that QTL results based on founder haplotypes closely matched functional alleles at known heading date loci. Despite the four founders, only 2.1 different functional haplotypes were estimated per QTL, on average. This durum wheat population provides a mapping resource for detailed genetic dissection of agronomic traits in an elite background typical of breeding programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aagronomic traits 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adurum wheat 3afield experimentation 3agenotyping 3agrain yield 3ahaplotypes 3aheading 3ainbred lines 3aloci 3aparents 3aphotoperiod 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avernalization1 aMaccaferri, Marco1 aHuang, Bevan Emma1 aMantovani, Paola1 aMassi, Andrea1 aFrascaroli, Elisabetta1 aTuberosa, R.q(Roberto),1 aSalvi, Silvio0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2016 Feb., v. 14, no. 2 p.735-748dBlackwell Pub.x1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.124243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01393naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245019600164300001200360520046600372592002800838650001400866650002800880650002400908773011700932856008101049852000901130655001201139IND60573991220221121234812.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057399122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-016-0776-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOren, Aharon10aReclassification of Halomonas caseinilytica Wu et al. 2008 as a later synonym of Halomonas sinaiensis—Comments on the proposal by Hwang et al., Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 109:1345–1352, 2016  ap. 171.  aHwang et al.

These barrages have variable features such as pigmented pseudosclerotia structures, a clear zone, fuzzy hair-like mycelia, or tuft-like mycelia, suggesting that mycelial incompatibility triggers a number of cellular reactions. In this study, to evaluate cellular reactions we performed genetic analysis of mycelial incompatibility of R. nectarix, using 20 single ascospore isolates from single perithecia. Mycelial interaction zones were removed by spatula and cellular reactions studied on oatmeal agar media. The interaction zones were categorized into types such as sharp or wide lines, with or without melanin, and combinations of these. Although various reaction types were observed, we were able to identify a single genetic factor that appears to be responsible for the barrage line formation within oatmeal agar medium. DNA polymorphism analysis identified parental isolates and revealed that R. necatrix has a heterothallic life cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRosellinia necatrix 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3amelanin 3amycelium 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMyceliumxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPyrusxmicrobiology 2aSpores, Fungalxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aXylarialesxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification.1 aInoue, Kanako1 aNakamura, Hitoshi1 aHamanaka, Taiki1 aOhta, Tatsuro1 aKitazawa, Hirotomo1 aKida, Chiaki1 aKanematsu, Satoko1 aPark, Pyoyun0 tFungal biology.g2011 Jan., v. 115, no. 1 p.80-86dElsevier Ltdx1878-61467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011000167300001400277520178200291592002802073650002702101650002502128650001202153650001302165650002402178650001502202650002502217650001202242650002102254650001202275650001502287650001602302650001302318650001602331773011102347856008102458852000902539655001202548IND60573991420221121234854.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057399142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-016-1262-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLord, Joshua P.10aTemperature, space availability, and species assemblages impact competition in global fouling communities  ap. 43-55.  aCompetition drives community composition in many ecosystems and can influence the spread of invasive species. Marine fouling communities are excellent study systems for competition because of space limitation and the abundance of invasive species. While many studies have examined individual or site-specific responses to changes in temperature or presence of invasive species, it is difficult to predict ecological impacts without assessing interspecific interactions over a wide geographic range. This study compared interactions between several globally distributed invasive fouling species over a broad geographic range. Weekly examination of photographs of settlement panels in marinas at 18 sites around the world allowed for the quantification of competitive outcomes. In the north Atlantic, experimental panels became covered with fouling organisms exponentially faster at warmer temperatures, while northeast and south Pacific sites did not. An invasive ascidian (Diplosoma listerianum) and bryozoan (Bugula neritina) were strong competitors, but most species displayed a negative response in high competition settings where there was little available space. Two species (Botryllus schlosseri and Botrylloides violaceus) had better competitive outcomes at cooler temperatures, possibly due to fewer strong competitors at these sites. Thus, warmer sites with little open space and multiple strong competitors are likely most resistant to future invasions, while colder sites with more open space and weaker competitors would be more susceptible to invasive species. These results suggest that the establishment and spread of invasive fouling species is likely to be influence by seawater temperature, available space, and the competitive abilities of community members.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrylloides violaceus 3aBotryllus schlosseri 3aBryozoa 3aNeritina 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3afouling 3ainvasive species 3amarinas 3aopen space 3aphotographs 3aseawater 3atemperature0 tBiological invasions.g2017 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.43-55dSpringer International Publishingx1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1262-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001900159245011300178300001600291500000900307520184100316592002802157650001102185650002102196650002202217650002202239650001502261650001202276650001502288650002302303650001502326650001402341700002702355700002002382700001502402773014702417852000902564856009602573655001202669IND2046654420221119094417.0191125e199505  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204665442DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900030017x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohanty, B. P.10aSpatio-Temporal Variability of Soil Temperature within Three Land Areas Exposed to Different Tillage Systems  ap. 752-759.  aepub  aThe rational (lateral) spacing between soil temperature sensors to obtain spatial independence of measurements in the field under various tillage systems is not well studied. In particular, properly positioning sensors in a tillage plot requires knowledge of the spatial dependence of the measurements. This study was conducted to measure the horizontal spatial variability of soil temperature and its diurnal fluctuation in three different tillage systems. Soil temperature was measured with copper-constantan thermocouples at 49 positions in each system at the 1- and 10-cm depths. The thermocouples formed a 7 by 7 grid with a spacing of 3.0 (east-west) by 1.5 m (north-south). The three management systems were fall moldboard plowing followed by spring disking and planter operation (MP), fall chisel plowing followed by spring disking and planter operation (CP), and ridge tillage slot planting (RN). Each management system had been under continuous field corn (Zea mays L.) for 8 yr. A novel finding of the study is that a hysteresis within the diurnal cycle existed between the mean and the sample variance. This hysteresis was presumably due to differences in soil surface heating and cooling rates during the diurnal cycle. Although no definitive relationships could be determined, semivariograms appeared to show a time dependence and anisotropy during the 24-h observation period. Correlation distances were ≈9 m in the E-W direction along crop rows and tillage operations but <1.5 m in the N-S direction across crop rows and tillage operations. These spatial correlation distances will be useful in deciding the minimum (lateral) spacing between adjacent soil temperature sensors in the field. Contribution as journal paper no.

The experiment was conducted using three different water flow rates, i.e. 4.76, 5.65, and 6.35 L min–¹.m–², to assess the effect of different water flow rates on evaporative pad cooling system performance and determine the most suitable water flow rate for maintaining the thermal comfort zone of laying hens. The evaporative pad cooling system maintained the mean indoor air temperature below 28°C. The mean indoor air relative humidity during the experimental period ranged from 72.6 to 73.8%. The 4.76 L min–¹.m–² water flow rate resulted in the highest saturation efficiency (ca. 73.75%). In contrast, the 6.35 L min–¹ m–² water flow rate resulted in the lowest saturation efficiency (70.63%). The mean cooling energy values were 69.11, 66.0, and 66.65 kwh for water flow rates of 4.76, 5.56, and 6.35 Lmin–¹m–², respectively. The highest temperature-humidity index was 27.78°C, which indicated that birds were not stressed in all treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural engineering 3aair temperature 3acommercial farms 3acooling systems 3aenergy 3alaying hens 3asummer 3awater flow 3aEgypt 0aEvaporative cooling 0aflow rate 0apad 0awater0 tJournal of agricultural engineering.g2020 Dec. 23, v. 51, no. 4 p.1051-dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:21681x1974-70717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jae.2020.10513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015500166520155500321592002801876650002201904650002501926650002901951650001401980650001101994650001902005650001902024650001202043650001402055650001802069650003902087653001402126653003602140653002502176653002102201653001902222700006402241700002302305700001602328700001702344773012202361856008102483852000902564655001202573IND60734790420221120101332.0211030e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073479042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1115502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Zongshuai10aInhibitory mechanism of catechins against advanced glycation end products of glycated myofibrillar protein through anti-aggregation and anti-oxidation  aProtein aggregation and oxidation could induce the generation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Nϵ-carboxymethyl lysine (CML), Nϵ-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) are two typical AGEs markers in muscle foods. Catechins are considered to be excellent natural antioxidants for scavenging AGEs in muscle protein. We compared, for the first time, the inhibitory effects and explored mechanisms of (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (−)-epicatechin (EC), and (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), in glycated myofibrillar protein (MPG) by measuring AGEs level, Maillard reaction degree, particle size and anti-oxidation ability using microstructure, multispectral and molecular docking techniques. The results showed that catechins dose-dependently inhibited AGEs in MPG through influencing lysine and free amino group, alleviating the Maillard reaction, detaching the particle size, affecting the protein-catechins interaction, relieving aggregates, and scavenging free radicals. The underlying mechanism behind the result indicated that catechins altered the structure information, SDS-PAGE bands, and the interaction sites of MPG via anti-aggregation and anti-oxidation. Particularly, EC and ECG showed weaker antioxidant ability than EGC and EGCG, EGCG exhibited a significant Pearson's correlation with the anti-oxidation and anti-aggregation of CML but no significant association with CEL. Overall, this study provides a theoretical insight into the applications of catechins to muscle foods as AGEs inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aantioxidant activity 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3aflavanols 3alysine 3amicrostructure 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3aparticle size 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 0aCatechins 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aMyofibrillar protein 0aAnti-aggregation 0aAnti-oxidation1 aBassey, Anthony Pius1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9322-72281 aKhan, Iftikhar Ali1 aHuang, Ming1 aZhang, Xibin0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 July, v. 147 p.111550-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1115503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012600167300001400293520103600307592002801343596006301371650002501434650001701459650002101476650002301497650002501520650001501545700002601560700002001586700002501606773014301631856008301774852000901857655001201866IND60723080820221120185203.0211118e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072308082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-03015-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, David10aChallenges and future directions in LC-MS-based multiclass method development for the quantification of food contaminants  ap. 25-34.  aMonitoring of food contaminants and residues has undergone a significant improvement in recent years and is now performed in an intensive manner. Achievements in the area of chromatography-mass spectrometry coupling techniques enabled the development of quantitative multi-target approaches covering several hundred analytes. Although the majority of methods are focusing on the analysis of one specific group of substances, such as pesticides, mycotoxins, or veterinary drugs, current trends are going towards the simultaneous determination of multiclass compounds from several families of contaminants and residues. This work provides an overview of relevant multiclass concepts based on LC-MS/MS and LC-HRMS instruments. Merits and shortcomings will be critically discussed based on current performance characteristics of the EU legislation system. In addition, the discussion of a recently developed multiclass approach covering >1000 substances is presented as a case study to illustrate the current developments in this area.  aPublisher supplied data  a854182cÖsterreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft 3aanalytical chemistry 3acase studies 3achemical species 3afood contamination 3alaws and regulations 3amycotoxins1 aMalachová, Alexandra1 aSulyok, Michael1 aKrska, R.q(Rudolf),0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 413, no. 1 p.25-34dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-03015-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02715naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002700157245013100184300001400315520151500329592002801844650001301872650002601885650002401911650001301935650001501948653002001963653002701983653001702010653002102027653001502048653001402063700002502077700002702102773011102129856009202240852000902332655001202341IND60536697720221119143647.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.09.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiannoulis, Anastasios10aDesign and analysis of the response of elastically supported wind-break panels of two different permeabilities under wind load  ap. 57-69.  aThe design and response of elastically supported short-length windbreak panels of different permeabilities under wind load is presented. The response of the panels was investigated through full-scale experiments and numerical simulation analysis. Two cladding materials were used: an impermeable film and a permeable net (62% porosity ratio). For the field experiments the elastic support of the panel was achieved by using extension springs which allowed it to pivot in response to wind loading through a hinge support at its base. The wind pressures developed on the panel for various equilibrium positions reached under different wind velocities were measured. The elastic support response resulted in a significant reduction of the wind pressures and the stress resultants on the windbreak for both cladding materials. A combined model coupling two-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulation and non-linear structural analysis was used to analyse the behaviour of the elastically supported panel when interacting with the wind. The numerical results for the elastic support response under wind load, and the developed wind pressures, were found to agree with the full-scale experiments for both cladding cases. For the permeable cladding case, the wake flow of the elastically supported panel was shown to be free of large scale turbulent eddies when analysed by numerical simulations. The wake airflow for the impermeable panel case was found to be complex and extensive investigation is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3afield experimentation 3amathematical models 3aporosity 3awind speed 0aElastic support 0aShort-length windbreak 0aPorous panel 0aAgricultural net 0aWind loads 0aWake flow1 aMistriotis, Antonios1 aBriassoulis, Demetrios0 tBiosystems engineering.g2015 Jan., v. 129 p.57-69dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245009400175300001600269520155900285592002801844653002601872653002501898653002101923653002601944653002401970700001801994700002202012700002202034700001802056700002902074700001802103700002202121700001902143773010302162856008702265852000902352655001202361IND60594058120221118114308.0180510e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059405812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Kyle Kai-Hung10aMicro-pattern Corrosion Screening on Bimetallic Corrosion for Microelectronic Application  ap. 512-519.  aThe continued miniaturization of the integrated circuit, leading to minute dimensions (<10nm) in microelectronic architecture, can greatly accelerate the on chip corrosion into a severe reliability threat. Particularly, various interfaces between multilayered film stacks create dissimilar contacts with significant galvanic potential difference. This can promote on-chip corrosion under semiconductor processing conditions. In this paper, an efficient micro-pattern corrosion screening metrology combined with electrochemical and x-ray photoelectron scattering techniques, is utilized to study bimetallic corrosion and its inhibition in wafer cleaning solutions. Cu/Ru bimetallic contact was found to exhibit a higher corrosion rate than the Cu/Ta contact. In alkaline ammonium citrate solution, higher dissolved oxygen content significantly accelerated Cu corrosion. The increased alkalinity (pH>12) at Cu/Ru interface, caused by enhanced oxygen reduction reaction on Ru, is proposed to generate more NH3 for sustaining fast Cu corrosion. Effects of different plasma chemistries like CF4, CF4+O2, CH2F2, C4F8 and SF6 on the Cu corrosion in tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) were also investigated. Plasma treatments using higher fluorine content gases showed higher Cu corrosion rate in TMAH. Benzotriazole showed limited corrosion inhibition to plasma treated Cu/Ru micro-patterns in pH 14 TMAH solution. Contrastingly, pyrazole demonstrated as an effective corrosion inhibitor suppressing Cu corrosion rate down to the desirable < 1 A°/min level.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMicroscopic corrosion 0aBimetallic corrosion 0aAmmonium citrate 0aFluorocarbon residues 0aCorrosion inhibitor1 aRimal, Sirish1 aAsokan, Muthappan1 aNalla, Praveen R.1 aKoskey, Simon1 aPillai, Karthikeyan S.M.1 aChyan, Oliver1 aSingh, Kanwal Jit1 aSuri, Satyarth0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.512-519dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245011800198500002000316520154100336592002801877596008401905596009001989596002002079596003802099650001602137650001502153650001702168650001402185650001202199650002002211650003502231650001202266650002202278650002202300700005802322700006102380700005902441773010602500856007302606852000902679655001202688IND60790670020221119091416.0220826e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079067002DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.3802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chun‐Yen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3941-456110aArabidopsis CIA2 and CIL have distinct and overlapping functions in regulating chloroplast and flower development  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArabidopsis CHLOROPLAST IMPORT APPARATUS 2 (CIA2) and its paralogous protein CIA2‐LIKE (CIL) are nuclear transcription factors containing a C‐terminal CCT motif. CIA2 promotes the expression of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast‐localized translocons and ribosomal proteins, thereby increasing the efficiency of protein import and synthesis in chloroplasts. We have previously reported that CIA2 and CIL form a homodimer or heterodimer through their C‐terminal sequences and interact with other nuclear proteins, such as CONSTANS (CO), via their N‐terminal sequences, but the function of CIL had remained unclear. In this study, we verified through transgenic cia2 mutant plants expressing the CIL coding sequence that CIL is partially functionally redundant to CIA2 during vegetative growth. We also compared phenotypes and gene expression profiles of wildtype Col‐0, cia2, cil, and cia2/cil mutants. Our results indicate that CIA2 and CIL coordinate chloroplast biogenesis and function mainly by upregulating the expression of the nuclear factor GOLDEN2‐LIKE 1 (GLK1) and chloroplast transcription‐, translation‐, protein import‐, and photosynthesis‐related genes, with CIA2 playing a more crucial role. Furthermore, we compared flowering phenotypes in single, double, and triple mutant plants of co, cia2, and cil. We found that CIA2 and CIL participate in modulating long‐day floral development. Notably, CIA2 increases flower number and height of the inflorescence main axis, whereas CIL promotes flowering.  aPublisher supplied data  a102‐2311‐B‐003‐001cMinistry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST)  a104‐2311‐B‐003‐002‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST)  cAcademia Sinica  cNational Taiwan Normal University 3aArabidopsis 3abiogenesis 3achloroplasts 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3amutants 3aprotein transport 3avegetative growth1 aYan, Wen‐You1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0875-95271 aChang, Hsin‐Yen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3496-76851 aSun, Chih‐Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5872-78170 tPlant direct.g2022 Jan., v. 6, no. 1 p.e380-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.3803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006700165300001400232500001100246520143100257592002801688596007501716650002301791650000801814650005201822650001801874650002501892650002001917650002601937650001901963650001301982650001801995650001202013700002002025700002102045700002102066700002302087700002202110773014302132856008302275852000902358655001202367IND60723080920221122040824.0211118e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072308092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-02889-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiri, Basant10aReview of analytical performance of COVID-19 detection methods  ap. 35-48.  aReview  aIn the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, public health experts have emphasized testing, tracking infected people, and tracing their contacts as an effective strategy to reduce the spread of the virus. Several diagnostic methods are reported for detecting the coronavirus in clinical, research, and public health laboratories. Some tests detect the infection directly by detecting the viral RNA and other tests detect the infection indirectly by detecting the host antibodies. A diagnostic test during the pandemic should help make an appropriate clinical decision in a short period of time. Recently reported diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 have varying throughput, batching capacity, requirement of infrastructure setting, analytical performance, and turnaround times ranging from a few minutes to several hours. These factors should be considered while selecting a reliable and rapid diagnostic method to help make an appropriate decision and prompt public health interventions. This paper reviews recent SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic methods published in journals and reports released by regulatory agencies. We compared the analytical efficiency including limit of detection, sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. In addition, we also looked into ease of use, affordability, and availability of accessories. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the methods and provide our perspectives on priorities for future test development.  aPublisher supplied data  aAID-OAA-A-11-00012cUnited States Agency for International Development 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aaffordability 3aanalytical chemistry 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3ainfrastructure 3apandemic 3apublic health 3aviruses1 aPandey, Shishir1 aShrestha, Retina1 aPokharel, Krisha1 aLigler, Frances S.1 aNeupane, Bhanu B.0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 Jan., v. 413, no. 1 p.35-48dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02889-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01711naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002100128024001900149040001800168100002200186245006600208300001200274506007600286520054000362592002800902506003700930650002200967650001000989650001300999650002601012650001501038700002601053700002001079700002101099700002401120773010401144856008001248852000901328655001201337IND60119478920221207103348.0141214e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011947892DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-10-r702doi7 aPMC3284592pmcid7 a145192052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHosack, Douglas A10aIdentifying biological themes within lists of genes with EASE  ap. 579.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEASE is a customizable software application for rapid biological interpretation of gene lists that result from the analysis of microarray, proteomics, SAGE and other high-throughput genomic data.

Their actions are largely controlled by specific tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). The role and regulation of MMPs in the chicken ovary is largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of tamoxifen (TMX; estrogen receptor modulator) treatment on the expression of selected members of the MMP system in the laying hen ovary. The activity of MMP-2 and -9 was also examined. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses revealed changes in mRNA and/or protein expression of MMP-2, -9, -10, −13, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3 in the following ovarian follicles after TMX treatment: white (WF), yellowish (YF), small yellow (SYF), and the largest yellow preovulatory (F3–F1). The response to TMX depended on the stage of follicle development and the layer of follicular wall. Moreover, ovarian regression following TMX treatment was accompanied by both an increase in total activity of MMP-2 in the theca layer of F3–F2 and granulosa layer of F2, and a decrease in total activity of MMP-2 in the WF, YF, and SYF, and MMP-9 in theca of F3–F1. In conclusion, the TMX-induced changes in MMP-2, -9, -10, and -13, and TIMP-2 and -3 mRNA expression, as well as MMP-2 and -9 activity, were dependent on tissue and the stage of follicular maturation. Our findings strongly suggests a role for estrogen in regulating the transcription, translation, and/or posttranslational activity of members of the MMP system. Further, these components may be involved in the orchestration of ECM turnover and cellular functions during ovary regression, which occur under conditions of reduced estrogenic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrogens 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3alaying hens 3amessenger RNA 3ametalloproteinases 3aovarian follicles 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atamoxifen 3atranslation (genetics) 0aMMPs 0aTIMPs 0aOvary 0aChicken1 aHrabia, Anna0 tTheriogenology.g2020 May, v. 148 p.208-215dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245007800175300001600253520138500269592002801654650001701682650002501699650001801724650001301742650001101755650001301766650001601779650002501795650000901820650001301829650001801842700001901860700002201879773012401901856008402025852000902109655001202118IND60123431420221120095026.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343142DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.8824562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemeckis, Douglas R.10aSpawning Dynamics and Associated Management Implications for Atlantic Cod  ap. 424-442.  aMany stocks of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua have been depleted due to interactions between overfishing and environmental variation. Stock declines were often accompanied by reductions in spawning diversity and collapses of population structure. Studying Atlantic Cod spawning activity can provide insights into the mechanisms involved in rebuilding. This paper reviews the existing literature on Atlantic Cod spawning dynamics, including habitat, timing, behavior, gamete production, larval survivorship, and fishery impacts. The associated implications for fisheries management are discussed, and critical information gaps are identified for inclusion in future research. Of primary importance for consideration by fisheries managers are the spatial and temporal extent of spawning, the behavior of spawners, and the reproductive contributions of older age-classes. The application of spawning closures as part of a multidisciplinary approach to fisheries management is advocated to prevent the disruption of spawning activity and the extirpation of semidiscrete spawning components. Integrating information on Atlantic Cod spawning dynamics into fisheries management plans will better account for reproductive processes, which is expected to promote rebuilding and decrease the risk of further collapses of population structure.

Plant metabolites may act as markers of quality traits, potentially expediting the appraisal of experimental lines during breeding. Here, we evaluated the utility of metabolites as markers by assessing metabolic variation influenced by genetic and environmental factors in an advanced breeding setting and in relation to the phenotypic distribution of 20 quality traits. Nontargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolite profiling was performed on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) grain and malt from 72 advanced malting barley lines grown at two distinct but climatically similar locations, with 2-row and 6-row barley as the main genetic factors. 27 420 molecular features were detected, and the metabolite and quality trait profiles were similarly influenced by genotype and environment; however, malt was more influenced by genotype compared with barley. An O2PLS model characterized molecular features and quality traits that covaried, and 1319 features associated with at least one of 20 quality traits. An indiscriminant MS/MS acquisition and novel data analysis method facilitated the identification of metabolites. The analysis described 216 primary and secondary metabolites that correlated with multiple quality traits and included amines, amino acids, alkaloids, polyphenolics and lipids. The mechanisms governing quality trait-metabolite associations were interpreted based on colocalization to genetic markers and their gene annotations. The results of this study support the hypothesis that metabolism and quality traits are co-influenced by relatively narrow genetic and environmental factors and illustrate the utility of grain metabolites as functional markers of quality traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aagricultural industry 3aalkaloids 3aamines 3aamino acids 3abarley 3abreeding 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3alipids 3amalt 3amalting barley 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3amodels 3apolyphenols 3asecondary metabolites 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aBreeding 2aEdible Grainxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aEnvironment 2aGenetic Association Studiesxstatistics & numerical data 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHordeumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetabolomicsxmethods 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aSeasons 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry1 aBroeckling, Corey D.1 aKirkpatrick, Kaylyn R.1 aPrenni, Jessica E.0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2014 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.147-160dBlackwell Pubx1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.12122  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001600158245012400174300001600298520217500314592002802489650001802517650001402535650002102549650002002570650003102590650001002621650002102631650001702652650001202669650001802681650003702699650004402736650002202780650002402802650001202826650001002838650002902848653001602877653001102893653000902904653000802913653001202921700001902933700001702952700001902969700001802988700001703006773009703023856009303120852000903213655001203222IND60676623420221121081310.0200412e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067662342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Ruijie10aFollicular fluid meiosis-activating sterol (FF-MAS) promotes meiotic resumption via the MAPK pathway in porcine oocytes  ap. 186-193.  aFollicular fluid meiosis-activating sterol (FF-MAS) exerts beneficial effects on the meiotic resumption of mammalian oocytes and their subsequent early embryonic development, but the signaling pathway underlying these effects has not been elucidated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is involved in the FF-MAS-induced in vitro resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes. Porcine cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were allocated in several groups cultured in TCM-199 medium with different concentration of AY 9944-A-7 (20, 30, 40 μmol/L) or ketoconazole (20 μmol/L) to increase or decrease endogenous accumulation of FF-MAS. Each experimental condition was repeated at least six times. After maturation for 44 h, the resumption of meiosis was assessed by the frequency of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and the first polar body (PBI) extrusion, The relative expressions of related genes in MAPK pathway [c-mos, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)] at both transcriptional and translational levels were detected to investigate the kinetic trend of expression throughout oocyte maturation in vitro in response to the addition of AY 9944-A-7 or ketoconazole to the maturation medium. Results indicated that AY 9944-A-7 promoted, while ketoconazole inhibited, the in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocytes. Relative expression of meiosis related genes was upregulated by AY 9944-A-7 and downregulated by ketoconazole. With extended culturing time, c-mos mRNA expression levels reached their peak at 12 h of maturation and decreased gradually thereafter, while MEK, ERK1 and ERK2 expression increased after an initial decrease peaking at 44 h of culture in the AY 9944-A-7-group. And the trend of the protein expression of c-mos, MEK, ERK1/2 was basically consistent with the mRNA expression of these genes. These results imply that the endogenous accumulation of FF-MAS is beneficial to resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes and that MAPK signaling is involved in FF-MAS-induced meiotic resumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aembryogenesis 3aextrusion 3afollicular fluid 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agerminal vesicle 3aketoconazole 3ameiosis 3amessenger RNA 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3asterols 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 0aAY 9944-A-7 0aFF-MAS 0aMAPK 0aPig 0aOocytes1 aWang, Xiaorong1 aLi, Qinghong1 aSun, Xiaojiang1 aZhang, Junlan1 aHao, Ruirong0 tTheriogenology.g2020 May, v. 148 p.186-193dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245009400161300002000255500001900275520137000294592002801664650002301692650001801715650001601733650002101749650001601770650001301786650001401799650001401813650001901827650000701846700002701853700002001880773012501900856007402025852000902099655001202108IND60688727120221121031426.0200416e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872712DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra01133a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarghese, Sophia10aOne-step dry synthesis of an iron based nano-biocomposite for controlled release of drugs  ap. 13394-13404.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBio-based drug carriers have gained significant importance in Control Drug Delivery Systems (CDDS). In the present work, a new iron-based magnetic nano bio-composite (nano-Fe-CNB) is developed in a one-step dry calcination process (solventless) using a seaweed-based biopolymer. The detailed analysis of the developed nano Fe-CNB is carried out using FE-SEM, HR-TEM, P-XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, FTIR etc. and shows that nano-Fe-CNB consists of nanoparticles of 5–10 nm decorated on 7–8 nm thick 2-D graphitic carbon material. The impregnation of nano-Fe-CNB into the calcium alginate (CA) hydrogel beads is found to have good drug loading capacity as well as pH responsive control release behavior which is demonstrated using doxorubicin (DOX) as a model cancer drug. The drug loading experiments exhibit ∼94% loading of DOX and release shows ∼38% and ∼8% release of DOX at pH 5.4 and 7.4 respectively. The developed nano Fe-CNB facilitates strong electrostatic interactions with cationic DOX molecules at pH 7.4 and thereby restricts the release of the drug at physiological pH. However, at cancer cell pH (5.4), the interaction between the drug and nano-Fe-CNB reduces which facilitates more drug release at pH 5.4. Thus, the developed nano-biocomposite has the potential to reduce the undesired side effects associated with faster release of drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiocomposites 3abiopolymers 3acalcium alginate 3adoxorubicin 3agraphene 3ahydrogels 3amagnetism 3aneoplasm cells 3apH1 aChaudhary, Jai Prakash1 aGhoroi, Chinmay0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 10, no. 23 p.13394-13404dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra01133a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013600163300001600299500001500315520164200330592002801972650002002000650001602020650001002036650001002046650001402056650001002070650001102080650001702091650002102108650000902129650002302138650001202161650003502173650002002208650001002228650002602238650002302264650001802287650001802305650001002323653001702333700002102350700002402371700002002395700001602415773012602431856007502557852000902632655001202641IND60657840520221121044845.0190823e20140203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065784052DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60225g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaiswal, Manish K.10aBiocompatibility, biodistribution and efficacy of magnetic nanohydrogels in inhibiting growth of tumors in experimental mice models  ap. 370-380.  a2019-12-06  aWe report in vivo evaluation of a thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-chitosan based magnetic nanohydrogel (MNHG) incorporated with Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles (NPs) in mice models with expandible scope for use in localized delivery of chemotherapeutics. Biocompatibility and biodistribution of the MNHG are studied in normal Swiss mice while efficacy in tumor growth inhibition is studied in a subcutaneous fibrosarcoma tumor. The ex vivo time-dependent pattern of accumulated MNHG into vital organs; lung, liver, spleen, kidney and brain collected at 1 h, 48 h, 7 d and 14 d post intravenous administration are investigated using both a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) method. The doses of MNHG (dose I ∼ 650 and dose II ∼ 325 μg g⁻¹ body wt) used in the study are determined based on induced thermal activation of MNHG under an AC magnetic field (AMF). Fibrosarcoma tumor bearing mice are subjected to hyperthermia with a field of 325 Oe and 265 kHz for 30 min following intratumoral administration of dose I. Tumor size measured at an interval of 72 h for a period of 2 weeks reveals that the NPs mediated therapy decelerated the growth of the transplanted tumor by about three-fold (size, 1545 ± 720 mm³) as compared to the exponential growth of the tumor (size, 4510 ± 735 mm³) in control mice. These results suggest the feasibility of using poly(NIPAAm)-chitosan hydrogels loaded with NPs for combined thermo-chemotherapy where the efficacy may further be improved by temperature dependent release of the drugs from the magneto hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3ain vivo studies 3airon oxides 3alungs 3adrugs 3ahydrogels 3abrain 3aspleen 3afibrosarcoma 3abiocompatibility 3amice 3agrowth retardation 3akidneys 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3amagnetic fields 3aliver 3aintravenous injection 3alaboratory animals 3aanimal models 3ananoparticles 3afever 0adrug therapy1 aGogoi, Manashjit1 aDev Sarma, Haladhar1 aBanerjee, Rinti1 aBahadur, D.0 tBiomaterials science.g2014 Feb. 3, v. 2, no. 3 p.370-380dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60225g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008900164300002000253520155700273592002801830650002201858650002201880650001601902650002201918650001201940650002301952650002301975650001701998650001302015700002702028700002002055700002402075773012302099856008202222852000902304655001202313IND60563012620170926000000.0170209e20161222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b084852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrr, Asuka
A.10aUncovering the Binding and Specificity of β-Wrapins for Amyloid-β and α-Synuclein  ap. 12781-12794.  aAmyloidogenic proteins amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and α-synuclein (α-syn) self-assemble into fibrillar amyloid deposits, senile plaques and Lewy bodies, pathological features of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, respectively. Interestingly, a portion of Alzheimer’s disease cases also exhibit aggregation of α-syn into Lewy bodies, and growing evidence also suggests that Aβ and α-syn oligomers are toxic. Therefore, the simultaneous inhibition through sequestration of the two amyloidogenic proteins may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy. Recently discovered β-wrapin proteins pave the way toward this direction as they can inhibit the aggregation and toxicity of both Aβ and α-syn. Here, we used computational methods, primarily molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, to shed light into the key interaction-based commonalities leading to the dual binding properties of β-wrapins for both amyloidogenic proteins, to identify which interactions potentially act as switches diminishing β-wrapins’ binding activity for Aβ/α-syn, and to examine the binding properties of the current most potent β-wrapin for Aβ. Our analysis provides insights into the distinct role of the key determinants leading to β-wrapin binding to Aβ and α-syn, and suggests that the Aβ ₁₈VFFAED₂₃ and α-syn ₃₈LYVGSK₄₃ are key domains determining the binding specificity of a β-wrapin.

Studies have shown that CGA plays a protective role in ARDS, however, the precise protective mechanism of CGA against ARDS, is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CGA enhances alveolar macrophages phagocytosis to attenuate lung injury during ARDS. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (100 μg/ml for 24 h) and treated with CGA (100, 200, and 400 μM CGA for 1 h) to measure pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, GPR37 expression and macrophages phagocytosis. Mouse models of ARDS induced by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) surgery were treated with CGA (100 or 200 mg/kg) to investigate lung inflammatory injury and alveolar macrophages phagocytosis. Computational modeling was performed to examine potential binding sites of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) with CGA, and the results were validated by interfering with the binding sites. In vitro, CGA notably ameliorated inflammatory response and increased phagocytosis in lipopolysaccharides-induced RAW264.7 cells. In vivo, CGA administration significantly alleviated lung inflammatory injury, decreased the bacteria load in the lung, promoted alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and improved the survival rate in mice with CLP-induced ARDS. Moreover, CGA markedly upregulated the expression of GPR37 in vivo and in vitro. However, the protective effect of CGA against ARDS were reversed after silencing the expression of GPR37. CGA has a protective effect against ARDS and may enhance alveolar macrophages phagocytosis and attenuate lung inflammatory injury by upregulating GPR37 expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aacute respiratory distress syndrome 3aantioxidants 3achlorogenic acid 3acytokines 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aphagocytosis 3aprotective effect 3asurgery 3asurvival rate 0aAlveolar macrophages 0aARDS 0aBALF 0aCGA 0aCFU 0aCLP 0aDXM 0aELISA 0aIL-6 0aIL-1β 0aMPO 0aPCR 0aTNF-α 0aWT1 aGao, Fengjuan1 aCai, Nan1 aJiang, Min1 aWu, Chao0 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Dec., v. 107 p.154474-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154474  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003300139245011600172300001800288520142300306592002801729650001501757650002501772650001601797650004901813650001601862650001401878650001801892650003901910650001901949650001301968650001301981650003701994700002702031700002102058700002702079700002202106700002602128700002102154700002702175700001902202700002102221700002202242773010802264856007502372852000902447655001202456IND60532799020221122222838.0160728e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279902DNAL7 a10.1021/bm501139h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adella Vecchia, Nicola

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated the presence in the ABM matrix of isolated eumelanin nanoparticles (≤100 nm) differing in shape from pure DHI melanin nanoparticles (SANS evidence). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra showed a slightly asymmetric signal (g ∼ 2.0035) similar to that of solid DHI melanin but with a smaller amplitude (ΔB), suggesting hindered spin delocalization in biomatrix. Enhanced light absorption, altered nanoparticle morphology and decreased free radical delocalization in ABM would reflect CEW-induced inhibition of eumelanin aggregation during polymerization accompanied in part by covalent binding of growing polymer to the proteins (SDS-PAGE evidence). The technological potential of eumelanin nanosizing by biomimetic synthesis within a CEW biomatrix is demonstrated by the preparation of an ABM-based black flexible film with characteristics comparable to those of commercially available polymers typically used in electronics and biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiomimetic synthesis 3aegg albumen 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectronics 3aeumelanin 3ananoparticles 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aCerruti, Pierfrancesco1 aGentile, Gennaro1 aErrico, Maria Emanuela1 aAmbrogi, Veronica1 aD’Errico, Gerardino1 aLongobardi, Sara1 aNapolitano, Alessandra1 aPaduano, Luigi1 aCarfagna, Cosimo1 ad’Ischia, Marco0 tBiomacromolecules.g2014 Oct. 13, v. 15, no. 10 p.3811-3816dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm501139h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03898naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100002000158245014900178300001600327520264700343592002802990653002503018653002103043653001903064653000803083653001603091700002103107700002203128700002103150700002303171700002203194700002503216700001903241700002603260700002303286773010103309856009303410852000903503655001203512IND60676623620221121111241.0200330e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067662362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodico, Giorgia10aUterine responses and equine chorionic gonadotropin concentrations after two intrauterine infusions with kerosene post early fetal loss in mares  ap. 202-210.  aPregnancy loss during the normal lifespan of endometrial cups (∼37-120-150 days of gestation) may affect a mare’s ability to conceive again in the same breeding season, as equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) secretion by retained endometrial cups can lead to abnormal ovulations and follicular growth. While intrauterine kerosene infusion has anecdotally been proposed as a treatment for endometrial cup retention, there are no controlled studies evaluating kerosene’s ability to enhance endometrial cup regression following abortion. The objectives of this study were to assess uterine response, systemic side effects, and efficacy of intrauterine kerosene infusions after abortion. We hypothesized that kerosene infusions would hasten regression of endometrial cups without detrimental effects on the endometrium and the mare’s general health. Twelve light-breed mares were enrolled in the study after an experimentally induced abortion with cloprostenol (n = 12) by 60 ± 2 days of gestation. Mares were randomly allocated to receive an intrauterine infusion with 500 mL of kerosene (n = 6) or 500 mL saline (n = 6) on days 21 and 35 after pregnancy termination. Uterine biopsies were collected at days 7, 21, 35, and 49 post-abortion to evaluate the degree of endometrial fibrosis with Picrosirius Red Stain and to be graded according to the Kenney & Doig 1986 classification. Furthermore, histomorphometry analysis of the endometrium lining, glandular epithelium and glandular density was performed. Endometrial lymphocyte B CD20⁺, lymphocyte T CD3⁺, and macrophage IBA-1⁺ cell populations were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Physical examinations, blood cell counts, and serum biochemistry were performed before, and for 2 days after each uterine infusion. Serum samples were collected for assessment of eCG concentrations. Continuous data were analyzed with MIXED procedure with repeated measures in SAS, categorical data with LOGISTIC procedure of SAS. Significance was set at p < 0.05. Kerosene infusion did not affect complete blood cell counts, serum chemistry parameters, or physical examinations. Concentrations of eCG decreased over time (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between groups or time by group interactions (p = 0.72). Histological evaluation of the uterus showed no signs of increased fibrosis or degeneration in the treatment group. In conclusion, while kerosene infusions did not appear to have detrimental effects on mare health, our findings suggest that the use of kerosene in the uterus does not enhance the regression of endometrial cups by 49 days post-abortion.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIntrauterine therapy 0aEndometrial cups 0aPregnancy loss 0aeCG 0aEndometrium1 aCanisso, Igor F.1 aRoady, Patrick J.1 aAustin, Scott M.1 aCarossino, Mariano1 aBalasuriya, Udeni1 aEllerbrock, Robyn E.1 aLima, Fabio S.1 aFerreira-Dias, Graça1 aDouglas, Robert H.0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 147 p.202-210dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008300170300001600253520113700269592002801406650001901434650003301453650001401486650001801500650001301518650002001531650002101551650002401572650001601596650002401612650001301636653002801649653002301677653002401700700002101724700002201745773009601767856008601863852000901949655001201958IND60531901020221122005157.0190319e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053190102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKardani, Kimia10aPrime-boost vaccine strategy against viral infections: Mechanisms and benefits  ap. 413-423.  aThe essential goal of vaccination is to generate potent and long-term protection against diseases. Among different vaccine modalities, prime-boost vaccine strategies could enhance cellular and also humoral immunity in several animal models. These strategies have been applied for the development of vaccines against important infectious diseases such as HIV, SIV, HCV, HSV, and HBV indicating promising results even in clinical trials. Several factors including selection of antigen, type of vector, delivery route, dose, adjuvant, boosting regimen, the order of vector injection, and the intervals between different vaccinations influence the outcome of prime-boost immunization approaches. The reported data suggest that the prime-boost strategy as a combination of vaccines (i.e., heterologous prime-boost) may be better than a single vaccine for protection against infectious diseases. Indeed, in many cases, heterologous prime-boost can be more immunogenic than homologous prime-boost strategy. This review discusses the recent advances in prime-boost immunization strategies as well as their benefits and mechanisms of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aadjuvants 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3aclinical trials 3ahumoral immunity 3amechanism of action 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 0aPrime-boost vaccination 0aInfectious disease 0aMechanism of action1 aBolhassani, Azam1 aShahbazi, Sepideh0 tVaccine.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 34, no. 4 p.413-423dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245020800160300001800368500001400386520165100400592002802051650002202079650001302101650002002114650002302134650001502157650001502172650001602187650002102203650002002224650001202244650001902256650001702275650001002292650001702302651001002319653001602329653001002345653001602355653000802371653002502379653002002404700002602424700001602450700002702466700001802493700001502511700002002526773015202546856007602698852000902774655001202783IND60710107520221121102847.0200908e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010752DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-36722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarma, Kalyan10aSeroprevalence of Sarcoptes scabiei var suis infestation in swine population and its effect on haemato-biochemical and oxidative stress indices and its management with special reference to herbal ointmen  ap. 1489-1496.  aNAL-light  aThe study was undertaken to know the sero-prevalence of sarcoptic infestation in pig in Mizoram and its effect on haemato biochemical and oxidative stress indices and to develop cost effective herbal therapeutic management.

The results cleared that out of 600 inspected pigs, 100 (16.66%) were found to be seropositive with sarcoptic mange. Geographically, pigs from Aizawl areas were more exposed to mange infestation (56/200, 28%) than Kolashib (32/200, 16%) and Mamit (12/200, 6%). The neutrophil and eosinophil was significantly (P≤ 0.05) increase and RBCs, Hb and PCV were significantly (P≤ 0.05) decreased in infested groups. There were significant ELISA SARCOPTES-ELISA 2001H Pig decrease in values of total protein, albumin, while there were significant (P≤ 0.05) increase in values of AST, ALT, ALP, BUN and creatinine In regard to oxidative stress, there was a significant (P≤ 0.05) increase in malonyldialdehyde (LPO) and NO and significant (P≤ 0.05) decrease in reduced GSH, SOD and TAA in infested group. In the present study, polyherb formulation showed similar efficacy to improve skin lesion, haemato-biochemical and oxidative stress indices with Ivermectin on 15th day of post therapeutic application against sarcoptic infestation in pigs.

Autophagy is involved in the physiological process of spermiogenesis and its crucial role in germ-plasm clearance conserved across kingdoms. However, the fate of by-products generated through autophagy during spermiogenesis is still largely unknown. In the present study, we showed that the autophagy enhanced lipid droplets (LDs) formation during spermiogenesis in Chinese soft-shelled turtle, Pelodiscus sinensis. TEM and Oil Red O staining results found that the number and size of LDs within spermatid increased considerably during the process of spermiogenesis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that autophagy was highly activated via the PI3K pathway during spermatogenesis. Inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly decreased testicular triglycerides (TGs) and fatty acid (FAs) content. In comparison with the control group, the number and size of LD within elongating spermatids was reduced significantly in the 3-MA group. Moreover, DGAT1, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase, which normally localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, was found to co-localize with LDs. Taken together, our results showed that FAs released through the autophagic degradation of germ-plasm was replenished LDs of spermatid, increasing LD number and size, during the process of spermiogenesis. These LDs facilitate long-term sperm storage in the epididymis of Chinese soft-shelled turtle.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSpermiogenesis 0aAutophagy 0aLipid droplets 0aChinese soft-shelled turtle1 aHuang, Yufei1 aYang, Ping1 aShi, Yonghong1 aAhmed, Nisar1 aLiu, Tengfei1 aBai, Xuebing1 aHaseeb, Abdul1 aChen, Qiusheng0 tTheriogenology.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 147 p.154-165dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245014300199300001600342506007600358520170000434592002802134506003702162650001002199650001502209650001302224650001302237650002502250650001202275650001102287650001502298650001602313650001402329650002302343700002202366700002302388700002302411700001502434700002102449700001902470773012502489856007502614852000902689655001202698IND60657840720221207121418.0190823e20140507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065784072DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60228a2doi7 aPMC42691662pmcid7 a255308492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSur, Shantanu10aSynergistic regulation of cerebellar Purkinje neuron development by laminin epitopes and collagen on an artificial hybrid matrix construct  ap. 903-914.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe extracellular matrix (ECM) creates a dynamic environment around the cells in the developing central nervous system, providing them with the necessary biochemical and biophysical signals. Although the functions of many ECM molecules in neuronal development have been individually studied in detail, the combinatorial effects of multiple ECM components are not well characterized. Here we demonstrate that the expression of collagen and laminin-1 (lam-1) are spatially and temporally correlated during embryonic and post-natal development of the cerebellum. These changes in ECM distribution correspond to specific stages of Purkinje neuron (PC) migration, somatic monolayer formation and polarization. To clarify the respective roles of these ECM molecules on PC development, we cultured cerebellar neurons on a hybrid matrix comprised of collagen and a synthetic peptide amphiphile nanofiber bearing a potent lam-1 derived bioactive IKVAV peptide epitope. By systematically varying the concentration and ratio of collagen and the laminin epitope in the matrix, we could demonstrate a synergistic relationship between these two ECM components in controlling multiple aspects of PC maturation. An optimal ratio of collagen and IKVAV in the matrix was found to promote maximal PC survival and dendrite growth, while dendrite penetration into the matrix was enhanced by a high IKVAV to collagen ratio. In addition, the laminin epitope was found to guide PC axon development. By combining our observations in vivo and in vitro, we propose a model of PC development where the synergistic effects of collagen and lam-1 play a key role in migration, polarization and morphological maturation of PCs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaxons 3acerebellum 3acollagen 3aepitopes 3aextracellular matrix 3alaminin 3amodels 3ananofibers 3asurfactants 3asynergism 3asynthetic peptides1 aGuler, Mustafa O.1 aWebber, Matthew J.1 aPashuck, Eugene T.1 aIto, Masao1 aStupp, Samuel I.1 aLauney, Thomas0 tBiomaterials science.g2014 May 7, v. 2, no. 6 p.903-914dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3bm60228a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03076naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245012200165300001800287520179400305592002802099650002002127650002902147650001302176650001202189650002202201650001802223650002302241650002102264650001502285650001102300650002302311650001302334650001702347650002202364650001002386700002002396700001902416700001602435773009802451856008402549852000902633655001202642IND4458789820221120233840.0150808e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445878982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2011.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewton, A.C.10aProjecting impacts of human disturbances to inform conservation planning and management in a dryland forest landscape  ap. 1949-1960.  aSystematic approaches to conservation planning and management require spatially explicit information on the dynamics of multiple disturbance processes, but progress in providing such information has been limited to date. Here we examine the use of a spatially explicit model of forest dynamics (LANDIS-II), incorporating a range of ecological processes, to examine the impacts of different types of disturbance on a dryland forest landscape in Central Chile. The model was parameterized using spatial data and results of a field survey, in which 21 native tree species were recorded, and one invasive exotic (Acacia dealbata). Seven disturbance scenarios were simulated, with different combinations of fire, browsing and tree cutting. Model results indicated relatively little impact of disturbance on forest cover but substantial differences in forest structure, with relatively old-growth forest stands (>120years old) being virtually eliminated from the landscape in scenarios with both browsing and cutting. Tree species richness tended to be lower in those scenarios without disturbance, highlighting potential trade-offs between forest structure and species richness. Spread of A. dealbata was projected only to occur in the presence of fire when combined with browsing and/or cutting. These interactive effects of different forms of disturbance illustrate the value of process-based modeling approaches for exploring the spatial dynamics of multiple disturbance processes, but highlight the difficulty of identifying an optimum disturbance regime that would enable conservation objectives to be achieved. It is suggested that process-based models should form part of an analytical ‘toolkit’ to support the practical implementation of systematic conservation planning approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia dealbata 3aanthropogenic activities 3abrowsing 3acutting 3aforest management 3aforest stands 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aold-growth forests 3aplanning 3aspatial data 3aspecies diversity 3atrees1 aEcheverría, C.1 aCantarello, E.1 aBolados, G.0 tBiological conservation.g2011 July, v. 144, no. 7 p.1949-1960dElsevier Ltdx0006-32077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245013000177300001600307520186000323592002802183650001102211650001502222650001902237650001402256650001502270650001002285650001502295650001302310650000902323650001602332650001302348653001602361653004102377653001902418653001102437653001302448653002502461700002302486700002602509700001702535700002102552700002202573700002502595773009602620856008602716852000902802655001202811IND60531901220221122005036.0190319e20160203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053190122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtenheim, Alison M.12aA behavioral economics intervention to increase pertussis vaccination among infant caregivers: A randomized feasibility trial  ap. 839-845.  aThe incidence of pertussis has tripled in the past five years. Infants can be protected by “cocooning,” or vaccinating household contacts with the Tdap vaccine. However, Tdap coverage for adult caregivers of infants is low. This study evaluated the feasibility and impact of interventions informed by behavioral economics (retail pharmacy vouchers for Tdap vaccines and a celebrity public service announcement) to increase Tdap vaccination among caregivers of young infants.We conducted a randomized controlled feasibility trial among adults attending newborn well-child visits at an urban Philadelphia pediatric primary care clinic who were not previously vaccinated with Tdap. Participants were randomized to one of four conditions: ($5-off Tdap voucher vs. free voucher)×(watching a 1min video public service announcement (PSA) about Tdap vaccination vs. no PSA). Tdap vaccination was assessed by tracking voucher redemption and following up with participants by phone.Ninety-five adult caregivers of 74 infants were enrolled in the study (mean age 29.3 years; 61% male; relationship to newborn: 54% father, 33% mother, 13% grandparent or other; caregiver insurance status: 35% Medicaid, 34% private insurance, 32% uninsured). Only 1 subject redeemed the retail pharmacy Tdap voucher. Follow-up interviews suggest that, even with the voucher, significant barriers to vaccination remained including: delaying planned vaccination, perceived inconvenient pharmacy locations, and beliefs about pertussis risk and severity.Despite leveraging existing infrastructure for adult vaccination, results suggest that retail pharmacy vouchers delivered during a newborn visit are not an effective strategy for promoting Tdap. Alternate approaches are needed that prioritize convenience and provide an immediate opportunity to vaccinate when motivation is high.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acaregivers 3ainfrastructure 3ainsurance 3ainterviews 3amales 3amotivation 3aneonates 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aVaccination 0aDiphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine 0aWhooping cough 0aInfant 0aPharmacy 0aBehavioral economics1 aFiks, Alexander G.1 aBurson II, Randall C.1 aWang, Eileen1 aCoffin, Susan E.1 aMetlay, Joshua P.1 aFeemster, Kristen A.0 tVaccine.g2016 Feb. 03, v. 34, no. 6 p.839-845dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009500169520107200264592002801336650001801364650001201382650001901394650001101413650001601424650001301440650001601453650003001469650001301499650002301512650001901535650001201554650001101566650001301577653001701590653001201607653001601619653001901635653002401654700001701678700005301695700001601748700001901764700005901783773011901842856008801961852000902049655001202058IND60709368420221121003524.0220426e20210110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Liting10aMicrobial removal of vanadium (V) from groundwater by sawdust used as a sole carbon source  aBioremediation of vanadium (V) (V(V)) for polluted groundwater is an emerging topic globally. With this study, microbial removal of V(V) was investigated by sawdust of pine used as a sole carbon source. The removal efficiency of V(V) reached up to 90.3% with anaerobic sludge as inocula and sawdust as the carbon source in nutrient solution. Microbial removal of V(V) could be enhanced by adding medical stone and phosphate rock, from 53.2% up to 82.6% in real groundwater. Microbiological analysis revealed such microbes as Thauera accumulated, which could contribute to V(V) reduction. Such functional species as Bacteroidetes vadinHA17 norank and Anaerolineaceae norank helped degradation of sawdust. In column experiments with domesticated sludge or indigenous microbes from soils, microbial V(V) removal efficiencies (on 26 d) with sawdust were around 58.7% (BS), 54.8% (BP) and 38.4% (BU), respectively. The study can offer a potential approach to microbially removing V(V) for contaminated groundwater and even for disposal of agricultural and forestry wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aThauera 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3aenvironment 3aforestry 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ainoculum 3anutrient solutions 3arock phosphate 3asawdust 3asludge 3avanadium 0aVanadium (V) 0aSawdust 0aGroundwater 0aBioremediation 0aMicrobial community1 aLiu, Yongjie1 aChen, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-83791 aHao, Xiaodi1 aZhang, Baogang1 aFeng, Chuanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5485-02600 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 10, v. 751 p.142161-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014000160300001600300520107600316592002801392650001201420650001301432650001801445650001801463650001701481650002301498650001301521650001101534650001601545650001101561650001301572650001301585700001901598700001801617700001801635700001801653700001701671700002001688773012601708856007501834852000901909655001201918IND60657840820221121044824.0190823e20140203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065784082DNAL7 a10.1039/c3bm60232j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelletto, V.10aAlanine-rich amphiphilic peptide containing the RGD cell adhesion motif: a coating material for human fibroblast attachment and culture  ap. 362-369.  aWe studied the self-assembly of peptide A₆RGD (A: alanine, R: arginine, G: glycine, D: aspartic acid) in water, and the use of A₆RGD substrates as coatings to promote the attachment of human cornea stromal fibroblasts (hCSFs).

A₆RGD vesicle walls were shown to have a multilayer structure built out of highly interdigitated A₆ units, while A₆RGD fibres were based on β-sheet assemblies. Changes in the self-assembly motif with concentration were reflected in the cell culture assay results.

However, Treg-eliminating agents, especially those with small molecules, are rarely reported. To identify small molecule inhibitors of Treg cells from natural products. Compounds from Diploclisia glaucescens were isolated by column chromatography, and structures were identified by spectroscopic evidence and quantum calculations. The tet-On system for Foxp3-GFP expression in Jurkat T cells was generated to screen Treg inhibitors based on Foxp3 expression. The effect of the compound on TNF-induced proliferative expansion of naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) and TGF-β-induced generation of Tregs (iTregs) from naive CD4⁺ Tcells was further examined. A novel dimeric proaporphine alkaloid, designated as distepharinamide (DSA) with a symmetric structure isolated from the stems of D. glaucescens, restrained the doxycycline (Doxy)-induced Foxp3-tGFP expression, decreased the half-life of Foxp3 mRNA as well as reduced the mRNA levels of chemokine receptors (CCR4, CCR8 and CCR10) in Jurkat T cells with inducible Foxp3-tGFP expression. In lymphocytes or purified Tregs from wild-type C57BL/6 mice or from C57BL/6-Tg(Foxp3-DTR/EGFP)23.2Spar/Mmjax mice, DSA markedly inhibited TNF-induced proliferative expansion of Tregs present in the unfractionated CD4⁺ T cells, accompanied by the down-regulation of TNFR2, CD25 and CTLA4 expression on Tregs. Furthermore, DSA potently inhibited TGF-β-induced differentiation of Foxp3-expressing iTregs. Importantly, the expression of Foxp3 mRNA by both nTregs and iTregs was decreased by DSA treatment. Nevertheless, DSA at the same concentrations did not inhibit the proliferation of conventional CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells stimulated by anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies. DSA, a novel dimeric proaporphine alkaloid, potently inhibited the expansion of nTregs and generation of iTregs. Therefore, DSA or its analogs may merit further investigation as novel immunotherapeutic agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3achemokines 3achromatography 3adoxycycline 3ahalf life 3aimmune evasion 3aimmunotherapy 3aneoplasms 3aspectral analysis 0aCancer immunotherapy 0aTreg 0aFoxp3 0aDimeric proaporphine alkaloid 0aDiploclisia glaucescens1 aGeng, Chang-An1 aChou, Chon-Kit1 aZheng, Jing-Bin1 aYang, Yang1 aWang, Yi-Fei1 aLi, Tian-Ze1 aLi, Ping1 aChen, Ji-Jun1 aChen, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2628-40270 tPhytomedicine.g2022 Dec., v. 107 p.154482-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2022.154482  aDNAL 7aarticle02086naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245011200165300001800277500001400295520079000309592002801099650001801127650001301145650001101158650002001169650001901189650001101208650001501219650001101234650002201245650001001267650001101277651001001288653001401298653004001312653002001352700002301372700002001395773015201415856007601567852000901643655001201652IND60710107920221121102919.0200908e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010792DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-36832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Dharmesh C.10aRisk factors associated prevalence of hard tick in large ruminants of coastal areas of South Gujarat, India  ap. 1514-1517.  aNAL-light  aSouth Gujarat were screened for tick infestation.

We sampled 1,032 randomly distributed stream sites (usually 100 m in length) across more than 60,000 km of stream network to assess Redband Trout occupancy, abundance, and genetic purity in the upper Snake River basin of Idaho. Study locations were more often in dry desert subbasins (49% of sites) than in montane subbasins (20%), and 25% of the dry “stream sites” had no discernible stream channel whatsoever, indicating a lack of flowing water for perhaps millennia. Redband Trout were estimated to occupy 13,485 km of stream (22% of the total) and were captured more often (389 sites) than Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis (128 sites), Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus (37 sites), or Brown Trout Salmo trutta (16 sites). Redband Trout were also the most abundant species of trout, with an approximate abundance of 3,449,000 ± 402,000 (90% confidence interval) of all sizes, followed by Brook Trout (1,501,000 ± 330,000), Bull Trout (159,000 ± 118,000), and Brown Trout (43,000 ± 25,000). Approximately 848,000 ± 128,000 Redband Trout were adults. From 1913 (the earliest year of record) to 2001, roughly 43 million hatchery Rainbow Trout were stocked in streams in the study area, 17.5 million of which were of catchable size (i.e., ≥200 mm total length); since 2001, all catchable trout have been sterilized prior to stocking. Genetic results from 61 study sites suggest that hybridization with hatchery Rainbow Trout is more likely to occur in streams that were directly stocked with catchable trout from 1913 to 2001. Applying these results across the landscape, we estimated that Redband Trout likely remain pure in about 68% of the streams occupied in the upper Snake River basin.

The PnWB-mediated leafy flower transitions were studied to understand the mechanisms underlying the pathogen–host interaction; however, our understanding is limited because of the lack of information on the C. roseus genome. In this study, the whole-transcriptome profiles from healthy flowers (HFs) and stage 4 (S4) PnWB-infected leafy flowers of C. roseus were investigated using next-generation sequencing (NGS). More than 60,000 contigs were generated using a de novo assembly approach, and 34.2% of the contigs (20,711 genes) were annotated as putative genes through name-calling, open reading frame determination and gene ontology analyses. Furthermore, a customized microarray based on this sequence information was designed and used to analyze samples further at various stages of PnWB infection. In the NGS profile, 87.8% of the genes showed expression levels that were consistent with those in the microarray profiles, suggesting that accurate gene expression levels can be detected using NGS. The data revealed that defense-related and flowering gene expression levels were altered in S4 PnWB-infected leafy flowers, indicating that the immunity and reproductive stages of C. roseus were compromised. The network analysis suggested that the expression levels of >1,000 candidate genes were highly associated with CrSVP1/2 and CrFT expression, which might be crucial in the leafy flower transition. In conclusion, this study provides a new perspective for understanding plant pathology and the mechanisms underlying the leafy flowering transition caused by host–pathogen interactions through analyzing bioinformatics data obtained using a powerful, rapid high-throughput technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aPhytoplasma 3abacteria 3abioinformatics 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aimmunity 3amicroarray technology 3aopen reading frames 3apeanuts 3aphytoplasmal diseases 3aplant pathology 3atranscriptomics 0aCatharanthus roseus 0aMicroarray 0aLeafy flower 0aNext-generation sequencing 0aPeanut witches’-broom phytoplasma 0aTranscriptome1 aZeng, Xinyi,1 aLin, Chan-Pin1 aLin, Yen-Yu1 aHuang, Yuan-Hung1 aHuang, Chien-Kang1 aChang, Tean-Hsu1 aLin, Shih-Shun0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.942-957dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011700170500001900287520188800306592002802194650002202222650002202244650001602266650001302282650001302295650000702308650001202315650001602327650001802343651001002361653001402371653002002385653001402405653001402419653001502433700005602448700001502504700001702519700001502536700001602551700001502567700001302582773011902595856008802714852000902802655001202811IND60709368620221121024930.0210121e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shanshan10aRedistribution of iron oxides in aggregates induced by pe + pH variation alters Cd availability in paddy soils  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the effect of unstable pe + pH levels on the transformation of Fe oxides in different-sized soil fractions and its impact on Cd speciation were explored. Paddy soil samples collected from two locations in China were cultivated for two months under one of four pe + pH conditions: flooding + N₂ (T1), flooding (T2), 70% water holding capacity (T3), and 70% water holding capacity + O₂ (T4). Chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to identify the mineralogical phases and species of Fe and Cd in paddy soils. The results show that the decrease of soil pe + pH level favored the transformation of well-crystallized Fe oxides (Fec), such as hematite and goethite, into poorly-crystallized (Feₒ) and organically-complexed (Feₚ) forms. The transformation promoted the binding of Cd to Fe oxides and was primarily responsible for up to a 41.8% decrease of soil DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid)-extractable-Cd content. In addition, the decline in pe + pH value reduced Fe concentrations in soil particle fractions of 0.2–2-mm (17.8%–30.6%) and <0.002-mm (20.7%–31.7%) of the two flooding treatments. The decreased Fe concentrations were closely associated with less Fec contents in these same fractions and more Feₒ and Feₚ in coarser aggregates (P < 0.01). Importantly, the increase in contents of Feₒ and Feₚ in the 0.002–2 mm fraction were significantly correlated with content of Fe-/Mn-oxide-bound Cd (OX-Cd) in larger particle-size fractions (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the increasing content of OX-Cd played a crucial role in reducing DTPA-Cd content. This study demonstrates that low pe + pH values favor the transformation of crystalline Fe oxides into a poorly-crystallized and organically-complexed phase, which facilitates Cd accumulation in coarser aggregates and enhances Cd stability in paddy soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical analysis 3aenvironment 3agoethite 3ahematite 3apH 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aparticle size 3aChina 0ape + pH 0aCd availability 0aFe oxides 0aAggregate 0aPaddy soil1 aChen, Shibao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0159-24341 aWang, Meng1 aLei, Xiaoqin1 aZheng, Han1 aSun, Xiaoyi1 aWang, Lifu1 aHan, Yun0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 752 p.142164-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011400165300001600279520185000295592002802145650001702173650001902190650001102209650001102220650001602231650001302247700002202260773012302282856008402405852000902489655001202498IND60123432320221120105251.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343232DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.8925462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yunbo13aAn Empirical Approach for Estimating the Precision of Hydroacoustic Fish Counts by Systematic Hourly Sampling  ap. 535-545.  aSystematic hourly sampling is a logistically favorable method for hydroacoustic estimation of fish passage through constricted passageways or finite sections of a river monitored by fixed-location sonar systems. Similar to simple random and hourly stratified random sampling, systematic hourly sampling produces unbiased estimates of fish passage. Variances of estimates produced by systematic hourly sampling are determined by the sampling fraction, f , variance of the underlying process, S ², and correlations among all hourly strata of the process. This intrahour correlation dependency makes it difficult to accurately evaluate the precision of the estimate when the complete temporal pattern of the process is unavailable. Fish passage is rarely counted continuously, so the uncertainty of estimated mean by systematically subsampled fish counts is traditionally estimated using variance estimators. Variance estimates by these estimators are likely biased and subject to potentially large errors. We present an alternative approach for estimating the precision of systematic hourly sampling using an empirical relation between precision and sampling fraction established from continuous fish counts acquired by imaging sonar for a wide range of migration scenarios of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. in the lower Fraser River. The empirical relation indicates that a CV (100·SD/mean) of 5.5% can be achieved by the systematic hourly counting of fish passage at a counting effort of 10 min/h, while increasing the counting effort to 20 min/h only leads to a marginally improved CV of 4.1%. The data-based analysis also shows that the precision of systematic sampling can be gained more efficiently and consistently by increasing the sampling rate than by lengthening the sampling time.

Clustering arises naturally in clinical genetic studies and other settings. We develop a nonparametric estimator of cumulative incidence, and obtain robust pointwise standard errors that account for withinâcluster correlation. We modify the twoâsample Gray and PepeâMori tests for correlated competing risks data, and propose a simple twoâsample test of the difference in cumulative incidence at a landmark time. In simulation studies, our estimators are asymptotically unbiased, and the modified test statistics control the type I error. The power of the respective twoâsample tests is differentially sensitive to the degree of correlation; the optimal test depends on the alternative hypothesis of interest and the withinâcluster correlation. For purposes of illustration, we apply our methods to a familyâbased prospective cohort study of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families. For women with BRCA1 mutations, we estimate the cumulative incidence of breast cancer in the presence of competing mortality from ovarian cancer, accounting for significant withinâfamily correlation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal ovaries 3abiometry 3abreast neoplasms 3acohort studies 3amortality 3amutation 3aovarian neoplasms 3arisk 3awomen1 aKramer, Joan L.1 aGreene, Mark H.1 aRosenberg, Philip S.0 tBiometrics.g2008 Mar., v. 64, no. 1 p.172-179dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00868.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03640naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245014000176300001600316520186000332592002802192650001902220650002502239650001702264650002302281650001802304650001302322650003902335650001702374650004302391650001202434650002302446650002102469650001402490650001202504650001602516650002202532650002202554650001702576653001502593653001702608653001502625653001802640653001202658653002302670700002202693700002002715700002402735700002002759700002002779700002302799700002102822773011102843856008702954852000903041655001203050IND60585828120221123030354.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStănciuc, Nicoleta10aInvestigations on binding mechanism of bioactives from elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) by whey proteins for efficient microencapsulation  ap. 197-207.  aA comprehensive study regarding the microencapsulation of bioactives from elderberry extract (Sambuci nigra) by whey proteins was performed. Quenching experiments allowing the estimations of binding parameters for anthocyanins and flavonoids from elderberry extract by whey proteins isolate were first performed. The binding parameters values highlighted a preferential binding of the flavonoids, whereas a dynamic quenching process involving multiple binding sites was suggested. The HPLC analysis allowed identification of major anthocyanins and flavonoids in the extract, as delphinidin-3-glucoside and catechin hydrate. Molecular docking tests carried out to identify the particularities of the interaction between these bioactives from elderberry by β-lactoglobulin indicated affinity varying with the type of complex and different binding sites for each ligand. The results indicated that the complex with anthocyanins is thermodynamically stable, while the complex with the main flavonoid appears rather unstable. Further, elderberry bioactives were encapsulated within whey proteins isolate and pectin, with an encapsulating efficiency of ∼98%. The confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the presence of various spherical or polygonal formations with sizes ranging from 40 to 150 μm. The powder showed a significant amount of polyphenols (5.59 ± 0.02 mg GA/g DW), flavonoids (1.19 ± 0.02 mg CE/g DW) and anthocyanins (307.82 ± 1.57 mg C3G/g DW), whereas the antioxidant activity was 3695.67 ± 0.67 μM Trolox/g DW. The remarkable antioxidant activity of the powder highlights the potential use of the microcapsules as natural antioxidants in food and derivatives. The thermal stability experiments evidenced a significant protective effect on anthocyanins degradation, whereas an increase in flavonoid content was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSambucus nigra 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3abinding sites 3acatechin 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aelderberries 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aligands 3amicroencapsulation 3amolecular models 3amyrtillin 3apectins 3apolyphenols 3aprotective effect 3athermal stability 3awhey protein 0aElderberry 0aAnthocyanins 0aFlavonoids 0aWhey proteins 0aBinding 0aMicroencapsulation1 aOancea, Ana Maria1 aAprodu, Iuliana1 aTurturică, Mihaela1 aBarbu, Vasilica1 aIoniţă, Elena1 aRâpeanu, Gabriela1 aBahrim, Gabriela0 tJournal of food engineering.g2018 Apr., v. 223 p.197-207dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002200158245013300180300001600313500001500329520156700344592002801911650001601939650001501955650003101970650000902001650002802010650002902038650001002067650002802077650000702105650001102112650001402123650001402137650005502151650002402206650002702230650004002257650002002297650001302317650002802330650001402358650002502372650003902397650002302436650002702459650005302486650003602539650003202575653001002607700002402617700002102641700002002662700001902682700001902701700002302720700001902743700001602762700001602778773010002794856004002894852000902934655001202943IND50072295420221118064757.0140125e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007229542DNAL7 a241121472pmid7 a10.1111/pbi.121242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeekwilder, Jules10aValencene synthase from the heartwood of Nootka cypress (Callitropsis nootkatensis) for biotechnological production of valencene  ap. 174-182.  a2019-12-06  aNootkatone is one of the major terpenes in the heartwood of the Nootka cypress Callitropsis nootkatensis. It is an oxidized sesquiterpene, which has been postulated to be derived from valencene. Both valencene and nootkatone are used for flavouring citrus beverages and are considered among the most valuable terpenes used at commercial scale. Functional evaluation of putative terpene synthase genes sourced by large-scale EST sequencing from Nootka cypress wood revealed a valencene synthase gene (CnVS). CnVS expression in different tissues from the tree correlates well with nootkatone content, suggesting that CnVS represents the first dedicated gene in the nootkatone biosynthetic pathway in C. nootkatensis The gene belongs to the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily of terpenes synthases and its protein sequence has low similarity to known citrus valencene synthases. In vitro, CnVS displays high robustness under different pH and temperature regimes, potentially beneficial properties for application in different host and physiological conditions. Biotechnological production of sesquiterpenes has been shown to be feasible, but productivity of microbial strains expressing valencene synthase from Citrus is low, indicating that optimization of valencene synthase activity is needed. Indeed, expression of CnVS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated potential for higher yields. In an optimized Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain, expression of CnVS increased valencene yields 14-fold to 352 mg/L, bringing production to levels with industrial potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3anootkatone 3aXanthocyparis nootkatensis 3awood 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3atrees 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3apH 3aCitrus 3aheartwood 3abeverages 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCupressaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aRhodobacterxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSesquiterpenesxanalysisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aTerpenesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aWoodxenzymologyxgenetics. 0agenes1 aHouwelingen, Adèle1 aCankar, Katarina1 aDijk, Aalt D.J.1 aJong, René M.1 aStoopen, Geert1 aBouwmeester, Harro1 aAchkar, Jihane1 aSonke, Theo1 aBosch, Dirk0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2014 Feb., v. 12, no. 2 p.174-182dBlackwell Pubx1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.12124  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245007600162300002000238520097000258592002801228650002301256650002401279650001801303650002901321650001001350700002001360700002101380700002301401773012501424856007401549852000901623655001201632IND60688727920221121005823.0200416e20200405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872792DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra01394c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillocq, Bertrand10aAdvances in intrinsic self-healing polyurethanes and related composites  ap. 13766-13782.  aFascinating and challenging, the development of repairable materials with long-lasting, sustainable and high-performance properties is a key-parameter to provide new advanced materials.

Generally, PA uptake activity is elevated in rapidly proliferating cells. Previous studies showed that PA uptake in plant cells occurred via energy-dependent, protein-mediated transport systems. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that paraquat (PQ), one of the most widely used herbicides, is transported by the PA transport system in diverse organisms including plants. The PA/PQ transport interactions are proposed to be due to specific structural similarities between PA and PQ. The understanding of PA transport mechanisms has progressed in parallel with that of PQ transport, but the molecular identity of the plant PA/PQ transporter has remained an enigma. Recently, independent studies identified the l -type amino acid transporter (LAT) family transmembrane proteins as transporters of both PA and PQ. Arabidopsis LAT family proteins showed different subcellular localization properties, which suggested that these transporters were involved in intracellular PA trafficking and PA uptake across the plasma membrane. The identification of plant PA transporters is an important step in understanding the mechanism of PA homeostasis in plant cells. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the study of PA transport systems that are linked to the understanding of PQ translocation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3ahomeostasis 3aparaquat 3aplasma membrane 3apolyamines 3atransmembrane proteins 3atransporters 0aArabidopsis 0aParaquat 0aPolyamine transporter 0aRice1 aShinozaki, Kazuo0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.855-861dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003200152245016600184300001600350520187800366592002802244650001702272650001702289650002002306650002802326650001002354650002502364773009402389856005502483852000902538655001202547IND4487646320221116155026.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448764632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1096-0031.2012.00394.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTixier, MarieâStephane10aStatistical approaches to assess intraspecific variations of morphological continuous characters: the case study of the family Phytoseiidae (Acari: Mesostigmata)  ap. 489-502.  aStatistical methods for delimiting species with morphological data remain woefully understudied. The present study presents statistical approaches to study the intraspecific variations of continuous characters used in species diagnosis. For this, the data set comprised 14 species of the mite family Phytoseiidae (Acari: Mesostigmata) and 23 continuous characters (seta lengths). The statistical approaches aim to determine (i) how intraspecific variations differ depending on the characters and species considered, and (ii) how to choose the number of specimens to be considered for characterizing intraspecific boundaries. The means of the related confident limits at 95% (rCL95) of the 14 species and the 23 setae are around 20%, suggesting that 95% of the specimens of a same species are included in the interval Î¼âÂ±â0.2Î¼. No relationship was found between seta variations and the number of specimens considered for each species, nor for seta variations and their position on the mite body. However, a correlation between seta lengths and rCL95 means was observed. An abacus was proposed to determine the coefficient that must be applied to mean seta length to calculate the lower and upper limits of the interval that will include 95% of the specimens of a same species. The higher the precision around the mean, the higher the number of specimens considered. Furthermore, this number varies considerably depending on the characters and species considered for high precisions. However, for a priori error around the mean of 15%, the number of specimens needed to characterize the intraspecific variation is quite homogeneous and ten specimens would be required. I discuss the utility of such results to resolve some persistent problems in the alphaâtaxonomy of the family Phytoseiidae but also of other taxa.

To enrich soy protein, the environment-friendly enzymatic processing requires multiple carbohydrases including cellulase, xylanase, pectinase, α-galactosidase and sucrase. Besides enriched protein, the processing adds value by generating monosaccharides that are ready feedstock for biofuel/bioproducts. Aspergillus could produce the required carbohydrases, but with deficient pectinase and α-galactosidase. Here we address this critical technological gap by focused evaluation of the suboptimal productivity of pectinase and α-galactosidase. A carbohydrases-productive strain A. niger (NRRL 322) was used with soybean hull as inducing substrate. Temperatures at 20 °C, 25 °C and 30 °C were found to affect cell growth on sucrose with an Arrhenius-law activation energy of 28.7 kcal/mol. The 30 °C promoted the fastest cell growth (doubling time = 2.1 h) and earliest enzyme production, but it gave lower final enzyme yield due to earlier carbon-source exhaustion. The 25 °C gave the highest enzyme yield. pH conditions also strongly affected enzyme production. Fermentations made with initial pH of 6 or 7 were most productive, e.g., giving 1.9- to 2.3-fold higher pectinase and 2.2- to 2.3-fold higher α-galactosidase after 72 h, compared to the fermentation with a constant pH 4. Further, pH must be kept above 2.6 to avoid limitation in pectinase production and, in the later substrate-limiting stage, kept below 5.5 to avoid pectinase degradation. α-Galactosidase production always followed the pectinase production with a 16-24 h lag; presumably, the former relied on pectin hydrolysis for inducers generation. Optimal enzyme production requires controlling the transient availability of inducers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aactivation energy 3abiofuels 3acell growth 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3apectins 3apolygalacturonase 3aprotein sources 3asoy protein 3asoybean hulls 3asoybeans 3asucrose 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3axylanases 0aPectinase 0aα-Galactosidase 0aSoybean hull1 aAl Loman, Abdullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2018-70901 aRay, Christopher S.1 aCallow, Nicholas V.1 aLoman, Abdullah A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2018-70901 aIslam, S.M.M.1 aJu, Lu-Kwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0252-05070 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2020 Mar., v. 134 p.109476-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2019.1094763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009700169300001600266520186700282592002802149650002102177650001402198650001102212650001102223650002102234650000902255650001402264650001402278650002302292650001402315650001402329651001802343700002402361700001902385700002602404773012302430856008402553852000902637655001202646IND60123432720221120105310.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343272DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.8925502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKneebone, Jeff10aMovements of Striped Bass between the Exclusive Economic Zone and Massachusetts State Waters  ap. 524-534.  aIn recent years, commercial and recreational fishermen have reported large aggregations of adult Striped Bass Morone saxatilis occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) adjacent to Massachusetts state waters. Directed fishing for Striped Bass within the EEZ has been prohibited since 1990, and there is overwhelming public perception that adult Striped Bass remain as seasonal residents of the EEZ and do not enter state waters, where they would become available to anglers. Passive acoustic telemetry was utilized to examine the extent to which adult Striped Bass move between the EEZ and Massachusetts state waters and to assess the relative conservation benefit provided by the EEZ fishery closure. From 2008 to 2011, 125 adult Striped Bass (68–110 cm TL) were tagged with acoustic transmitters on Stellwagen Bank within the EEZ and were monitored with an extensive array of fixed acoustic receivers deployed within Massachusetts state waters. Of these tagged individuals, 119 (95%) were detected for 1–56 d within state waters during a given year, and 96 (77%) were detected seasonally for up to 2 years after tagging. Sixty-five (55%) fish moved into state waters within 30 d after tagging (during July and August) and became accessible to the Massachusetts commercial fishery. The results of this study provide definitive evidence that a majority of the adult Striped Bass encountered annually on Stellwagen Bank (i.e., in the EEZ) exhibit movement into Massachusetts state waters as part of their normal migratory and feeding behaviors. If future research in other areas off the northeast U.S. coast likewise documents routine movements between federal and state waters, fishery managers will need to re-evaluate the efficacy of the EEZ closure as a tool for reducing fishing mortality.

Previous computational analyses have identified approximately 1,500 mouse olfactory receptors, but experimental evidence confirming olfactory function is available for very few olfactory receptors. We therefore screened a mouse olfactory epithelium cDNA library to obtain olfactory receptor expressed sequence tags, providing evidence of olfactory function for many additional olfactory receptors, as well as identifying gene structure and putative promoter regions. RESULTS: We identified more than 1,200 odorant receptor cDNAs representing more than 400 genes. Using real-time PCR to confirm expression level differences suggested by our screen, we find that transcript levels in the olfactory epithelium can differ between olfactory receptors by up to 300-fold. Differences for one gene pair are apparently due to both unequal numbers of expressing cells and unequal transcript levels per expressing cell. At least two-thirds of olfactory receptors exhibit multiple transcriptional variants, with alternative isoforms of both 5' and 3' untranslated regions. Some transcripts (5%) utilize splice sites within the coding region, contrary to the stereotyped olfactory receptor gene structure. Most atypical transcripts encode nonfunctional olfactory receptors, but can occasionally increase receptor diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Our cDNA collection confirms olfactory function of over one-third of the intact mouse olfactory receptors. Most of these genes were previously annotated as olfactory receptors based solely on sequence similarity. Our finding that different olfactory receptors have different expression levels is intriguing given the one-neuron, one-gene expression regime of olfactory receptors. We provide 5' untranslated region sequences and candidate promoter regions for more than 300 olfactory receptors, valuable resources for computational regulatory motif searches and for designing olfactory receptor microarrays and other experimental probes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3acomplementary DNA 3amicroarray technology 3aodorant receptors 3aexpressed sequence tags 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3asmell 3acDNA libraries 3a3' untranslated regions 3asequence homology 3aolfactory receptors 3aepithelium 3apromoter regions 3a5' untranslated regions 0agenes1 aShykind, Benjamin M1 aLane, Robert P1 aTonnes-Priddy, Lori1 aRoss, Joseph A.,1 aWalker, Megan1 aWilliams, Eleanor M1 aTrask, Barbara J0 tGenome biology.g2003 Nov., v. 4, no. 11 p.580-580dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2003-4-11-r713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002100169245009600190300001800286520105600304592002801360596008301388650002601471650001701497650001701514650001801531650003201549650002301581650001701604650001401621650002401635650001601659650001801675650000901693650000701702650001901709700001901728700002001747700001901767700002501786700002401811700002201835773012601857856007401983852000902057655001202066IND60532799920221123021641.0160728e20141110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279992DNAL7 a10.1021/bm500970b2doi7 a10.1021/bm500970b2chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalbert, Joey N.10aImmobilization and Stabilization of Lipase (CaLB) through Hierarchical Interfacial Assembly  ap. 3915-3922.  aNanostructure-enabled hierarchical assembly holds promise for efficient biocatalyst immobilization for improved stability in bioprocessing. In this work we demonstrate the use of a hierarchical assembly immobilization strategy to enhance the physicochemical properties and stability of lipase B from Candida antarctica (CaLB). CaLB was complexed with iron oxide nanoparticles followed by interfacial assembly at the surface of an oil-in-water emulsion. Subsequent ring opening polymerization of the oil provided cross-linked microparticles that displayed an increase in catalytic efficiency when compared to the native enzyme and Novozym 435. The hierarchical immobilized enzyme assembly showed no leakage from the support in 50% acetonitrile and could be magnetically recovered across five cycles. Immobilized lipase exhibited enhanced thermal and pH stability, providing 72% activity retention after 24 h at 50 °C (pH 7.0) and 62% activity retention after 24 h at pH 3.0 (30 °C); conditions resulting in complete deactivation of the native lipase.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aacetonitrile 3abiocatalysts 3abioprocessing 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalytic activity 3acrosslinking 3aemulsions 3aimmobilized enzymes 3airon oxides 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apH 3apolymerization1 aWang, Lisheng,1 aDuncan, Bradley1 aJeong, Youngdo1 aAndler, Stephanie

The main changes are to DS₊ and DS– for [HMIM][PF₆] ([C₆C₁Im][PF₆]) and DS– for [OMIM][BF₄] ([C₈C₁Im][BF₄]). New atmospheric pressure self-diffusion, density, and conductivity data are provided for [HMIM][BF₄] ([C₆C₁Im][BF₄]). Velocity cross-correlation, distinct diffusion, and Laity resistance coefficients have been calculated. There is no evidence for ion association. A new relation between the Nernst–Einstein deviation parameter (Δ) and resistance coefficients (rᵢⱼ) is derived; Δ tends toward 0.5 when the like-ion rᵢᵢ are much smaller than the unlike-ion rᵢⱼ, i.e., when the counterion interactions dominate. [OMIM]⁺ ion salts approach this limit. Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland and Walden plots overlap almost quantitatively for [BF₄]⁻, [PF₆]⁻, and Cl– salts with a common [RMIM]⁺ cation. That is, in thermodynamic states that have the same viscosity, the salt molar conductivities and hence ionic electrical mobilities of, say, [BMIM][BF₄] and [BMIM][PF₆] are almost equal, as are the corresponding Brownian or diffusive mobilities, (DSᵢ/RT), for the cation, and also for these three small anions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aatmospheric pressure 3acations 3achlorides 3aphysical chemistry 3athermodynamics 3aviscosity1 aKanakubo, Mitsuhiro0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Dec. 22, v. 120, no. 50 p.12937-12949dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b103413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245007300183300001400256520096500270592002801235650001201263650001601275650001001291650001401301650001801315650001601333650000901349650001101358650001901369650000701388650001201395650000901407650002701416650002101443650002801464650002401492650001601516650002701532653001701559653001101576653001801587653002401605700003701629700006301666700002901729700002101758700003101779700002501810700004101835773010901876856008701985852000902072655001202081IND60585828420221123030405.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaglarini, Camila de Souza10aFunctional emulsion gels with potential application in meat products  ap. 29-37.  aThis study aimed to develop soybean-oil based functional emulsion gels (EG) to be used as animal fat replacer in meat products. A Plackett-Burman 12 was applied to 7 independent variables for the elaboration of EG (soy protein isolate (SPI), sodium caseinate, carrageenan (CAR), inulin (INUL), pectin, sodium tripolyphosphate, and soy lecithin). Then, three selected factors, SPI, CAR, and INUL were optimized using a central composite rotatable design (CCRD). The responses evaluated in the EG were: pH, color, water holding capacity (WHC) and rheological properties. CCRD showed that pH values in EG were mainly influenced by CAR and SPI addition. G′ values increased in high concentration of SPI, CAR, and INUL. EG with 94% of WHC were obtained. Technological properties of meat emulsions were slightly affected by addition of EG. However, EG with high content of inulin and unsaturated fatty acids to replace pork back fat in meat products were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackfat 3acarrageenan 3acolor 3aemulsions 3afat replacers 3afatty acids 3agels 3ainulin 3ameat emulsions 3apH 3apectins 3apork 3arheological properties 3asodium caseinate 3asodium tripolyphosphate 3asoy protein isolate 3asoybean oil 3awater holding capacity 0aEmulsion gel 0aInulin 0aMeat emulsion 0aExperimental design1 aFurtado, Guilherme de Figueiredo1 aBiachi, João Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8866-98731 aVidal, Vitor Andre Silva1 aMartini, Silvana1 aForte, Marcus Bruno Soares1 aCunha, Rosiane Lopes1 aPollonio, Marise Aparecida Rodrigues0 tJournal of food engineering.g2018 Apr., v. 222 p.29-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013000169300001600299520188300315592002802198650001702226650002102243650001802264650001402282650001102296650001602307650003502323650001102358650001102369650001302380651001602393651002302409700001902432700002202451700002302473773012302496856008402619852000902703655001202712IND60123432820221120105302.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343282DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2014.9012562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Noah S.10aPerformance of a Surface Bypass Structure to Enhance Juvenile Steelhead Passage and Survival at Lower Granite Dam, Washington  ap. 576-594.  aAn integral part of efforts to recover stocks of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss in Pacific Northwest rivers is to increase passage efficacy and survival of juveniles past hydroelectric dams. As part of this effort, we evaluated the efficacy of a prototype surface bypass structure, the removable spillway weir (RSW), installed in a spillbay at Lower Granite Dam, Washington, on the Snake River during 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006. Radio-tagged juvenile steelhead were released upstream from the dam and their route of passage through the turbines, juvenile bypass, spillway, or RSW was recorded. The RSW was operated in an on-or-off condition and passed 3–13% of the total discharge at the dam when it was on. Poisson rate models were fit to the passage counts of hatchery- and natural-origin juvenile steelhead to predict the probability of fish passing the dam. Main-effect predictor variables were RSW operation, diel period, day of the year, proportion of flow passed by the spillway, and total discharge at the dam. The combined fish passage through the RSW and spillway was 55–85% during the day and 37–61% during the night. The proportion of steelhead passing through nonturbine routes was <88% when the RSW was off during the day and increased to >95% when the RSW was on during the day. The ratio of the proportion of steelhead passed to the proportion of water passing the RSW was from 6.3:1 to 10.0:1 during the day and from 2.7:1 to 5.2:1 during the night. Steelhead passing through the RSW exited the tailrace about 15 min faster than fish passing through the spillway. Mark–recapture single-release survival estimates for steelhead passing the RSW ranged from 0.95 to 1.00. The RSW appeared to be an effective bypass structure compared with other routes of fish passage at the dam.

Herein, we firstly introduce the combination of ultrasound and Fe₃O₄/CNTs as an alternative strategy to enhance coagulation for the removal of Microcystis aeruginosa cells in water. It remarkably enhanced cyanobacterial cell removal and microcystins control, compared with sonication alone (40 kHz ultrasonic bath, 4.2 mJ mL⁻¹). 94.4% cyanobacterial cells were removed using 20 second sonication with 20 mg L⁻¹ Fe₃O₄/CNTs, Al₂(SO₄)₃ coagulation (20 μM). Both sonication time and catalyst dose significantly influenced the cyanobacterial removal. Ultrasound with Fe₃O₄/CNTs only induced a slight increase of cell permeability, which may contribute to the effective control of DOC and microcystins' release in water. The enhanced settlement of the cyanobacterial cells may result from the moderate oxidation on the cell surface. This study suggested a novel ultrasound-Fe₃O₄/CNT process to promote cyanobacteria removal with efficient DOC and microcystin release control, which is a green and safe technology for drinking water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrocystis aeruginosa 3aalgicides 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acoagulation 3amicrocystins 3aoxidation 3apermeability 3apollution 3asonication 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aXu, Guofeng1 aWang, Juanjuan0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 02, v. 10, no. 23 p.13525-13531dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra01530j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245017800163300002000341520113400361592002801495650002201523650001101545650002701556650002301583650001501606650002001621650002001641700001501661700001601676773012301692856008201815852000901897655001201906IND60563013720221118063111.0170209e20161222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b103442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bai-jian10aTheoretical Investigation of Regioselectivity and Stereoselectivity in AIBN/HSnBu3-Mediated Radical Cyclization of N-(2-Iodo-4,6-dimethylphenyl)-N,2-dimethyl-(2E)-butenamide  ap. 12950-12958.  aIn this study, we employed the density functional method to simulate AIBN/HSnBu₃-mediated radical cyclizations with different axially chiral conformers of N-(2-iodo-4,6-dimethylphenyl)-N,2-dimethyl-(2E)-butenamide as substrates. We constructed a reaction potential energy profile using the Gibbs free energies of the located stationary points. The thermodynamic and kinetic data of the profile were further used to evaluate the regioselectivity, stereoselectivity, and product distribution of the cyclizations. Additionally, we compared the present HSnBu₃-mediated radical cyclization with the experimentally available Heck reaction and found that such a radical cyclization can convert (M,Z) and (P,Z) o-iodoanilide substrates to centrally chiral products with high chirality transfer. The goal of this study was to estimate the practicality of theoretically predicting the memory of chirality in such radical cyclizations. The present results can provide a strategy from a theoretical viewpoint for experimentally synthesizing highly stereoselective carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds using radical cyclization methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aenergy 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aphysical chemistry 3aprediction 3astereochemistry 3astereoisomerism1 aZhong, Hua1 aYu, Hai-tao0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Dec. 22, v. 120, no. 50 p.12950-12958dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b103443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245018900175500001900364520188100383592002802264650001202292650001602304650001602320650002602336650003602362650002602398650002502424650002102449650001502470650001902485650004402504653003102548653002502579653003602604653002402640653001902664700002502683700001702708700006302725700002202788773011902810856008802929852000903017655001203026IND60709369220221116144138.0210624e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoh, Yan Ni Annie10aComparison of soluble microbial product (SMP) production in full-scale anaerobic/aerobic industrial wastewater treatment and a laboratory based synthetic feed anaerobic membrane system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study focused on the characterisation of soluble microbial products (SMPs) produced from a full-scale multi-stage (anaerobic/aerobic) industrial wastewater treatment plant, and contrasted them to the SMPs detected in the effluent of a lab-scale AnMBR treating synthetic wastewater to determine if there were any common solutes detected irrespective of the feed organics. Recently developed analytical methods using gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and liquid chromatography coupled quadrupole-time-of-flight (LC-Q-ToF) for SMP characterisation in a wide molecular weight (MW) range of 30–2000 Da (Da) were applied. Samples collected from the Industrial Wastewater plant were the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) influent and effluent, and aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluent before discharge. The GC–MS detected a spike in cyclooctasulphur in the UASB effluent, an indicator of shock-loading, which disappeared after the MBR process. Alkanes, acids and nitrogenous compounds were found to be the end-products from the GC–MS results, while LC-Q-ToF analysis revealed that eicosanoids, a group of cell-signalling molecules, were produced in the aerobic MBR, and made up 71% of its effluent. A comparison of the submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAMBR) and aerobic MBR effluents using GC–MS showed that there was only a small degree of similarity between the SMPs, comprising mainly long chain alkanes and phthalate. On the other hand, LC-Q-ToF showed a large contrast in compound composition, mostly having cell-signalling functions, which deepened our understanding of the different metabolic processes occurring in aerobic and anaerobic systems. These data could be useful for future work in various areas such as controlling quorum-sensing and biofilm formation, process optimisation and control, and microbial ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3aeicosanoids 3aenvironment 3aindustrial wastewater 3aindustrial wastewater treatment 3aliquid chromatography 3amembrane bioreactors 3amolecular weight 3aphthalates 3aquorum sensing 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 0aSoluble microbial products 0aBiological treatment 0aUpflow anaerobic sludge blanket 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aSynthetic feed1 aKunacheva, Chinagarn1 aMenon, Suren1 aWebster, Richard D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0896-19601 aStuckey, David C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 754 p.142173-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245012500165300001600290520104900306592002801355650001701383650002001400650002701420650001401447650001401461650001401475650001201489650001601501650001701517653002301534653001701557653001801574653001301592653002201605653002501627700001501652700002101667700001501688773011101703856008701814852000901901655001201910IND60585828520221121224603.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, L.10aImproving the emulsifying properties of whey protein isolate-citrus pectin blends by a novel reactive extrusion approach  ap. 175-188.  aIn this study we used a new experimental setup to improve the emulsifying capacity of whey protein isolate-citrus pectin (WPI-HMCP) blends during extrusion processing. In this setup, the extruder serves as pump, while the reaction takes place mainly in a 380 mm long slit die which is attached at the end of the extruder. Using this setup, it is possible to improve the emulsifying capacity of WPI-HMCP blends: The Sauter mean diameter of emulsions stabilized by the extruded blends could be reduced compared to those stabilized by the untreated blend. The smallest Sauter mean diameter was measured when the WPI-HMCP blend was treated at 120 °C for 46 s residence time in the reaction die (corresponding to a total mass flow rate of 19.4 kg/h). It was halved compared to the untreated blend. Structural analyses of the reaction products showed that at constant reaction die temperature and increasing total mass flow rate the formation of disulfide bonds is favored, while the formation of non-disulfide covalent cross-links is inhibited.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adisulfide bonds 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3aextrusion 3amass flow 3apectins 3atemperature 3awhey protein 0aReactive extrusion 0aWhey protein 0aCitrus pectin 0aEmulsion 0aMaillard reaction 0aCovalent cross-links1 aHummel, L.1 aSchuchmann, H.P.1 aEmin, M.A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2018 Apr., v. 223 p.175-188dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2017.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009700175300001600272520168100288592002801969650001501997650001502012650001502027650001702042650002802059650002202087650001102109650003102120650001502151650001102166650002302177650002202200650001102222650001402233650001602247650001002263650001102273651001102284653000902295653000802304653001002312653000902322653000802331653000802339653000702347653000802354653000802362653000802370653000802378653000802386653000802394653000902402653001002411653002002421653001302441653001702454653001002471653001802481700002602499700001902525700002802544773008902572856008402661852000902745655001202754IND60544843820221120022353.0160901e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.09.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrianou, Xanthi D.10aSpatial and seasonal variability of urinary trihalomethanes concentrations in urban settings  ap. 289-295.  aA complex network of sources and routes of exposure to disinfection by-products (DBP), such as trihalomethanes (THM) has been driving the wide variability of daily THM intake estimates in environmental epidemiological studies. We hypothesized that the spatiotemporal variability of THM exposures could be differentially expressed with their urinary levels among residents whose households are geographically clustered in district-metered areas (DMA) receiving the same tap water. Each DMA holds unique drinking-water pipe network characteristics, such as pipe length, number of pipe leaking incidences, number of water meters by district, average minimum night flow and average daily demand. The present study assessed the spatial and seasonal variability in urinary THM levels among residents (n=310) of geocoded households belonging to two urban DMA of Nicosia, Cyprus, with contrasting water network properties. First morning urine voids were collected once in summer and then in winter. Results showed that the mean sum of the four urinary THM analytes (TTHM) was significantly higher during summer for residents of both areas. Linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, season and gender, illustrated spatially-resolved differences in creatinine-adjusted urinary chloroform and TTHM levels between the two studied areas, corroborated by differences observed in their pipe network characteristics. Additional research is warranted to shed light on the contribution of spatially-resolved and geographically-clustered environmental exposures coupled with internal biomarker of exposure measurements towards better understanding of health disparities within urban centers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abyproducts 3achloroform 3adisinfection 3aepidemiological studies 3aexposure pathways 3agender 3agene expression regulation 3ahouseholds 3amodels 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial variation 3asummer 3atap water 3aurban areas 3aurine 3awinter 3aCyprus 0aBDCM 0aBMI 0aBrTHM 0aDBCM 0aDBP 0aDMA 0aGM 0aICC 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aTBM 0aTCM 0aTHM 0aTTHM 0aUDWDS 0aTrihalomethanes 0aExposure 0aDisinfection 0aUrban 0aMixed effects1 aCharisiadis, Pantelis1 aAndra, Syam S.1 aMakris, Konstantinos C.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Nov., v. 135 p.289-295dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001400159245006700173300001600240500002000256500000900276500001500285520142000300592002801720596002001748650001701768650000901785650001301794650000701807650001801814700001801832773014801850852000901998856009602007655001202103IND2046524420221119094206.0220514e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204652442DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900020023x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeren, R.14aThe Role of Edge Surfaces in Flocculation of 2:1 Clay Minerals  ap. 430-435.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of pH on the flocculation, settling rate, and gel volume of pyrophyllite in dilute suspension was studied in solutions of various NaNO₃ concentrations to evaluate the role of the edge surfaces in particle‐particle interaction. The critical flocculation concentration (CFC) increased with increasing pH, being 1.6 × 10⁻⁴, 4 × 10⁻⁴, 1.5 × 10⁻³, 9.5 × 10⁻³, 1.6 × 10⁻², and 0.1 molc L⁻¹ at pH 3.2, 4.4, 5.3, 6.0, 7.4, 8.5, and 10.2, respectively. The CFC increased significantly in the presence of small amounts of sodium hexametaphosphate in the suspension. The changes in CFC from low values in the absence of the polymer to higher values in the presence of it support the hypothesis that the edge surfaces are involved in particle‐particle interactions. The settling rate of the clay particles at pH 8.5 increased as the electrolyte concentration was decreased. The effect of electrolyte concentration on settling rate was explained by the presence of an electrical field associated with the edge surfaces. The gel volume, after reaching a stable volume, increased with the increasing of electrolyte concentration. This increase in water content, indicating an open structure of clay platelets, also supports the hypothesis that edge surfaces are associated with clay flocculation. The electrical field associated with the edge surface also has an effect on the gel volume.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Borax Corp 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3asurfaces 3apH 3awater content1 aSparks, D.

Lipid peroxidation (LP) was also determined as an indicator of oxidative stress. The data from different procedures were compared and analysed by multivariate techniques (correlation matrix calculation and principal component analysis (PCA)). Significant positive correlations were obtained between TPC, ACC and DPPH, NO, O₂ ⁻, and OH antiradical powers, and also between PRAC and TPC, ACC and FRAP. PCA found two major clusters of cornelian cherry, based on antiradical power, FRAP and PRAC and also on chemical composition. Chemometric evaluation showed close interdependence between PRAC method and FRAP and ACC. There was a huge variation between C. mas genotypes in terms of antioxidant activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCornus mas 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical composition 3acherries 3aethanol 3agenotype 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aprincipal component analysis 2aAnthocyaninsxchemistry 2aAntioxidantsxchemistry 2aGenotype 2aManganese Compoundsxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidesxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPrunusxchemistryxgenetics.1 aŠtajner, Dubravka1 aSlavko, Kevrešan1 aSandra, Bijelić0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 134, no. 2 p.734-741dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.1703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245014600167300001600313520161200329592002801941653000901969653001401978653002701992653001702019653003002036700001202066700001302078700001702091700001602108773010302124856008702227852000902314655001202323IND60594055120221118114600.0180510e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059405512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fan10aNicotinamide-assisted fabrication of high-stability gold-palladium nanoparticles on carbon fiber cloth for hydrogen peroxide electroreduction  ap. 199-205.  aBimetallic nanoparticles with excellent activity and stability have been widely studied as H2O2 electroreduction catalysts. Hereby, we have successfully found a green fabrication of high-stability Au-Pd nanoparticles directly supported on carbon fiber cloth (Au-Pd NPs/CFC) by using tobacco extract (nicotinamide) as a simple and ecofriendly reducing agent. Transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analyses and high angle annular dark field scanning TEM are performed to characterize the morphology, composition and structure of the as-prepared electrode. Results show that alloy nanoparticles prepared with different mole ratios of HAuCl4/PdCl2 mixtures in the wide range of 10–100nm have a uniform distribution on every carbon fiber, presenting a regular circle shape. The 3D electrode is directly applied as the electrocatalyst for H2O2 reduction in acid solution and does not introduce into any polymer binders. The catalytic performance is investigated by chronoamperometry and voltammetry, exhibiting desired catalytic performance and improved utilization than other representative nanomaterials recently reported. Furthermore, Au-Pd NPs do not aggregate after the whole test due to the effect of in-situ immobilization, showing a great significance for the application in fuel cells. A direct peroxide-peroxide fuel cell (DPPFC) using Au-Pd NPs/CFC cathode with Ni/Ni-foam anode acquires a maximum power density of 22.8mWcm⁻². Electrochemical stability test through long-term potential cycles (>9h) further confirms the high durability of the electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGold 0aPalladium 0aIn-situ immobilization 0aNicotinamide 0aPeroxide electroreduction1 aCao, Bo1 aTao, Yue1 aCao, Dianxue1 aZhang, Ying0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.199-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009800157520198500255592002802240650004102268650002002309650002902329650001102358650001902369650002102388650002102409650001302430650001902443650000902462650001102471650001902482650001702501650001502518651001002533700001702543700001602560773011902576856007302695852000902768655001202777IND60653377420221119070037.0190714e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337742DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shanshan10aEffects of Climate Change and Human Activities on Soil Erosion in the Xihe River Basin, China  aClimate change and human activities are the major factors affecting runoff and sediment load. We analyzed the inter-annual variation trends of the annual rainfall, air temperature, runoff and sediment load in the Xihe River Basin from 1969&ndash;2015. Pettitt&rsquo;s test and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were used to detect sudden changes in hydro-meteorological variables and simulate the basin hydrological cycle, respectively. According to the simulation results, we explored spatial distribution of soil erosion in the watershed by utilizing ArcGIS10.0, analyzed the average soil erosion modulus by different types of land use, and quantified the contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff and sediment load in changes. The results showed that: (1) From 1969&ndash;2015, both rainfall and air temperature increased, and air temperature increased significantly (p < 0.01) at 0.326 &deg;C/10 a (annual). Runoff and sediment load decreased, and sediment load decreased significantly (p < 0.01) at 1.63 &times; 105 t/10 a. In 1988, air temperature experienced a sudden increased and sediment load decreased. (2) For runoff, R2 and Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (Ens) were 0.92 and 0.91 during the calibration period and 0.90 and 0.87 during the validation period, for sediment load, R2 and Ens were 0.60 and 0.55 during the calibration period and 0.70 and 0.69 during the validation period, meeting the model&rsquo;s applicability requirements. (3) Soil erosion was worse in the upper basin than other regions, and highest in cultivated land. Climate change exacerbates runoff and sediment load with overall contribution to the total change of &minus;26.54% and &minus;8.8%, respectively. Human activities decreased runoff and sediment load with overall contribution to the total change of 126.54% and 108.8% respectively. The variation of runoff and sediment load in the Xihe River Basin is largely caused by human activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aair temperature 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3aclimate change 3ahydrologic cycle 3ahydrometeorology 3aland use 3apollution load 3arain 3arunoff 3asediment yield 3asoil erosion 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aZhu, Zhengru1 aLyu, Leting0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008800173300001600261520166100277592002801938650001801966650001301984650002101997650002202018650001902040650000902059650001002068650001102078650001502089650001902104650001402123650001402137651001402151653000902165653001302174653002102187653001502208653002902223773010702252856008502359852000902444655001202453IND60573718920221119033046.0170724e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371892DNAL7 a10.1080/10402381.2017.12877892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, William F.10aPhosphorus binding dynamics in the aluminum floc layer of Half Moon Lake, Wisconsin  ap. 130-142.  aJames WF. 2017. Phosphorus binding dynamics in the aluminum floc layer of Half Moon Lake, Wisconsin. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:130–142. Half Moon Lake is a shallow oxbow located in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Eutrophic to hypereutrophic conditions and cyanobacteria blooms driven primarily by sediment internal phosphorus (P) loading led to a buffered aluminum sulfate treatment in 2011. Aluminum (Al) dosage was based on the redox-sensitive P (redox-P) concentration in the upper 4 cm sediment layer. The west arm was treated with 150 g/m ² to sequester 1 to 5 mg/g redox-P while the east arm was treated with 75 g/m ² to bind an order of magnitude lower redox-P concentration (0.15 mg/g). Four years after treatment, the Al floc layer was positioned on top of the original sediment surface due to density differences between sediment and the Al floc. Rather than sinking or mixing into the sediment, P binding has occurred primarily via upward diffusive P flux into the Al floc layer. Changes in vertical P profiles over time suggested that the Al floc in the western arm has bound only ∼60% of this upward diffusive P flux, whereas the other portion has become associated with Fe and now potentially contributes to the lake P budget through redox-driven recycling pathways. The east arm Al floc layer has sequestered ∼90% of the much lower upward diffusive P flux. Laboratory-derived anaerobic diffusive P fluxes in the west arm have increased from near 0 in 2011 to ∼3.7 mg/m ² d in 2015. P binding inefficiency may be attributed to Al polymerization to a more ordered crystalline structure over time in the absence of exposure to sediment P.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aaluminum 3aaluminum sulfate 3acrystal structure 3aeutrophication 3airon 3alakes 3amixing 3aphosphorus 3apolymerization 3arecycling 3asediments 3aWisconsin 0aAlum 0aaluminum 0adiffusive P flux 0aphosphorus 0aphosphorus fractionation0 tLake and reservoir management.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 33, no. 2 p.130-142dTaylor & Francisx2151-55307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2017.12877893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002500157245009000182300001600272520122500288592002801513650001001541650001301551650001701564653000901581653001801590653001501608653003001623700002101653773011301674856009201787852000901879655001201888IND60536694920221119143855.0190412e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumhála, František10aBulk properties of densified hop cones related to storage and throughput measurements  ap. 123-128.  aHop is one of the most important materials for beer production. Nevertheless the material density of hop is little known even though this information is needed for the harvesting, processing and storage of the hop cones. To fill this gap in knowledge, densification experiments were carried out during 2013 harvesting season with wet and dry hop cones of different varieties. It was shown that for hop cones of all varieties in dry state that pressure increased with increasing material density. In a wet state, Sladek and Vital varieties showed different behaviour. Higher initial densities meant greater hardness of those two varieties. The densification process caused significant increase in the densification curve slope at the initial and final points. The initial slope was very high for the Sladek and Vital varieties in a wet state. Resulting pressure values were statistically different for most of the tested varieties. The differences in densification parameters were in all cases transferred from the wet to dry states. Differences found between varieties can significantly influence hop material throughput during harvesting as well as the behaviour of hop cones during post-harvest processing and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3ahardness 3aharvest date 0aHops 0aDensification 0aHarvesting 0aPost-harvest technologies1 aBlahovec, Jiří0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Oct., v. 126 p.123-128dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011800173300001800291500001900309520078800328536023701116592002801353596007101381650002401452650001301476650002701489650001501516650002701531650001001558650001501568650001401583650000901597650001301606650001401619650001201633650001201645650002301657653001401680653002701694653002301721653002101744653002201765653002801787700002101815700002101836700002101857773013901878856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60722642120221122154316.0210106e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264212DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2020.18561352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspinoza, Luis A.10aChemical, microbial and sensory properties of a chestnut and milk ice cream with improved healthy characteristics  ap. 2271-2294.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWith the aim of revalorization of two productions of economic relevance (milk and chestnuts), a novel ice cream was formulated incorporating milk, chestnut flour and chestnut bits.

A general preference of the tasters was observed for the formulations containing sucrose over those made with the hypocaloric sweetener.  aAuthor Luis Alfredo Espinoza acknowledges the Government of Perú for the financial support through the Programa Nacional de Becas y Crédito Educativo (PRONABEC) (Resolución 099-2013-PRONABEC-OBEC-VMGI-MED de 27 de marzo de 2013).  aPublisher supplied data  aResolución 099-2013-PRONABEC-OBEC-VMGI-MED de 27 de marzo de 2013 3aCaesalpinia spinosa 3aCastanea 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aerythritol 3afatty acid composition 3aflour 3aglycosides 3aice cream 3amilk 3amilk fat 3aolive oil 3asteviol 3asucrose 3avolatile compounds 0achestnuts 0ahealthier formulations 0afatty acid profile 0avolatile profile 0amicrobial quality 0asensory characteristics1 aPurriños, Laura1 aCenteno, Juan A.1 aCarballo, Javier0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 23, no. 1 p.2271-2294dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2020.18561353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01498naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100001700153245006000170300001600230520073600246592002800982650002001010700001601030773011901046852000901165856008201174655001201256991620947260742620221121061749.0181030e197408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490888972DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517574044008092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRattee, I.D.12aA Novel Method of Polymerizing Acrylic Monomers on Wool  ap. 600-605.  aIt has been found that acrylic monomers may be readily and selectively polymerized inside wool fibers in the presence of peroxydisulphates by the use of cupric and other transition metal ions in the higher valency state. The process has the advantage of producing high polymer "add on" values at any pH between 2 and 10 or higher without the need for oxygen exclusion or special reducing agents. Wool whiteness may be preserved by the addition of formaldehyde, while induction time effects can be controlled by the addition of sodium metabisulphite. The treated wool may be dyed with selected basic dyes suitable for dyeing acrylic fibers to give brilliant shades with a light fastness comparable with that obtained on such fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal products1 aSingh, G.S.0 tTextile research journal.g1974 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.600-605dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517574044008093Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02876naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009300170520146500263592002801728650002201756650001601778650002401794650001001818650002701828650002101855650001301876650004301889650001401932653001101946653003201957653001901989653002302008653001502031700001802046700002102064700001902085700001902104700001802123700005602141700001602197773011202213856008402325852000902409655001202418IND60761102420221119183859.0220124e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076110242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2021.1536032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawochar, Md Abu10aSuppression of the tonoplast sugar transporter StTST3.2 improves quality of potato chips  aWhich sugar transporter regulates sugar accumulation in tubers is largely unknown. Accumulation of reducing sugar (RS) in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers negatively affects the quality of tubers undergoing the frying process. However, little is known about the genes involved in regulating RS content in tubers at harvest. Here, we have identified two tonoplast sugar transporter (TST) 3-type isoforms (StTST3.1 and StTST3.2) in potato. Quantitative real-time PCR results indicate that StTST3.1 and StTST3.2 possess distinct expression patterns in various potato tissues. StTST3.2 was found to be the expressed TST3-type isoform in tubers. Further subcellular localization analysis revealed that StTST3.2 was targeted to the tonoplast. Silencing of StTST3.2 in potato by stable transformation resulted in significantly lower RS content in tubers at harvest or after room temperature storage, suggesting StTST3.2 plays an important role in RS accumulation in tubers. Accordingly, compared with the unsilenced control, potato chips processed from StTST3.2-silenced tubers exhibited lighter color and dramatically decreased acrylamide production at harvest or after room temperature storage. In addition, we demonstrated that silencing of StTST3.2 has no significant effect on potato growth and development. Thus, suppression of StTST3.2 could be another effective approach for improving processing quality and decreasing acrylamide content in potato tubers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aacrylamides 3aambient temperature 3acolor 3agrowth and development 3aplant physiology 3apotatoes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atonoplast 0aPotato 0aTonoplast sugar transporter 0aReducing sugar 0aProcessing quality 0aAcrylamide1 aCheng, Yunxia1 aBegum, Shahnewaz1 aWang, Enshuang1 aZhou, Tingting1 aLiu, Tiantian1 aLiu, Tengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3640-46831 aSong, Botao0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2022 Feb., v. 269 p.153603-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2021.1536033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011500160300001400275500001400289520166000303592002801963650002401991650001302015650000902028650001702037650000902054653001102063653001302074653001202087700001502099700001702114700001702131773014202148856007302290852000902363655001202372IND60723078020221121075530.0210112e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072307802DNAL7 a10.3920/CEP2000322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTranquille, C.A.12aA descriptive study quantifying warm-up patterns in elite and non-elite dressage horses in a field environment  ap. 35-41.  aNAL-light  aThere is very little reported information on the content of the warm-up period in dressage horses. Our objective was to quantify warm-up content, patterns and duration in a simulated competition (field) environment in British dressage horses. Twelve elite (Group A) and 20 non-elite (Group B) mixed-breed dressage horses, all ridden by advanced level riders, were assessed. Riders warmed-up as they would normally for a competition prior to completing a test. The warm-up was videoed and assessed retrospectively. Total duration, time spent in the different paces, and on which rein, was recorded, along with information on which movements were performed, and the head and neck position. Appropriate statistical tests were used to compare variables between groups. Mean warm-up duration, time in walk and trot did not differ between groups, however Group A horses spent significantly more time in canter than Group B horses (P=0.0024). Group A horses also spent significantly more time in collected and extended paces, and performing advanced movements than Group B horses (P≤0.0421 for all variables). There was no difference in time spent on the left and right rein in either group. Results provide novel information on the warm-up content in a competition (field) environment for dressage horses. The findings indicate that that the content of the warm-up of elite and non-elite dressage horses was significantly different, with elite horses warming up for longer, spending more time in canter, performing more changes within paces and advanced movements. Dressage horses appear to warm-up more symmetrically than has been reported in jumping horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3adescriptive studies 3aexercise 3ahead 3amixed breeds 3aneck 0aequine 0adressage 0awarm-up1 aClarke, J.1 aWalker, V.A.1 aMurray, R.C.0 tComparative exercise physiology.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 17, no. 1 p.35-41dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000061x1755-25597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/CEP2000323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245010900172300001600281520131100297592002801608653001901636653001901655653001601674653001601690653002501706700001801731700001401749700001701763700001401780773010301794856008701897852000901984655001201993IND60594055520221118114614.0180510e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059405552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xiaojuan10aPreparation of polypyrrole nanocomposites for supercapacitor using spent battery powder as raw materials  ap. 646-654.  aA strategy has been developed to prepare conductive polymer-based nanocomposites as the electrode materials for supercapacitor with spent battery powder (SBP) as raw materials. Thus the waste resources from power could be sustainably recycled for new energy storage devices. The SBP containing manganese dioxide (MnO2) and graphite powder was obtained from the spent zinc-carbon battery, in which MnO2 was utilized for the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole. The binary graphite/polypyrrole (G/PPy) and ternary MnO2/graphite/polypyrrole (MnO2/G/PPy) nanocomposites were obtained under different reaction conditions, such as hydrochloric acid concentration, MnO2/pyrrole molar ratio, sodium p-toluene sulfonate (p-TSNa)/pyrrole molar ratio, and acid solution volume. The results showed that the electrochemical properties of the G/PPy nanocomposites were better than those of the MnO2/G/PPy. Under the optimized preparation condition (100mL of 1.5mol/L HCl with 0.03mol/L pyrrole, and MnO2/pyrrole/p-TSNa molar ratio of 1:1:1), the G/PPy nanocomposite possessed a relatively high Coulombic efficiency, a high electrical conductivity of 20.0S/cm, and the highest specific capacitance of 212.4F/g at 1mV/s scan rate tested by CV, as well as a retention of 89.5% of its original capacitance after 1000 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEnergy storage 0asupercapacitor 0apower waste 0apolypyrrole 0aspent battery powder1 aDeng, Jinxing1 aWang, Xue1 aGuo, Jinshan1 aLiu, Peng0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.646-654dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100001900173245011400192300001600306500002400322520170500346650002002051650001102071650001302082650001902095650001902114650001202133650001102145650002602156650001802182650002302200650002402223650002302247650001402270650002502284650001702309650001102326650001302337650001102350650002702361650001002388650001402398651001002412700001402422700002002436700001702456700001702473700001702490700001802507700001402525773010802539852000902647856008702656930003302743945002502776946001102801655001202812IND4387615820221118042611.0070206e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438761582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ100 0aF6001 aTagliavini, M.10aNutrient recycling during the decomposition of apple leaves (Malus domestica) and mowed grasses in an orchard  ap. 191-200.  aIncludes references  aEach year, significant fractions of nutrients absorbed by trees and orchard grasses, return to the soil by abscised leaves and mowed biomass. Using litter bag technique and labelled (15N) litter, we assessed the decay dynamics and the related nutrient releases in a mature, drip irrigated, apple (Malus domestica) orchard located in the Eastern Po Valley (Italy) on a silty clay loam soil. Litter bags containing abscised apple leaves were placed in December 2001 on the soil surface and collected over a 2-year period, while the decomposition of perennial ryegrass was studied over a 6-month period from May 2002. The dynamics of mass and C losses from decomposing apple leaves fitted to a single exponential decay model. At 1 year from their placement, about 50% of original mass was lost, while and additional 20% was not recovered in the second year. Initial C losses were not accompanied by degradation of cellulose which started only in the spring of the year after their placement on the soil. Along with the decomposition process, the remaining litter was progressively enriched in lignin-like compounds. Net N and S immobilization occurred during the winter-spring period and net release of these nutrients occurred only in the second year. Ryegrass lost about half their mass and original N content after 6 weeks and most of sward derived N was recovered in the underneath soil volume. Both apple and ryegrass released most their initial K content during the period of decomposition. The knowledge of the dynamics of nutrient release on the orchard floor will be useful for predicting nutrient availability for tree uptake and therefore for managing amounts and dynamics of nutrient supply. 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3aorchards 3abiodegradation 3asoil fertility 3agrasses 3aleaves 3anutrient availability 3aorchard soils 3aseasonal variation 3amathematical models 3adry matter content 3acellulose 3achemical degradation 3aplant litter 3alignin 3anitrogen 3asulfur 3aimmobilization in soil 3asward 3apotassium 3aItaly1 aTonon, G.1 aScandellari, F.1 aQuinones, A.1 aPalmieri, S.1 aMenarbin, G.1 aGiocchini, P.1 aMasia, A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2007 Jan., v. 118, no. 1-4 p.191-200dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.05.0183Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02744naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100001500155245007200170300001600242500002400258520126000282650001901542650001601561650001201577650002001589650002501609650002301634650003601657650001201693650002201705650002301727650002601750650002301776650002101799650001101820650001301831650002401844650002101868700001601889700001901905700001601924700001301940773010801953852000902061856008702070930003302157945002502190946001102215655001202226IND4387615020221118042454.0070206e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438761502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aWanner, H.10aTracking parasitoids with the stable isotope 44Ca in agroecosystems  ap. 143-148.  aIncludes references  aHabitat management influences spatial and temporal distribution of parasitoids in farmland. The current work evaluates, for the first time, the potential of a novel marking technique using a calcium stable isotope (44Ca) under field conditions. In two subsequent trials, 44Ca-enriched Cotesia glomerata parasitoids were released into an organically managed cabbage field in a region known to harbor natural populations of this species. The trap plants infested with Pieris brassicae host larvae were distributed in the trial areas and collected 3 days after parasitoid release. Parasitism by released wasps was determined through calcium isotope analysis of the recovered caterpillars using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The spatial habitat use by female parasitoids was determined based on marked caterpillars on the trap plants. Both trials yielded relatively consistent results, showing that C. glomerata females dispersed over at least 50 m within 3 days. The total proportion of caterpillars parasitized by the marked wasps amounted to 32.4 and 24.4%, respectively, with no statistically significant difference. The potential of this approach for field investigations on habitat management and biological control is discussed. 3aagroecosystems 3aparasitoids 3acalcium 3astable isotopes 3aspatial distribution 3atemporal variation 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3acabbage 3aCotesia glomerata 3abeneficial insects 3afield experimentation 3aorganic production 3aPieris brassicae 3alarvae 3ahabitats 3aexperimental design 3aisotope labeling1 aGu, Huanan.1 aHattendorf, B.1 aGunther, D.1 aDorn, S.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2007 Jan., v. 118, no. 1-4 p.143-148dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.05.0053Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03036naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072001700154072001700171100001700188245012800205300001600333500002400349500001500373520125500388650001501643650004401658650001701702650002701719650002201746650003301768650001401801650001801815650001301833650001501846650001401861650004501875650002401920650002001944653001701964653001301981653001201994653001302006700001602019700001402035700001102049700001502060700001702075700002002092700001702112773011802129852000902247856005902256856003802315930003302353945002502386946001102411655001202422IND4387615220221118042510.0070206e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438761522DNAL7 a170199332pmid7 a10.1002/pca.9212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The chemical composition of propolis is highly variable and its quality is often controlled on the basis of one or two marker compounds. In order to progress towards a method for the quality control of this complex material, HPLC and ¹H-NMR approaches as methods of quality control have been compared. HPLC analyses of 43 samples of propolis were carried out and six marker compounds were quantified in each sample. The same samples were analysed using ¹H-NMR and the spectra were then converted into their first derivative forms and digitised using the software application MestRe-C. The digitised data were subjected to principal component analysis using the software application Simca-P. It was found that the chemical composition of propolis mapped well according to the geographical origins of the samples studied when the first three principal components were used to display them. In addition, each sample was assessed for anti-oxidant activity, and the results were then overlaid onto the sample groupings according to ¹H-NMR data. It was observed that anti-oxidant properties also mapped quite well according to geographical origin. 3anaringenin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3acaffeic acid 3ageographical variation 3achemical analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3aflavonols 3acinnamic acid 3apropolis 3aprovenance 2aGeography 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aPropolisxchemistry 2aQuality Control 0apinocembrine 0aflavones 0achrysin 0acalangin1 aPeyfoon, E.1 aZheng, L.1 aLu, D.1 aSeidel, V.1 aJohnston, B.1 aParkinson, J.A.1 aFearnley, J.0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2006 , v. 17, no. 5 p.323-331dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.9213electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.921  a20070312b20070402c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03296naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100001500155245011200170300001600282500002400298520183200322650002102154650001102175650001802186650002002204650001502224650002802239650000902267650002402276650002402300650002202324650002302346650002102369650002202390650002602412651001202438653001902450700002202469700001702491700002102508773010802529852000902637856008702646930003302733945002502766946001102791655001202802IND4387615120221118042606.0070206e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438761512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aEvrard, O.10aEffectiveness of erosion mitigation measures to prevent muddy floods: A case study in the Belgian loam belt  ap. 149-158.  aIncludes references  aDuring the previous decade, 68% of the municipalities in the Belgian loam belt have been confronted with muddy floods from agricultural catchments after intense rainfall. A muddy flood means that runoff concentrates in a dry valley causing damage to infrastructure and housing property downstream. A typical problem area is the village of Velm where a permanent river is constrained by a culvert designed to accommodate its peak discharge. However, the design of the culvert does not take the local flooding from seven dry valleys just upstream into account. This study focuses on peak discharge from one of these agricultural catchments (ca. 300 ha). The Meshed Hydrological Model (MHM) is used to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures to reduce flooding. Seasonal variation of soil cover in cropland and difference in land use patterns, i.e. before and after land consolidation is explicitly taken into account. The land cover spatial pattern was mapped at regular intervals during 2003. The largest potential of runoff generation occurs in December, and therefore represents a worst-case scenario. Mitigation measures implemented after the extreme event of August 2002 (i.e. a 12 ha grassed waterway and a retention dam in the thalweg) alleviate the flooding risk in Velm. The model simulates a peak discharge and a runoff volume reduction of more than 40%. The retention pond would buffer the generated runoff volume entirely for the worst-case scenario. Land consolidation carried out in the 1970s has led to an increase in peak discharge by 33% and in runoff volume by 19%. The major role played by a new consolidation road built in the thalweg on runoff concentration is highlighted. Implementation of additional soil conservation measures is therefore needed to limit runoff generation within the catchment. 3awater management 3afloods 3awater erosion 3aerosion control 3aloam soils 3aagricultural watersheds 3arain 3aagricultural runoff 3avegetated waterways 3ahydrologic models 3aseasonal variation 3avegetation cover 3aspatial variation 3adisaster preparedness 3aBelgium 0apeak discharge1 aPersoons, Ernest.1 aVandaele, K.1 aWesemael, B. van0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2007 Jan., v. 118, no. 1-4 p.149-158dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.02.0193Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02426naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001400167245010800181300001600289500002400305520109500329650001701424650002001441650002201461650002601483650002101509650002301530651001001553653002401563653004701587700001701634700001601651700001301667700001501680700001501695773010301710852000901813856008901822930003301911945002501944946001101969655001201980IND4387612420221118042430.0070206e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438761242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2006.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ501 0aQ1011 aAprea, E.10aAssessment of Trentingrana cheese ageing by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry and chemometrics  ap. 226-234.  aIncludes references  aProton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) data have been analysed by chemometric techniques to monitor cheese ageing by means of on-line direct head-space gas analysis. Twenty cheese loaves of Trentingrana, a trademarked cheese produced in northern Italy, of different origin and ripening degree, were sampled over the whole Trentingrana production area. An increase of the spectral intensity with ripening has been observed for most of the PTR-MS peaks and a univariate analysis identified 16 mass peaks that were significantly different for ripened and young cheeses, respectively. Moreover, the usefulness of different discriminant analyses and class modelling techniques have been investigated. Discriminant Partial Least Squares analysis, while indicating average behaviour and possible outliers, was not able to correctly classify all samples. Soft class modelling performed better and allowed a 100% correct classification. Partial least square calibration predicted the ageing time of each loaf with reasonable accuracy with a maximum cross-validation error of 3.5 months. 3aGrana cheese 3acheese ripening 3amass spectrometry 3adiscriminant analysis 3afood composition 3aheadspace analysis 3aItaly 0aTrentingrana cheese 0aproton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry1 aBiasioli, F.1 aGasperi, F.1 aMott, D.1 aMarini, F.1 aMark, T.D.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2007 Mar., v. 17, no. 3 p.226-234dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2006.02.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090513b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03926naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175072001700192100001300209245018500222300001600407520203800423650002002461650002002481650001002501650002102511650002102532650001402553650002002567650002602587650001202613650004802625650005002673650002102723650002402744650001102768650002802779650002802807650002502835650006902860650002602929650000902955650005502964650003503019700001603054700001703070700001703087773007303104852000903177856007903186930003303265945002503298946001303323655001203336IND4372370820221118042118.0050718e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437237082DNAL7 a157429652pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.2.2832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Groups 1 and 2 were fasted for 48 h posthatch; groups 3 and 4 were fasted for 48 h followed by ad libitum access to a 1% glutamine (Gln) diet; groups 5 and 6 had ad libitum access to a common diet; groups 7 and 8 had access to a 1% Gln diet posthatch; groups 9 and 10 were fed regular Oasis hatchling supplement; and groups 11 and 12 were fed Oasis sprayed with 1% Gln for the first 48 h posthatch. The birds in treatment groups 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12 were vaccinated with Eimeria maxima posthatch, and all birds were orally challenged with high dose E. maxima on d 22. During the first 2 wk, birds in group 7 had the highest gain and feed efficiency among treatments (P < 0.01). Compared with birds in the nonGln groups, birds in the Gln group had higher gain, feed efficiency, and livability (P < 0.05). Among the Fast (groups 1 to 4), Feed (groups 5 to 8), and Oasis (groups 9 to 12) groups, birds in the Feed groups had the highest gain during d 0 to 21 (P < 0.01). During d 22 to 28, birds in the Fast groups had the lowest BW and livability (P < 0.01), and the nonvaccinated birds had lower gain and feed efficiency relative to vaccinated birds (P < 0.01). Birds in the Feed and Oasis groups had higher villus height (VH) of mid small intestine than Fast groups at d 2 and 7 (P < 0.05), and nonvaccinated birds had higher VH than vaccinated birds (P < 0.01) at d 7 after hatch. On d 14, there were differences in serum interferon-gamma (P < 0.05) levels among treatments. During d 22 to 28, vaccinated birds had lower lesion scores in the mid small intestine than nonvaccinated birds (P < 0.01), and birds in the Feed or Oasis groups had lower lesion scores compared with the Fast groups (P < 0.02). These results indicated the importance of immediate access to feed posthatch, the beneficial effects of feeding Oasis hatching supplement and Gln after hatch, as well as the necessity of the vaccination program against coccidiosis challenge. 3aliveweight gain 3asmall intestine 3avilli 3afeed deprivation 3afeed supplements 3amortality 3afeed conversion 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aCoccidiosisxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aDietxveterinary 2aEimeriaximmunology 2aFemale 2aGlutaminexpharmacology 2aInterferon-gammaxblood 2aInterleukin-2xblood 2aIntestinal Diseases, Parasiticxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aIntestinesxpathology 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aProtozoan Vaccinesximmunology1 aAllee, G.L.1 aKnight, C.D.1 aDibner, J.J.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.283-293x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.2.2833Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/07/29  aOther US 7aarticle02794naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001800192245007900210300001600289520109200305650001901397650001501416650002001431650001701451650002501468650003901493650002801532650002601560650004701586650001201633650003101645650002401676650004801700650002101748650003301769650002501802650002501827650003601852650003901888650002701927650002101954700001801975700001501993773007302008852000902081856007902090930003302169945002502202946001302227655001202240IND4372369620221118042119.0050718e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236962DNAL7 a157429612pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.2.2482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOnyango, E.M.10aEfficacy of an evolved Escherichia coli phytase in diets of broiler chicks  ap. 248-255.  aAn evolved Escherichia coli-derived phytase was evaluated for its efficacy in improving growth performance and nutrient utilization of broiler chicks. One hundred forty-four 7-d-old male broiler chicks were grouped by weight into 6 blocks of 6 cages with 4 birds per cage. Six corn-soybean meal-based mash diets were randomly assigned to cages within each block. The 6 diets were adequate P (7.7 g of P/kg of diet), low P (3.9 g of P/kg of diet), low P diet plus 0.75 or 1.5 g of inorganic P from monosodium phosphate, and low P diet plus the evolved Escherichia coli phytase at 500 or 1,000 units/kg of diet. The chicks were fed the experimental diets from 8 to 22 d of age. The evolved Escherichia coli phytase improved weight gain (P < 0.05), feed intake (P < 0.01), percentage tibia ash (P < 0.01), and retention of P (P < 0.001), Ca (P < 0.01), N (P < 0.05), and a number of amino acids (P < 0.05). The evolved Escherichia coli phytase was, therefore, efficacious in improving broiler growth performance, bone characteristics, and retention of P, Ca, N, and a number of amino acids. 3afeed additives 3aphosphorus 3aliveweight gain 3abone density 3anutrient utilization 2a6-Phytasexgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDietxveterinary 2aEscherichia colixenzymology 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOrganisms, Genetically Modified 2aPhosphatesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPichiaxgenetics1 aBedford, M.R.1 aAdeola, O.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.248-255x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.2.2483Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/07/29  aOther US 7aarticle03331naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001700192245010200209300001600311520187500327650002002202650001602222650001802238650002002256650002202276650001602298650001202314650002102326650002102347650003002368650002102398650002502419650000902444650002002453650004702473650001602520700001802536700001702554700002202571773007302593852000902666856007902675930003302754945002502787946001302812655001202825IND4372370420221118042052.0050718e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437237042DNAL7 a157429642pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.2.2732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVeldkamp, T.10aGrowth responses to dietary energy and lysine at high and low ambient temperature in male turkeys  ap. 273-282.  aThe effects of ambient temperature (T; 18 vs. 28 degrees C), dietary energy level [E; 90, 100, and 110% of NRC (1994) recommendations], and dietary lysine level [LYS; 105 vs. 120% of NRC (1994) recommendations], and their interactions on feed intake, BW gain, feed:gain ratio, and carcass yields of male turkeys were studied from 29 to 140 d of age. The experiment was designed as a split plot, including T as the main plot and E and LYS as the subplot, with 60 pens containing 10 male turkeys each. Overall, feed intake, BW gain, and feed:gain ratio were significantly lower at high compared with low T. Feed intake decreased linearly as E increased and was more pronounced at low compared with high T. Metabolizable energy intake increased more at high compared with low T as E increased. Turkeys that were fed the highest E gained less weight until 84 d of age than those fed the lowest E. Dietary lysine was not the limiting amino acid because birds showed no response to extra lysine. Feed:gain decreased linearly as E level increased. Until 84 d of age, feed:gain decreased more at low compared with high T as E level increased. Breast meat yields were lower, and thigh, drum, and wing yields were higher at high than at low T. The highest E resulted in lower cold carcass yields, and breast meat yields, and higher thigh and drum yields than the lowest E. Dietary lysine level did not affect carcass yield. The results imply that when dietary lysine levels are adequate, dietary energy may be increased above NRC (1994) to improve feed efficiency, but some of the limiting amino acids after lysine may be increased in high-density diets to optimize breast meat yield. Particularly at high temperature in the period after 16 wk of age, dietary energy contents may be increased to at least 110% of NRC (1994) because turkeys will need more energy to dissipate heat. 3afeed conversion 3aheat stress 3aanimal growth 3aliveweight gain 3aoptimal nutrition 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCold Temperature 2aDietxveterinary 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aLysinexpharmacology 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aTurkeysxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aWeight Gain1 aKwakkel, R.P.1 aFerket, P.R.1 aVerstegen, M.W.A.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.273-282x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.2.2733Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/07/29  aOther US 7aarticle03054naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175072001700192100001600209245009700225300001600322520143400338650001601772650003201788650001801820650002301838650001601861650002001877650001601897650004701913650001201960650003801972650002102010650003702031650001902068650001102087650002902098650004102127650002502168650003202193650001702225700001902242700001902261773007302280852000902353856007902362930003302441945002502474946001302499655001202512IND4372369520221118042008.0050718e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236952DNAL7 a157429592pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.2.2322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPayne, R.L.10aEffect of inorganic versus organic selenium on hen production and egg selenium concentration  ap. 232-247.  aA 28-d experiment using 288 Hy-Line W-36 laying hens was conducted to compare sodium selenite (SS) with Se-enriched yeast (SY). The Se from SS or SY was supplemented into a corn-soybean meal basal diet at 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, or 3.00 ppm, and the basal diet was formulated to provide 0.82% lysine and 2,950 kcal/kg of ME. Each treatment was replicated 4 times with 2 cages of 4 hens per cage in each replicate. Hen production was assessed daily, and 2 eggs per replicate were collected every 4 d for whole-egg Se analysis. Albumen quality was assessed at 2 egg storage temperatures (7.2 vs. 22.2 degrees C) with the eggs collected on d 24 and 28, respectively. The percentage of dirty and cracked eggs was greater (P < 0.04) in hens fed SY than in those fed SS. Percentage hen-day production was not affected (P > 0.05) by diet. Albumen quality of eggs stored at 22.2 degrees C was improved (P < 0.04) in eggs from hens fed SS, but there was no difference (P > 0.05) in albumen quality of eggs stored at 7.2 degrees C. Egg weight was linearly increased (P < 0.01) by SY. Whole-egg Se levels were linearly increased (P < 0.01) as dietary Se level increased for both sources of Se, but eggs from hens fed SY had higher (P < 0.01) Se concentrations than those fed SS. The results from this experiment indicate that percentage hen-day production is not affected by Se source, and that SY increases egg Se concentrations more than SS. 3alaying hens 3adietary mineral supplements 3adose response 3alaying performance 3aegg quality 3aegg composition 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEggsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aOrganoselenium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSeleniumxmetabolism 2aSodium Selenitexmetabolism 2aYeast, Dried1 aLavergne, T.K.1 aSouthern, L.L.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Feb., v. 84, no. 2 p.232-247x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.2.2323Available from publisher's Web site  a20050920b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/07/28  aOther US 7aarticle01666naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245008000159300001600239500002400255520061200279650001400891650001300905650000800918650001200926650001600938650001700954653001800971653002100989653000901010653002201019700001101041700001301052700001601065700001601081700001601097773009801113852000901211856004801220655001201268IND4407285820221118041948.0080627e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440728582DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-008-0079-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, C.

Because research addressing daily Ile needs for broiler immunity is sparse, Ile responses for immunity in female broilers were evaluated in 2 experiments in broilers from 30 to 42 d of age. Cellular and humoral immunity were evaluated in diets limiting in Ile and diets varying in Ile from deficient to adequate. Pen was the experimental unit in both experiments. Treatments in experiment 1 consisted of 2 levels of Ile (0.42 vs. 0.72% total of diet) and 3 strains of broilers, Arbor Acres+, Ross 508, Ross 708 (6 treatments; 5 pens each). In experiment 1, measurements consisted of: a cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity test to phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P) on d 37 and 38; cell quantification of CD4+, CD8+, and BU-1+ lymphocytes at d 41 and 42; and relative immune organ weights at 42 d. No Ile x strain interaction occurred. Feeding an Ile-deficient diet to broilers suppressed the cell mediated response to PHA-P, and reduced thymus weight and the percentage of CD8+ T cells. There were no significant differences between strains. In experiment 2, gradations of Ile (0.42, 0.50, 0.58, 0.66, 0.74, and 0.82% total of diet) were fed to one strain (Ross 508) of female broilers (7 pens per diet). A control diet containing 0.70% Ile (6 pens) was compared with an Ile surfeit concentration. Measurements in experiment 2 consisted of a hypersensitivity test to PHA-P on d 35 and 36; a primary antibody response to SRBC from 35 to 42 d; cell quantification of CD8+alpha, beta, and T cell receptor (TCR)-1 (delta/gamma) lymphocytes on d 41 and 42; and immune organ weights at 42 d. Immunity measurements in birds fed surfeit Ile in the titration diets were equal to birds fed the control diet. A linear response to increasing Ile was obtained for relative bursa, but no Ile quadratic responses were noted for other measurements in experiment 2. Although feeding broilers a diet deficient in Ile suppressed some immune criteria, it does not appear that a marginal Ile deficiency will compromise immunity in growing female broilers. 3abroiler chickens 3astrain differences 3acell-mediated immunity 3ahumoral immunity 3alimiting amino acids 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesxblood 2aChickensximmunology 2aDiet 2aErythrocytesximmunology 2aFemale 2aIsoleucinexadministration & dosageximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aLymphoid Tissuexdrug effects 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aPhytohemagglutininsximmunology 2aSheep1 aPharr, G.T.1 aBurgess, S.C.1 aCorzo, A.1 aKidd, M.T.0 tPoultry science.g2004 Dec., v. 83, no. 12 p.1979-1985x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/83.12.19793Available from publisher's Web site  a20050119b20050130c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/01/19  aOther US 7aarticle03110naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100002000193245007000213300001800283500001500301520141900316650002101735650001801756650001501774650001501789650002401804650002201828650001001850650002101860650001201881650002701893650001101920650002301931650002001954650001101974650004301985650001702028650005602045650002702101650001202128651001602140651001602156653002002172653001502192700002602207700002002233700002002253773007502273852000902348856008002357930003302437945002502470946001302495655001202508IND4373079920221118042146.0050806e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437307992DNAL7 a161562162pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.8.13082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMollenhorst, H.10aRisk factors for Salmonella enteritidis infections in laying hens  ap. 1308-1313.  a2019-12-04  aContamination with SE is an important threat to food safety in egg production. Various risk factors exist for infection with and spreading of SE on a farm. A data set of regularly collected blood samples from hens at the end of lay was available for analysis. Data included information about infection with SE, date of sampling, housing system and flock size and whether there were hens of different ages on the farm or in the house. By using the mentioned data set, our objective was to identify risk factors associated with SE infection in laying hens. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the contribution of different variables. Results showed that bigger flocks increased the chance of infection with SE in all housing systems. The system with the lowest chance of infection was the cage system with wet manure. An outdoor run increased the chance of infection only at farms with all hens of the same age. The presence of hens of different ages on a farm was a risk factor for deep litter systems only. This resulted in the highest chance of infection for a deep litter system on a farm with hens of different ages. On a farm with all hens of the same age, however, a deep litter system did not increase the chance of infection with SE compared with a cage system. The main risk factors associated with SE infection, therefore, were flock size, housing system, and farm with hens of different ages. 3alitter (bedding) 3abattery cages 3aanimal age 3agroup size 3aon-farm food safety 3adisease incidence 2aAging 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aFood Contamination 2aLogistic Models 2aManure 2aPoultry Diseasesxbloodxepidemiology. 2aRisk Factors 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxbloodxepidemiology. 2aSalmonella enteritidis 2aSeasons 3aNetherlands 0aNetherlands 0apoultry housing 0aflock size1 aWoudenbergh, C.J. van1 aBokkers, E.G.M.1 aBoer, I.J.M. de0 tPoultry science.g2005 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.1308-1313x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.8.13083Available from publisher's Web site  a20050915b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle03460naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193100001700210245010200227300001800329520183400347650001802181650001902199650002402218650002002242650002002262650001202282650002502294650005202319650004702371650001202418650003102430650004602461650002502507650000902532650002402541650004902565650002402614700001602638700001802654700002202672773007602694852000902770856008002779930003302859945002502892946001302917655001202930IND4373920020221118042323.0050901e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437392002DNAL7 a162065622pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.9.14062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDriver, J.P.10aEffects of calcium and nonphytate phosphorus concentrations on phytase efficacy in broiler chicks  ap. 1406-1417.  aPhytase supplementation over a range of different levels of dietary Ca and nonphytate phosphorus (NPP) was investigated by comparing surface response curves from regression equations generated with (experiment 1) and without (experiment 2) phytase using various performance and bone quality parameters. Cobb x Cobb broiler chicks were raised from 0 to 16 d in 2 experiments using corn-soybean meal based diets. Experiment 1 used a 4 x 4 factorial arrangement with diets formulated to contain combinations of 4 levels of Ca: 0.38, 0.58, 0.78, and 0.98% and 4 levels of NPP: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5%. Experiment 2 used a composite rotatable design in which rations were formulated to contain dietary Ca levels of 0.38, 0.47, 0.68, 0.89, and 0.98% and NPP levels of 0.20, 0.24, 0.35, 0.46, and 0.50%. An extra point was included in the design to contain the lowest Ca and lowest NPP levels (0.38% Ca and 0.20% NPP). All combinations of Ca and NPP were fed with 657 phytase units/kg Natuphos 5000 phytase, plus 4 combinations (0.38% Ca and 0.20% NPP, 0.47% Ca and 0.24% NPP, 0.68% Ca and 0.35% NPP, and 0.89% Ca and 0.46% NPP) were fed without phytase to determine the suitability of comparing multiple regression response surfaces for particular variables among experiments. Comparison of surfaces, with and without phytase, showed that growth and bone quality responses to phytase were greatest at low NPP levels and high Ca levels, and these decreased when the Ca level was reduced or when the NPP level was increased. A third experiment confirmed that phytase elicits a greater response at higher Ca levels and lower NPP levels (0.86% Ca and 0.20% NPP) versus low Ca levels and low NPP levels (0.47% Ca and 0.24% NPP). The data demonstrated why it is impossible to determine a single NPP equivalency value for phytase supplements. 3adose response 3afeed additives 3abone mineralization 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3arickets 3aabnormal development 2a6-Phytasexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxphysiology 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aRegression Analysis1 aPesti, G.M.1 aBakalli, R.I.1 aEdwards, H.M.

  1 aRafacz-Livingston, K.A.10aCitric acid improves phytate phosphorus utilization in crossbred and commercial broiler chicks  ap. 1370-1375.  aPrevious research in our laboratory has shown that citric acid (CA) improves phytate P utilization in New Hampshire x Columbian (NHC) crossbred chicks fed a P-deficient corn-soybean meal diet. The current study was conducted to determine if CA is also effective in commercial broiler chicks (Ross x Ross). In 3 experiments, 4 replicate groups of 5 male NHC chicks and male commercial chicks were fed corn-soybean meal diets varying in CA and nonphytate P (NPP) from 8 to 22 d of age. In experiment 1, a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial treatment arrangement was used to evaluate the effect of 2 levels of CA (0 and 3%) and NPP (0.13 and 0.28%) in NHC chicks and commercial chicks. The commercial chicks, but not the NHC chicks, fed the 0.13% NPP diet had to be removed from the experiment after 3 to 5 d due to very poor growth and severe leg problems. Chick weight gain and tibia ash were significantly increased (P < 0.05) by CA in both types of chicks. In experiment 2, the same 2 x 2 x 2 factorial treatment arrangement was again used except that the NPP levels were 0.18 and 0.28%. Tibia ash was increased significantly (P < 0.05) with the addition of CA in both breeds of chicks; response was greater at 0.18% NPP than at 0.28% NPP. In experiment 3, graded levels of CA (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4%) were evaluated in commercial chicks fed diets containing 0.18% NPP. Tibia ash increased linearly (P < 0.05) as CA increased from 0 to 4%. The average increase in bone ash resulting from 3% CA supplementation in experiments 2 and 3 was 41%. These results indicate that CA markedly improved phytate P utilization in NHC and Ross x Ross commercial broiler chicks. 3aline differences 3anutrient deficiencies 3aliveweight gain 3abone mineralization 3afeed additives 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCitric Acidxpharmacology 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDiet 2aEating 2aMale 2aPhosphorusxpharmacokinetics 2aPhytic Acidxchemistry 2aSoybeans 2aWeight Gain 2aZea mays1 aMartinez-Amezcua, C.1 aParsons, C.M.1 aBaker, D.H.1 aSnow, J.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1370-1375x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.13703Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/12  aOther US 7aarticle02824naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001500193245012500208300001800333520138000351650002801731650001501759650002001774650002001794650004901814650001201863650003501875650000901910650001401919650001201933650003601945650000901981650002901990650001302019650001702032650001602049650001302065700001602078773007602094852000902170856008002179930003302259945002502292946001302317655001202330IND4373918620221118042231.0050901e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437391862DNAL7 a162065542pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.9.13502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGarcia, A.10aChanges in the digestible lysine and sulfur amino acid needs of broiler chicks during the first three weeks posthatching  ap. 1350-1355.  aFour experiments were conducted to study the changes in the digestible lysine (DLYS) and sulfur amino acid (DSAA) requirements of broilers during the first 21 d posthatching. Cobb 500 by-product male broilers were fed corn-corn gluten meal-soybean meal diets formulated to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Five graded levels of either Lys or SAA were used, varying from 0.78 to 1.28% DLYS (experiments 1 and 2) and from 0.61 to 1.08% DSAA (experiments 3 and 4). Body weight gain (BWG) and gain:feed ratio (GF) were calculated at 4, 7, and 21 d. The DLYS requirements based on BWG varied from 0.98 at 4 d of age to 1.01% at 21 d in experiment 1 and from 0.95 at 4 d of age to 0.99% at 21 d, in experiment 2. Based on GF, the DLYS requirement varied from 1.08 to 1.10% in experiment 1, and from 0.98 to 0.94% in experiment 2 at 4 and 21 d, respectively. The estimated DSAA requirements for BWG varied from 0.83 to 0.88% or from 0.71 to 0.75% for 4 and 21 d in experiments 3 and 4, respectively. For GF, the DSAA decreased slightly from 0.88% at 4 d to 0.83% at 21 d in experiment 3, but did not change in experiment 4 (0.81%). Minimal changes in the DLYS or DSAA estimated requirements occurred during the first 21 d of age, which suggests that the recommended DLYS and DSAA levels determined at 21 d of age appear to be adequate to meet chick needs for the first week of age. 3aamino acid requirements 3aanimal age 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 2aAmino Acids, Sulfurxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aDiet 2aDigestion 2aGlutens 2aLysinexadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aNutritional Requirements 2aSoybeans 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain 2aZea mays1 aBatal, A.B.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Sept., v. 84, no. 9 p.1350-1355x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.9.13503Available from publisher's Web site  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/09/12  aOther US 7aarticle04047naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193100001400210245010400224300001800328520204700346650002202393650001302415650001802428650001502446650002002461650001602481650002502497650002702522650002602549650004702575650001202622650003302634650003102667650004802698650003702746650003302783650001102816650002502827650002502852650002302877650002602900650003302926650002902959650001602988650004903004650001903053700002003072700001603092700001503108700001403123700001303137773007503150852000903225856008003234930003303314945002503347946001303372655001203385IND4372922420221118042128.0050802e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437292242DNAL7 a160501192pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.7.10222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRossi, F.10aEffect of Bt corn on broiler growth performance and fate of feed-derived DNA in the digestive tract  ap. 1022-1030.  aThe aim of the study was to evaluate the effect on broiler performance of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn containing the Cry1A(b) protein compared with the corresponding near isogenic corn and to analyze the degradation of the Cry1A(b) gene in the digestive tract. Ross male broilers (432) were fed for 42 consecutive days with diets containing Bt or isogenic corn. Diet, Bt corn, and the isogenic form of the Bt corn were analyzed for composition and aflatoxin B1, fumonisin B1, and deoxynivalenol contents. Broiler body weight and feed intake were recorded at regular intervals (d 0, 21, and 42). The presence of the Cry1A(b) gene and plant-specific genes Zein and Sh-2 in gut contents of crop, gizzard, jejunum, cecum, and samples of blood was determined in 10 animals per treatment at the end of the trial using a PCR technique. Chemical composition was not different between Bt and its isogenic form, whereas the fumonisin B1 content for Bt was lower than for isogenic corn (2,039 vs. 1,1034 ppb; P < 0.05). The results of the growth study showed no difference for average daily weight gain (129.4 vs. 126.0 g/d), feed intake (63.4 vs. 61.8 g/d), and feed conversion ratio (1.95 vs. 2.02) among the groups. No significant relationship was observed between mycotoxins content and growth performances. Feed-derived DNA is progressively degraded along the digestive tract. Detection frequency of short fragments of maize-specific high copy number Zein gene was high but significantly decreased in distal sectors. An 1,800-bp fragment of the Cry1A(b) gene, corresponding to the minimal functional unit, was detected only in crop and gizzard of birds fed Bt corn. Sh-2 showed the same detection frequency of Cry1A(b) and was also found in birds fed isogenic corn. Blood samples were positive with low frequency only for the Zein gene fragment. No significant difference in DNA detection was observed between birds fed Bt and isogenic corn, indicating that DNA derived from transgenic feed undergoes the same fate as isogenic feed. 3atransgenic plants 3aZea mays 3athuringiensin 3amycotoxins 3aliveweight gain 3adegradation 3anucleotide sequences 2aAflatoxin B1xanalysis 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxinsxgenetics 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxblood. 2aDNA, Plantxanalysisxblood. 2aEating 2aEndotoxinsxgenetics 2aFumonisinsxanalysis 2aHemolysin Proteins 2aIntestinesxchemistry 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aTrichothecenesxanalysis 2aWeight Gain 2aZea maysxchemistryxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aZeinxgenetics1 aMorlacchini, M.1 aFusconi, G.1 aPietri, A.1 aMazza, R.1 aPiva, G.0 tPoultry science.g2005 July, v. 84, no. 7 p.1022-1030x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.7.10223Available from publisher's Web site  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/08  aOther US 7aarticle03903naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100002000194245009000214300001800304500001500322520186800337650002202205650001702227650002102244650002102265650000902286650001602295650001502311650002002326650001902346650002202365650001602387650001202403650002102415650003302436650001102469650003302480650002402513650001502537650001602552650002802568650002802596650002802624650002902652650007402681650001602755650002902771650004002800650001302840650001302853651001202866653003802878700001602916700001902932700001702951773007602968852000903044856008103053930003303134945002503167946001303192655001203205IND4376680120221118042222.0051212e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437668012DNAL7 a164799392pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.12.18412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The objectives of the current experiment were to examine the effects of feeding grains naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins on hematology and immunological indices and functions of laying hens and the possible protective effect of feeding a polymeric glucomannan mycotoxin adsorbent (GMA). One hundred forty-four laying hens were fed for 12 wk with diets formulated with (1) uncontaminated grains, (2) contaminated grains, or (3) contaminated grains + 0.2% GMA. Fusarium mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON, 12 mg/kg), 15-acetyl-DON (0.5 mg/kg), and zearalenone (0.6 mg/kg) were identified in the contaminated diets arising from contaminated grains grown in Ontario, Canada. The concentrations of DON arising from naturally contaminated grains in this study were similar to purified mycotoxin fed to experimental mice. The chronic feeding of Fusarium mycotoxins induced small decreases in hematocrit values, total numbers of white blood cells, lymphocytes including both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, and biliary IgA concentration. Supplementation of diets containing feed-borne mycotoxins with GMA prevented the reduction in total number of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and the reduction in biliary IgA concentration. In addition, the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to dinitrochlorobenzene was increased by feed-borne mycotoxins, whereas IgG and IgM antibody titers to sheep red blood cells were not affected by diet. We concluded that chronic consumption of grains naturally contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins at levels likely to be encountered in practice were not systemically immunosuppressive or hematotoxic; however, mucosal immunocompetence needs to be explored further. 3aimmunosuppression 3aglucomannans 3amucosal immunity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3abile 3azearalenone 3aadsorbents 3aimmune response 3adeoxynivalenol 3ablood cell counts 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBileximmunology 2aChickensxbloodximmunology. 2aFemale 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFusariumxchemistry 2aHematocrit 2aHemoglobins 2aImmunoglobulin Axblood 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aImmunoglobulin Mxblood 2aMannansxtherapeutic use 2aMycotoxinsxadministration & dosagexchemistryxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aOviposition 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinases 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src) 2aTriticum 2aZea mays 3aOntario 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aSmith, T.K.1 aBoermans, H.J.1 aWoodward, B.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.1841-1850x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.12.18413Available from publisher's Web site  a20060131b20060202c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle02853naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001800194245008100212300001800293500001500311520147300326650002101799650002101820650001701841650002301858650001501881650001001896650001201906650002101918650001301939650003001952650002001982650000902002650002002011650001702031650000902048653002002057700001702077700001602094773007602110852000902186856008102195930003302276945002502309946001302334655001202347IND4376679820221118042038.0051212e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437667982DNAL7 a164799362pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.12.18162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShields, S.J.10aEffect of sand and wood-shavings bedding on the behavior of broiler chickens  ap. 1816-1824.  a2019-12-04  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 2 different bedding types, sand and wood shavings, on the behavior of broiler chickens. In experiment 1, 6 pens were divided down the center and bedded half with sand and half with wood shavings. Male broilers (10/pen) were observed by scan sampling at 5- or 12-min intervals throughout the 6-wk growth period during the morning (between 0800 to 0900 h), afternoon (1200 to 1500 h), and night (2300 to 0600 h). There was a significant behavior x substrate x week interaction during the day (P < 0.0001) and at night (P < 0.0002). Drinking, dustbathing, preening, and sitting increased in frequency on the sand side but decreased on the wood shavings side during the day, as did resting at night. In general, broilers performed a greater proportion of their total behavioral time budget on the sand (P < 0.0001) as they aged. Broilers used the divider between the 2 bedding types to perch; perching behavior peaked during wk 4. In experiment 2, male broilers were housed in 8 pens (50 birds/pen) bedded only in sand or wood shavings. Bedding type had no effect on behavioral time budgets (P = 0.8946), although there were age-related changes in behavior on both bedding types. These results indicate that when given a choice, broilers increasingly performed many of their behaviors on sand, but if only one bedding type was provided they performed those behaviors with similar frequency on sand or wood shavings. 3abroiler chickens 3alitter (bedding) 3adust bathing 3aanimal preferences 3aanimal age 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aChickens 2aFloors and Floorcoverings 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aSilicon Dioxide 2aTime Factors 2aWood 0aanimal behavior1 aGarner, J.P.1 aMench, J.A.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.1816-1824x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.12.18163Available from publisher's Web site  a20060131b20060202c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle03918naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001700194245010600211300001800317520236200335650002202697650001602719650002402735650002302759650001402782650002702796650002002823650002302843650001202866650001202878650002402890650002102914650001102935650002202946650002502968650000902993650001403002650002403016650004403040700001903084700001703103700001903120773007603139852000903215856008103224930003303305945002503338946001303363655001203376IND4376679920221118042023.0051212e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437667992DNAL7 a164799372pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.12.18252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNestor, K.E.10aGenetic variation in pure lines and crosses of large-bodied turkeys. 4. Body shape and carcass traits  ap. 1825-1834.  aAn experimental line (F) of turkeys selected long term for increased 16-wk BW was reciprocally crossed with a primary breeding sire line (C) from a major international turkey breeder to study the inheritance of carcass traits and body shape. The birds were weighed and killed at 16 wk of age, and various measurements of muscling, leg bones, and body shape were made. The BW of males were 16.0 and 15.1 kg, respectively, in the C and F lines. The respective BW for females were 12.2 and 11.2 kg. Additive genetic variation, as indicated by differences between the F and C line, was a more important source of variation for measurements of muscling than for measurements of leg bones. The anterior and posterior depth of the body and the ratio of these measurements differed between the F and C lines. Body cavity volume index (length x width x height) differed between lines in females and sexes combined. The weights of some internal organs (gizzard, heart, liver, pancreas, and spleen), but not others (proventriculus and lungs), differed between lines, and the total weight of these organs was greater in the C line than in the F line. However, the ratio of total demand organs (muscles and bones) to the total weight of the supply organs was less in the F line than in the C line. Heterosis was a more important source of variation in body weight and weights of the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscle weights in males than in females. Heterosis for some body shape measurements (keel length, body depth 1, body depth 2, body depth ratio, body cavity height, and body cavity volume index) was significant in some comparisons. Heterosis (range = 3.64 to 3.99%) for leg muscle measurements (thigh muscles, drumstick muscles, and total leg muscles) was highly significant (P less than or equal to 0.01) based on the analysis for both sexes. Differences between the reciprocal crosses of the F and C lines were more frequent in the present study than in previous studies in which the F line was reciprocally crossed with sire lines from 2 other commercial breeders. However, when the data from the previous studies and the current study were summarized, it appeared that the only reciprocal effect that was consistent was for the weight of the drumstick muscles, indicating sex linkage or maternal effects may influence the weight of these muscles. 3abody conformation 3abody weight 3acarcass composition 3agender differences 3aheterosis 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amaternal effect 3areciprocal crosses 3amuscles 2aAnimals 2aBody Sizexgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aHindlimbxphysiology 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aSex Characteristics 2aTurkeysxanatomy & histologyxgenetics.1 aAnderson, J.W.1 aHartzler, D.1 aVelleman, S.G.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.1825-1834x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.12.18253Available from publisher's Web site  a20060131b20060202c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle03153naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001900211245010300230300001800333500001500351520159700366650002101963650002101984650001402005650001802019650002102037650002202058650002102080650002302101650002002124650002102144650001202165650004602177650001302223650002002236650002002256650001002276653000902286700001702295700001702312700001702329700001602346773007602362852000902438856008102447930003302528945002502561946001302586655001202599IND4375965720221118042111.0051110e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437596572DNAL7 a164639782pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.11.17852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

An experiment was conducted to assess the effects of outdoor access and genotype on meat quality. One slow-growing genotype (S), 2 medium-growing genotypes (M1 and M2), and a commercial fast-growing genotype (F) were raised (straight-run) for 81, 67, or 53 d, respectively. The placement date was staggered in order to achieve a similar final body weight. Each genotype was assigned to 3 pens of 24 birds each and raised in indoor floor pens in a naturally ventilated facility; the S and F genotypes were also assigned to 2 floor pens with outdoor access containing 36 birds each. All birds were provided with the same starter, grower, and finisher feeds, and birds were commercially processed. Pectoralis samples were collected at 6 h postmortem for proximate analysis and evaluation of meat quality. The principal effect of outdoor access was to make the meat more yellow in the case of the S genotype (P < 0.05) although not the F genotype (P > 0.05). Drip loss and cook loss (%) were affected (P < 0.05) by genotype, with the highest losses occurring with the S genotype and the lowest losses occurring with the F and M genotypes. Tenderness was affected (P < 0.05) by gender as well as production system but only in the F birds. Pectoralis dry matter (%), fat (%), and ash (%) were largely unaffected (P > 0.05) by genotype or outdoor access. These data indicate that meat quality differences exist among genotypes with very different growth rates and reared with or without outdoor access. 3aage at slaughter 3abroiler chickens 3adrip loss 3aanimal growth 3ameat composition 3aextensive farming 3aslaughter weight 3agender differences 3ameat tenderness 3aline differences 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGenotype 2aHousing, Animal 2aMeatxstandards 2aWater 0apens1 aCavitt, L.C.1 aPillai, P.B.1 aEmmert, J.L.1 aOwens, C.M.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Nov., v. 84, no. 11 p.1785-1790x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.11.17853Available from publisher's Web site  a20051222b20060102c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/11/21  aOther US 7aarticle02421naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008200128300001600210500001500226520152700241650002201768650001901790650001501809650001301824650002101837650001501858653001101873700001601884700001301900700001301913773007901926852000902005930003302014945001302047946001102060655001202071IND2200885220221118042139.0991001e199811  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantovani, G.10aApplication of planar chromatography to sample analysis in the sugar industry  ap. 263-272.  a2019-12-05  aAnalysis of sugar mixtures by modern liquid chromatographic techniques, both column and planar, has gained in prominence. As far as planar chromatography is concerned, the introduction of high performance bonded-phase layers and instrumental development techniques has opened up new avenues in the TLC analysis of sugars, especially for samples that normally require cumbersome clean-up processes. In chromatography, gradient elution is the technique of choice when the mixture components span a wide range of polarities (or molecular structure). Planar chromatography gradient development is also possible using an automated technique (AMD), which has been recently introduced. This technique makes large spot capacities possible because of the reconcentration effect caused by the multiple development as well as the accommodation of many spots on the same chromatographic plate, because of the gradient development. Thus, complex samples, such as beet or cane molasses, can be analyzed (or at least screened) on high-performance thin layers using modern scanners which allow a great deal of information to be obtained. In the analysis of molasses, over pressure liquid chromatography (OPLC) is also interesting. This is a forced flow technique which makes both large spot capacities and short development times possible, and can be utilized for gradient elutions as well. Details of the analysis of both beet and cane molasses are reported, and a comparison between the two techniques mentioned previously is discussed. 3achemical analysis 3achromatography 3acane sugar 3amixtures 3aoligosaccharides 3abeet sugar 0asugars1 aVaccari, G.1 aDosi, E.1 aLodi, G.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1998 Nov., v. 37, no. 3 p.263-272x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03066naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013700125300001600262500001500278520219800293650002102491650002302512650002302535653003102558700001602589700001402605773007902619852000902698930003302707945001302740946001102753655001202764IND2061533120221118042039.0980127e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206153312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, R.H.10aEffects of chain flexibility of chitosan molecules on the preparation, physical, and release characteristics of the prepared capsule  ap. 141-148.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of chain flexibility of chitosan molecules on the preparation, physical, and release characteristics of the prepared capsule were studied. The chain flexibility of chitosan molecules in solution was manipulated by using chitosans with different degrees of deacetylation (DD) (67.9%, 81.3%, 90.5%, 92.2%), different pHs (2.0, 3.0, 4.0), and NaCl concentrations (0, 0.3%). The solutions were then used to encapsulate hemoglobin or dextran by the orifice method to make the capsules. Axial ratios and break strengths were used to characterize the appearance and mechanical properties of the prepared capsules. D. S. C. was employed to measure enthalpies and maximum melting temperatures to be used as a quantitative index of hydrogen bond formation in the walls of the capsules. Release rate was used as a pore size indicator. The results show axial ratios of the capsules increased with a decrease in molecular weight and also with an increase in DD of chitosan used. Axial ratios also increased when 0.3% NaCl was added to the solutions used. The effects of solution pH show that capsules prepared from pH 3.0 solutions were smaller than those from pH 2.0 and/or pH 4.0 solutions. Capsules of lower break strengths had higher axial ratios. The enthalpies of the chitosan capsules increased with increasing DD of chitosans used, and also with increasing NaCl concentration in the solutions used. However the maximum melting temperatures showed no linear relationship with the DDs of chitosan used. Maximum melting point temperatures of capsules also increased with an increase in NaCl concentrations in solutions used. The hemoglobin and dextran release percentages from the capsule at 25 degrees C for 24 h increased with an increase of DD of chitosan used. The release rate also increased with the addition of NaCl in the chitosan solution used. The release percentages of capsules prepared from pH 4.0 solutions were higher than those from pH 2.0 and/or pH 3.0 solutions. Release percentages of dextran of different molecular weights from capsules of 81.3% DD chitosan and pH 3 solutions were 52.7% for 19600 Da dextran, 26.3% for 87000 Da dextran and 12.4% for 162000 Da dextran. 3amolecular weight 3achemical structure 3athermal properties 0aphysicochemical properties1 aTsaih, M.L.1 aLin, W.C.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1996 Nov., v. 31, no. 3 p.141-148x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01595naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006200125300001600187520086200203650001601065650001201081650002001093700001701113700001501130700001501145773007901160852000901239930003301248945001301281946001101294655001201305IND2061533720221118042148.0980127e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206153372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichon, C.10aViscoelastic properties of l-carrageenan/gelatin mixtures  ap. 161-169.  aThe storage (G') and loss (G") moduli of transparent mixtures of l-carrageenan and gelatin have been measured during gelation and melting and compared with those of gelatin and l-carrageenan systems alone.

Three specific temperature domains can be distinguished, delimited by the melting and helix-coil transition temperatures of gelatin and l-carrageenan. An interpretation based on conformational changes and an attractive electrostatic interaction between the two biopolymers is suggested. The temperature dependence of G' and G" for mixtures has been studied as a function of thermal history (time and temperature of gel ageing), sodium chloride concentration and molecular weight of the l-carrageenan. 3acarrageenan 3agelatin 3aviscoelasticity1 aCuvelier, G.1 aLaunay, B.1 aParker, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1996 Nov., v. 31, no. 3 p.161-169x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01671naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009300125300001400218500002400232520087800256651001601134700001301150700002501163773015801188852000901346939003301355946002901388655001201417IND8102306320221118042137.0810309e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810230632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbruna, F.10aStudies on management of a wild yam (Dioscorea alata) and a wild tanier (Xanthosoma sp.)  ap. 58-61.  aSummary in Spanish.  aA wild yam (Dioscorea alata) appears to be unaffected by insects or diseases and its vigorous growth smothers all weeds. Total production of over 40 t/ha of tubers, of which 30 t/ha were suitable for human consumption, were produced with the best planting system. Benching alone increased yields from 19.8 to 24.4 t/ha. Benching and staking increased marketable yields from 19.8 to 31.8 t/ha, and total yields from 26.4 to 41.9 t/ha. Higher yields were produced with 1 x 1 m than with 1 x 2 m spacing. Yields of a wild tanier cultivar harvested at 31 months after planting increased with closer spacing from 34.8 t/ha with 9,200 plants to 99.2 t/ha with 48,900 plants. Intermediate yields were obtained with intermediate spacings. Planting in beds did not increase yields over those for level planting. This root crop can be consumed by humans but is best used as pig feed. 3aPuerto Rico1 aDiaz, N.1 aVicente-Chandler, J.0 tJournal of agriculture of the University of Puerto Rico - Puerto Rico, Agricultural Experiment Station.g1981 Jan., v. 65, no. 1 p.58-61x0041-994X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19810309c00000000  aState experiment station 7aarticle03848naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158100001400175245017700189300001600366520190500382650002002287650002102307650002202328650002302350650002002373650002002393650002902413650001602442650004702458650001202505650002202517650001302539650002502552650003302577650002302610650004002633650002002673650003402693650000902727650003602736650005902772650002402831650002102855700001802876700001502894700001702909700002102926700001302947700001502960700001502975773007302990852000903063856007903072930003303151945002503184946001303209655001203222IND4370926020221118042138.0050602e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437092602DNAL7 a159715332pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.6.9332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aIqbal, M.10aCompromised liver mitochondrial function and complex activity in low feed efficient broilers are associated with higher oxidative stress and differential protein expression  ap. 933-941.  aVariations in broiler growth and efficiency have been explained in part by differences in mitochondrial function and biochemistry in broilers. To further our knowledge in this regard, 2 experiments were carried out to determine the relationships of a) mitochondrial function and activities of various electron transport chain (ETC) complexes; b) production of H2O2, a reactive oxygen species (ROS), and its association with protein oxidation; and c) mitochondrial protein expression in liver of a single line male broilers with low or high feed efficiency (FE, n = 5 to 8 per group). Mitochondrial function and complex activities were measured polarographically and spectrophotometrically, respectively. H2O2 was measured fluorimetrically, whereas oxidized protein (carbonyls) and specific mitochondrial proteins were analyzed using Western blots. Mitochondrial function (ETC coupling) and activities of ETC complexes (I, II, III, and IV) were higher in high FE compared with low FE broilers. H2O2 and protein carbonyls were higher in the livers of low FE broilers than in high FE broilers. Whereas the expression of 4 immunoreactive proteins NAD3 (complex I), subunit VII (complex III), cytochrome c oxidase subunits (COX) II, and COX IVb (complex IV) were higher in low FE liver mitochondria and 2 proteins subunit 70 (complex II) and a-ATP synthase (complex V) were higher in high FE birds, there were no differences between groups in the expression of 18 other mitochondrial proteins. In conclusion, increases in oxidative stress in low FE broilers were caused by or may contribute to differences in mitochondrial function (ETC coupling and complex activities) or the differential expression of steady-state levels of some mitochondrial proteins in the liver. Understanding the role of oxidative stress in Low FE broilers will provide clues in understanding the cellular basis of feed efficiency. 3afeed conversion 3aline differences 3ahydrogen peroxide 3acarbonyl compounds 3agene expression 3aenzyme activity 3aelectron transport chain 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aBreeding 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aElectron Transport 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGene Expression 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aMale 2aMitochondria, Liverxphysiology 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidative Stress1 aPumford, N.R.1 aTang, Z.X.1 aLassiter, K.1 aOjano-Dirain, C.1 aWing, T.1 aCooper, M.1 aBottje, W.0 tPoultry science.g2005 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.933-941x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.6.9333Available from publisher's Web site  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/06/18  aOther US 7aarticle03960naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001700192245009100209300001600300520231300316650001602629650001402645650000702659650001702666650001602683650002002699650003902719650004702758650001202805650004602817650001302863650004602876650000902922650001102931650001202942650000902954650004902963650005303012650001303065650001603078650001303094700001803107700001903125700001803144773007303162852000903235856007903244930003303323945002503356946001303381655001203394IND4370920020221118042131.0050602e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437092002DNAL7 a159715292pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.6.9102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWatson, B.C.14aThe interactive effects of Eimeria acervulina infection and phytase for broiler chicks  ap. 910-913.  aAn experiment was conducted to determine the interactive effects of Eimeria acervulina infection and phytase in male broiler chicks. Chicks were standardized from 0 to 4 d posthatching, and the assay period was 5 to 15 d. Treatments were replicated with 6 pens of 5 chicks each. The initial and final BW were 67 and 363 g. A corn-soybean meal diet formulated to provide 1.26% total Lys and 3,200 kcal of ME/kg was used, and it was adequate in all other nutrients except Ca and nonphytate P (NPP) when appropriate. The treatments were in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement: adequate Ca and NPP (1.0% Ca and 0.45% NPP) or inadequate Ca and NPP (0.80% Ca and 0.25% NPP), 0 or 600 phytase units/kg of diet, and uninfected or infected with 400,000 E. acervulina oocysts on d 0, 3, and 6 of the experiment. Daily gain, average daily feed intake, and gain:feed (GF) were reduced (P < 0.01) by the coccidial infection and the reduction in Ca and NPP. Phytase addition increased (P < 0.02) average daily gain and average daily feed intake, regardless of the Ca and NPP contents of the diet or the presence of coccidiosis. The GF was increased by phytase but only in uninfected chicks (phytase x coccidiosis, P < 0.02). Toe and tibia ash percentages were decreased (P < 0.01) in chicks fed diets deficient in Ca and NPP, but tibia ash was decreased more by Ca and NPP in healthy chicks than in infected chicks (coccidiosis x Ca and NPP, P < 0.02). Phytase increased (P < 0.02) toe and tibia ash but only in diets deficient in Ca and NPP (phytase x Ca and NPP, P < 0.01). Phytase increased toe ash percentage of healthy chicks fed diets deficient in Ca and NPP, but it had less of an effect in infected chicks fed diets deficient in Ca and NPP (coccidiosis x Ca and NPP x phytase, P < 0.08). Also, phytase was less effective in increasing tibia ash percentage in coccidiosis-infected chicks than in uninfected chicks (phytase x coccidiosis, P < 0.02). These data indicate that phytase is effective in the presence of a coccidial infection, but based on GF and tibia ash percentage, it may not be as effective as in uninfected chicks. Also, phytase increased average daily gain and average daily feed intake in uninfected chicks fed diets formulated to be adequate (or in excess) in all nutrients for male broiler chicks. 3acoccidiosis 3a3-phytase 3apH 3abone density 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 2a6-Phytasexadministration & dosage 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aChickens 2aCoccidiosisxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aDiet 2aEating 2aEimeria 2aMale 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aPoultry Diseasesxparasitologyxphysiopathology. 2aSoybeans 2aWeight Gain 2aZea mays1 aMatthews, Jo.1 aSouthern, L.L.1 aShelton, J.L.0 tPoultry science.g2005 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.910-913x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.6.9103Available from publisher's Web site  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/06/18  aOther US 7aarticle02475naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140072001700158072001700175100001600192245005000208300001600258520088600274650002101160650001901181650001801200650002101218650001501239650005401254650002601308650001201334650005101346650004501397650001301442650000901455650002301464650002101487650003101508650001901539650000901558650002401567650002301591650001401614650001001628700001201638700001401650700001301664773007301677852000901750856007901759930003301838945002501871946001301896655001201909IND4370930420221118042105.0050602e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437093042DNAL7 a159715382pmid7 a10.1093/ps/84.6.9592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The maximum amounts of AFB1 on Mont in aqueous solution at 2 and pH 8 were 613.5 and 628.9 microgram of AFB1 /g of Mont, respectively. The structure of AFB1-Mont was measured by x-ray diffraction and infrared absorption spectrum. The results suggested that the mechanism of AFB1 on Mont was AFB1 sorbed onto the edge of Mont by a double hydrogen bond, and AFB1 molecules did not penetrate into the interlayer area of Mont. The Mont, when added to the diet of broiler chicken at 0.5%, significantly diminished the adverse effects of feeding 200 microgram of AFB1 /kg of feed. And the concentrations of Ca, P, Cu, Fe, Zn in the broiler bones were not affected by AFB1 and Mont, but the concentrations of Mn, Pb, and F were decreased by Mont. 3ahydrogen bonding 3afeed additives 3aaflatoxicosis 3adietary minerals 2aAdsorption 2aAflatoxin B1xadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBentonitexadministration & dosagexchemistry. 2aBone and Bonesxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aChickens 2aDiet 2aFluorinexanalysis 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLeadxanalysis 2aMale 2aManganesexanalysis 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aSolutions 2aWater1 aFan, L.1 aYanhu, Y.1 aNiya, Z.0 tPoultry science.g2005 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.959-961x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.6.9593Available from publisher's Web site  a20070831b20070902c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/06/18  aOther US 7aarticle02884naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139072001700156100002000173245006500193300001600258500001500274520174400289650002302033650001802056650001702074650002902091650001202120650002002132650002702152650001102179653001702190700002002207700001502227773007302242852000902315856007902324930003302403945002502436946001302461655001202474IND4372365020221118042518.0050718e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437236502DNAL7 a10.1093/ps/84.3.4792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCastaneda, M.P.10aFunctionality of electrically stimulated broiler breast meat  ap. 479-481.  a2019-12-04  aPostmortem electrical stimulation (ES) tenderizes meat by acceleration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, pH decline, and physical disruption of muscle fibers. It has been demonstrated that rigor development at elevated temperatures, as with slow chilling, can cause meat to develop pale color and poor water-holding capacity. The objective of this study was to compare the functionality of broiler breast meat from control and electrically stimulated carcasses with and without normal rapid chilling. Broilers were either electrically stimulated (450 mA, 450 V, 2 s on, 2 s off for 7 pulses) immediately after bleeding or used as nonstimulated controls. The ES birds were either chilled immediately (ES2) or had chilling delayed for 2 h at room temperature (ESD2). All ES breast fillets were harvested at 2 h postmortem. The control carcasses were chilled immediately and had fillets harvested at 2 h postmortem (C2) or at 8 h postmortem (C8). Electrical stimulation accelerated pH decline and prevented toughening when breast meat was deboned at 2 h postmortem, regardless of chilling rate. The water released from the gels during cooking was higher for the ESD2 than the ES2 group, which was not different from the C2 group, suggesting that ES followed by slow chilling reduced water-holding capacity compared with the ES2 and C2 groups. There were no differences in expressible moisture, gel strength, or lightness among the ES2, ESD2, and C2 treatments. These results indicated that high voltage ES followed by normal chilling did not impair protein functionality or cause pale, soft, exudative meat. However, there was some evidence that slow chilling after ES may negatively affect some water-holding properties of the meat. 3apostmortem changes 3abreast muscle 3achicken meat 3apale soft exudative meat 3acooling 3ameat tenderness 3awater holding capacity 3aboning 0ameat quality1 aHirschler, E.M.1 aSams, A.R.0 tPoultry science.g2005 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.479-481x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/84.3.4793Available from publisher's Web site  a20050913b00000000c00000000  aINDdJITe2005/08/05  aOther US 7aarticle01812naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245016300143300001600306520082400322650002301146650001901169650001801188650002901206650001601235650001701251650001901268651001201287700001601299773009101315852000901406930003301415946001301448961001301461655001201474IND9001429420221118042512.0900409e198910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900142942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Juss., was evaluated for control of the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), flower thrips, Frankliniella spp., cotton leafperforator, Bucculatrix thurberiella Busck, and spider mites, Tetranychus spp., in small field plots of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., at Phoenix, AZ. A significant (P < 0.05) 60% reduction was observed in the numbers of immature whiteflies on cotton leaves after applications of aqueous sprays containing 160 ppm of azadirachtin (138.7 ml (AI)/ha) but lower concentrations, including the recommended rate of 20 ppm, were ineffective. No consistent effects were observed with the other species. No phytotoxicity was observed in cotton plants after application of the test doses. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aBemisia tabaci 3aFrankliniella 3aBucculatrix thurberiella 3aTetranychus 3aazadirachtin 3ainsect control 3aArizona1 aParks, N.J.0 tJournal of agricultural entomology.g1989 Oct., v. 6, no. 4 p.211-215x0735-939X7nnas  aDNAL  a20120210b20120302c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03637naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010700182300001600289500002400305500001500329520200000344650001702344650001602361650001202377650001802389650001602407650002202423650002202445650001302467650001902480650002602499650002402525650001202549650001202561650001402573650001002587650001602597650001202613650004502625650001302670650001202683650001102695650000902706650002102715650002402736650002402760650002802784650001602812653001602828700002402844700002502868773008502893852000902978856004802987655001203035IND4431703320221118041007.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443170332DNAL7 a199158702pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-009-1482-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNevoux, Marie10aLong- and short-term influence of environment on recruitment in a species with highly delayed maturity  ap. 383-392.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aShort-term effects of environmental perturbations on various life history traits are reasonably well documented in birds and mammals. But, in the present context of global climate change, there is a need to consider potential long-term effects of natal conditions to better understand and predict the consequences of these changes on population dynamics. The environmental conditions affecting offspring during their early development may determine their lifetime reproductive performance, and therefore the number of recruits produced by a cohort. In this study, we attempted to link recruitment to natal and recent (previous year) conditions in the long-lived black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophrys) at Kerguelen Islands. The environmental variability was described using both climatic variables over breeding (sea surface temperature anomaly) and non-breeding grounds (Southern Oscillation index), and variables related to the colony (breeding success and colony size). Immature survival was linked to the breeding success of the colony in the year of birth, which was expected to reflect the average seasonal parental investment. At the cohort level, this initial mortality event may act as a selective filter shaping the number, and presumably the quality (breeding frequency, breeding success probability), of the individuals that recruit into the breeding population. The decision to start breeding was strongly structured by the age of the individuals and adjusted according to recent conditions. An effect of natal conditions was not detected on this parameter, supporting the selection hypothesis. Recruitment, as a whole, was thus influenced by a combination of long- and short-term environmental impacts. Our results highlight the complexity of the influence of environmental factors on such long-lived species, due to the time-lag (associated with a delayed maturity) between the impact of natal conditions on individuals and their repercussion on the breeding population. 3alife history 3aprobability 3aislands 3aage structure 3aparturition 3along term effects 3aearly development 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental factors 3asurface temperature 3amammals 3aprogeny 3amortality 3abirds 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aBreeding 2aClimate 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNesting Behavior 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aTemperature 0arecruitment1 aWeimerskirch, Henri1 aBarbraud, Christophe0 tOecologia.g2010 Feb., v. 162, no. 2 p.383-392dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1482-y 7aarticle02591naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245006800130300001600198520189300214650001102107650002502118700001702143700002002160773007902180852000902259930003302268945001302301946001102314655001202325IND2061532920221118041049.0980127e199611  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206153292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuisman, M.M.H.10aChanges in cell wall polysaccharides from ripening olive fruits  ap. 123-133.  aCell wall material was isolated as alcohol insoluble solids (AIS) from olives at three stages of ripeness. AIS contained 38.8 to 45.6% carbohydrates and 21.5 to 24.8% proteins. Glucose, xylose, arabinose and uronic acids were the major constituent sugars. AIS was sequentially extracted with hot buffer (HBSS), chelating agent (ChSS), dilute alkali (DASS), 1 M alkali (1 M ASS), 4 M alkali (4 M ASS), 4 M alkali + borate (A/BO3(3-), 6 M alkali (6 M ASS) and water (WSS) to leave a cellulose-rich residue (RES). These extracts were characterised by their sugar composition and their molecular weight distribution. The yields, sugar composition, degree of branching and molecular weight distribution of the pectin-rich extracts (HBSS, ChSS, DASS and 6 M ASS) changed during ripening, whereas no significant changes were detected in the other extracts. The degree of branching of the pectins increased with increasing strength of the extractant; the ratio ara:uronic acids increased from 0.46 to 2.59. These extracts were further characterised by their degradability with polygalacturonase (PG) and rhamnogalacturonase (RGase) after chemical saponification. The digests were analysed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC). The amount of oligomers released by PG from pectic material in olive fruits of corresponding extracts from various stages of ripeness decreased with increasing ripening stage. Oligomers released by RGase were formed in similar amounts from corresponding extracts from various stages of ripeness as well as from each extract. HBSS and 6 M ASS were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography. Five pools were obtained for each fractionated extract. HBSS was rich in strongly bound, uronic acid-rich polysaccharides, whereas 6 M ASS was rich in unbound, neutral sugar-rich polysaccharides. 3aolives 3acell wall components1 aSchols, H.A.1 aVoragen, A.G.J.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1996 Nov., v. 31, no. 3 p.123-133x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02229naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008100126300001600207520137100223650002201594650001301616650002501629650001201654650001901666650002101685653001401706653002001720700001801740773007901758852000901837930003301846945001301879946001101892655001201903IND2200885720221118041111.0991001e199811  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220088572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, F.M.10aInfluence of polysaccharide composition in foam stability of espresso coffee  ap. 283-285.  aIn expresso coffee (EC) brew, persistent foam is of great importance as it is responsible for the visual acceptability of the drink and for trapping the volatilized aromas. The foam stability of EC is related to the amount and type of polysaccharides extracted from the roasted ground coffee, where they behave as viscosity improvers. This work relates the changes of the molecular weight of the polysaccharides present in the infusion caused by the roast that the coffees were submitted to and the foam stability of the resulting EC. The polymeric carbohydrates of each EC were precipitated with 55 and 75% ethanol solutions (Et55 and Et75, respectively). Fraction Et55, composed mainly of galactomannans, was fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography and two type of polymers were separated. The polymers that eluted with the void volume (2000 kDa) were inferred to be composed of polysaccharide and protein, possibly products of Maillard reactions caused by the roasting process. The molecular weight of the major fraction was estimated to average 70 kDa. The amount of material recovered with higher molecular weight gave a high correlation with the foam stability of EC. The results show that the amount of material of high molecular weight, in addition to the viscosity of the continuous phase, can also be responsible for the stabilization of the EC foam. 3acoffee (beverage) 3aroasting 3achemical composition 3afoaming 3agalactomannans 3amolecular weight 0astability 0adegree of roast1 aCoimbra, M.A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g1998 Nov., v. 37, no. 3 p.283-285x0144-86177nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01999naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245010500122300001600227500001500243520088900258650001601147650002301163650001201186650001601198650001401214650001801228650001501246650001801261650001301279653002401292653003401316653001301350653001601363653002301379700001601402700001401418773007901432852000901511930003301520945001301553946001101566655001201577IND2205924120221118041003.0000720e199911  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220592412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, H.10aPhysical properties and enzymatic digestibility of hydroxypropylated ae, wx, and normal maize starch  ap. 175-182.  a2019-12-05  aThe physical properties and enzymatic digestibility of hydroxypropylated starches prepared from high amylose (Hi-Maize, 66% amylose; GELOSE 50, 47% amylose), waxy (MAZACA 3401X, 3.3% amylose), and normal (22.4% amylose) maize starches were studied. For normal and high amylose starch, hydroxypropylation decreased the temperature at peak viscosity and caused a large increase in both the peak and cool paste viscosities. Hydroxypropylation had little effect on the pasting properties of waxy starch. All the hydroxypropylated starches had lower gelatinization parameters (To, Tp, Tc, and delta H) than their unmodified and control starches, but hydroxypropylation increased swelling power and solubility. After hydroxypropylation, the hardness and adhesiveness of all the starch gels decreased.

In screening for quality using the Glu-1 scoring system, the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are especially valuable. This information is needed at the earliest stages of breeding to ensure that poor-quality lines are not propagated. Conventionally, glutenin polypeptides have been identified by SDS gel electrophoresis, but this method is slow, labour-intensive and only semi-quantitative. The recent Lab-on-a-Chip technology provides faster micro-fluidic analysis of these proteins at 1 min per analysis (3 min, given instrument conditioning time). To screen breeding lines for dough quality, the Lab-on-a-Chip approach offers quick quantification of specific glutenin subunits with computerized interpretation. To achieve these objectives, we have allocated subunit identities to the peaks in the Lab-on-a-Chip sample profiles, using multiple-deletion lines of wheat and varieties of known composition. The positions of HMW-GS can be used to identify the composition of unknown varieties and breeders' lines by computerized comparison against this established library of profiles from the Lab-on-a-Chip. 3aglutenins 3aprotein subunits 3awheat flour 3acomputer analysis 3arapid methods 3acapillary electrophoresis 3amolecular weight 0ahigh molecular weight glutenin subunits 0aanalytical methods 0aLab-on-a-Chip1 aListiohadi, Y.1 aBaratta, M.1 aBatey, I.L.1 aWrigley, C.W.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 July, v. 44, no. 1 p.34-39dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2006.01.0013electronic resource  a20061031b20061102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03778naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001700181245010000198300001300298500002400311500001500335520205900350650002002409650001402429650001102443650002102454650002102475650001002496650002102506650001602527650002302543650003502566650001702601650002002618650002002638650002502658653002802683653002702711653001402738653002702752653002702779653002602806700001902832700001802851700001702869700001802886700001702904773009602921852000903017856006903026930003303095945002503128946001103153655001203164IND4382960620221118041024.0060821e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2005.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF500 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aLerner, S.E.10aN- and S-fertiliser effects on grain composition, industrial quality and end-use in durum wheat  ap. 2-11.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGrain composition, industrial and end-use qualities were analysed in four cultivars of durum wheat subjected to four different nitrogen (N) and sulphur (S) fertiliser treatments in field trials conducted in two successive years in soils not deficient in S:N1S1 (both N and S applied), N1S0 (N application only), N0S1 (S application only) and N0S0 (no fertiliser application). Characters analysed were grain protein content (%P), grain sulphur content (%S), SDS-sedimentation (SDSS), Farinograph energy level (EL), Farinograph tolerance (TOL) and viscoelasticity of cooked pasta (VISCO). Important differences were found between the results from the 2 years, where all parameters showed superior performance in the year of lower rainfall and higher mean temperatures in the final phase of the crop cycle. Significant differences were observed between fertilisers and between cultivars for all parameters. In spite of the non-limiting conditions for S-availability, S-fertiliser application caused significant differences in grain %P, SDSS and N:S ratio, although it did not generate changes in rheological parameters and end-use; these latter parameters were only influenced by N-fertiliser application. For SDSS, the fertiliser treatment N1S1 was generally the best treatment. SDSS was, in general, strongly correlated with the rheological parameter EL and the end-use parameter VISCO, verifying the potential utility of this small-scale test in early generation selection during breeding. However, one cultivar, Chagual, with a very distinct glutenin and gliadin allelic composition compared to the other three cultivars, showed markedly inferior performance for SDSS and EL, yet acceptable performance for VISCO. Given that previous studies have shown that this cultivar shows superior grain yield compared to the other three cultivars, this sounds a cautionary note for the use of SDSS in breeding: selection based upon SDSS performance would have meant this valuable line would have been eliminated from consideration early in the breeding programme. 3aviscoelasticity 3acultivars 3asulfur 3anutrient content 3anitrogen content 3apasta 3afertilizer rates 3adurum wheat 3asulfur fertilizers 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3awheat gluten 3aprotein content 3acooking quality 3anitrogen fertilizers 0afood processing quality 0afertilizer application 0aN:S ratio 0aSDS sedimentation test 0arheological properties 0anitrogen:sulfur ratio1 aSeghezzo, M.L.1 aMolfese, E.R.1 aPonzio, N.R.1 aCogliatti, M.1 aRogers, W.J.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 July, v. 44, no. 1 p.2-11dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2005.12.0063electronic resource  a20061031b20061102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/10/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245009900176300001400275500002400289520180500313650002002118650002502138650001702163650002502180650001102205650001302216650001402229650001702243650002002260650004202280650003602322650002302358650004202381650002102423650002102444650001302465650001602478650002002494650002502514700002002539700002002559700002202579700002602601700002402627700002302651773010402674852000902778856005502787655001202842IND4413872320221118040819.0081219e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441387232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01174.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-López, Usue14aThe oxidative stress caused by salinity in two barley cultivars is mitigated by elevated CO₂  ap. 29-42.  aIncludes references  aChanges in antioxidant metabolism because of the effect of salinity stress (0, 80, 160 or 240 mM NaCl) on protective enzyme activities under ambient (350 μmol mol⁻¹) and elevated (700 μmol mol⁻¹) CO₂ concentrations were investigated in two barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L., cvs Alpha and Iranis). Electrolyte leakage, peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities [superoxide dismutase (SOD), EC 1.15.1.1; ascorbate peroxidase (APX), EC 1.11.1.11; catalase (CAT), EC 1.11.1.6; dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), EC 1.8.5.1; monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), EC 1.6.5.4; glutathione reductase (GR), EC 1.6.4.2] and their isoenzymatic profiles were determined. Under salinity and ambient CO₂, upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, APX, CAT, DHAR and GR occurred. However, this upregulation was not enough to counteract all ROS formation as both ion leakage and lipid peroxidation came into play. The higher constitutive SOD and CAT activities together with a higher contribution of Cu,Zn-SOD 1 detected in Iranis might possibly contribute and make this cultivar more salt-tolerant than Alpha. Elevated CO₂ alone had no effect on the constitutive levels of antioxidant enzymes in Iranis, whereas in Alpha it induced an increase in SOD, CAT and MDHAR together with a decrease of DHAR and GR. Under combined conditions of elevated CO₂ and salinity the oxidative damage recorded was lower, above all in Alpha, together with a lower upregulation of the antioxidant system. So it can be concluded that elevated CO₂ mitigates the oxidative stress caused by salinity, involving lower ROS generation and a better maintenance of redox homeostasis as a consequence of higher assimilation rates and lower photorespiration, being the response dependent on the cultivar analysed. 3aHordeum vulgare 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abarley 3acatalase 3acultivars 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3alipid peroxidation 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3aoxidative stress 3aphotorespiration 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aRobredo, Anabel1 aLacuesta, Maite1 aSgherri, Cristina1 aMuñoz-Rueda, Alberto1 aNavari-Izzo, Flavia1 aMena-Petite, Amaia0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2009 Jan., v. 135, no. 1 p.29-42dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01174.x 7aarticle02590naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002100155245007400176300001600250500002400266520096400290650001901254650002001273650002101293650002401314650001201338650001501350650001701365650001601382650001701398650001301415650003101428650006001459650002901519650003601548650003001584650002701614650002101641650001101662650003201673650002901705650003601734700002301770700001801793700002001811700001701831700001801848700001801866773010401884852000901988856003901997655001202036IND4432555320221118040809.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443255532DNAL7 a195854682pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.29102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSand, Philipp G.10aCytochrome P450 2C19 inhibitory activity of common berry constituents  ap. 304-307.  aIncludes references  aThe cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C19 is involved in the metabolism of many commonly prescribed drugs, including proton pump inhibitors, antiepileptics and antidepressants. CYP2C19 inhibitors from food and food supplements may augment the toxicity of these agents and lead to noncompliance with treatment. The present investigation addresses CYP2C19 inhibition by 18 berry constituents using a chemiluminescent assay. Test compounds displayed inhibitory properties in a concentration-dependent fashion, with IC₅₀ values ranging from 20.2 μM up to >316 μM. In the order of decreasing effect size, anthocyanidins were followed by anthocyanidin-monoglycosides and procyanidins. Anthocyanidin-diglucosides exhibited weak and biphasic effects. When compared with the CYP2C19 inhibitor fluvoxamine, the flavonoids under study were 50- to 750-fold less potent. It is concluded that the above natural substances are moderate to poor inhibitors of CYP2C19 in vitro. 3aanthocyanidins 3aantidepressants 3acytochrome P-450 3adietary supplements 3aenzymes 3ametabolism 3aprocyanidins 3aproton pump 3asmall fruits 3atoxicity 2aAnthocyaninsxpharmacology 2aAryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFluvoxaminexpharmacology 2aFood-Drug Interactions 2aFruitxchemistry 2aHumans 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aLuminescent Measurements 2aProanthocyanidinsxpharmacology1 aDreiseitel, Andrea1 aStang, Martin1 aSchreier, Peter1 aOehme, Anett1 aLocher, Sanja1 aHajak, Goeran0 tPhytotherapy research.g2010 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.304-307dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2910 7aarticle03027naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001600169245007400185300001600259500002400275520161800299650000801917650001201925650001501937650002301952650001801975650002101993650001002014650002502024650005202049650003402101650001602135650005202151650002402203650003202227650001002259650001302269650001402282650001302296650002502309700001302334700001402347700001502361773009502376852000902471856005302480655001202533IND4402073820221118040640.0080227e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440207382DNAL7 a173211312pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2006.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsang, Y.F.10aTreatment of odorous volatile fatty acids using a biotrickling filter  ap. 589-595.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, a novel fibrous bioreactor was developed for treating odorous compounds present in contaminated air. The first stage of this work was a preliminary study which aimed at investigating the feasibility of using the fibrous bioreactor for the removal of malodorous volatile fatty acids (VFA) that is a common odorous contaminant generated from anaerobic degradation of organic compounds. The kinetics of microbial growth and VFA degradation in the selected culture, and the performance of the submerged bioreactor at different VFA mass loadings were studied. Above 95% of VFA removal efficiencies were achieved at mass loadings up to 22.4g/m³/h. In the second stage, the odour treatment process was scaled up with system design and operational considerations. A trickling biofilter with synthetic fibrous packing medium was employed. The effects of inlet VFA concentration and empty bed retention time (EBRT) on the process performance were investigated. The bioreactor was effective in removing VFA at mass loadings up to 32g/m³/h, beyond which VFA started to accumulate in the recirculation liquid, indicating the biofilm was unable to degrade all of the VFA introduced. Although VFA accumulated in the liquid phase, the removal efficiency remained above 99%. This suggested that the biochemical reaction rather than gas-liquid mass transfer was the limiting step of the treatment process. In addition, the biotrickling filter was stable for long-term operation with relatively low and steady pressure drop, no clogging and degeneration of the packing material occurred during the four-month study. 3aair 3abiofilm 3abiofilters 3achemical reactions 3amass transfer 3amicrobial growth 3aodors 3avolatile fatty acids 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBioreactors 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexisolation & purification 2aFeasibility Studies 2aFiltrationxinstrumentation 2aGases 2aKinetics 2aOdorants. 2aPressure 2aSewagexmicrobiology1 aChua, H.1 aSin, S.N.1 aChan, S.Y.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Feb., v. 99, no. 3 p.589-595dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.12.032 7aarticle02563naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245004500168300001800213520143200231650001301663650001901676650001201695650003201707650002501739650003501764650003301799650002901832650004301861650001101904650002301915651001901938653001701957653001201974700001401986773009802000852000902098939003302107946001302140655001202153IND9003709720221118040754.0900803e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900370972DNAL7 a21167632pmid7 aPMC1845302pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoessner, M.J.10aBacteriophage typing of Listeria species  ap. 1912-1918.  aA bacteriophage typing scheme for differentiating Listeria isolates from dairy products and various other foodstuffs was developed. Sixteen selected phages isolated from both environmental sources and lysogenic strains were used for typing and, according to their lytic spectra, divided into four groups. Thus far, 41 distinct patterns of lysis were seen when this set was used in typing 57 defined reference strains, representing all five confirmed species and 16 serotypes in addition to 454 Listeria isolates of primarily foodborne origin. Overall, typability was 84.5%; i.e., a strain was lysed by at least one phage at 100x routine test dilution. Strains belonging to serovar 3 were mostly resistant to lysis by the phages employed. The results were highly reproducible, as determined in retyping trials several weeks later. Some phages isolated from environmental sources showed a wider lytic spectrum than did those isolated from lysogenic strains. In accordance with this, the phages were found in different clusters within a computer-generated linkage map. Species specificity and serovar specificity of the lytic reaction were not found. None of the phages was able to lyse strains of Listeria grayi, Listeria murrayi or Jonesia denitrificans. This phage typing system may provide important information for a means of recognizing and eliminating sources of contamination by Listeria spp. within dairy plant equipment. 3aListeria 3abacteriophages 3astrains 2aElectronic Data Processing. 2aBacteriophage Typing 2aBacteriophagesxclassification 2aCytopathogenic Effect, Viral 2aListeriaxclassification 2aListeria monocytogenesxclassification 2aSewage 2aWater Microbiology 0aGermany (West) 0atype testing 0aspecies1 aBusse, M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1990 June, v. 56, no. 6 p.1912-1918x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02705naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245008000164300001800244500001500262520150500277650003001782650001301812650001501825650001201840650001801852650004901870650002501919650002701944650001301971650003601984650002602020653001602046653002302062653001502085653003002100773009802130852000902228939003302237946001302270655001202283IND9003708520221118040618.0900803e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900370852DNAL7 a23830132pmid7 aPMC1845082pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, C.R.10aGrowth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens under octopine limitation in chemostats  ap. 1775-1781.  a2019-12-04  aAgrobacterium tumefaciens B6 and ATCC 15955 were grown under octopine or glutamate limitation in chemostats. Examination of the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) and substrate affinity (Ks) for each strain indicated that strain B6 was highly inefficient in its use of octopine as either a nitrogen or carbon source compared with strain ATCC 15955. Examination of the yield coefficients showed that in both strains octopine was used more efficiently as a nitrogen source than as a carbon source. The data permitted predictions to be made concerning the outcome of competition for a single limiting substrate. Under octopine limitation, strain ATCC 15955 should dominate; under glutamate limitation, strain B6 should dominate. The results of an observed competition with glutamate as the limiting substrate confirmed the latter prediction, although B6 did dominate at a rate faster than was predicted from simple competition theory. B6 displayed higher growth rates and substrate affinities than ATCC 15955 on all concentrations of glutamate. The yield of B6 on octopine was also considerably higher. This latter attribute could provide an ecological advantage to B6 because of the importance of yield in the fate of competitions under multisubstrate regimens. These will be the most prevalent regimens in the area around the tumor (tumorosphere) or the rhizosphere. The increased performance on glutamate could provide an advantage in an opine-free environment when B6 is growing as a saprophyte. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aoctopine 3aglutamates 3astrains 3aculture media 2aArgininexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBinding, Competitive 2aGlutamatesxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aRhizobiumxgrowth & development 2aSubstrate Specificity 0agrowth rate 0asubstrate affinity 0asubstrates 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1990 June, v. 56, no. 6 p.1775-1781x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03155naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001600163245010000179300001600279500002400295520142200319650001701741650000901758650001101767650001001778650001001788650001601798650001901814650001701833650002201850650001901872650002201891650002001913650002401933650002501957650001001982650001701992650001802009650003102027650002302058650001402081650002202095700001402117700001402131700001502145700001402160700001502174700001402189700001502203700001502218700001502233773012202248852000902370856006902379930003302448945002502481946001102506655001202517IND4382897520221118040709.0060818e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9064-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aJeong, M.J.12aA rice (Oryza sativa L.)

Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of OsMAPK44 showed high homology with other rice MAPKs. Under normal conditions, the OsMAPK44 gene is highly expressed in root tissues, but relatively less in leaf and stem tissues of the japonica type rice plant (O. sativa L. Donggin). mRNA expression of the gene is highly inducible by salt and drought treatment, but not by cold treatment. Moreover, the mRNA level of the OsMAPK44 is up-regulated by exogenously applied Abscisic acid (ABA) and H2O2. When we compared the OsMAPK44 gene expression level between a salt sensitive indica cultivar (IR64) and a salt resistant indica cultivar (Pokkali), they showed some difference in expression kinetics with the salt treatment. OsMAPK44 gene expression in Pokkali was slightly up-regulated within 30 min and then disappeared rapidly, while IR64 maintained its expression for 1 h following down-regulation. Under the salinity stress, OsMAPK44 overexpression transgenic rice plants showed less damage and greater ratio of potassium and sodium than OsMAPK44 suppressed transgenic lines did, suggesting that OsMAPK44 may have a role to prevent damages due to working for favorable ion balance in the presence of salinity. 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3aleaves 3astems 3aroots 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3awater stress 3adrought tolerance 3aplant proteins 3aprotein synthesis 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3agenetic code 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression regulation 3aDNA fingerprinting 3acultivars 3agenetic variation1 aLee, S.K.1 aKim, B.G.1 aKwon, T.R.1 aCho, W.S.1 aPark, Y.T.1 aLee, J.O.1 aKwon, H.B.1 aByun, M.O.1 aPark, S.C.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 May, v. 85, no. 2 p.151-160dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9064-03electronic resource  a20060824b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02356naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001600172245014500188300001600333500002400349500001500373520073800388650002701126650001801153650001901171650001401190650001801204650002201222650003001244650002001274650001301294650002101307650001201328650002601340650001801366650001101384650001901395653002101414653001601435653003001451653001801481700001501499700001901514773012201533852000901655856006901664930003301733945002501766946001101791655001201802IND4382898920221118040736.0060818e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9073-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF1101 aCosta, M.S.13aAn improved selection strategy and the use of acetosyringone in shoot induction medium increase almond transformation efficiency by 100-fold  ap. 205-209.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn improved almond transformation system was developed with a 100 x increase in efficiency (12.3%) as compared to the existing transformation method (0.1%) in spite of the lower regeneration ability of the explants used. Leaf transformation was performed with Agrobacterium EHA105/p35 SGUSINT. Main modifications introduced in the transformation protocol were the use of 150 μM acetosyringone (AS) during the 21-days induction period, and a different selection strategy. Transformed shoots were assayed using PCR, GUS analyses and Southern blotting. The improved methodology is being applied for transformation of in vitro propagated cultivars and opens the possibility of using almond as model for functional studies in Prunoideae. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aplant breeding 3akanamycin 3adose response 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aselective media 3aexplants 3amicropropagation 3aalmonds 3ain vitro regeneration 3aPrunus dulcis 3aleaves 3aacetosyringone 0ain vitro culture 0amethodology 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aculture media1 aMiguel, C.1 aOliveira, M.M.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 May, v. 85, no. 2 p.205-209dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9073-z3electronic resource  a20060825b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/25  aNon-US 7aarticle04099naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003100113040001800144100001900162245021800181300001800399500002400417506017300441520197900614650001002593650002502603650001802628650000902646650002802655650000902683650002402692650002602716650002702742650001402769650001102783650001502794650001202809650001202821650002002833650001602853650002402869650001702893650001502910650001402925650001702939650001102956650001102967650001402978651002402992700002503016700001703041700001503058773014003073852000903213856011203222856004403334956009803378961000903476655001203485IND4462538720221118040654.0120104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446253872DNAL7 a10113/549382hdl7 a10.2527/jas.2011-40582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKronberg, S.L.14aThe effect of flaxseed supplementation on growth, carcass characteristics, fatty acid profile, retail shelf life, and sensory characteristics of beef from steers finished on grasslands of the northern Great Plains  ap. 2892-2903.  aIncludes references  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe objective of this trial was to determine if daily supplementation of flaxseed for 85 d to steers finished on grasslands of the northern Great Plains would influence growth and carcass characteristics or the fatty acid profile, tenderness, and sensory characteristics of beef steaks. Eighteen Angus yearling steers (initial BW 399 ± 21 kg) were randomly divided into 3 groups. Steers in treatment 1 (FLX; n = 6) received a daily supplement of ground flaxseed (0.20% of BW), whereas steers in treatment 2 (CSBM; n = 6) received a daily supplement of ground corn and soybean meal (0.28% of BW), with contents of CP and TDN being similar to the supplement for FLX. Control steers (CONT; n = 6) were not supplemented. Treatments were given to each individual steer in side-by-side stalls and were fed from mid-August to November 7, 2007, the day before slaughter. All steers grazed growing forage from early May through the first week of November. Growth rate of steers fed FLX was 25% greater (P < 0.01) than that of steers fed CONT, but was similar (P = 0.45) to that of steers fed CSBM. No differences were observed for carcass characteristics (P ≥ 0.14), tenderness (Warner-Bratzler shear force; P ≥ 0.24), or sensory attributes (P ≥ 0.40) except for a slight off-flavor detected in steaks from steers fed FLX compared with CONT (7.4 vs. 7.8, respectively, with 8 indicating no off-flavor and 1 indicating extreme off-flavor; P = 0.07) and CSBM (7.9; P = 0.01). The n-3 fatty acids α-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid were 62 and 22% greater, respectively, in beef from steers fed FLX compared with those fed CONT (P < 0.001). The ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids was smaller (P < 0.001) in beef from steers fed FLX compared with the ratios in beef from steers fed CONT and CSBM. Daily supplementation of flaxseed to steers grazing growing vegetation on the northern Great Plains may improve growth rate and enhance the n-3 fatty acid profile of the steaks. 3aAngus 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aanimal growth 3abeef 3acarcass characteristics 3acorn 3adietary supplements 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afinishing 3aforage 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3alinseed 3ameat tenderness 3aoff flavors 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3ashear stress 3ashelf life 3aslaughter 3asoybean meal 3asteaks 3asteers 3ayearlings 3aGreat Plains region1 aScholljegerdes, E.J.1 aLepper, A.N.1 aBerg, E.P.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.2892-2903dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x1525-31637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/549383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2011-4058  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111964_Publ1088_Kronberg_EJS_et_al.pdf  aUSDA 7aarticle03780naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245008100180300001600261500002400277500001500301520208900316650001302405650001802418650002402436650002102460650002402481650001802505650001402523650002502537650002802562650001302590650002302603650002902626650002502655650002002680650002602700650001802726650004302744653002102787653002902808653001202837700001502849700001302864700001402877700001502891700001402906773012302920852000903043856006903052930003303121945002503154946001103179655001203190IND4382890520221118040729.0060818e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9032-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF2001 aSteinitz, B.12aA simple plant regeneration-ability assay in a range of Lycopersicon species  ap. 269-278.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlant growth regulator-dependent (PGR-dependent) in vitro shoot organogenesis has been extensively studied in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), whereas PGR-independent adventitious shoot organogenesis received marginal attention in L. esculentum and no consideration at all in other Lycopersicon species. In the present study, induction of PGR-independent adventitious shoots was by decapitation of the apex and removal of preexisting shoot meristems of the seedling, and seedling culture on a medium with no PGR supplements. The existence of PGR-independent regeneration-ability was verified in L. esculentum genotypes (high pigment photomorphogenic mutants and wild-type counterparts) and was uncover amongst L.x cheesmanii, L. chilense, L. chmielewskii, L. hirsutum, L. parviflorum, L.x peruvianum and L. pimpinellifolium. Compared to species other than L. esculentum, high pigment photomorphogenic mutants displayed the weakest PGR-independent regeneration-ability. Our results imply that decapitated seedlings cultured on a medium without PGRs can serve as a convenient assay system for genotypic variation in self-controlled, PGR-independent, shoot regeneration-ability in a wide range of Lycopersicon species. Using transverse thin slices of the hypocotyl placed onto a medium supplemented with 0.2 μM zeatin reboside and 0.04 μM IAA, we assessed PGR-mediated shoot regeneration in L. esculentum genotypes. In a given genotype, more plants per seedling were established by PGR-mediated than by PGR-independent regeneration. However, with both modes of organogenesis, only a fraction of shoot buds eventually grew into normal plants, while others developed into abnormal regenerants having no stem. Percentage of stem-deficiency, in a given genotype, was higher in PGR-treated cultures, which indicates that PGRs amplify the formation frequency of imperfect adventitious apical shoot meristems. Unlike L. esculentum, adventitious shoot buds of other Lycopersicon species, induced by wounding seedlings that were not treated with PGRs, rarely formed regenerants lacking a stem. 3atomatoes 3aorganogenesis 3aSolanum cheesmaniae 3aSolanum chilense 3aadventitious shoots 3adose response 3aseedlings 3aSolanum habrochaites 3aplant growth substances 3aexplants 3aSolanum peruvianum 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3aSolanum chmielewskii 3ashoot meristems 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0ain vitro culture 0aLycopersicon parviflorum 0aSolanum1 aAmitay, A.1 aGaba, V.1 aTabib, Y.1 aKeller, M.1 aLevin, I.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.269-278dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9032-83electronic resource  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02445naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001500172245007900187300001600266500002400282500001500306520087000321650001301191650002101204650001801225650001301243650001801256650002201274650001601296650001501312650001501327650002501342650002101367650001301388650002201401650001201423650001301435650002601448650001801474650001101492653001501503653002701518700001601545700001701561700001901578773012301597852000901720856006901729930003301798945002501831946001101856655001201867IND4382890120221118040637.0060818e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438289012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9029-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF200 0aF4001 aStanys, V.10aIn vitro induction of polyploidy in japanese quince (Chaenomeles japonica)  ap. 263-268.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn vitro conditions for Japanese quince polyploidisation were investigated.

Morphogenesis was more dependent on the concentration of colchicine or oryzalin than on the duration of exposure, genotype differences were observed. Low oryzalin concentrations had no impact on morphogenesis. Plants with changed chromosome numbers were obtained at 0.25-38 mM colchicine and 10-50 μM oryzalin concentrations. It was determined that stomata length is a suitable parameter for identifying putative Japanese quince tetraploids. Stomata of tetraploid shoots of the same clone were approximately 1/3 longer than in the diploids. It was shown that through polyploidisation gigas effect was not obtained in fruit size but tetraploids have reduced seed set and an increased proportion of fruit flesh. 3aoryzalin 3ain vitro culture 3adose response 3adiploidy 3amorphogenesis 3achromosome number 3atetraploidy 3acotyledons 3acolchicine 3aChaenomeles japonica 3aplant morphology 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3astomata 3aseed set 3ain vitro regeneration 3aculture media 3ashoots 0apolyploidy 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aWeckman, A.1 aStaniene, G.1 aDuchovskis, P.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 Mar., v. 84, no. 3 p.263-268dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-68577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9029-33electronic resource  a20060823b20060906c00000000  aINDdMKSe2006/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03244naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002100181245010900202300001800311500002400329500001500353520161900368650001101987650001701998650002202015650003502037650001202072650002102084650001402105650001602119650001802135650001502153650002302168650001102191650001902202650002002221650002202241653002002263653002702283700001702310700001602327773008902343852000902432856008502441856009302526930003302619945002502652946001302677655001202690IND4382875420221118040725.0060817s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287542DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606007675752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aJ500 0aF600 0aF1101 aTabatabaei, S.J.10aEffect of ammonium: nitrate ratio on yield, calcium concentration, and photosynthesis rate in strawberry  ap. 1273-1285.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of ammonium:nitrate (NH4:NO3) ratio in nutrient solution on growth, photosynthesis (Pn), yield, and fruit quality attributes in hydroponically grown strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch) cvs. 'Camarosa' and 'Selva' was evaluated. There were four nutrient solutions of differing NH4:NO3 ratios as follows: 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, and 75:25. Plants grown in solution with 75% NH4 had lower leaf fresh and dry weights and leaf area than those with 25% NH4 in both cultivars. High ratios of NH4 and NO3 in the solution always reduced the yield. The yield was increased by 38% and 84% in 'Camarosa' and 'Selva,' respectively, when the plants were grown in the 25NH4:75NO3 solution compared with plants grown in a higher NH4 ratio solution. The increased yield at the 25 NH4:75NO3 ratio was the result of the increase in fruit size, i.e., length and fresh weight of fruits. Plants grown in the 25NH4:75NO3 solution had the highest rate of Pn, while those grown in 75NH4:25NO3 solution had the lowest Pn rates in both cultivars. Increasing the NH4 ratio in the solution from 0 to 75% significantly reduced the calcium (Ca) concentration and postharvest life of the fruits in both cultivars. Both higher leaf area and Pn rate appeared to be the reason for the increased yield and plant growth in the 25:75 ratios of nitrogen (N). The results indicate the preference of strawberry plant growth toward a greater nitrate N form in a hydroponic solution. Therefore, a combination of two forms of N in an appropriate ratio (25NH4:75NO3) appears to be beneficial to plant growth, yield, and quality of strawberry fruits. 3aweight 3astrawberries 3aFragaria ananassa 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3acalcium 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaf area 3ahydroponics 3afruit quality 3acrop yield 3anutrient solutions 3alength 3aphotosynthesis 3amineral content 3aammonium nitrogen 0aplant nutrition 0afruits (plant anatomy)1 aFatemi, L.S.1 aFallahi, E.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 7 p.1273-1285dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606007675753Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/14  aOther US 7aarticle01958naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001900163245013900182300001600321500002400337500001500361520043400376650002900810650001500839650001800854650002400872650002900896650001500925650001900940650002300959653002400982653002201006700002001028700002101048700001801069700002101087700002301108773008701131852000901218856008501227856009301312930003301405945002501438946001301463655001201476IND4382874120221118040721.0060817s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287412DNAL7 a10.1080/019041606006491382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ5001 aKosareva, I.A.10aComparative analysis of impact of the complex vitreous fertilizers with microelements on the microflora of sod-podzolic and peat soils  ap. 933-942.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhosphate glasses have been studied in connection with the general topic of slow-release fertilizers since the 1940s.

The microbial inoculants--BGA, PSB, VAMF, and Azospirillum--positively interacted with one another, resulting in significant improvement in yield and nutritional parameters. Application of biofertilizers also substantially improved soil (peat) fertility status by increasing the nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and organic carbon content. The biofertilizer combination BGA + PSB + VAMF + Azospirillum was best for improved growth and yield traits, nutritional status of rice, and sustained soil (peat) fertility. Azolla, which is a highly competitive organism, suppressed the growth of the other four inoculants. The inclusion of VAMF and PSB was observed to significantly improve the zinc nutrition of the paddy and the P utilization of the applied rock phosphate. A basal dose of nitrogenous fertilizer was essential for deriving maximum benefits from applied inoculants, thereby underlying the supplementary/complementary role of biofertilizers in efficient nutrient management in agriculture. 3asoil inoculation 3aplant growth 3arice 3abeneficial organisms 3aplant nutrition 3amicrobial competition 3aOryza sativa 3anutrient availability 3asoil quality 3abiofertilizers 3asoil microorganisms 3agrain yield 3asoil fertility 3aorganic fertilizers 3ainoculum 0afertilizers1 aKaushik, B.D.1 aPrasanna, R.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2006, v. 29, no. 5 p.857-871dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/019041606006518033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080605b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/13  aOther US 7aarticle02864naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245015600214300001800370500002400388500001500412506007600427520134800503506003701851650001901888650001301907650001801920650001101938650002201949650001401971650001101985650001601996650001302012650001102025650001802036653003802054700002502092700002002117700002102137700001902158773011702177852000902294856009102303655001202394IND4370572720221207101405.0050529s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437057272DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.73.6.3659-3667.20052doi7 aPMC11118792pmcid7 a159083952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNulty, Kelly M.10aCharacterization of CD8⁺ T Cells and Microenvironment in Oral Lesions of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Persons with Oropharyngeal Candidiasis  ap. 3659-3667.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), the most common oral infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive persons, correlates with reduced blood CD4⁺ T cells. In those with OPC, CD8⁺ T cells accumulate at the lamina propria-epithelium interface at a distance from the organism at the outer epithelium. The present study aimed to characterize the tissue-associated CD8⁺ T cells and tissue microenvironment in both OPC⁺ and OPC⁻ persons. The results show that the majority of CD8⁺ T cells possess the [alpha]{szligbeta} T-cell receptor, the thymus-derived [alpha]{szligbeta} CD8 antigen heterodimer, and similar levels of the [alpha]₄{szligbeta}₇, [alpha]₄{szligbeta}₁, and [alpha][subscript e]{szligbeta}₇ homing receptors. Studies to evaluate the tissue microenvironment showed that in OPC⁺ persons, the adhesion molecule for T cells to enter mucosa, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule, is significantly increased, whereas E-cadherin, which allows T cells to migrate through mucosa, is significantly decreased compared to OPC⁻ persons. These results continue to support a role for CD8⁺ T cells against OPC under conditions of reduced numbers of CD4⁺T cells, with susceptibility to infection potentially associated with a dysfunction in mucosal CD8⁺ T-cell migration by reduced tissue-associated E-cadherin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahuman diseases 3aantigens 3aT-lymphocytes 3ahumans 3aimmunosuppression 3areceptors 3amucosa 3acandidiasis 3aadhesion 3apeople 3acell adhesion 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aPlianrungsi, Jananya1 aLeigh, Janet E.1 aMercante, Donald1 aFidel, Paul L.0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 June, v. 73, no. 6 p.3659-3667dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.6.3659-3667.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02867naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002200192245008300214300001800297500002400315506007600339520092600415506003701341650002401378650001801402650001301420650001401433650002101447650000901468650002601477650001401503650002701517650001201544650001101556650003501567650002601602650000901628650002301637650002401660650003101684650004801715650002801763650004901791650003001840650002901870650001401899700001901913700002301932700002201955700001801977700002201995700001902017773011702036852000902153856009102162655001202253IND4370571920221207101410.0050529s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437057192DNAL7 a159083872pmid7 aPMC11118312pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.73.6.3577-3586.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlórido, Manuela10aGamma Interferon-Induced T-Cell Loss in Virulent Mycobacterium avium Infection  ap. 3577-3586.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInfection by virulent Mycobacterium avium caused progressive severe lymphopenia in C57BL/6 mice due to increased apoptosis rates. T-cell depletion did not occur in gamma interferon (IFN-[gamma])-deficient mice which showed increased T-cell numbers and proliferation; in contrast, deficiency in nitric oxide synthase 2 did not prevent T-cell loss. Although T-cell loss was IFN-[gamma] dependent, expression of the IFN-[gamma] receptor on T cells was not required for depletion. Similarly, while T-cell loss was optimal if the T cells expressed IFN-[gamma], CD8⁺ T-cell depletion could occur in the absence of T-cell-derived IFN-[gamma]. Depletion did not require that the T cells be specific for mycobacterial antigen and was not affected by deficiencies in the tumor necrosis factor receptors p55 or p75, the Fas receptor (CD95), or the respiratory burst enzymes or by forced expression of bcl-2 in hematopoietic cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3ainterferon-gamma 3amice 3anitric oxide synthase 3areceptors 3atumor necrosis factors 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aInterferon-gammaxbiosynthesis 2aLymphopeniaxetiology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMycobacterium avium 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesis 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2xphysiology 2aReactive Oxygen Species 2aReceptors, Tumor Necrosis Factorxphysiology 2aT-Lymphocytesxphysiology 2aTuberculosisximmunology 2aVirulence1 aPearl, John E.1 aSolache, Alejandra1 aBorges, Margarida1 aHaynes, Laura1 aCooper, Andrea M.1 aAppelberg, Rui0 tInfection and immunity.g2005 June, v. 73, no. 6 p.3577-3586dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.73.6.3577-3586.20053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03200naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001900172245007600191300001600267500002400283520145600307650001201763650001001775650001401785650001001799650002201809650001601831650002201847650001801869650001301887650001401900650001901914650002401933650002001957650001501977650002401992650001902016650002202035650001802057650000702075651001102082651001902093651001202112700001802124700002002142700001502162700002202177700001602199700001702215700001602232700001402248700001502262773009802277852000902375856008502384930003302469945002502502946001102527655001202538IND4382967420221118040832.0060821e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2005.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ104 0aT3001 aEckert, R. van10aTowards a new gliadin reference material-isolation and characterisation  ap. 331-341.  aIncludes references  aTwenty-eight wheat cultivars representative of the three main European wheat producing countries, France, UK and Germany, were selected as a source for the preparation of a reference gliadin. One kilogram of kernels from each cultivar were mixed and milled. The resulting white flour was defatted and vacuum dried. Albumins and globulins were eliminated by extraction using 0.4 M NaCl solution and gliadins were extracted with 60% ethanol. The gliadin extracts were concentrated, desalted by ultrafiltration, freeze-dried, and homogenised. After tests had shown good solubility and homogeneity, aliquots of the reference gliadin were sent to 16 different laboratories for further investigations: The material was analysed by various methods including RP-HPLC, SE-HPLC, RP-HPLC-ESI-MS, MALDI-TOF, capillary electrophoresis, acid-PAGE, 2D-PAGE, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and ELISA-tests with different monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The results showed that the gliadin composition of the source flour and the reference gliadin matched perfectly, demonstrating that no major gliadin components had been lost during the isolation procedure. The reference gliadin showed good immunochemical sensitivity with different gliadin antibodies in enzyme immunoassays. Because of its high protein and gliadin content, good solubility, homogeneity, stability and representative character, the product is regarded as a suitable universal reference material. 3agliadin 3awheat 3acultivars 3aseeds 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat flour 3adefatted products 3avacuum drying 3aalbumins 3aglobulins 3aplant extracts 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aprotein content 3asolubility 3areference standards 3aceliac disease 3agluten-free foods 3awater content 3apH 3aFrance 3aUnited Kingdom 3aGermany1 aBerghofer, E.1 aCiclitira, P.J.1 aChirdo, F.1 aDenery-Papini, S.1 aEllis, H.J.1 aFerranti, P.1 aGoodwin, P.1 aImmer, U.1 aMamone, G.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.331-341dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2005.12.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20080116b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03090naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001600172245011300188300001600301500002400317500001500341520130000356650001601656650002301672650002101695650002401716650001801740650002101758650002301779650001601802650002401818650002101842650002101863650001601884650002001900650001801920650001401938650001401952650001801966650001401984650002101998650001802019650001202037653001102049653001202060700001502072700001502087700001702102700002302119700002202142700001502164773009802179852000902277856008502286930003302371945002502404946001102429655001202440IND4382965320221118040902.0060821e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2005.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ114 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aBowen, S.E.10aLipid oxidation and amylopectin molecular weight changes occurring during storage of extruded starch samples  ap. 275-283.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUsing thermomechanical extrusion, waxy maize starch and 4% (w/w) lipid were formed into strips. The lipids used were free fatty acids (mostly linoleic) and antioxidant stripped sunflower oil (either previously oxidised or fresh, with and without copper ions). By altering their water content it was possible to store, at the same temperature, sample strips in the glassy and rubbery states. Lipid oxidation was monitored by determining hexanal in the headspace above all stored samples. The molecular weights of the amylopectin in the samples of extruded products (dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, precipitated and redissolved using a pressure cell) were determined by asymmetric flow-field-flow fractionation, analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering. The initial rate of hexanal generation was higher in samples stored in the glassy state compared with those in the rubbery state. Waxy maize and extruded samples, at the start of the storage period and after 42 days, were used to establish the molecular weight of the amylopectin. A significant fall (a decrease of approximately40%) in molecular weight was found on storage of samples containing sunflower oil and copper ions and those containing free fatty acids, irrespective of the method used for molecular weight determination. 3abiopolymers 3alipid peroxidation 3afree fatty acids 3aultracentrifugation 3asunflower oil 3arefractive index 3aheadspace analysis 3aamylopectin 3astorage temperature 3amolecular weight 3aglass transition 3acorn starch 3astorage quality 3awater content 3aextrusion 3arancidity 3alipid content 3awaxy corn 3alight scattering 3afree radicals 3astorage 0astarch 0ahexanal1 aGray, D.A.1 aGiraud, C.1 aMajzoobi, M.1 aMillan Testa, C.E.1 aBello Perez, L.A.1 aHill, S.E.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.275-283dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2005.08.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080116b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02616naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245008400147300001600231500001500247520092400262650002301186650001701209650002701226650000901253650001401262650000901276650001601285650002001301650001901321650001101340650002801351650001601379650002201395650001201417650002301429650003701452650002401489650005001513650002801563650001101591650003101602650001801633650001801651650002001669650003201689650000901721650001701730650002901747650002401776653002301800653002701823700001701850773008001867852000901947939003301956946001301989655001202002IND9302013420221118040854.0930406e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201342DNAL7 a84168362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJursnich, V.A.12aA positive role in differentiation for the male doublesex protein of Drosophila  ap. 235-249.  a2019-12-04  aThe doublesex (dsx) locus encodes male-specific and female-specific polypeptides that are essential for the proper differentiation of sexually dimorphic somatic features of Drosophila melanogaster. Ectopic expression of the male-specific dsx polypeptide was obtained by P-element-mediated transformation of flies with a construct bearing a fusion between the hsp70 heat shock promoter and dsx male-specific cDNA sequences. Heat shock-induced expression of the male cDNA in either sex resulted in three novel phenotypes: transformation of bristles on all legs toward a sex comb-like morphology, pigmentation of dorsal spinules and ventral setae in third-instar larvae, and lethality. These results were not predicted by previous models of dsx function, and provide evidence that the role of the male dsx protein includes activation of some aspects of male differentiation as well as repression of female differentiation. 3asexual development 3apolypeptides 3agenetic transformation 3aloci 3aphenotype 3alegs 3aheat stress 3agene expression 3asetae (animal) 3alarvae 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3atransposons 3asexual dimorphism 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxphysiology 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgrowth & development 2aExtremitiesxembryology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Insect 2aGenes, Lethal 2aHot Temperature 2aInsect Hormonesxphysiology 2aMale 2aPigmentation 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aSex Differentiation 0aectopic expression 0aanatomy and morphology1 aBurtis, K.C.0 tDevelopmental biology.g1993 Jan., v. 155, no. 1 p.235-249x0012-16067nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02343naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245008100140300001400221520114000235650002801375650001401403650001901417650001001436650001301446650001601459650002701475650002501502650001601527650001201543650001801555650006201573650002201635650000901657650005001666650002201716700002001738700001801758773007801776852000901854939003301863946001301896655001201909IND9302013120221118040851.0930406e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201312DNAL7 a84168392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, K.10aDevelopment of the taste bristles on the labellum of Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 26-37.  aThe taste bristles of the adult labellum develop from the labial discs within the first 30 hr of pupation. The neuron-specific antibody Mab22C10 and the tissue-specific beta-galactosidase activity in the A37 strain were used as cell markers for the developing sensilla. These experiments revealed that the sensory progenitors of all the labellar bristles are specified in three waves occurring 0, 6, and 16 hr after pupation. The incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) into the cells of the developing proboscis further supports the temporal pattern of the sensillum specification. Mitotic activity in the bristles specified in the first wave is completed before the next wave is initiated. The eight cells that constitute a single bristle share a common lineage. The trichogen and tormogen cells are siblings from a single progenitor and the thecogen and the five neurons share a common ancestry. Our results provide a basis for the identification of molecules that specify the development of the polyinnervated bristles of the adult and the specification of neurons with different stimulus specificities. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aproboscis 3asetae (animal) 3ataste 3asensilla 3ainnervation 3abiological development 3aimmunohistochemistry 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aCell Division 2aDrosophila melanogasterxanatomy & histologyxembryology. 2aNeuronsxcytology 2aPupa 2aSensory Receptor Cellsxgrowth & development. 2aTastexphysiology1 aHartenstein, V.1 aRodrigues, V.0 tDevelopmental biology.g1993 Jan., v. 155, no. 1 p.26-37x0012-16067nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03322naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011700146300001800263520166500281650001401946650001501960650001601975650001701991650002502008650000802033650001802041650002402059650001002083650003702093650001602130650002802146650002802174650003302202650001502235650000902250650004302259650004302302650001102345650004702356650001802403650000902421650001602430650002302446650002702469650004202496653001702538700001602555700001702571700001602588773008502604852000902689939003302698946001302731655001202744IND9302018220221118040740.0930406e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201822DNAL7 a14315972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEverson, G.T.10aEffects of psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid on LDL-cholesterol and bile acid synthesis in hypercholesterolemic men  ap. 1183-1192.  aThe goal of the current study was to determine the mechanism of the hypocholesterolemic effect of psyllium using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Twenty males (age 44 +/- 4 yr, weight 79 +/- 10 kg) with moderate hypercholesterolemia (total 265 +/- 17 mg/dl, low density lipoprotein (LDL) 184 +/- 15 mg/dl) were studied at baseline (B) and after randomization to receive a 40-day course of 15 g/day of either psyllium (Ps) or placebo (Pl) (cellulose). After a washout period (11 +/- 2 days), subjects were crossed over to the other fiber treatment for an additional 40 days and restudied. Intestinal cholesterol absorption, cholesterol synthesis in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bile acid kinetics, gallbladder motility, and intestinal transit were measured at each study period. Psyllium lowered LDL cholesterol (x:184 (B), 169 (Ps), and 179 (Pl) mg/dl; Ps vs. B,Pl: P < 0.004, P < 0.02), decreased relative cholesterol absorption (mean:51 (B), 45 (Ps), and 49 (Pl)%; Ps vs. B,Pl: P < 0.03, P < 0.03), did not alter absolute cholesterol absorption, and increased the fractional turnover of both chenodeoxycholic acid (mean:0.176 (B), 0.203 (Ps), and 0.170 (Pl) day-1; Ps vs. B,Pl: P < 0.0001, P < 0.01) and cholic acid (mean: 0.303 (B), 0.411 (Ps), and 0.301 (Pl) d-1; Ps vs. B, Pl: P < 0.006, P < 0.002). Bile acid synthesis increased in subjects whose LDL cholesterol was lowered by more than 10% (Ps vs. B: 1304 +/- 489 vs 992 +/- 307 micromoles/day, P < 0.006; Ps vs. Pl: 1304 +/- 489 vs. 914 +/- 321 micromoles/day, P < 0.0002). We conclude that psyllium lowers LDL cholesterol primarily via stimulation of bile acid synthesis. 3amucilages 3abile acids 3acholesterol 3abiosynthesis 3ahypercholesterolemia 3amen 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 2aAdult 2aBile Acids and Saltsxmetabolism 2aBody Weight 2aCellulosexpharmacology 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aCholesterol, LDLxmetabolism 2aDefecation 2aDiet 2aGallbladderxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGastrointestinal Transitxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aHypercholesterolemiaxmetabolismxtherapy. 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPatient Compliance 2aPsylliumxpharmacology 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 0atransit time1 aDaggy, B.P.1 aMcKinley, C.1 aStory, J.A.0 tJournal of lipid research.g1992 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.1183-1192x0022-22757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01991naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002300128245010500151300001400256500001500270520080200285650001501087650001501102650002801117650001201145650003501157650002201192650003701214650003801251650002001289650002601309650005101335650001201386653002801398653001801426773009401444852000901538939003301547946001301580655001201593IND9302019720221118040641.0930406e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201972DNAL7 a17968112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahasrabudhe, N.A.10aImmunological and molecular genetic analysis of the cellulase component from Penicillium funiculosum  ap. 37-41.  a2019-12-04  aFollowing immunization of rabbits, the antiserum was initially analyzed for antiendoglucanase activity using dot-blot ELISA methods.

The specificity of the polyclonal antibodies, raised against the partially purified endoglucanase component of Penicillium funiculosum, was determined by Ouchterlony double diffusion. Rocket electrophoresis confirmed the presence of only two types of antigens in the serum. The two rockets obtained were attributable to endo I and the merging of immunologically identical (but mobilitywise different) endo II and endo III. This antibody preparation was used as a probe.

Most seed-bearing plant embryos contain suspensor regions, which occur in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, and suspensor-like structures are present in the embryos of some lower land plants. Recent technological advances, including novel genomics approaches, have provided insights into the function of the suspensor and the DNA sequences that control suspensor-specific gene expression. The molecular mechanisms controlling embryo basal-cell lineage specification and suspensor differentiation events are also beginning to be illuminated. Here, we summarize the role of the suspensor in plant embryogenesis and discuss future directions of suspensor biology, including the dissection of suspensor gene regulatory networks. 3anutrient transport 3aplant hormones 3aplant nutrition 3aembryo (plant) 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenomics 3aembryogenesis 3apolytene chromosomes 3aapoptosis 2aCell Lineage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Regulatory Networks 2aGenomics 2aPlant Cells 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aSeedsxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aseeds 0aplant anatomy 0aliterature reviews1 aGoldberg, Robert B.0 tTrends in plant science.g2010 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.23-30dElsevier Science Ltd.x1360-13857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2009.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100308b20100403c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03717naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001900181245015600200300001600356500002400372520204000396650001302436650000902449650001602458650002302474650001702497650002302514650002602537650002502563650002602588650001102614650002102625650002102646650002302667650001802690650001602708650002102724650000902745650001502754650001502769651001002784653001602794700002602810700002702836773011302863852000902976856008502985930003303070945002503103946001103128655001203139IND4431376020221118040759.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2009.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aX100 0aF120 0aF6001 aKaterji, Nader10aEffects of corn deficit irrigation and soil properties on water use efficiency. A 25-year analysis of a Mediterranean environment using the STICS model  ap. 177-185.  aIncludes references  aThis study analyses the role of variability induced by climate and soil properties (texture and total available soil water in the root zone, TAW) on the "corn deficit irrigation-water use efficiency" relation over a 25-year period, between 1981 and 2005, in three different sites located in the South of Italy. The analysis of water use efficiency was carried out by means of three indexes: crops water use efficiency (WUEET and WUET) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). These indexes can be obtained by calculating the ratio between the yield and the seasonal values of evapotranspiration (ET), transpiration (T) and irrigation volume (I). After its validation, the STICS model was retained to simulate the variables required to determine these indexes. Climatic variability affected the three indexes in different ways during the 25-year period studied. The dispersion around the mean values of the water use efficiency is 17% on average for the WUE (ET or T) indexes, whereas it could reach 54% for the IWUE index. This last index is only poorly reliable due to the high variability of rainfall during the corn growing season in the Mediterranean region. For the same level of soil water deficit, TAW led to an improvement (the case of the site with a high TAW and loam-clay soil texture), a stabilisation (the case of the site with a high TAW and clay soil texture) or a decrease (the case of the site with a poor TAW and clay soil texture) in WUEET and WUET values. For the same conditions of soil water deficit and TAW, crops water use efficiency was higher in loam textured soil than in clay soil. The results derived by analyzing three indexes (WUEET, WUET and IWUE) converge to the same conclusions on the "corn deficit irrigation-water use efficiency" relation observed at the three different sites. The hypotheses which may explain the differences observed in the different sites studied in terms of water use efficiency are discussed, with the presentation of some suggestions devised for corn irrigation practices. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain crops 3adeficit irrigation 3asoil texture 3asoil water content 3aplant available water 3awater use efficiency 3aMediterranean climate 3amodels 3airrigation water 3airrigation rates 3aevapotranspiration 3atranspiration 3acalibration 3amodel validation 3arain 3aloam soils 3aclay soils 3aItaly 0aSTICS model1 aMastrorilli, Marcello1 aCherni, Houssem Eddine0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2010 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.177-185dElsevier Science Pub.

Its being intractable is rather due to the global approach being employed instead of formulating and applying solutions based on specific locations with an understanding of the social system and livelihood activities. It is necessary to include food availability, affordability and accessibility as factors underpinning food security. Farm and related activities dominated the livelihood activities of the respondents to which individuals engaged in multiple activities. Much income inequality was demonstrated by the food items consumed and this highlighted the level of food insecurity among the respondents. Access to quality food was not the problem but rather affordability, and this limited most people to consuming lower quality food items. This established the existence of food insecurity in the area and necessitated the engagement of coping strategies by the people. All coping strategies engaged, however, exacerbated the level of food insecurity rather than reduce it. The strategies did not alleviate insecurity but ensured the continued existence of the people even if other living standards are compromised. For the respondents, food security is not an issue but rather survival. 3arural areas 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3acoping strategies 3aaffordability 3aNigeria0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.187-191x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03385naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001800128245011100146300001600257500002400273520234900297650003502646650003102681650002302712650001502735650001202750651002102762773009702783852000902880856008902889930003302978945002503011946001103036655001203047IND4431524920221118040741.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443152492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aL2001 aOguz, Ozdemir10aAttitudes of consumers toward the effects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs): The example of Turkeye  ap. 159-165.  aIncludes references  aThis study was conducted as a part of the project entitled “Knowledge about and Disposition toward Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) of Consumers in Turkey” prepared for the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK). The study explored the attitudes of consumers in Turkey regarding the effects of GMOs on human and environmental health effects, their socio-economic impact and their control. The research was performed according to a stratified sampling model on the basis of a sampling that could be representative of the whole of Turkey (minimum of n 2431). Within this framework, face-to-face interviews were held with subjects of different genders, ages, education and income levels, guided by an interview form that was developed by the researcher. The research data was collected by means of the interview form’s subscale, “Attitudes Toward the Effects of GMOs.” The sub-scale is a 5-point Likert-type scale made up of 14 items rating the participants’ attitudes toward the effects of GMOs on “human and environmental health” (6 items) socio-economic structure” (4 items) and on “control” (4 items). The data was analyzed on an SPSS 15.00 statistics program using the Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient tests. At the end of the research, it was established that the participants displayed a pessimistic attitude which reflected a belief that the widespread use of GMOs presented a risk to human and environmental health and was also a hazard in socio-economic terms. At the same time, participants believed that such risks could be controlled to a certain degree within a biosafety system. From a different perspective, it was found that the demographic characteristics of the subjects in the study (gender, age, education and income levels) in general did not have a significant effect on attitudes toward the impact of GMOs but that participants who were university graduates had a more optimistic outlook on the effects of GMOs on human and environmental health and related controls. It was finally concluded that study participants who regarded GMOs as risks to human and environmental health also found them to be socio-economic hazards as well, however, believing that these effects could be partially contained through government control. 3agenetically modified organisms 3agenetically modified foods 3aconsumer attitudes 3ainterviews 3asurveys 3aTurkey (country)0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.159-165x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02563naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001900168245011100187300001600298500002400314520122600338650001001564650001501574650001501589650002001604650001901624650001401643650001201657650002101669650001901690650002601709650001001735650001201745651001401757653001701771700001701788700001801805773010201823852000901925856009001934930003302024945002502057946001102082655001202093IND4431517520221118040805.0100119e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443151752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aJ2001 aAndrioli, R.J.10aInfluence of cattle grazing on nitrogen cycling in soils beneath Stipa tenuis, native to central Argentina  ap. 419-422.  aIncludes references  aDirect effects of herbivores on plants and on the physical environment can accelerate inorganic nitrogen (N) flow in grassland ecosystems. This study compares N content and N mineralization in the soil beneath plants of Stipa tenuis growing in adjacent grazed or ungrazed areas at three sites in central Argentina. Grazed areas had a long history of heavy, year-long grazing by cattle (6–8 ha cattle−1), whereas ungrazed areas had been excluded from grazing by large herbivore for five to ten years. N content and N mineralization was measured in the soil under plants (n = 10 per grazing treatment and per site) of the studied species at monthly intervals along an annual growing cycle. N mineralization was measured both in situ and in laboratory under optimal conditions of moisture and temperature. We did not found a significant effect of grazing on N content or on N mineralization in the soil beneath S. tenuis all over the studied period. Sustained, long-term overgrazing by domestic livestock, through plant and soil deterioration may either counterbalance or override accelerating N cycling attributed to prudent grazing (i.e., grazing that favours plant productivity and persistence) in managed grasslands. 3aStipa 3arangelands 3agrasslands 3agrassland soils 3asemiarid soils 3alivestock 3agrazing 3anitrogen content 3amineralization 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aroots 3abiomass 3aArgentina 0aStipa tenuis1 aDistel, R.A.1 aDidoné, N.G.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2010 Mar., v. 74, no. 3 p.419-422dAcademic Pressx0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.09.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100125b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03442naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001900119245012900138300001600267500002400283500001500307520220600322650002702528650001702555650002202572650001102594651002102605653002502626653001902651700001802670700002102688700002202709700002102731700001602752773009702768852000902865856008902874930003302963945002502996946001103021655001203032IND4431522920221118040913.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443152292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5011 aCakir, Ibrahim10aIntroducing a traditional dairy product Keş: Chemical, microbiological, and sensorial properties and fatty acid composition  ap. 116-119.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, it was aimed to determine the chemical, biochemical, microbiological and sensorial characteristics and fatty acid composition of Keş, traditionally produced in Bolu province in Turkey. The information on production of ‘Keş’ was collected from Bolu province in Turkey. Moreover, 20 samples were taken from the local bazaars in different periods in Bolu. These samples were taken to the laboratory, and the intended analyses were carried out. Also sensorial characteristics were described. In traditional way, first the cream of the milk is separated, and then it is processed for the yogurt. The yogurt is transferred in a cloth sack and allowed draining for one night. After that the content of the sack is dry salted and processed to obtain a cubic shape, which is called ‘Keş’, then dried under room temperature, or yogurt is churned and the whey (in Turkish, Ayran) is heated until content of the whey is precipitated. Then the precipitate is drained well and salted. After that some part of the salted precipitate is taken, shaped as cubic or conic and dried under room conditions. In the Keş samples, mean dry matter was 61.59%, ash 13.66%, protein 32.42%, fat 6.30%, salt 13.26%, acidity 0.22% and pH 3.81. The mean ripening degree was 5.76% and lipolysis value 3.62 ADV (acid degree value) for Keş samples. Microbiological analysis showed that the mean number of total aerobic bacteria was 4.50 log cfu/g, molds and yeasts 3.99 log cfu/g, Lactobacillus spp. 3.80 log cfu/g and Streptococcus spp. 3.41 log cfu/g. The Keş samples contained neither coliform bacteria nor E. coli. Water activity (a(w)) of the Keş samples was 0.74 as mean of total samples. The color and appearance of Keş samples was dull-white, the structure was hard, and smell was acidic. The taste of the Keş samples was salty and acidic. The shapes of the samples were cubic, rectangular, triangle and conic. The predominant free fatty acids in the Keş samples were palmitic (C16:0) and oleic (C18:1) acids, followed by stearic (C18:0) and myristic (C14:0) acids.chromatic and antioxidant properties of red wines during the ageing and at establishing the relationship between these properties. 3afatty acid composition 3afood quality 3afood microbiology 3ayogurt 3aTurkey (country) 0achemical composition 0adairy products1 aCoskun, Hayri1 aAkoglu, Ilker T.1 aIsleyen, M.

However, the physiological mechanisms are not clear enough. As confirmed in the present research, PRD not only induced osmotic adjustment, whereby the leaf turgor potential maintained higher than usual, but also strengthened the tomato plant resistance to leaf blights. The pressure-volume (P-V) curve analysis showed that the osmotic potential in symplasm at fully turgid status was lower and consequently the leaf turgor potential was higher in tomato leaves of PRD-treated plants than in the control plants. Leaf symplastic water fraction was larger in tomato leaves of PRD-treated plants. Both osmotic potential and relative water content at the point of incipient plasmolysis were lower, suggesting a higher stress resistance, in tomato leaves in PRD treatment. Analyses of photosynthetic hysteresis and stomatal declining curves showed that there were less constraints in photosynthetic mechanisms in PRD tomato leaves, where the transpiration through the leaf epicuticular layer was also smaller, suggesting the leaf surface was more protective from water loss and pathogen infections. As consequences, the PRD-treated tomato plants not only showed higher photosynthetic activity and yielded more and better fruit, but also were less infected by leaf blights. It is concluded that PRD is an acceptable technique to produce stronger crops for disease resistance and yield improvement in crop production. 3atomatoes 3astomatal conductance 3aosmotic pressure 3awater stress 3acrop yield 3ahysteresis 3adisease resistance 3aphotosynthesis 3adrying 3aroots 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0atranspiration 0aplant-water relations 0aplant physiology1 aDu, F.L.1 aXu, Q.C.1 aWang, Ruic(Researcher)1 aShah, R.P.1 aZhao, A.H.1 aLi, F.M.0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.981-988x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100420b20100501c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02459naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100002100137245010800158300001600266500002400282520125200306650002001558650001201578650002301590650001501613650002601628650002501654650002301679650002801702650001701730651002101747700001701768773009701785852000901882856008901891930003301980945002502013946001102038655001202049IND4431519920221118040611.0100119e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443151992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aF600 0aF1101 aDemirtas, Cigdem10aDeficit irrigation effects on pepper (Capsicum annuum L.

The research was carried out at the Agricultural Research Station of Yenişehir High School of Uludag University in Bursa, Turkey, in 2007. In the study, water was applied to pepper as 100, 75, 50, 25 and 0% (as control) of evaporation from a Class A pan (K1(cp) 1.00, K2(cp) 0.75, K3(cp) 0.50, K4(cp) 0.25, K5(cp) 0.00- control) corresponding to 2-day irrigation frequency. Irrigation water applied to crops ranged from 65 to 724 mm, and water consumption ranged from 115 to 740 mm. The effect of irrigation water level on the yield, fruit heigth, diameter and weight and dry matter ratio were significant. The highest yields were 24 and 19 t ha-1 for the K1(cp) and K2(cp) treatments, respectively. Crop yield response factor (k(y)) was 1.07. The highest values for water use efficiency (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) were 3.13 and 3.39 kg mm-1 for the K2(cp) treatment. Under the conditions that water resources are scarce, it can be recommended that K2(cp) treatment is most suitable as a water application level for pepper irrigation by drip irrigation under unheated greenhouse condition. 3aCapsicum annuum 3apeppers 3adeficit irrigation 3acrop yield 3agreenhouse production 3awater use efficiency 3aevapotranspiration 3adry matter accumulation 3aplant growth 3aTurkey (country)1 aAyas, Serhat0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2009 , v. 7, no. 3-4 p.989-993x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100420b20100501c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03243naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196072000900205100001600214245014000230300001800370500002400388520129300412650001201705650002901717650001601746650002201762650001901784650001401803650001901817650002501836650002101861650002201882650001201904650002301916650001201939650003601951650001301987650002702000650002602027650001302053650001702066650002502083650002102108650004602129653002702175653002602202653004202228653003102270700002402301773009802325852000902423856009002432930003302522945002502555946001302580655001202593IND4431373820221118041142.0100115e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137382DNAL7 a200442502pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX350 0aM001 0aP120 0aW000 0aS2001 aFu, Zhihong10aConsolidated bioprocessing of sugarcane bagasse and chicken manure to ammonium carboxylates by a mixed culture of marine microorganisms  ap. 2825-2836.  aIncludes references  aThe MixAlco process, an example of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), was utilized for anaerobic fermentation of 80% lime-treated sugarcane bagasse/20% chicken manure at 55°C by a mixed culture of marine microorganisms. NH₄HCO₃ was recommended by this study to replace CaCO₃ buffer to neutralize the produced carboxylic acids. The resulting ammonium carboxylates can be converted to gasoline or mixed alcohol fuels by downstream processing. Four-stage countercurrent fermentations at various volatile solids loading rates (VSLR) and liquid residence times (LRT) showed the highest acid productivity (1.27g/(L·day)) and highest conversion (76%) occurred at a total acid concentration of 24.4 and 31.3g/L, respectively. The Continuum Particle Distribution Model (CPDM) predicted the experimental total acid concentrations and conversions within 9.05% and 14.39%, respectively. The CPDM “map” indicates that both high acid concentrations (>50g/L) and high conversions (>72%) are possible with 300g substrate/(L liquid) concentration, 30 days liquid residence time, 5.4g/(L·day) solid loading rate, and NH₄HCO₃ buffer. The present study suggests that mixed culture biotechnology in the MixAlco process provides an alternative “carboxylate platform” for biomass conversion. 3abiomass 3arenewable energy sources 3abiorefining 3asugarcane bagasse 3alignocellulose 3acellulose 3apoultry manure 3aammonium bicarbonate 3acarboxylic acids 3acalcium carbonate 3abuffers 3abatch fermentation 2aAnimals 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxmetabolism 2aBiofuels 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aChickens 2aFermentation 2aManurexmicrobiology 2aModels, Chemical 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 0aanaerobic fermentation 0aammonium carboxylates 0acontinuum particle distribution model 0aconsolidated bioprocessing1 aHoltzapple, Mark T.0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Apr., v. 101, no. 8 p.2825-2836dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.1043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100302b20100403c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/03/02  aOther US 7aarticle02445naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245013000155300001800285500001500303520120600318650001501524650001201539650001801551650001401569650001301583650002101596650002701617653001201644653001301656653001501669653001901684653001201703700001701715700001801732700001501750773010101765852000901866856007701875930003301952945001301985946001301998655001202011IND2053427620221118041031.0961007e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205342762DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950567c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, D.D.10aEffects of sucrose, guar gum, and carboxymethylcellulose on the release of volatile flavor compounds under dynamic conditions  ap. 1321-1326.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of viscosity and thickener type (sucrose, guar gum, and carboxymethylcellulose) on dynamic flavor release was tested with model flavor solutions at two equiviscous levels. Dynamic flavor release was measured under simulated mouth conditions in an apparatus at 37 degrees C, with a shear rate of 100 s-1. The volatilized flavors were swept in a flow of helium gas into a mass spectrometer for selected ion monitoring chemical ionization. A plot of time versus ion abundance was recorded for each data set. The highly volatile compounds showed a large decrease in maximum ion abundance (Imax) as viscosity increased. Carboxymethylcellulose, guar gum, and sucrose solutions with a viscosity of 160 mPa s showed 36, 44, and 86% decreases compared to water, respectively, for the release of alpha-pinene. Similarly, 1,8-cineole decreased 32, 40, and 70% and ethyl 2-methyl-butyrate decreased 58, 63, and 94%, respectively. The less volatile compounds methyl anthranilate, vanillin, and maltol showed less of an effect. Thickened solutions of similar viscosity did not show the same flavor release, indicating that both viscosity and binding of flavors with the food matrix affect flavor release. 3athickeners 3asucrose 3ahydrocolloids 3aviscosity 3aguar gum 3aflavor compounds 3acarboxymethylcellulose 0arelease 0acolloids 0avolatility 0aflavor release 0abinding1 aElmore, J.S.1 aLangley, K.R.1 aBakker, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1321-1326x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950567c3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle04501naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100003500181245013800216300001600354500002400370500001500394520258700409650002402996650002403020650001203044650002103056650002603077650001603103650001603119650002403135650002203159650001803181650002303199650002003222650002103242650002503263650001603288650002903304650001603333650002803349650001303377650002103390650001803411650001003429650000903439651001003448653002403458653001603482700002003498700002303518700002203541773011303563852000903676856008503685930003303770945002503803946001103828655001203839IND4431375620221118041131.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2009.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ500 0aX100 0aB2001 aAkponikpè, P.B.

Because experiments with only a few fertility management options on a limited number of sites and years cannot fully capture the complex and highly non-linear soil-climate-crop interactions, crop growth simulation models may suitably complement experimental research to support decision making regarding soil fertility and water management. By means of a long term (23 years) scenario analysis using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model, this study investigates millet response to N in view of establishing N recommendations better adapted to subsistence small-holder millet farming in the Sahel. Prior to this, the APSIM model was tested on a rainfed randomized complete block experiment carried out during the 1994 and 1995 cropping seasons, having contrasting rainfall conditions. The experiment combined, at three levels each, the application of cattle manure (300, 900 and 2700kgha⁻¹), millet residue (300, 900 and 2700kgha⁻¹) and mineral fertilizer (unfertilized control, 15kgNha⁻¹ +4.4kgPha⁻¹ and 45kgNha⁻¹ +13.1kgPha⁻¹) at ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Niger. The model suitably predicted plant available water PAW and the simulated water and nitrogen stress were in agreement with measurement (water) and expectation (N) regarding the fertilizer and rainfall conditions of the experiment. APSIM simulations were in satisfactory agreement with the observed crop growth except for the highest crop residue application rates (>900kgha⁻¹). For biomass and grain yield, the model performance was relatively good in 1994 but biomass yields were slightly overpredicted in 1995. The model was able to adequately reproduce the average trend of millet grain yield response to N inputs from manure and fertilizer, and to predict the overall observed higher grain yield in 1995 compared to 1994, despite the better rainfall in 1994. The 23-year, long term scenario analysis combining different application rates of cattle manure, millet residue and mineral fertilizer, showed that moderate N application (15kgNha⁻¹) improves both the long term average and the minimum yearly guaranteed yield without increasing inter-annual variability compared to no N input. Although it does imply a lower average yield than at 30kgNha⁻¹, the application of 15kgNha⁻¹ appears more appropriate for small-holder, subsistence farmers than the usual 30kgNha⁻¹ recommendation as it guarantees higher minimum yield in worst years, thereby reducing their vulnerability. 3asubsistence farming 3asmall-scale farming 3amillets 3amodel validation 3along term experiments 3acalibration 3agrain yield 3anutrient management 3asimulation models 3acrop residues 3aPennisetum glaucum 3adryland farming 3aclimatic factors 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acrop models 3adecision support systems 3agrain crops 3afertilizer requirements 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3acattle manure 3aSahel 3arain 3aNiger 0amineral fertilizers 0aAPSIM model1 aGérard, Bruno.1 aMichels, Karlheinz1 aBielders, Charles0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2010 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.144-154dElsevier Science Pub.

The recovery of tannins was monitored at different time intervals (up to 18 h) using Folin-Ciocalteu and butanol-HCl-Fe3+ reagents. The recovery of tannins decreased with increase in time of storage, increase in pH, and increase in temperature. The decrease in the recovery of tannins was accompanied by a decrease in their protein precipitation capacity, and also there was no defined peak for the assay medium following the butanol-HCl-Fe3+ method for the purified quebracho and A. barteri tannins when stored at pH 11. These observations suggested that the decrease in recovery of tannins was due to inactivation of tannins. A. barteri tannins were found to be most susceptible to pH-mediated inactivation. The stirring of quebracho tannins increased the rate of inactivation at pH 11. The results suggested that alkaline pH inactivates the tannins. The rate of inactivation is higher at higher temperatures, and it can be further increased by oxygen present in the air or possibly by any other oxidizing agent. These observations were exploited to detannify tannins in some agroindustrial byproducts by using hydrogen peroxide (a strong oxidizing agent) in the presence of sodium hydroxide. This treatment was found to be very effective; the decrease in tannins reached as high as 99% in some cases. The results of the present study also highlighted a problem related to quantification of tannins in samples treated with alkalis. During extraction of tannins from such materials, tannins were inactivated due to alkalinity in the extraction medium, thereby giving an underestimate of the actual tannin levels. The alkalinity in the extraction medium results from the residual alkali present in the treated materials. This problem was overcome by addition of hydrochloric acid in the extraction medium so that the pH during extraction did not rise above 7. The results of the present study also suggest that for studying the nutritional, physiological, and biological effects of tannins (i) the pH of the tannin-containing solution should never at any stage be alkaline, (ii) the solution should be kept at low temperature, and (iii) the exposure to oxygen or to any other oxidizing agent should be avoided. 3aMangifera indica 3aseeds 3aextraction 3aphenols 3ainactivation 3achemical precipitation 3aalkalinity 3aChrysobalanaceae 3aTamarindus indica 3achemical analysis 3atannins 3apH 3aoxidants 3aQuercus leucotrichophora 3astorage 3achemical constituents of plants 3atemperature 3aVachellia nilotica 3aleaves 0aAcacia nilotica 0aacioa barteri 0adetannification 0aprotein precipitation 0aquebracho1 aBecker, K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1291-1295x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf95062873Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02439naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002900167245005600196300001600252500002400268500001500292520105700307650004501364650001801409650001001427650001101437650002501448650001301473650001301486650001501499650001801514650001701532650002001549653002101569653003601590700001901626700002301645700001901668773010301687852000901790856008901799930003301888945002501921946001101946655001201957IND4431370020221118041031.0100115e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443137002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aQ5011 aGiambra, Isabella Jasmin10aGenomics and proteomics of deleted ovine CSN1S1∗I  ap. 195-202.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOvine αs₁-casein (CSN1S1) allele I (CSN1S1∗I) was characterized at the molecular genetic and protein level. Sequencing of CSN1S1 cDNA and mature protein showed the absence of exon 7 from CSN1S1∗I in comparison with the C″ genetic variant of the C phenotype. This allelic aberration is correlated with a sequence difference in 5′-splice donor sequence of intron 7 (g.656T > A), leading to upstream skipping of exon 7. Consequently mRNA sequence of ovine CSN1S1∗I is 24 bp shorter than complete coding sequence leading to an abbreviation of eight amino acids in the mature protein, resulting in a lower degree of phosphorylation in comparison with CSN1S1∗C″. However CSN1S1∗I was expressed at a quantitative level similar to that for the C″ reference variant. Using amplified created restriction site polymerase chain reaction, a DNA-based test for identification of CSN1S1∗I was developed. Altogether six nucleotide substitutions were identified within intron 6 and intron 7 of CSN1S1 variants, forming three different haplotypes. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3amilk analysis 3asheep 3acasein 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agenomics 3aewe milk 3aproteomics 3agene deletion 3asheep breeds 3aanimal genetics 0amilk composition 0aGray Horned Heath (sheep breed)1 aChianese, Lina1 aFerranti, Pasquale1 aErhardt, Georg0 tInternational dairy journal.g2010 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.195-202dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.09.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02443naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001700176245012200193300001600315500002400331500001500355520083400370650002701204650001801231650002701249650002001276650001201296650001301308650002001321650001501341650001301356650002901369653001701398653001701415653002801432653001801460653002101478653003701499700001801536700002201554700001601576700001401592700001301606773010301619852000901722856008901731930003301820945002501853946001101878655001201889IND4431369920221118041049.0100115e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443136992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ501 0aQ1011 aBuccioni, A.10aConjugated linoleic acid and C18:1 isomers content in milk fat of sheep and their transfer to Pecorino Toscano cheese  ap. 190-194.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to evaluate the transfer of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and of C18:1 isomers from sheep milk to Pecorino Toscano protected denomination of origin cheese and to monitor the stability of these fatty acids during ripening. The total content of C18:1 fatty acids was not affected by milk treatment but there were changes in the isomers profile. In particular, the milk trans11 C18:1 decreased with pasteurization and after starter culture addition. In contrast, trans10 C18:1 and cis9, trans11 C18:2 were enhanced by the thermal treatment of milk. The fatty acid profile of cheese reflected that of milk used for cheese making with the exception of the C18:1 and CLA isomer profile. The cheese ripening affected the percentage of cis9, trans11 C18:2, which increased more than 10% on total content of CLA. 3atraditional technology 3afood analysis 3afatty acid composition 3acheese ripening 3aisomers 3amilk fat 3aItalian cheeses 3aprovenance 3aewe milk 3aconjugated linoleic acid 0acheesemaking 0asheep cheese 0aPecorino Toscano cheese 0aC18:1 isomers 0afood composition 0aprotected denomination of origin1 aRapaccini, S.1 aAntongiovanni, M.1 aMinieri, S.1 aConte, G.1 aMele, M.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2010 Mar., v. 20, no. 3 p.190-194dElsevier Sciencex0958-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.10.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/03/04  aNon-US 7aarticle01102naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245007400134300001400208500002400222500001500246520011300261650001400374653003100388653001800419653017800437653002400615700001700639773007100656852000900727939003300736945000800769946001100777655001200788991626999300742620221118041036.0840703s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840042342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValkounova, J.10aMorphology of the cysticercoid of Hymemolepis erinacei (Gmelin, 1789)  ap. 53-57.  aSummary in Russian.  a2019-12-05  aHymenolepis erinacei, description of cyst, neck, and scolex of cysticercoids studied by histological methods 3ahelminths 0aanimal parasites and pests 0aanimal health 0aHymenolepis erinacei (Cestoda)Geotrupes stercorarius (Host)Oeceoptoma thoracica (Host)Necrophorus humator (Host)Necrophorus interruptus (Host)Necrophorus vespilloides (Host) 0aMorphology, Cestoda1 aProkopic, J.0 tFolia parasitologica.g1980, v. 27, no. 1 p.53-57x0015-56837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840703c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01399naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245010200140300001600242500002400258500001500282520034100297650001400638653003100652653001800683653001000701653002400711653001300735653012700748700002100875700001900896773007300915852000900988939003300997945000801030946001101038655001201049991626999220742620221118041044.0840501s1981    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840024812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrasnoshchekov, G.P.10aPeculiarities of the ultrastructure of Hymenolepis horrida larvae from different definitive hosts  ap. 147-154.  aSummary in Russian.  a2019-12-05  aHymenolepis horrida, ultrastructural studies of cysticercoids developing in Collembola experimentally infected with hexacanth embryos from lemmings and voles revealed great differences in cyst wall and tegument, it is supposed that 2 cestode species of identical adult morphology and parasitic in different definitive hosts are involved 3ahelminths 0aanimal parasites and pests 0aanimal health 0acysts 0aMorphology, Cestoda 0aTegument 0aHymenolepis horrida (Cestoda)Microtus oeconomus (Host)Clethrionomys rutilus (Host)Lemmus sibiricus (Host)Onychiurus (Host)1 aPluzhnikov, L.T.1 aSmirnova, L.V.0 tFolia parasitologica.g1981, v. 28, no. 2 p.147-154x0015-56837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840501c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02348naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245010900152300001800261500001500279520118500294650002501479650002301504650001901527650002301546650003101569650001101600650001201611650001001623650001701633653001701650700001801667700001901685773010101704852000901805856007701814930003301891945001301924946001301937655001201950IND2053408120221118040959.0961007e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205340812DNAL7 a10.1021/jf95037722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrun, I.U.10aChanges in headspace volatiles and peroxide values of undeodorized menhaden oil over 20 weeks of storage  ap. 1190-1194.  a2019-12-04  aUndeodorized menhaden oil was stored in the dark at 30 degrees C under a headspace of air. Oil samples were removed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks of storage and analyzed for peroxide value and headspace volatiles by GC and GC-MS. Total volatiles increased in concentration during the first 2 weeks of storage, fell slightly at week 3, and then rose steadily reaching a second maximum at week 16, before declining again at week 20. Peroxide values exhibited three maxima, at weeks 1, 4, and 12. Several volatiles that are potentially derived from lipoxygenase activity in menhaden were identified in the oil including 1-penten-3-ol, (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (E)-2-octenal, 1-octen-3-ol, 2,5-octadien-1-ol, 2-nonenal, and (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal. Some volatiles derived from autoxidation are as follows: (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, (E,Z)-2,4-hepadienal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, and (E,E)-3,5-octadien-2-one. Five of these volatiles reached maximum concentrations by the first or second week of storage. These findings suggest that pro-oxidant mechanisms at work prior to and/or during oil refining lead to rapid buildup of objectionable flavors and aromas in menhaden oil. 3achemical composition 3avolatile compounds 3aperoxide value 3alipid peroxidation 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aflavor 3astorage 3aodors 3amenhaden oil 0alipoxygenase1 aBarbeau, W.E.1 aCrowther, J.B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1190-1194x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf95037723Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01901naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002400137245010400161300001800265500001500283520074900298650001601047650002101063650002301084650001201107650001601119650002101135650001401156650001301170653002501183700001301208700002001221700001601241773010101257852000901358856007701367930003301444945001301477946001301490655001201503IND2053407620221118040943.0961007e199605  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205340762DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950438w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoel-Suberville, C.10aCorrelation between fatty acid content and aromatic compound release in fresh blewit (Lepista nuda)  ap. 1180-1183.  a2019-12-04  aIdentification, quantification, and location of fatty acids in the newly cultivated fresh mushroom, Lepista nuda, as well as three aromatic effluents (1-octen-3-ol, 1-octen-3-one, and 3-octanone) from mushroom homogenate, were established.

Observed results indicate that the gills are the major compartment for the metabolic interconversion of fatty acids into aromatic compounds. 3afatty acids 3anutrient content 3avolatile compounds 3aketones 3acorrelation 3aflavor compounds 3amushrooms 3aalcohols 0achemical composition1 aCruz, C.1 aGuinberteau, J.1 aMontury, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1180-1183x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950438w3Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02481naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245010100158300001800259520126300277650001201540650001401552650001601566650001801582650002201600650001901622650002601641650003301667651001001700653001601710700002101726700002601747700002401773700002701797773010201824852000901926856007701935930003302012945001302045946001302058655001202071IND2055113020221118041144.0970129e199607  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205511302DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950505m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Lopez, C.10aMajor fatty acid composition of 19 almond cultivars of different origins. A chemometric approach  ap. 1751-1755.  aMultivariate chemometric techniques have been applied to the fatty acid composition of gas chromatographic data from 19 almond cultivars. Analysis of variance indicates the important contribution of all major fatty acids to the typification of almond cultivars. Principal component analysis applied to all of the individual values of fatty acids of the different cultivars leads to three new variables which accumulate about 90% of the total variance. The projection of different cultivars in the reduced space allows the visualization of some different cultivar groups. Cluster analysis classifies the studied almond cultivars into three groups. Within a large group many cultivars of the Mediterranean area and the American cultivar Non Pareil are found. The second group includes some Italian and American cultivars. A third group covers one American and one Australian cultivar, in association with two Spanish ones. Discriminant analysis applied to the groups previously established by cluster analysis and principal component analysis brings out two discriminant functions, which explain 68.53% and 31.47% of the total variance, respectively. Application of these discriminant functions verified a correct assignment (100%) of each member to its group. 3aalmonds 3acultivars 3afatty acids 3afood analysis 3achemical analysis 3achromatography 3amultivariate analysis 3aprincipal component analysis 3aSpain 0acomposition1 aGrane-Teruel, N.1 aBerenguer-Navarro, V.1 aGarcia-Garcia, J.E.1 aMartin-Carratala, M.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.1751-1755x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950505m3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02227naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002200137245013200159300001800291520105000309650001201359650001401371650001001385650001201395650002101407650001601428650002701444650002501471650003301496653001701529653003101546700001701577773010201594852000901696856007701705930003301782945001301815946001301828655001201841IND2055100120221118041108.0970128e199607  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205510012DNAL7 a10.1021/jf950676r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElysee-Collen, B.10aProtein ternary phase diagrams. 1. Effect of ethanol, ammonium sulfate, and temperature on the phase behavior of type B gelatin  ap. 1651-1657.  aThe effect of ethanol or (NH4)2SO4 addition on aqueous gelatin solution (pH 7.0) phase behavior was examined in the temperature range from 10 to 70 degrees C for protein and solute concentrations of 0-100 wt%. Ternary phase diagrams were used to effectively illustrate the relationship between the seven protein morphologies observed. Gelatin only exists as a random coil structure above 40 degrees C. As a result, in ethanol and salt systems below 30 degrees C, one-phase or two-phase gel and liquid morphologies dominated. In contrast, above 50 degrees C, one-phase sol or two-phase coacervate morphologies occupied significant portions of the two phase diagram systems. Between 30 and 50 degrees C, a wide range of morphologies was observed in both systems, as the gelatin gradually transformed to a more random structure. Differences observed between the various gelatin phase diagrams were a result of altered protein-solute, intraprotein, and interprotein interactions caused by changing temperature, ethanol, and (NH4)2SO4 concentrations. 3agelatin 3asolutions 3awater 3aethanol 3aammonium sulfate 3atemperature 3amolecular conformation 3aprotein conformation 3aprotein-protein interactions 0ainteractions 0aprotein-water interactions1 aLencki, R.W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1996 July, v. 44, no. 7 p.1651-1657x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf950676r3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02023naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009200147300001600239520074000255650001600995650001001011650001601021650001601037650002501053650003501078650002401113650001201137650001301149650001801162650003301180650003101213650003101244650001101275650002801286650002401314650004601338650001201384700001301396773011301409852000901522939003301531946001301564655001201577IND9302014520221118040949.0930416e19930129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201452DNAL7 a84275882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDasGupta, B.R.10aProtease activity of botulinum neurotoxin type E and its light chain: cleavage of actin  ap. 470-474.  aWe demonstrate here for the first time a proteolytic activity of botulinum neurotoxin type E which is not expressed unless the single chain approximately 150 kDa neurotoxic protein is nicked into the dichain approximately 150 kDa neurotoxin.

Survival and height 3-5 years after planting were positively related to seedling size at the time of planting. On all sites, survival nearly doubled from the smallest to largest diameter classes. Root mass had a similar relationship to survival on sites with environmental stress. Increasing root size class increased survival more for the small diameter classes than for the larger diameter classes. On the other hand, increasing root size class increased total height more for the large diameter class than the smaller ones. Although height was not as strongly affected as survival on several sites, height differences among initial seedling diameter classes were still significant and increasing after five years. Root class effects on height were less important than diameter class effects. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aseedlings 3abare root stock 3amortality 3aplant morphology 3aforest nurseries 3aplanting 3aOregon 0astand establishment 0agrading 0atransplanting 0asize 0aroot class1 aCarrier, B.D.0 tNew forests.g1993, v. 7, no. 1 p.19-32x0169-42867nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01724naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008400125300001600209520090200225650002401127650001601151650001401167650001801181650001401199650001501213653002401228700001901252773009601271852000901367939003301376946001301409655001201422IND9302017120221118041138.0930416s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThed, S.T.10aAbsorption of dissolved ascorbate by live channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)  ap. 185-192.  aLive channel catfish were exposed to 0.3% sodium ascorbate solution at pH 5.

For the group of fish exposed to 8 h of ascorbate followed by 16 h of dechlorinated water, pH 7, the fillets contained 27 ppm ascorbic acid. Fish which were exposed to water (without ascorbate) at pH 5 for 24 h showed a comparable ascorbic acid level in fillets to those fillets from the control group. The absorption of ascorbate via gills and/or intestines and distribution to required sites within the muscle tissue could serve to increase the stability of the fish fillet during subsequent processing and storage. Introduction of water-soluble antioxidants to aquacultured fish species by this approach requires further exploration. 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aaquaculture 3anutrition 3aascorbic acid 3asolutions 3aadsorption 0adissolved nutrients1 aErickson, M.C.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g1992, v. 16, no. 3 p.185-192x0145-88927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01618naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009600129300001600225520077500241650001601016650001401032650003101046650001901077650001501096650001001111653002301121700001801144773009901162852000901261939003301270946001301303655001201316IND9302012720221118041104.0930406e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930201272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConforti, F.D.10aUse of the farinograph in predicting baking quality of unchlorinated and chlorinated flours  ap. 333-347.  aThe viscoelastic properties of six Coker 916 flours with different protein contents were analyzed along with their baking properties. The wheat grain was grown under different amounts of nitrogen, which resulted in the variation of protein content. A portion of each flour sample was chlorinated, and comparisons were made between viscoelastic properties and baking quality. The farinograph was used to link the data derived from the flour analysis with baking quality. The stability, mixing tolerance index (MTI) and peak time (PT) correlated significantly with baking performance and were also good predictors when testing quality of chlorinated flour. Chlorination increased the absorbency of the flour, which contributed to a firmer crumb and a stable baked product. 3abaked goods 3achlorides 3aphysicochemical properties 3abaking quality 3aprediction 3aflour 0aflour chlorination1 aJohnson, J.M.0 tJournal of food quality.g1992 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.333-347wJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02531naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245010500162300001800267520086800285650001801153650002701171650001601198650001301214650001701227650001101244650001601255650002101271650001801292650001101310650001101321650001201332650003001344650001301374650002201387650002501409650001001434650001301444650000901457650001101466700002201477700002001499700001701519700001801536700002001554700001901574700002201593700002001615700002201635700001901657773012701676852000901803856008301812930003301895946001301928655001201941IND4412546020221118041011.0081114e20081114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441254602DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11655782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHongoh, Yuichi10aGenome of an Endosymbiont Coupling N₂ Fixation to Cellulolysis Within Protist Cells in Termite Gut  ap. 1108-1109.  aTermites harbor diverse symbiotic gut microorganisms, the majority of which are as yet uncultivable and their interrelationships unclear. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of the uncultured Bacteroidales endosymbiont of the cellulolytic protist Pseudotrichonympha grassii, which accounts for 70% of the bacterial cells in the gut of the termite Coptotermes formosanus. Functional annotation of the chromosome (1,114,206 base pairs) unveiled its ability to fix dinitrogen and recycle putative host nitrogen wastes for biosynthesis of diverse amino acids and cofactors, and import glucose and xylose as energy and carbon sources. Thus, nitrogen fixation and cellulolysis are coupled within the protist's cells. This highly evolved symbiotic system probably underlies the ability of the worldwide pest termites Coptotermes to use wood as their sole food. 3aBacteroidales 3aCoptotermes formosanus 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3achromosomes 3adigestive system 3aendosymbionts 3aenergy 3agenome 3aglucose 3aintestinal microorganisms 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anucleotide sequences 3apests 3aprotists 3awood 3axylose1 aSharma, Vineet K.1 aPrakash, Tulika1 aNoda, Satoko1 aToh, Hidehiro1 aTaylor, Todd D.1 aKudo, Toshiaki1 aSakaki, Yoshiyuki1 aToyoda, Atsushi1 aHattori, Masahira1 aOhkuma, Moriya0 tScience.g2008 Nov. 14, v. 322, no. 5904 p.1108-1109dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11655783Available from publisher's Web site  a20081114b20081206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03588naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001300189245012500202300001800327500002400345520121100369650001401580650002001594650001301614650000901627650001801636650001701654650001401671650001401685650002101699650002701720650001301747650001401760650003001774650002801804650001201832650001401844650003701858650007601895650002501971650002801996650002102024650002302045650001102068650006602079650002802145650004002173650000902213650002502222650002802247650001702275650004902292650002202341650002202363650001002385653001702395653002202412700001602434700001702450700001702467700002102484700002002505773010902525852000902634856009202643930003302735945002502768946001302793655001202806IND4443394220221118035915.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339422DNAL7 a215355052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01509.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT3001 aHan, Xue10aImmunizing Effects of Cocultures of H22 Hepatocarcinoma Cells and Cartilage Polysaccharide on Murine H22 Hepatocarcinoma  ap.

In order to disclose the immunizing effects of the cells and cartilage polysaccharide (CHCP) on liver cancer, murine H22 hepatocarcinoma model was set up. The survival time, life span, and survival rate of the CHCP group were better than model group or other groups which was immunized with cartilage short-chain polysaccharide (CPS) only or H22 cell lysate only. A series of experiments were proceeded and the results confirmed that the humoral immunity and cellular immunity were strengthened. HE staining, TUNEL assay, and Alcian staining were used to research the mechanism of the tumor specific antigen production which may be related to the apoptosis of H22 hepatocarcinoma cells induced by CPS or some new polysaccharide compound emerged. The animal experiment testified the relationship between H22 hepatocarcinoma cell apoptosis induced by CPS and the effect of murine H22 hepatocarcinoma immunoprophylaxis. Our data demonstrated that the coculture of cartilage polysaccharide and cancer cells may serve as a novel source of antihepatocarcinoma agent that may play an important role in future liver cancer immunoprophylaxis. 3acartilage 3apolysaccharides 3ahepatoma 3amice 3aanimal models 3aimmunization 3amortality 3alongevity 3ahumoral immunity 3acell-mediated immunity 3aantigens 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3ahepatoprotective effect 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCancer Vaccinesxtherapeutic use 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellularximmunologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aCartilagexchemistry 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferation 2aFemale 2aLiver Neoplasmsximmunologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aLymphocytesximmunology 2aMacrophages, Peritonealximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aNeutrophilsximmunology 2aPhagocytosis 2aPolysaccharidesxchemistryxtherapeutic use. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSurvival Analysis 2aSwine 0acell lysates 0aimmunoprophylaxis1 aLiu, An-Jun1 aZhao, Xi-Hua1 aLi, Yan-Dong1 aZheng, Guo-Qiang1 aZhang, Guo-Rong0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.H265-H273dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2009.01509.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/14  aOther US 7aarticle03263naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002300180245009100203300001800294500002400312500001500336520115800351650001601509650000901525650003501534650001801569650002101587650000901608650002001617650002601637650001201663650001501675650001401690650001501704650002101719650001601740650001301756650001401769650001801783650002801801650002501829650001701854650003301871650003301904650000901937650002801946650001101974650002601985650002102011650002302032650001202055650002802067650002402095650002102119650002302140653002002163653001902183700002402202700002202226773010902248852000902357856009202366930003302458945002502491946001302516655001202529IND4443394120221118035635.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339412DNAL7 a215355042pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01796.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aIyengar, Vasuprada10aDietary Ligands as Determinants of Iron-Zinc Interactions at the Absorptive Enterocyte  ap.

We have previously reported that zinc noncompetitively inhibits iron uptake in Caco-2 cells, a widely accepted model of the absorptive enterocyte. However, the determinants of this interaction, such as the effect of dietary ligands, remain uncharacterized. Dietary ligands selectively chelate iron and zinc in definite stoichiometric proportions and thus alter the bioavailability from food matrices. Here, we have used common dietary ligands, such as ascorbic acid, phytic acid, tannic acid, tartaric acid, cysteine, histidine, and methionine to characterize iron, zinc uptake individually and in combination, using Caco-2 cells. Selective chelation of zinc, using cysteine, decreased the magnitude of inhibition of iron uptake but could not reverse the inhibition. On the other hand, selective increase in iron uptake in the presence of methionine resulted in increased zinc uptake, rather than inhibition. Taken together, these in vitro results suggest that dietary ligands can modulate iron-zinc interaction and that zinc cannot competitively inhibit iron uptake. 3aphytic acid 3azinc 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3atartaric acid 3achelating agents 3airon 3anutrient uptake 3aintestinal absorption 3atannins 3amethionine 3achelation 3acell lines 3adietary minerals 3aenterocytes 3acysteine 3ahistidine 3aascorbic acid 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aBiological Transport 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aCarboxylic Acidsxmetabolism 2aChelating Agentsxmetabolism 2aDiet 2aEnterocytesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aIronxmetabolism 2aIron Radioisotopes 2aLigands 2aPhytic Acidxmetabolism 2aTanninsxmetabolism 2aZincxmetabolism 2aZinc Radioisotopes 0adietary ligands 0acultured cells1 aPullakhandam, Raghu1 aNair, K.

Objectivity, speed, and record keeping are advantages in using this method. The objective of this work was to develop the mathematical correlations to predict the weight of whole Alaskan Pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) based on its view area from a camera. One hundred and sixty whole Pollock were obtained fresh, within 2 d after catch from a Kodiak, Alaska, processing plant. The fish were first weighed, then placed in a light box equipped with a Nikon D200 digital camera. A reference square of known surface area was placed by the fish. The obtained image was analyzed to calculate the view area of each fish. The following equations were used to fit the view area (X) compared with weight (Y) data: linear, power, and 2nd-order polynomial. The power fit (Y = A · XB) gave the highest R² for the fit (0.99). The effect of fins and tail on the accuracy of the weight prediction using view area were evaluated. Removing fins and tails did not improve prediction accuracy. Machine vision can accurately predict the weight of whole Pollock. The weight of Alaskan Pollock can be predicted automatically by taking the image of the fish and using it in one of the correlations developed in this study. The removal of the fins or the fins and the tail did not increase the prediction accuracy of the method. Therefore, intact fish images should be used. 3aweight 3amathematical models 3aautomatic detection 3aimage analysis 3asurface area 3afish products 3apollock 3afood quality 3adigital images 3aaccuracy 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3aprediction 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimal Finsxgrowth & development 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aFood-Processing Industryxmethods 2aGadiformesxgrowth & development 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aPhotography 2aRegression Analysis 2aTailxgrowth & development 0aAlaska 0aTheragra chalcogramma1 aChombeau, Melanie1 aCırban, Dilşat1 aGümüş, Bahar0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.E552-E556dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01813.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle02777naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002300189245014000212300001800352500002400370500001500394520082100409650001201230650002601242650002601268650001701294650002101311650001901332650004301351650001001394650001601404650002201420650002101442650001901463650003501482650004101517650002101558650005701579650003501636650004401671650003601715650003101751650004801782650003701830653001701867700002201884773010901906852000902015856009202024930003302116945002502149946001302174655001202187IND4443392420221118035815.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339242DNAL7 a215354872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01799.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aWallace, Taylor C.10aExtraction and Normal-Phase HPLC-Fluorescence-Electrospray MS Characterization and Quantification of Procyanidins in Cranberry Extracts  ap.

The greatest electrostatic improvement was found when using powders that had the worst nonelectrostatic side coverage: large particle size (>135 μm), low resistivity, and low cohesiveness, especially on targets that had high-surface resistivity (2 x 10⁵Ωm). Tribocharging had a similar effect as electrostatic coating. In both nonelectrostatic and electrostatic coating, percent side coverage increased as powder particle size decreased, cohesiveness increased, or target resistivity decreased. In electrostatic coating, percent side coverage increased as powder resistivity increased; however, in nonelectrostatic coating, as powder resistivity increased, percent side coverage increased on only oiled plastic and dry bread. The evenness of powder coating on food is very important for consumer acceptability, since consumers judge food from its appearance before they have a chance to taste it. If thick food targets, such as cakes, donuts, and marshmallows need to be coated, the side coverage, due to the wrap around effect, is important. Choosing powders with small particle size, high cohesiveness and high-powder resistivity, and using electrostatic coating can produce food targets coated on all sides. 3aprotein isolates 3apaper 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amodified starch 3asugars 3atapioca 3aparticle films 3acocoa powder 3awheat protein 3ametals 3apowders 3abreads 3acorn starch 3aappearance (quality) 3asurfaces 3acohesion 3aplastic film 3aelectrical properties 3asoy protein 3awood 3acheeses 3aparticle size 2aAdhesiveness 2aCondimentsxanalysis 2aElectric Impedance 2aElectrochemical Techniques 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Technology 2aParticle Size 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aRheology 2aSurface Properties 0aelectrostatic coating 0apowdered foods 0astarch 0anacho cheese1 aBarringer, Sheryl A.0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.E537-E543dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01810.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle03835naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001700180245014600197300001800343500002400361500001500385520169800400650002802098650002102126650001902147650001802166650002102184650001602205650001202221650001902233650001702252650001102269650001002280650005802290650001302348650004002361650003702401650004102438650004802479650002302527650002202550650004902572650003102621650002702652650002202679650003002701650002602731653001702757653002402774653001402798653003602812700001702848700002702865773010902892852000903001856009203010930003303102945002503135946001303160655001203173IND4443392320221118035911.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339232DNAL7 a215354862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01814.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aLee, Eun Jin10aIdentification of Candidate Amino Acids Involved in the Formation of Pink-Red Pigments in Onion (Allium cepa L.)

C684-C689.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe formation of pink-red pigments ("pinking") by various amino acids was investigated by reacting amino acids with compounds present in onion juice. The unknown pink-red pigments were generated and separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a diode array detector (DAD) in the range of 200 to 700 nm. To generate pink-red pigments, we developed several reaction systems using garlic alliinase, purified 1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (1-PeCSO), onion thiosulfinate, natural onion juice, and 21 free amino acids. The compound 1-PeCSO was a key compound associated with pinking in the presence of both the alliinase and amino acids. Numerous naturally occurring pink-red pigments were detected and separated from pink onion juice using the HPLC-DAD system at 515 nm. Most free amino acids, with the exceptions of histidine, serine, and cysteine, formed various pink-red pigments when reacted with onion thiosulfinate. This observation indicated that onion pinking is caused not by a single pigment, but by many. Furthermore, more than one color compound could be produced from a single amino acid; this explains, in part, why there were many pink-red compound peaks in the chromatogram of discolored natural onion juice. We presumed that the complexity of the pink-red pigments was due to the involvement of more than 21 natural amino acids as well as several derivatives of the color products produced from each amino acid. We observed that the pinking process in onion juice is very similar to that of the greening process in crushed garlic, emphasizing that both thiosulfinate from flavor precursors and free amino acids are absolutely required for the discoloration. 3afood processing quality 3avegetable juices 3aplant pigments 3adiscoloration 3afree amino acids 3aAllium cepa 3aenzymes 3aplant extracts 3athiosulfates 3aonions 3acolor 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3acysteine 2aAmino Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCarbon-Sulfur Lyasesxmetabolism 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCysteinexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aGarlicxenzymology 2aOnionsxchemistry 2aPigments, Biologicalxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aSpectrophotometry 2aSulfinic Acidsxchemistry 2aSulfoxidesxchemistry 0apurification 0aonion thiosulfinate 0aalliinase 0a1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide1 aYoo, Kil Sun1 aPatil, Bhimanagouda S.0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.C684-C689dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01814.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle03467naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100001700180245009300197300001800290500002400308500001500332520127300347650002301620650001501643650001701658650001301675650002801688650001901716650005801735650001301793650001001806650004101816650001701857650003901874650005701913650001001970650002101980650002602001650005802027650002202085650003902107650002602146650004602172650002802218650004402246650004802290650001702338653001602355653002102371653001902392653001902411700001602430700001702446700002002463700001702483773010902500852000902609856009202618930003302710945002502743946001302768655001202781IND4443391920221118035734.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444339192DNAL7 a215354822pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01803.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aPark, ChanUk10aEffects of Riboflavin Photosensitization on Daidzein and Its Photosensitized Derivatives  ap.

As the period of light irradiation increased, concentration of daidzein decreased significantly (P < 0.05) and new peaks of daidzein derivatives were observed and changed during photosensitization. Three new peaks from photosensitized daidzein were tentatively identified as 7-, 3′, 4′-trihydroxyisoflavone (or 3′-hydroxydaidzein) and 2 dimmers of daidzein by a combination of HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) and retention times of standard compounds by HPLC. Addition of sodium azide and removal of headspace oxygen treatment affected the formation of newly formed peaks. The type I pathway of riboflavin photosensitization played more important roles than type II pathways on the formation of daidzein derivatives. Isoflavones are important phytochemicals found in soy foods. Generally, many foods containing soy ingredients are displayed under visible light irradiation. Also, riboflavin can be found in many foods containing vegetables. The results of this study can be used to understand the stability and changes of isoflavone aglycones in soy and soy-based foods under visible light irradiation. 3amodel food systems 3ariboflavin 3afood storage 3asoybeans 3aphotochemical reactions 3aphotostability 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3adaidzein 3alight 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDimerization 2aFree Radical Scavengersxchemistry 2aIsoflavonesxanalysisxchemistryxradiation effects. 2aLight 2aModels, Chemical 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aOxygenxchemistry 2aPhotosensitizing Agentsxchemistry 2aRiboflavinxchemistry 2aSinglet Oxygenxantagonists & inhibitors. 2aSodium Azidexchemistry 2aSoy Foodsxanalysisxradiation effects. 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTime Factors 0aisoflavones 0asoybean products 0aphytochemicals 0aphotochemistry1 aYeo, JuDong1 aPark, MinHee1 aPark, Jin-Byung1 aLee, JaeHwan0 tJournal of food science.g2010 Oct., v. 75, no. 8 p.C659-C666dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01803.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/13  aOther US 7aarticle03875naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001500189245012300204300001800327500010400345500002400449520128600473650002201759650001201781650001901793650002501812650002001837650002301857650002301880650002501903650002601928650002201954650001801976650002101994650002502015650001702040650001302057650002202070650001602092650002602108650001902134650002402153650006502177650002902242650003402271650003302305650002702338650003102365650002702396650004202423650003002465650003302495650004602528650003502574653001702609653002802626700001702654700001602671700001502687700001702702700001402719700001602733700001902749700001802768773010802786852000902894856008302903930003302986945002503019946001303044655001203057IND4443369720221118035644.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444336972DNAL7 a209233532pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-01-10-00292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aF600 0aF2001 aSun, Lijun13aAn h-Type Thioredoxin Functions in Tobacco Defense Responses to Two Species of Viruses and an Abiotic Oxidative Stress  ap. 1470-1485.  aIn the special issue: Cell biology of plant-virus interactions / edited by Biao Ding and John Carr.  aIncludes references  aVarious thioredoxin (Trx) proteins have been identified in plants. However, many of the physiological roles played by these proteins remain to be elucidated. We cloned a TRXh-like gene predicted to encode an h-type Trx in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and designated it NtTRXh3, based on the biochemical activity of the NtTRXh3 protein. Overexpression of NtTRXh3 conferred resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus and Cucumber mosaic virus, both of which showed reduced multiplication and pathogenicity in NtTRXh3-overexpressing plants compared with controls. NtTRXh3 overexpression also enhanced tobacco resistance to oxidative stress induced by paraquat, an herbicide that inhibits the production of reducing equivalents by chloroplasts. The NtTRXh3 protein localized exclusively to chloroplasts in coordination with the maintenance of cellular reducing conditions, which accompanied an elevation in the glutathione/glutathione disulfide couple ratio. NtTRXh3 gene expression and NtTRXh3 protein production were necessary for these defensive responses, because they were all arrested when NtTRXh3 was silenced and the production of NtTRXh3 protein was abrogated. These results suggest that NtTRXh3 is involved in the resistance of tobacco to virus infection and abiotic oxidative stress. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atobacco 3aplant proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3agene expression 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3avirus replication 3apathogenicity 3aoxidative stress 3aantioxidant activity 3achloroplasts 3aparaquat 3aprotein transport 3aglutathione 3aresistance mechanisms 3agene silencing 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aOxidative Stressximmunology 2aParaquatxpharmacology 2aPlant Diseasesximmunology 2aPlant Leavesxvirology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Virusesxphysiology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aThioredoxinsxclassificationxmetabolism. 2aTobaccoximmunologyxvirology. 0athioredoxins 0amolecular sequence data1 aRen, Haiying1 aLiu, Ruoxue1 aLi, Baoyan1 aWu, Tingquan1 aSun, Feng1 aLiu, Huimin1 aWang, Xiaomeng1 aDong, Hansong0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2010 Nov., v. 23, no. 11 p.1470-1485dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-10-00293Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle02748naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100001700200245010300217300001800320500002400338500001500362520120900377650001801586650001001604650002701614650001701641650002101658650001801679650003201697650000901729650002301738650002601761650001401787651001001801653002201811653001801833653001101851653002201862700001801884700001801902700001701920773009401937852000902031856008502040930003302125945002502158946001102183655001202194IND4443366620221118035652.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444336662DNAL7 a224451312pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311100009232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aQ502 0aL200 0aL6001 aIndurain, G.10aEffect of weight at slaughter and breed on beef intramuscular lipid classes and fatty acid profile  ap. 1771-1780.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of slaughter weight and breed on the composition of intramuscular fat (IMF) of seven Spanish cattle breeds was studied. Lipid classes and fatty acids were evaluated in young bulls of seven local Spanish cattle breeds, Asturiana, Avileña, Morucha, Parda Alpina, Pirenaica, Retinta and Rubia Gallega, slaughtered at a live weight of 320 kg (veal type) and 550 kg (yearling bull type). Higher slaughter weight and early maturating breeds produced higher IMF content in the longissimus muscle (P < 0.001), which was linked to a reduction in phospholipids, monoglycerides, diglycerides, cholesterol and free-fatty acids content, but an increase in triacylglycerols. Besides, heavier animals displayed a higher percentage of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), but a lower polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) percentage (P < 0.001). The increase in triglycerides (TG), saturated fatty acids (SFA) and MUFA illustrates the increasing importance of lipid storage as fattening proceeds and the acquisition of ruminal functionality. The feeding system based on cereals had a strong influence on the fatty acid profile, giving the studied beef a relatively high PUFA/SFA and n-6/n-3 ratios. 3ayoung animals 3abulls 3afatty acid composition 3abeef quality 3aslaughter weight 3acattle breeds 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3abeef 3alongissimus muscle 3asaturated fatty acids 3afinishing 3aSpain 0alongissimus dorsi 0alipid classes 0alipids 0aintramuscular fat1 aBeriain, M.J.1 aSarries, M.V.1 aInsausti, K.0 tAnimal.g2010 Oct., v. 4, no. 10 p.1771-1780dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100009233Available from publisher's Web site  a20110113b20110205c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03919naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191072000900200100001600209245011300225300001800338500002400356500001500380520248200395650001502877650001602892650002202908650002202930650001602952650002002968650002302988651001103011653001203022653001703034700002003051700001903071700001803090700001703108700001903125773009403144852000903238856008503247930003303332945002503365946001103390655001203401IND4443366420221118035708.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444336642DNAL7 a224451302pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311100007042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aQ201 0aQ501 0aE200 0aX1001 aNielsen, C.10aEconomic consequences of mastitis and withdrawal of milk with high somatic cell count in Swedish dairy herds  ap. 1758-1770.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe main aim was to assess the impact of mastitis on technical and economic results of a dairy herd under current Swedish farming conditions. The second aim was to investigate the effects obtained by withdrawing milk with high somatic cell count (SCC). A dynamic and stochastic simulation model, SimHerd, was used to study the effects of mastitis in a herd with 150 cows. Results given the initial incidence of mastitis (32 and 33 clinical and subclinical cases per 100 cow-years, respectively) were studied, together with the consequences of reducing or increasing the incidence of mastitis by 50%, modelling no clinical mastitis (CM) while keeping the incidence of subclinical mastitis (SCM) constant and vice versa. Six different strategies to withdraw milk with high SCC were compared. The decision to withdraw milk was based on herd-level information in three scenarios: withdrawal was initiated when the predicted bulk tank SCC exceeded 220 000, 200 000 or 180 000 cells/ml, and on cow-level information in three scenarios: withdrawal was initiated when the predicted SCC in an individual cow’s milk exceeded 1 000 000, 750 000 or 500 000 cells/ml. The accuracy with which SCC was measured and predicted was assumed to affect the profitability of withdrawing milk with high SCC and this was investigated by applying high, low or no uncertainty to true SCC. The yearly avoidable cost of mastitis was estimated at €8235, assuming that the initial incidence of mastitis could be reduced by 50%. This cost corresponded to 5% of the herd net return given the initial incidence of mastitis. Expressed per cow-year, the avoidable cost of mastitis was €55. The costs per case of CM and SCM were estimated at €278 and €60, respectively. Withdrawing milk with high SCC was never profitable because this generated a substantial amount of milk withdrawal that was not offset by a sufficient increase in the average price per delivered kg milk. It had the most negative impact on net return when high incidence of mastitis was simulated. Withdrawing milk with high SCC based on low-uncertainty information reduced the amount of withdrawn milk and thus resulted in less negative effect on net return. It was concluded that the current milk-pricing system makes it more profitable for farmers to sell a larger amount of milk with higher SCC than to withdraw milk with high SCC to obtain payment premiums, at least in herds with mastitis incidences within the simulated ranges. 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3asimulation models 3aeconomic analysis 3aherd health 3abovine mastitis 3asomatic cell count 3aSweden 0aSimHerd 0amilk quality1 aØstergaard, S.1 aEmanuelson, U.1 aAndersson, H.1 aBerglund, B.1 aStrandberg, E.0 tAnimal.g2010 Oct., v. 4, no. 10 p.1758-1770dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311100007043Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03411naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072000900163072000900172072000900181100002500190245009600215300001800311500002400329500001500353520156600368650002501934650001401959650001401973650001601987650002202003650001102025650001002036650001302046650002102059650001802080650001802098650002702116650002202143650002502165650002302190650001402213650003102227650004102258650003302299650003802332651001402370653003002384653002002414700001902434700002402453700003202477773011202509852000902621856008402630930003302714945002502747946001302772655001202785IND4443379420221118040004.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337942DNAL7 a208399412pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-01-10-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF200 0aX1001 aChakraborty, Sukumar10aWheat Crown Rot Pathogens Fusarium graminearum and F. pseudograminearum Lack Specialization  ap. 1057-1065.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis article reports a lack of pathogenic specialization among Australian Fusarium graminearum and F. pseudograminearum causing crown rot (CR) of wheat using analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component and biplot analysis, Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W), and κ statistics. Overall, F. pseudograminearum was more aggressive than F. graminearum, supporting earlier delineation of the crown-infecting group as a new species. Although significant wheat line–pathogen isolate interaction in ANOVA suggested putative specialization when seedlings of 60 wheat lines were inoculated with 4 pathogen isolates or 26 wheat lines were inoculated with 10 isolates, significant W and κ showed agreement in rank order of wheat lines, indicating a lack of specialization. The first principal component representing nondifferential aggressiveness explained a large part (up to 65%) of the variation in CR severity. The differential components were small and more pronounced in seedlings than in adult plants. By maximizing variance on the first two principal components, biplots were useful for highlighting the association between isolates and wheat lines. A key finding of this work is that a range of analytical tools are needed to explore pathogenic specialization, and a statistically significant interaction in an ANOVA cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of specialization. With no highly resistant wheat cultivars, Fusarium isolates mostly differ in aggressiveness; however, specialization may appear as more resistant cultivars become widespread. 3aFusarium graminearum 3acultivars 3aseedlings 3ahost plants 3agenetic variation 3aniches 3awheat 3avariance 3adisease severity 3apathogenicity 3adata analysis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aTriticum aestivum 3astatistical analysis 3adisease resistance 3acrown rot 3aFusarium pseudograminearum 2aFusariumxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aTriticumxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 3aAustralia 0apathogenic specialization 0aGibberella zeae1 aObanor, Friday1 aWestecott, Rhyannyn1 aAbeywickrama, Krishanthi P.0 tPhytopathology.g2010 Oct., v. 100, no. 10 p.1057-1065dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-01-10-00073Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/06  aOther US 7aarticle02753naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145072001700163072001700180100001800197245008200215300001800297500002400315520083800339650003001177650001801207650002301225650002401248650002601272650001901298650001601317650001701333650000901350650002301359650002001382650002301402650001701425650001301442650001201455650002101467650002101488650002401509650003101533650004401564650002301608650002901631650001701660651001301677700003401690700004201724700002001766773013001786852000901916856008401925856004702009930003302056945002502089946001302114655001202127IND4443379120221118035949.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337912DNAL7 a208399392pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-10-09-02892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We found that although PAV is transmitted by two aphids and MAV by only one, this fact, by itself, does not explain the complete replacement of MAV by PAV in New York State during the period from 1961 through 1976; an interpretation that is in agreement with the theories of A. G. Power. Also, although MAV wins the competition within aphids, we assumed that, in 1961, PAV mutated into a new variant such that this new variant was able to overcome MAV within the plants during a latent period. As shown below, this is sufficient to explain the swap of strains; that is, the dominant MAV was replaced by PAV, also in agreement with Power's expectations. 3aBarley yellow dwarf virus 3aplant viruses 3astrain differences 3amathematical models 3amicrobial competition 3ainsect vectors 3ahost plants 3aAvena sativa 3aoats 3avirus transmission 3aSitobion avenae 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3ainsect pests 3amutation 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxvirology 2aAvenaxvirology. 2aComputer Simulation 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aLuteovirusxclassificationxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aTime Factors 3aNew York1 aBurattini, Marcelo Nascimento1 aCoutinho, Francisco Antônio Bezerra.1 aMassad, Eduardo0 tPhytopathology.g2010 Oct., v. 100, no. 10 p.1042-1047dAmerican Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-10-09-02893Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-10-09-0289  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/06  aOther US 7aarticle03523naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002100191245014300212300001600355500002400371500001500395520161100410650001502021650002702036650002002063650001302083650001902096650001702115650001602132650000902148650002302157650001902180650001502199650002002214650001202234650001102246650002302257650001102280650002602291650002602317650003402343650005402377650002002431650001702451653002102468700002502489700002302514700002102537700002002558700002102578773011102599852000902710856008502719930003302804945002502837946001102862655001202873IND4443375220221118035843.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337522DNAL7 a208000052pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299100005792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aQ501 0aL6001 aHyvönen, Paula.10aConcentrations of bovine lactoferrin and citrate in milk during experimental endotoxin mastitis in early- versus late-lactating dairy cows  ap. 474-480.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLactoferrin (Lf) is a molecule naturally present in bovine milk that affects the availability and transport systems of iron. Lf also binds endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria and modulates the immunological response. In the present study, concentrations of bovine Lf (bLf) and citrate in milk were determined in early (EL) and late (LL) lactating dairy cows, using an experimentally induced endotoxin mastitis model and a crossover design. Nine clinically healthy Finnish Ayrshire cows were challenged twice with 100 μg endotoxin infused into one udder quarter. Milk samples were collected from the challenged and control quarters of each cow before and after endotoxin infusion during 3 d, and bLf and citrate concentrations were measured. In all cows, clinical signs of mastitis were seen at both times of challenge, but the response was more severe in EL than in LL. Concentration of bLf in the milk started to rise approximately 8 h after endotoxin infusion and was still higher than normal on the third day, especially in the late-lactating cows. In milk of the LL group, concentrations of bLf were significantly higher than in the EL group. In contrast, concentrations of citrate were higher in milk of the EL cows compared with the LL cows. Concentration of bLf and citrate varied substantially among cows. The molar ratio of citrate to bLf before and after challenge was significantly higher during the EL period. The results of this study partly explain why cows in early lactation are more susceptible to intramammary infections and why mastitis is more severe in them. 3adairy cows 3achemical concentration 3aearly lactation 3acitrates 3alate lactation 3amilk quality 3alactoferrin 3amilk 3adisease resistance 3audder quarters 3aendotoxins 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCitratesxanalysis 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLactoferrinxanalysis 2aLipopolysaccharidesxtoxicity 2aMastitis, Bovinexchemically inducedxmetabolism. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aTime Factors 0amilk composition1 aHaarahiltunen, Taina1 aLehtolainen, Tanja1 aHeikkinen, Jouni1 aIsomäki, Ritva1 aPyörälä, Satu0 tJournal of dairy research.g2010 Nov., v. 77, no. 4 p.474-480dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299100005793Available from publisher's Web site  a20101217b20110101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02855naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100002000173245023900193300001600432500002400448500001500472520095600487650001301443650002401456650002101480650002101501650002001522650001101542650002301553650001101576650001601587650002101603650001401624650001801638650002001656650003001676650002201706650001301728650005401741650002301795650003101818653001901849700002701868700002301895700002401918700002501942700002401967773011101991852000902102856008502111930003302196945002502229946001102254655001202265IND4443372720221118040146.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337272DNAL7 a208318432pmid7 a10.1017/S002202991000066X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1211 aMissous, Ghalia10aRelationship between growth behaviour, micro and macroscopic morphologies and freezing sensitivity of the ripening starter Geotrichum candidum is strain specific and mostly related to the morphotypes: the arthrospores/hyphae parameter  ap. 425-431.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMicroscopic conformation, growth behaviour and freezing sensitivity of seven strains of Geotrichum candidum, a ripening starter, were studied and compared according to their macroscopic morphotypes. It has been shown that the thallus forming units (TFU)×ml−1/OD600nm ratio as a function of time is an interesting parameter to follow G. candidum sporulation through the growth behaviour. Microscopic conformation, growth behaviour and freezing sensitivity are clearly strain specific and mostly related to their corresponding morphotypes “yeast”, “mould” or “intermediate”. The two “mould” strains that sporulate weakly (UCMA103, UCMA499) showed a low survival rate to freezing stress whereas the “yeast” strains expressed a significant resistance owing to the arthrospore abundance. Interestingly, one strain (UCMA96) which appeared on solid medium in accord with the “mould” morphotype respond similarly to freezing stress. 3afreezing 3aGeotrichum candidum 3afreezing quality 3acryopreservation 3acheese ripening 3ayeasts 3astrain differences 3ahyphae 3acold stress 3amicrobial growth 3amortality 3amolds (fungi) 3acheese starters 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aFood Microbiology 2aFreezing 2aGeotrichumxclassificationxcytologyxphysiology. 2aHyphaexphysiology 2aSpores, Fungalxphysiology 0afungal anatomy1 aThammavongs, Bouachanh1 aLaunay, Géraldine1 aGuéguen, Micheline1 aDieuleveux, Virginie1 aPanoff, Jean-Michel0 tJournal of dairy research.g2010 Nov., v. 77, no. 4 p.425-431dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002202991000066X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101217b20110101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03939naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179100002000196245016900216300001800385500002400403500001500427520156600442650003002008650004202038650002502080650003102105650001002136650002302146650002302169650001502192650003902207650001402246650001402260650002302274650002702297650002102324650001302345650002302358650001202381650002302393650001402416650001902430650005402449650003202503650003102535650002502566650002802591650006402619653003902683653002102722653002102743653001802764700002002782700001602802700001702818700001802835700001702853773012602870852000902996856008303005856004603088930003303134945002503167946001303192655001203205IND4443372520221118035858.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337252DNAL7 a206728762pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-05-10-01142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola race 4 strain 1302A contains the avirulence gene hopAR1 (located on a 106-kb genomic island, PPHGI-1, and earlier named avrPphB), which matches resistance gene R3 in P. vulgaris cultivar Tendergreen (TG) and causes a rapid hypersensitive reaction (HR). Here, we have fluorescently labeled selected Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1302A and 1448A strains (with and without PPHGI-1) to enable confocal imaging of in-planta colony formation within the apoplast of resistant (TG) and susceptible (Canadian Wonder [CW]) P. vulgaris leaves. Temporal quantification of fluorescent Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola colony development correlated with in-planta bacterial multiplication (measured as CFU/ml) and is, therefore, an effective means of monitoring Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola endophytic colonization and survival in P. vulgaris. We present advances in the application of confocal microscopy for in-planta visualization of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola colony development in the leaf mesophyll to show how the HR defense response greatly affects colony morphology and bacterial survival. Unexpectedly, the presence of PPHGI-1 was found to cause a reduction of colony development in susceptible P. vulgaris CW leaf tissue. We discuss the evolutionary consequences that the acquisition and retention of PPHGI-1 brings to Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola in planta. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 3aintercellular spaces 3agene-for-gene relationship 3abeans 3atemporal variation 3agenetic resistance 3aendophytes 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3amesophyll 3avirulence 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3amicrobial colonization 3amicrobial growth 3agenomics 3adisease resistance 3astrains 3amicrobial genetics 3amortality 3adisease course 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxphysiology 2aGenomic Islandsxphysiology 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aPhaseolusxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonas syringaexclassificationxcytologyxphysiology. 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy 0aresistance genes 0aavirulence genes 0acell invasion1 aMansfield, J.W.1 aCorry, D.S.1 aLovell, H.C.1 aJackson, R.W.1 aArnold, D.L.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2010 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.1294-1302dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-05-10-01143Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-05-10-0114  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/03  aOther US 7aarticle03449naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100001900173245005900192300001600251500002400267500001500291520180300306650001502109650002102124650001902145650001402164650001802178650001702196650002102213650002302234650002002257650002202277650000902299650001702308650001302325650001902338650001102357650001502368650002002383650001602403650001202419650001102431650003802442650002002480650002402500653001202524653001702536700002002553773011102573852000902684856008502693930003302778945002502811946001102836655001202847IND4443374220221118035857.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337422DNAL7 a208225642pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299100005802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5011 aLarsen, Torben10aFluorometric determination of uric acid in bovine milk  ap. 438-444.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe primary objective of this study is to validate a new fast method for determination of uric acid in milk. The method is based on an enzymatic-fluorometric technique that requires minimal pre-treatment of milk samples. The present determination of uric acid is based on the enzymatic oxidation of uric acid to 5-hydroxyisourate via uricase where the liberated hydrogen peroxide reacts with 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine via peroxidase and the fluorescent product, resorufin, is measured fluorometrically. Fresh composite milk samples (n=1,072) were collected from both Jersey (n=38) and Danish Holstein (n=106) cows from one local herd. The average inter- and intra-assay variations were 7·1% and 3·0%, respectively. Percent recovery averaged 103·4, 107·0 and 107·5% for samples spiked with 20, 40 or 60 μm of standard, respectively, with a correlation (r=0·98; P<0·001) observed between the observed and expected uric acid concentrations. A positive correlation (r=0·96; P<0·001) was observed between uric acid concentrations using the present method and a reference assay. Storage at 4°C for 24 h resulted in lower (P<0·01) uric acid concentrations in milk when compared with no storage or samples stored at −18°C for 24 h. Addition of either allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or dimethylsulfoxide (a solvent for allopurinol) did not affect milk uric acid concentrations (P=0·96) and may indicate that heat treatment before storage and analysis was sufficient to degrade xanthine oxidase activity in milk. No relationship was observed between milk uric acid and milk yield and milk components. Authors recommend a single heat treatment (82°C for 10 min) followed by either an immediate analysis of fresh milk samples or storage at −18°C until further analysis. 3adairy cows 3axanthine oxidase 3afrozen storage 3auric acid 3afood analysis 3afluorescence 3amilk composition 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3astorage quality 3aenzyme inhibitors 3amilk 3apretreatment 3aHolstein 3aheat treatment 3aJersey 3amilk yield 3aenzyme activity 3aallopurinol 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aFluorometryxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aUric Acidxanalysis 0astorage 0acold storage1 aMoyes, Kasey M.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2010 Nov., v. 77, no. 4 p.438-444dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299100005803Available from publisher's Web site  a20101217b20110101c00000000  aINDd7CTe2010/11/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02697naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162100001300171245013900184300001800323500002400341500001500365520106500380650001801445650001901463650001901482650002001501650002601521650003201547650002501579650002301604650001401627650002301641650002601664650004201690650002801732650004601760650003701806650003801843653002801881653001101909773010801920852000902028856008302037930003302120945002502153946001302178655001202191IND4443371520221118040044.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337152DNAL7 a208314052pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-06-10-01242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aQu, Feng10aAntiviral Role of Plant-Encoded RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases Revisited with Deep Sequencing of Small Interfering RNAs of Virus Origin  ap. 1248-1252.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeveral recent studies profiled virus-specific small interfering RNAs (vsRNAs) using next generation sequencing platforms and compellingly implicated plant-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDR) in vsRNA biogenesis and vsRNA-mediated antiviral defense. Specifically, both RDR1 and RDR6 were found to contribute to the accumulation of vsRNAs in virus-infected cells. While RDR1 was responsible for the majority of vsRNAs in plants infected with three different viruses, RDR6 acted as a surrogate when RDR1 function was disrupted. Mechanistically, vsRNAs associated with RDR1 mostly mapped to viral RNA regions close to the 5′ ends, whereas those associated with RDR6 mapped to more 3′ regions and appeared to be dependent on higher viral RNA concentrations. Knocking out both RDR1 and RDR6 led to drastically diminished vsRNA levels concomitant with enhanced viral RNA accumulation. In conclusion, these studies established that RDR1 and RDR6 function synergistically to contain RNA virus infections through the RNA silencing–based antiviral defense. 3aplant viruses 3aplant proteins 3agene silencing 3agene expression 3aresistance mechanisms 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3anucleotide sequences 3adisease resistance 3asynergism 3amicrobial genetics 3asmall interfering RNA 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxvirology. 2aPlant Virusesxgenetics 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data 0aplants0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2010 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.1248-1252dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-06-10-01243Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/12/03  aOther US 7aarticle03449naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245015400180300001600334520180100350592002802151650001902179650002102198650001702219650002302236650001402259650001102273650002002284650003102304650002902335650002502364650001402389650001702403650001902420650000902439650002602448650002102474650001602495650001102511653002102522653003202543653001602575653002702591653002002618700001902638700002402657700002602681700002202707773008302729856008602812852000902898655001202907IND60581707820221118003305.0171005e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058170782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Sabirón, Ana M.10aCarbon footprint of a thermal energy storage system using phase change materials for industrial energy recovery to reduce the fossil fuel consumption  ap. 616-624.  aUntil now, a small number of studies have analysed the carbon footprint (CO2 eq. emissions) of the application of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in conventional Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems considering different conventional fossil fuels as the source of heat. In those scarce studies, the different environmental impact categories were estimated using, on the one hand, diverse environmental methodologies and, on the other hand, different environmental evaluation methods (the midpoint and endpoint approaches). Despite the fact that several researchers have used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology as a tool to estimate the environmental impact of TES systems, there is no unanimity in the scientific community on the environmental evaluation method to be used. As a consequence, research results cannot be easily compared. This article evaluates the introduction of a TES system (using different PCMs) to recover the waste thermal energy released in industrial processes, which can be used in other applications, thereby avoiding fossil fuel consumption by the associated equipment to produce thermal energy. Five different fossil fuels have been considered to generate the 20 case studies that were analysed using the same methodology (LCA) and evaluation method (Global Warming Potential, GWP100, a midpoint approach). The results were used to identify the best cases, considering the environmental benefits that they generate. Additionally, this research indicates that the benefits can be achieved since, in general, the amount of conventional fuels saved is sufficiently large to balance the environmental impact associated with the inclusion of PCMs in conventional TES. Nevertheless, the selection of a PCM can increase or eliminate the environmental benefits obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aequipment 3afossil fuels 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3alife cycle assessment 3aphase transition 3aresearchers 3awastes 0aCarbon footprint 0aPhase Change Material (PCM) 0aFossil fuel 0aThermal energy storage 0aEnergy recovery1 aRoyo, Patricia1 aFerreira, Victor J.1 aAranda-Usón, Alfonso1 aFerreira, Germán0 tApplied energy.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 135 p.616-624dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012000168300001800288520157200306592002801878650002701906650001401933650002301947650002001970650002301990650001602013650001402029650001702043650001502060650001602075650002102091650001102112650001802123650003202141650002002173650001802193650002102211650002502232650001402257650000902271700002302280700001902303700003902322700001202361700001802373700001802391700001902409700002502428700002102453700001902474700006902493773014502562856008202707852000902789655001202798IND60681766720221121034502.0200117e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068176672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10296-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, Ryan J.10aZinc supplementation improves the harvest purity of β-glucuronidase from CHO cell culture by suppressing apoptosis  ap. 1097-1108.  aThe variability of trace metals in cell culture media is a potential manufacturing concern because it may significantly affect the production and quality of therapeutic proteins. Variability in trace metals in CHO cell culture has been shown to impact critical production metrics such as cell growth, viability, nutrient consumption, and production of recombinant proteins. To better understand the influence of excess supplementation, zinc and copper were initially supplemented with 50-μM concentrations to determine the impact on the production and quality of β-glucuronidase, a lysosomal enzyme, in a parallel bioreactor system. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a metal chelator, was included as another treatment to induce a depletion of trace metal bioavailability to examine deficiency. Samples were drawn daily to monitor cell growth and viability, nutrient levels, β-glucuronidase activity, and trace zinc flux. Cell cycle analysis revealed the inhibition of sub-G0/G1 species in zinc supplemented cultures, maintaining higher viability compared to the control, EDTA-, and copper-supplemented cultures. Enzyme activity analysis in the harvests revealed higher specific activity of β-glucuronidase in reactors supplemented with zinc. A confirmation run was conducted with supplementations of zinc at concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 μM. Further cell cycle analysis and caspase-3 analysis demonstrated the role of zinc as an apoptosis suppressor responsible for the enhanced harvest purity of β-glucuronidase from zinc-supplemented bioreactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aapoptosis 3abeta-glucuronidase 3abioavailability 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abioreactors 3acaspase-3 3acell culture 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3achelating agents 3acopper 3aculture media 3adietary mineral supplements 3aenzyme activity 3amanufacturing 3anutrient content 3arecombinant proteins 3aviability 3azinc1 aKetcham, Stephanie1 aMohammad, Adil1 aBandaranayake, Bandaranayake M.

We first designed a reporter screen using MEFs from human CD34-tTA/TetO-H2BGFP (34/H2BGFP) double transgenic mice. CD34+ cells from these mice label H2B histones with GFP, and cease labeling upon addition of doxycycline (DOX). MEFS were transduced with candidate TFs and then observed for the emergence of GFP+ cells that would indicate the acquisition of a hematopoietic or endothelial cell fate. Starting with 18 candidate TFs, and through a process of combinatorial elimination, we obtained a minimal set of factors that would induce the highest percentage of GFP+ cells. We found that Gata2, Gfi1b, and cFos were necessary and the addition of Etv6 provided the optimal induction. A series of gene expression analyses done at different time points during the reprogramming process revealed that these cells appeared to go through a precursor cell that underwent an endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). As such, this reprogramming process mimics developmental hematopoiesis "in a dish," allowing study of hematopoiesis in vitro and a platform to identify the mechanisms that underlie this specification. This methodology also provides a framework for translation of this work to the human system in the hopes of generating an alternative source of patient-specific hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for a number of applications in the treatment and study of hematologic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3adoxycycline 3aendothelial cells 3afibroblasts 3agene overexpression 3ahematologic diseases 3ahematopoiesis 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahistones 3ahumans 3amice 3atransgenic animals1 aPereira, Carlos-Filipe1 aBernitz, Jeffrey M.1 aLemischka, Ihor R.1 aMoore, Kateri0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Dec. 16, , no. 118 p.e54372-e54372dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/543723Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/54372/reprogramming-mouse-embryonic-fibroblasts-with-transcription-factors  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01756naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245014200173300001400315520058400329592002800913650001700941650001300958650001700971650001100988650001200999650001601011651001201027653002101039653002401060653002201084653002701106653003001133773014301163856007901306852000901385655001201394IND60682112320221120121433.0200124e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068211232DNAL7 a10.2478/trser-2019-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider-Binder, Erika10aParticularities of Grey Alder (Alnus incana) Stands in Riparian Galleries Along Streams of the Southern Transylvanian Tableland (Romania)  ap. 23-40.  aGrey Alder (Alnus incana (L.)

In this study, we used the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) to explore its effect on household food insecurity in the northern part of AJK, Pakistan, using household survey data of 600 rural women. By using the Partial Least Square model structural equation model (PLS-SEM), the outcomes show that rights of women in the leadership domain, agricultural production domain, resource ownership in the form of land and livestock and time-domain i.e., time spent on farming lands have significant negative effects on food insecurity, i.e., women can improve the vulnerability of their households by having access to these rights. Surprisingly, we found that women's empowerment in the income domain provides significant but positive results, which points out that some non-economic mechanisms such as patriarchal customs and norms may prevent women from controlling their household income. As a consequence, women are likely to spend less money on accessing foods. The study results have significant implications for developmental practitioners targeting alleviating food insecurity, and empowering women must focus on cultural factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood security 3ahousehold income 3ahousehold surveys 3aland policy 3aleadership 3aleast squares 3alivestock 3aownership 3astructural equation modeling 3aIndia 3aPakistan 0aHousehold food security 0aWomen rights 0aAgriculture 0aHierarchical construct 0aPLS-SEM1 aRen, Yanjun1 aRong, Kong1 aZhou, Jin0 tLand use policy.g2021 Mar., v. 102 p.105249-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1052493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009800159300002000257520178700277592002802064650001702092650002502109650001402134650002102148650001702169650001102186650001102197650002002208650001702228650001802245651001402263700002302277700004102300700002002341773012402361856007502485852000902560655001202569IND60636164020221123015635.0190505e20170606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063616402DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04681b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFontana, Ariel10aPhenolics profiling of pomace extracts from different grape varieties cultivated in Argentina  ap. 29446-29457.  aGrape pomace can be considered as an excellent and inexpensive source of phenolic compounds with potential bioactive properties. Therefore, the key aim of this study was to carry out a comparative study of different Argentinean grape varieties for selecting the most convenient residue during the recovery of compounds with antioxidant activities that will be useful in emerging industrial applications. Phenolics, including 17 non-anthocyanins and 13 anthocyanins, isolated from grape pomace (GP) obtained from the varieties Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot, were characterised via assessing different chemical profiles of the studied samples. The maximum concentrations of the non-anthocyanins corresponded to the following flavanols: (−)-epicatechin (5518 μg g⁻¹), (+)-catechin (5340 μg g⁻¹), procyanidin B1 (1820 μg g⁻¹), and syringic acid (6665 μg g⁻¹). Malvidin-3-glucoside was the most abundant anthocyanin (32 056 μg g⁻¹). The compound OH-tyrosol was first identified and quantified in the GPE of Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Moreover, stilbene trans-resveratrol was found at the levels as high as 328 μg g⁻¹ GPE in Malbec, thus highlighting the potentiality of the variety as a source of compounds with nutraceutical value. A discussion about the relationship between the high levels of syringic acid and the anthocyanin malvidin-3-glucoside has also been presented. Based on the results, new knowledge for understanding the possible synergic effects between the contents of compounds of different families in the extracts was presented. This information can be helpful for the technological application of the extracts and to justify different beneficial effects achieved when these extracts are used in experimental models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aflavanols 3afunctional foods 3agrape pomace 3agrapes 3amodels 3apomace extracts 3aprocyanidins 3asyringic acid 3aArgentina1 aAntoniolli, Andrea1 aD'Amario Fernández, María Agustina1 aBottini, Rubén0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 06, v. 7, no. 47 p.29446-29457dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04681b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245019900205520136800404592002801772650001401800650001601814650001801830650001001848650001601858650001501874650002501889650001301914650001801927650001501945650001801960650001801978650002901996650002402025650002302049650001502072650002002087650001902107650001402126650002802140650001402168650001702182650001302199653002402212653002502236653002502261653001902286653001802305653000902323700002402332700002302356700002102379773011802400856008202518852000902600655001202609IND60735797520221118190006.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073579752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomaa, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1544-304210aPhycotoxicity of antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to green algae Chlorella sp. and Desmodesmus spinosus: Assessment of combined toxicity by Box–Behnken experimental design  aThere is a growing concern regarding the adverse effects of pharmaceutical pollution on aquatic environments. The present study investigated the toxicity of different antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on two green algae namely Chlorella sp. and Desmodesmus spinosus. Based on the 96h IC₅₀ values of the two chlorophytes, tetracycline (TET) was more toxic than other antibiotics (ciprofloxacin (CPF) and amoxicillin (AMX)), while paracetamol (PAR) was more toxic than ketoprofen (KET) and diclofenac (DIF). Gross photosynthesis was markedly reduced with most of the investigated drugs, although, the Chl a content was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner. Algal treated cells exhibited elevated malonaldehyde content which reflected several structural and functional cellular damages. Catalase and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were involved in the reduction of reactive oxygen species, but the effects of APX were more pronounced at low drug concentrations. Box–Behnken design (BBD) was employed to investigate the combined toxicities of PAR, KET, AMX and TET on D. spinosus in response to growth inhibition and pigment increase. The mutual interactions varied between synergism and antagonism. The BBD analysis indicated that the experimental design could be effectively utilized as a useful tool for ecotoxicological assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aDesmodesmus 3aacetaminophen 3aalgae 3aamoxicillin 3aantagonism 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3aciprofloxacin 3adiclofenac 3adose response 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironmental technology 3aexperimental design 3agrowth retardation 3aketoprofen 3amalondialdehyde 3aphotosynthesis 3apollution 3areactive oxygen species 3asynergism 3atetracycline 3atoxicity 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aGross photosynthesis 0aBox–Behnken design 0aJoint toxicity 0aEcotoxicology 0aIC501 aZien-Elabdeen, Ayat1 aHifney, Awatief F.1 aAdam, Mahmoud S.0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101586-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015500173300001400328520132200342592002801664650001201692650002101704650001901725650001801744650002701762650001701789650001701806650001901823650002901842653002601871653002001897653001201917653001601929700001801945700002001963700002001983700001902003700002802022700002202050773009102072856008502163852000902248655001202257IND60599426420221118103731.0180702e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059942642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreirós, Nerea10aLipoxin A4: Problems with its determination using reversed phase chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and confirmation with chiral chromatography  ap. 82-87.  aLipoxins belong to the family of so-called pro-resolving endogenous lipid mediators which are derived from arachidonic acid and play a key role in the counter-regulation of inflammation. Arachidonic acid is also precursor of multiple pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are simultaneously present in biological compartments. The close structural relationship between several of these lipid mediators and the absence of blank matrix samples enormously complicates the unequivocal identification of these compounds.The determination of lipoxin A4 has been accomplished by chromatographic separation using a C18 reversed phase column and tandem mass spectrometry detection. Samples were liquid–liquid extracted with ethyl acetate before injection. Identification of the analyte was done based on three criteria: retention time, ratio of the m/z transitions and MS/MS spectrum. To avoid false positive results due to endogenous interferences, the extracted samples were re-injected into a chiral Lux Amylose-2 chromatographic column. The authors recommend the use of chiral chromatography in the determination of pro-resolving lipid mediators, together with transition area ratio and fragmentation spectra to improve selectivity for identification and quantitation purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3aarachidonic acid 3achromatography 3aethyl acetate 3afalse positive results 3ainflammation 3aleukotrienes 3aprostaglandins 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aChiral chromatography 0aLipid mediators 0aLipoxin 0aSelectivity1 aHomann, Julia1 aLabocha, Sandra1 aGrossmann, Nina1 aHahn, Julia S.1 aBrüne, B.q(Bernhard),1 aGeisslinger, Gerd0 tTalanta.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 127 p.82-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010900178300001600287520121000303592002801513650004401541650002101585650001301606650001701619650001501636650001801651650001201669650001101681650002101692650002001713650001301733650001501746650001601761650001101777653001601788653001701804653003301821653002801854653002001882700002401902700002501926700002301951700002301974700002401997773010702021856008602128852000902214655001202223IND60540770320221121123451.0190318e20140525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054077032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValasques, Gildomar L.10aExtraction optimization and antinociceptive activity of (1⟶3)-β-d-glucan from Rhodotorulamucilaginosa  ap. 293-299.  aβ-d-glucans are polymers of d-glucose monomers found in the cell walls of many bacteria, plants, fungi and yeasts. A variety of β-d-glucans differing in structures have been isolated from various sources and their biological activity to be regulated by various structural factors, such as the primary structure, molecular weight, solubility, and conformation. This study investigated the effect of extraction time and temperature on the yield of β-d-glucan produced by Rhodotorulamucilaginosa. A statistical Doehlert design was applied to determine the important effects and interactions of these independent variables on the yield of β-d-glucan, the dependent variable. Significant models were obtained. The best yield was of 25% obtained after 128min of extraction in a temperature of 72°C. The polysaccharides were characterized as (1⟶3)-β-d-glucan by methods spectroscopic (FT-IR, 1HNMR and 13CNMR). In addition, the antinociceptive effect was evaluated using different experimental tests (acetic acid-induced writhing test, formalin test and tail immersion test). The (1⟶3)-β-d-glucan showed a potent peripheral antinociceptive effect, possibly by the inhibition of inflammatory mediators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanalgesic effect 3abacteria 3abeta-glucans 3acell walls 3aformalin test 3aglucose 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aplants (botany) 3apolymers 3asolubility 3atemperature 3ayeasts 0aβ-d-glucan 0aOptimization 0aResponse surface methodology 0aRhodotorulamucilaginosa 0aAntinociceptive1 ade Lima, Flávia O.1 aBoffo, Elisangela F.1 aSantos, Jener D.G.1 ada Silva, Bruno C.1 ade Assis, Sandra A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 May 25, v. 105 p.293-299dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.01.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012000167300001800287520159700305592002801902596005901930596005901989596007202048650002202120650002102142650001602163650001302179650002002192650001502212650001502227650001702242650001102259650001302270650001902283650001402302650002202316650002502338650002902363650002602392650001602418700001502434700001402449700001502463700001302478700005502491773014502546856008202691852000902773655001202782IND60681767020221121034607.0200117e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068176702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10268-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Minggen12aA plasmid-based genomic screening system for transcriptional regulators of non-adjacent xenobiotic catabolism genes  ap. 1163-1174.  aBacteria play an important role in the catabolism of environmental xenobiotics. The study of transcriptional regulation has greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with these processes. However, genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) for xenobiotic catabolism are usually not located in the immediate vicinity of the catabolic genes that they regulate; therefore, functional identification of these TFs is difficult. Significantly modified from a metagenome screening method substrate-induced gene expression (SIGEX), here we propose a synthetic pSRGFP-18 plasmid-based tool as a TF reporter system. In short, two multiple cloning sites (MCS) were designed; one in front of an egfp reporter gene was constructed for promoter insertion, and the other MCS was used for shotgun cloning of genomic DNA. Based on the regulatory relationship between TFs and the promoter of their associated catabolic genes, this approach allowed us to screen for TF genes using a genome shotgun approach. This system performed well when testing the known operons. Following statistical analysis of known catabolic operons in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, the suggested region of the target promoter for this system was from − 250 to + 150. Furthermore, to broaden the applicability of this plasmid, a series of pSRGFP-18 and pBBR1-based pSRGFP-X plasmids were constructed, which had broad host ranges and contained different antibiotic markers. This study outlines a powerful tool to enable functional identification of TFs for bacterial xenobiotic catabolism.  aPublisher supplied data  a41671317cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41977119cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKJQN201940cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3agene expression 3ahost range 3ametabolism 3ametagenomics 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3areporter genes 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3astatistical analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3axenobiotics1 aXing, Ziyu1 aLu, Luyao1 aChen, Feng1 aHe, Jian1 aHuang, Xing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8710-81820 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 3 p.1163-1174dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10268-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245011400180300001600294520089600310592002801206653003101234653001301265653001701278653001701295653002201312700003001334700002801364773016601392856008201558852000901640655001201649IND60517061120221121070502.0190728e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706112DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154130015862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Felipe de Vasconcelos12aA new species of Tritonia (Opisthobranchia: Nudibranchia: Tritoniidae) from the tropical South Atlantic Ocean  ap. 579-585.  aA new species of the family Tritoniidae is described from the tropical South Atlantic Ocean.

Cu(II) was complexed with dimethyl dithiocarbamate (DMDC) to obtain hydrophobic complex and extracted to supramolecular solvent phase. The influences of some analytical parameters including pH, type and volume of supramolecular solvent, amount of complexing agent, ultrasonication and centrifuge time and sample volume were investigated. The effects of matrix components were also examined. The detection limit (LOD) and the quantification limit (LOQ) were 0.52µgL⁻¹ and 1.71µgL⁻¹ respectively. An preconcentration factor was obtained as 60 and the relative standard deviation was <3%. The accuracy of the developed method was evaluated by the analysis of the certified reference materials (TMDA-64.2 water, SRM 1568A Rice Flour and 8433 Corn Bran) and addition-recovery tests.

The microscopic and elemental analyses investigated the technology and metalworking practices used in the sanctuary’s votives with a micro-invasive analytical protocol. Results confirmed that the assemblage consists of copper-tin binary alloys and provide evidence for the continuity of bronze in the Tegea area during the Geometric (9th-7th century BCE) and Orientalising (7th century BCE) periods. Most of the artefacts are made of bronze with an average tin content of ca. 9 wt% Sn, while a small group (n= 3) of pins is tin-free (<0.3 wt% Sn). Tin concentrations in the alloys do not correlate with the typology of the pins. The results further suggest an intentional addition of tin, as indicated by the normal distribution of tin values, along with a local metallurgical technology, that catered for the local sanctuary’s demand for votive objects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aalloys 3aarchaeology 3ageometry 3anormal distribution 3atin 3aGreece 0aEarly Iron Age Greece 0aTegea 0aAthena Alea 0aVotive pins 0aCopper alloys 0aBronze 0aMicro XRF1 aKarydas, A.G.1 aOrfanou, V.1 aKantarelou, V.1 aZacharias, N.0 tJournal of archaeological science: Reports.g2021 June, v. 37 p.102975-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26843x2352-409X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.1029753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01229naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003100154245007200185500001900257520025000276592002800526650003100554650001900585650001600604650002200620651001100642653002100653653002300674653002400697773009600721856008900817852000900906655001200915IND60722777620221117161110.0210215e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072277762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1052692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolton-Thornton, Nathaniel10aViewpoint: How should policy respond to land abandonment in Europe?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article argues that policy responses to land abandonment in Europe must move beyond agriculture-oriented schemes under the purview of the Common Agricultural Policy to incorporate a range of independent, holistic rural development programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aabandoned land 3aland policy 3arural development 3aEurope 0aLand abandonment 0aRural depopulation 0aAgricultural policy0 tLand use policy.g2021 Mar., v. 102 p.105269-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1052693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014200165300001600307520157300323592002801896653001101924653002001935653001801955653002401973653001301997653002302010700003002033700003402063773016602097856008202263852000902345655001202354IND60517061220221121070408.0190728e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706122DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154130015982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorton, Brian10aSpecies richness, relative abundance and dwarfism in Azorean bivalves: consequences of latitude, isolation or productivity? Or all three?  ap. 567-578.  aThe Azorean seabed is depauperate in terms of bivalve species richness, there being only between ~70 and 80 recorded to date, most being sub-tidal and generally lacking of specialists. Analysis of large numbers (>3200) of Azorean bivalve shells has revealed that, overall, each species is only ~50% the shell length size of Mediterranean conspecifics. Thus, although Azorean bivalve size may be a consequence of decreasing latitude (Bergmann's Rule), the islands are located at approximately the same latitude as the Mediterranean (and are influenced by those waters) where larger conspecifics occur. Hence, the main reason for bivalve dwarfism in the archipelago appears to result from low oceanic productivity (Foster's Rule). This, in turn, is associated with low diversity, possibly resulting from past extinctions and isolation, and low population sizes, except for Ervilia castanea, which here overwhelmingly occupies higher-energy inshore habitats and associated higher productivities. Nevertheless, this species too is dwarfed by mainland conspecifics. Similarly, the introduced Venerupis decussata, found solely within the lagoonal environment of Fajã de Santo Cristo on São Jorge, is somewhat smaller than its mainland conspecifics, although it is abundant enough to warrant artisanal exploitation. This study therefore, supports Foster's Rule and argues for the role of nutrient deficiency in regulating Azorean species richness and individual maximum size. In waters of locally higher productivities, however, population densities increase, but not size.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAzores 0aBergmann's Rule 0aFoster's Rule 0aisland biogeography 0adwarfism 0aocean productivity1 aDa Cunha, Regina Tristão1 aDe Frias Martins, António M.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 May, v. 94, no. 3 p.567-578dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154130015983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010800167300001400275520122600289592002801515650001601543650001101559650002201570650002001592650002801612650001501640650001801655650001301673653005001686653006401736653004401800653003101844700001801875700001501893700002001908773009101928856008502019852000902104655001202113IND60599426720221118103754.0180702e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059942672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Chenyi10aPolydopamine-coated eppendorf tubes for Ti4+ immobilization for selective enrichment of phosphopeptides  ap. 88-93.  aMass spectrometric technique has emerged as a preferred technique in the analysis of protein phosphorylation. Owing to the low stoichiometry of phosphopeptides and the signal suppression effect by non-phosphopeptides, there is a demand for efficient enrichment of phosphopeptides. The selective enrichment of phosphopeptides in modified eppendorf tubes prior to mass spectrometry analysis, which can minimize sample loss as well as nonspecific interferences effectively, has become a hot topic in current proteomics field. In our work, an easy-to-use phosphopeptide-selective eppendorf tube was initially prepared, with its inner surface being modified with a Ti⁴⁺-immobilized polydopamine (PDA) layer. The unique Ti⁴⁺-immobilized PDA-modified eppendorf tubes (EP tube@PDA-Ti⁴⁺) are investigated for its application in selective enrichment of phosphopeptides from complex biological samples. Due to the high Ti⁴⁺ loading amount on the surface of PDA, the EP tube@PDA-Ti⁴⁺ exhibits remarkable phosphopeptide enrichment ability in protein digests and human serum, which presents a powerful evidence for its high selectivity in detecting the low-abundance phosphopeptides from complex biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphopeptides 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aproteomics 3astoichiometry 3atitanium 0aImmobilized metal ion affinity chromatography 0aPolydopamine-modified eppendorf tubes immobilized with Ti4+ 0aSelective enrichment of phosphopeptides 0aMass spectrometry analysis1 aDeng, Chunhui1 aZou, ShiEn1 aZhang, Xiangmin0 tTalanta.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 127 p.88-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011500162300002000277520152200297592002801819650003701847650001801884650001701902650001401919650002301933650001101956650001701967650001801984650001902002650001902021650001102040650001502051650001502066650001402081650000702095650001502102650002202117650001402139650001502153650001302168650001702181650001602198700001502214700001802229700001602247773012402263856007502387852000902462655001202471IND60636164520221123015655.0190506e20170721xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063616452DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04761d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Y.q(Yanan),10aCoMoO₄ as a novel heterogeneous catalyst of peroxymonosulfate activation for the degradation of organic dyes  ap. 36193-36200.  aSulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs) are receiving more and more attention for the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants. In this study, we employ CoMoO₄ as a novel heterogeneous catalyst for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation to release powerful sulfate radicals for the first time. The CoMoO₄, prepared through a hydrothermal route and high-temperature calcination, displays a hierarchical microstructure assembled from ultrathin nanosheets and a large surface area (61.9 m² g⁻¹). Methylene blue (MB) is selected as a model organic pollutant, and it is found that the CoMoO₄/PMS system can realize 100% degradation of MB in 40 min and maintain its removal efficiency during three recycling experiments. Such a catalytic performance of CoMoO₄ is indeed superior to those of conventional Co₃O₄ and CoFe₂O₄. The effects of some potential influential factors, including reaction temperature, dosages of PMS and CoMoO₄ and the initial pH value are systematically evaluated. More importantly, the CoMoO₄/PMS system not only shows its universality in the degradation of other organic dyes (e.g. orange II and rhodamine B), but also exhibits considerable degradation efficiency under some actual water background conditions. The quenching experiments confirm that sulfate radicals are the main active species for the degradation of dyes, and XPS spectra reveal that Co sites on the surface of CoMoO₄ are the primary active sites for the generation of sulfate radicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacid orange 7 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3afree radicals 3amethylene blue 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution control 3arecycling 3arhodamines 3asulfates 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aMa, Wenjie1 aHe, Jianglong1 aDu, Yunchen0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 21, v. 7, no. 57 p.36193-36200dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04761d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245012700177300001600304520102500320592002801345653002001373653001101393653001901404653002301423653002001446653001501466700002901481700002601510700003401536700004501570700002901615773016601644856008201810852000901892655001201901IND60517061420221121070424.0190728e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706142DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154130016532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Almaraz, Pablo10aMetal mobility and bioaccumulation differences at lower trophic levels in marine ecosystems dominated by Sargassum species  ap. 435-442.  aConcentrations of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) were measured in three macroalgal species, Codium simulans, Sargassum sinicola and Gracilaria pachydermatica, and in the sea slug Elysia diomedea, living in marine ecosystems dominated by Sargassum species and located near exploited phosphorite deposits. Metal concentrations in macroalgae and sea slugs were significantly different among sites. The highest concentrations of Cd recorded in C. simulans and S. sinicola, as well as in E. diomedea were recorded at the site closest to the phosphorite deposit. In general, Cd and Zn concentrations in E. diomedea were higher than those recorded in specimens of C. simulans, S. sinicola and G. pachydermatica. In contrast, Pb, Cu, and Fe concentrations in E. diomedea were lower than or similar to those in macroalgae from all sampled sites.

The density of states (DOS) of the Au/YSZ interface around the Fermi level is less than that of the Pt/YSZ interface, resulting from the lower density of Au-s and -p orbitals around the Fermi level compared with the higher density of Pt-d orbitals. Metal layers adjacent to the interface become negatively charged when the bonding oxygen layer contains a high concentration of oxygen vacancies. These results indicate that segregation of oxygen vacancies to Au or Pt/YSZ hetero-interfaces increase the electronic conductivity of Au or Pt atom layers at the interfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3agold 3aoxygen 3aplatinum1 aKuwabara, A.1 aFisher, C.

The standard error of the estimates and a parametric bootstrapping procedure was used to investigate sampling properties of the estimated variance components. The data set contained milk yield, dry matter intake and body weight for 517 first-lactation heifers with genotypes and phenotypes, and another 112 heifers with phenotypes only. Multivariate models were fitted using the different relationships in ASReml software. Estimates of genetic variance were lower based on genomic relationships than using pedigree relationships. Genetic variances from genomic and pedigree relationships were, however, not directly comparable because they apply to different base populations. Standard errors indicated that using the genomic relationships gave more accurate estimates of heritability but equally accurate estimates of genetic correlation. However, the estimates of standard errors were affected by the differences in scale between the 2 relationship matrices, causing differences in values of the genetic parameters. The bootstrapping results (with genetic parameters at the same level), confirmed that both heritability and genetic correlations were estimated more accurately with genomic relationships in comparison with using the pedigree relationships. Animals without genotype were included in the analysis by merging genomic and pedigree relationships. This allowed all phenotypes to be used, including those from non-genotyped animals. This combination of genomic and pedigree relationships gave the most accurate estimates of genetic variance. When a small data set is available it might be more advantageous for the estimation of genetic parameters to genotype existing animals, rather than collecting more phenotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adry matter intake 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variance 3agenotype 3aheifers 3aheritability 3amilk yield 3amultivariate analysis 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avariance 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenetic Association Studiesxveterinary 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aGenomexgenetics 2aGenotype 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMale 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aModels, Genetic 2aPedigree 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable1 aMulder, H.A.1 aThompson, R.1 aCalus, M.P.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Aug., v. 94, no. 8 p.4189-4197dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-42233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013800164300001600302520158900318592002801907653001501935653001901950653001901969653001501988653001902003700001602022700002402038700002602062700002402088773016602112856008202278852000902360655001202369IND60517061520221121070400.0190728e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051706152DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154130016772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Wouter10aInventory and comparison of abundance of parasitic copepods on fish hosts in the western Wadden Sea (North Sea) between 1968 and 2010  ap. 547-555.  aA conspicuous part of the parasite fauna of marine fish are ectoparasites, which attach mainly to the fins or gills. The abundant copepods have received much interest due to their negative effects on hosts. However, for many localities the copepod fauna of fish is still poorly known, and we know little about their temporal stability as long-term observations are largely absent. Our study provides the first inventory of ectoparasitic copepods on fish from the western Wadden Sea (North Sea) based on field data from 1968 and 2010 and additional unpublished notes. In total, 47 copepod parasite species have been recorded on 52 fish host species to date. For two copepod species parasitizing the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), a quantitative comparison of infection levels between 1968 and 2010 was possible. Whereas Acanthochondria cornuta did not show a change in the relationship between host size and infection levels, Lepeophtheirus pectoralis shifted towards the infection of smaller hosts, with higher infection levels in 2010 compared to 1968. These differences probably reflect the biology of the species and the observed decrease in abundance and size of flounders during the last decades. The skin-infecting L. pectoralis can probably compensate for dwindling host abundance by infecting smaller fish and increasing its abundance per given host size. In contrast, the gill cavity inhabiting A. cornuta probably faces a spatial constraint (fixed number of gill arches), thus limiting its abundance and setting a minimum for the host size necessary for infections.  aPublisher supplied data 0aparasitism 0along-term data 0aparasite fauna 0afish hosts 0acoastal waters1 aBoer, Peter1 aWitte, Johannes IJ.1 aVan der Veer, Henk W.1 aThieltges, David W.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 May, v. 94, no. 3 p.547-555dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154130016773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010800159500001900267500002000286520170100306592002802007650003402035650001702069650002502086650001702111650001302128650001602141650000702157650001502164650001102179650002002190650002502210700001602235700001702251700001902268700001802287700001902305700001502324700001202339700001602351700002002367700001302387700005502400773014302455856007402598852000902672655001202681IND60725487620221118194840.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072548762DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.150492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhifang10aEffects of elevated sodium chloride on shelf‐life and antioxidant ability of grape juice sports drink  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effects of sodium chloride on pH, total soluble solid, phenolics, anthocyanins, and 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl radical‐scavenging activity (DPPH) of grape juice during storage at 7, 20, and 30°C were investigated in this study. The results indicated that during the 6‐day storage, NaCl at concentrations of 17, 42.5, and 85 mmol/L delayed the decrease of total anthocyanins and DPPH effectively at 7, 20, and 30°C. Except for 85 mmol/L at the late stages during storage, NaCl‐treated samples showed higher levels of total phenolics than control groups stored at 7, 20, and 30°C. Additionally, samples treated with NaCl showed significantly delayed decrease of pH and total soluble solids especially at 20 and 30°C. DPPH showed positive and significant correlation with total soluble solids, total phenolics, and total anthocyanins with r of 0.298 (p < .05), 0.376 (p < .01), and 0.835 (p < .001), respectively, while no correlation with pH. Our results showed that NaCl has potential effect on maintaining the quality and extending shelf life of grape juice without preservatives. In addition, NaCl‐treated grape juice could supplement water, electrolytes lost during exercise and antioxidant substances. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, effects of NaCl on quality of grape juice during storage were investigated. NaCl effectively delayed decrease of anthocyanins and antioxidant activity and has potential effect on maintaining the quality grape juice. Additionally, NaCl‐treated grape juice replenishes water, sodium, total soluble solids, antioxidant substances, etc., and provides a theoretical basis for the development of juice‐type sports drinks.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aexercise 3agrape juice 3apH 3ashelf life 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3atotal soluble solids1 aLyu, Jiayin1 aLou, Heqiang1 aTang, Chaochao1 aZheng, Hexiao1 aChen, Shaoning1 aYu, Meilan1 aHu, Wei1 aJin, Lumeng1 aWang, Changchun1 aLv, Heli1 aLu, Hongfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9732-08330 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e15049-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.150493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245014000172300001600312500001900328520086000347592002801207650002001235650002901255650001301284650001301297650001901310650002901329650001301358650001201371653000801383653000901391653003201400700002201432700001401454700002501468700001801493773010401511856008301615990002301698852000901721655001201730IND60697459120221119191644.0200605e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069745912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalil, Mohamed I.10aVaricella-zoster virus (VZV) origin of DNA replication oriS influences origin-dependent DNA replication and flanking gene transcription  ap. 179-186.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe VZV genome has two origins of DNA replication (oriS), each of which consists of an AT-rich sequence and three origin binding protein (OBP) sites called Box A, C and B. In these experiments, the mutation in the core sequence CGC of the Box A and C not only inhibited DNA replication but also inhibited both ORF62 and ORF63 expression in reporter gene assays. In contrast the Box B mutation did not influence DNA replication or flanking gene transcription. These results suggest that efficient DNA replication enhances ORF62 and ORF63 transcription. Recombinant viruses carrying these mutations in both sites and one with a deletion of the whole oriS were constructed. Surprisingly, the recombinant virus lacking both copies of oriS retained the capacity to replicate in melanoma and HELF cells suggesting that VZV has another origin of DNA replication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 3 3amelanoma 3amutation 3areporter genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirology 3aviruses 0aVZV 0aOriS 0aFlanking gene transcription1 aSommer, Marvin H.1 aHay, John1 aRuyechan, William T.1 aArvin, Ann M.0 tVirology.g2015 July, v. 481 p.179-186dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245011100198300001600309500001900325500002000344520133900364592002801703596007301731596006901804650001301873650001701886650001501903650001201918650001001930650002701940650003801967650001102005650001402016650002402030650002302054651001302077651001302090773013602103856007302239852000902312655001202321IND60705314620221120154457.0200803e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070531462DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.124392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHargrove, J.

A Markov process was used to model age‐dependent changes in wing fray in tsetse (Glossina spp), calibrated using published mark–recapture data for male G. m. morsitans in Tanzania. The model was applied to female G. m. morsitans, captured in Zimbabwe using a vehicle‐mounted electric net and subjected to ovarian dissection and wing fray analysis. Rates of fray increased significantly with age in males but not females, where the rate was constant for ovarian categories 0–3. A jump in mean fray between ovarian categories 3 and 4 + 4n is consistent with the latter category including flies that have ovulated 4, 8, 12, 16 times and so on. The magnitude of the jump could, theoretically, facilitate improved mortality estimates. In practice, although knowledge of fly mortality was required for modelling wing fray, mortality estimates derived from ovarian dissection data are independent of patterns and rates of change in wing fray. Significantly better fits to ovarian age data resulted when age‐specific mortality was modelled as the sum of two exponentials, with high mortality in young and old flies, than when mortality was constant at 2.3% per day.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/L019035/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  cDepartment of Science and Innovation, Government of South Africa 3aGlossina 3aMarkov chain 3adissection 3afemales 3amales 3amark-recapture studies 3amedical and veterinary entomology 3amodels 3amortality 3apopulation dynamics 3avectorial capacity 3aTanzania 3aZimbabwe0 tMedical and veterinary entomology.g2020 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.251-263dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl42323x0269-283X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mve.124393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03709naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009600211300001100307500001100318520215100329592002802480650001202508650002002520650001202540650001402552650001202566650001902578650001002597650001802607650001402625650001202639650002902651650002502680650001302705650001702718650001902735650001602754700006402770700005902834700005702893700006102950773013603011856008303147852000903230655001203239IND60782369420221118021313.0220803e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078236942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-022-03194-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Patricia L.

Whether or not, and under what circumstances, females benefit from multiple mating has been less clear. Our review of 154 studies covering 184 populations of amphibians and reptiles showed that polyandry was widespread and variable among and within taxonomic groups. We investigated whether amphibian and reptile females had greater reproductive output as the number of sires for offspring increased. Meta-analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in the dataset of all taxa. Expected heterozygosity was a significant moderator (covariate) of positive relationships between female reproductive output and the number of sires, but a sensitivity test showed the result was tenuous. Significant heterogeneity remained despite controlling for expected heterozygosity and other variables but was resolved for most taxonomic groups with subgroup meta-analyses. Subgroup meta-analyses showed that only female salamanders (Caudata) had significantly greater reproductive output with an increased number of sires. For many species of Caudata, males cannot coerce females into accepting spermatophores. We therefore suggest that if females control the number of matings, they can use polyandry to increase their fitness. Caudata offers ideal models with which to test this hypothesis and to explore factors enabling and maintaining the evolution of female choice. Outstanding problems may be addressed by expanding taxonomic coverage and data collection and improving data reporting. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Many factors and combinations of factors drive polyandry. Whether or not females benefit from mating with more than one male remains equivocal. Focusing on amphibians and reptiles, our analyses demonstrate that female salamanders produced more offspring when mated with multiple males, whereas this was not the case for reptiles. Unlike many other species in our dataset, the polyandrous female salamanders fully control sperm intake and have chosen to mate multiple times. We further highlight problems and key directions for future research in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaudata 3adata collection 3aecology 3aevolution 3afemales 3aheterozygosity 3amales 3ameta-analysis 3apolyandry 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3areproductive success 3areptiles 3asociobiology 3aspermatophores 3aspermatozoa1 aSherman, Craig D.

Therefore, this study aimed evaluating the impact of inulin on the physical properties, proximate composition, glycemic response and sensory acceptance of corn breakfast cereals. A mixture of corn grits and inulin was extruded in a single screw extruder, at a feed rate of 247 g/min, temperatures in the shearing zones at 140 °C and screw speed of 192 rpm. The addition of inulin did not impair the physical properties of breakfast cereals, such as expansion ratio, density, instrumental force and color. Moreover, inulin did not affect the acceptance of products, as well as having a positive impact on them. Extrudates with inulin presented a high fiber level and moderate glycemic load, in contrast to the control extrudate that had low fiber level and high glycemic load. Therefore, the addition of inulin in breakfast cereals is promising and may contribute to increasing the consumption of products with aggregated nutritive value.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreakfast 3acolor 3acorn 3acorn grits 3aglycemic effect 3aglycemic load 3ahydrocolloids 3aingredients 3ainulin 3apasta 3aproximate composition 3asweets 0aFructan 0aExtrusion-cooking 0aGlycemic index 0aGlycemic load 0aSensory quality1 aCapriles, Vanessa Dias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8486-11121 aConti-Silva, Ana Carolina0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2021 May, v. 114 p.106582-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.1065823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04245naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006400149245018300213506010400396506007600500520213500576592002802711506003702739650001602776650001602792650001602808650001602824650001402840650001802854650002202872650001902894650002602913650002502939650001402964650001002978650002502988650002103013650001503034650001403049650001103063650001903074650002903093650002003122650002403142653001903166653002603185653001303211653001103224653001903235700002303254700002403277700001903301700002903320700001803349700005903367773010003426856008403526852000903610655001203619IND60735798320221207143843.0220704e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073579832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKousoulaki, Katerina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8021-545212aA full factorial design to investigate interactions of variable essential amino acids, trace minerals and vitamins on Atlantic salmon smoltification and post transfer performance  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo contribute in knowledge for the development of safe, efficient and sustainable functional salmon diets, we ran a feeding trial applying a 2³ full factorial design to investigate combined effects, on Atlantic salmon smoltification and post transfer performance, of variable supplementation levels of essential amino acid (Lys, Met, Thr and Arg), essential trace mineral (Zn, Fe and Se) and vitamins (E, C and astaxanthin as provitamin A) premixes in low fishmeal diets, using crystalline amino acids, organic trace minerals and synthetic vitamins, respectively. The nutrient levels used in our study were chosen to meet the known requirements of fish reflecting the variation in commercial feeds. Fish performance, nutrient digestibility, skin, and intestinal health were evaluated in Atlantic salmon parr-smolt, the latter by means of qPCR, global transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry. The results revealed the potential for significant improvement of salmon post smoltification growth by simultaneous dietary level increase of Met, Lys, Thr and Arg (5% higher body weight increase). Significantly negative effect on fish post transfer growth and survival (22.5 % lower body weight growth and 2.6 times higher mortality) was observed in the high dietary vitamin supplementation treatments which was not present in the simultaneous high trace mineral and vitamin supplementation treatments (8% higher body weight increase and 2.8 times lower mortality in the high trace mineral supplementation treatments). In the high trace mineral supplemented dietary treatments was also observed improved FCR (8.5 %) and a further improvement in performance was seen in the treatments with simultaneous high essential amino acid and trace mineral supplementation levels (12.6 % higher body growth increase). Redox-sensitive gene and extracellular matrix components’ gene transcription effects and compensatory mechanisms on protein and energy metabolism, immune modulation, skin repair systems and erythropoiesis were observed by transcriptomic and histological analyses in response to the variable dietary essential nutrient levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmo salar 3aaquaculture 3aastaxanthin 3abody weight 3acarotenes 3adigestibility 3aenergy metabolism 3aerythropoiesis 3aessential amino acids 3aextracellular matrix 3afish meal 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aimmunomodulation 3aintestines 3amortality 3asalmon 3asmoltification 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3avitamin supplements 0aTrace minerals 0aEssential amino acids 0aVitamins 0aSalmon 0aSmoltification1 aKrasnov, Alekseĭ,1 aYtteborg, Elisabeth1 aSweetman, John1 aPedersen, Mona Elisabeth1 aHøst, Vibeke1 aMurphy, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4143-74310 tAquaculture reports.g2021 July, v. 20 p.100704-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013900164300001800303520154200321592002801863596006501891650002701956650002801983650002702011650001502038650002602053650003202079650001902111650002002130650002902150650001202179650001402191650001702205650001402222650001602236700005502252773014502307856008202452852000902534655001202543IND60681767620221121034417.0200117e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068176762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-019-10266-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Menghao10aCell permeability, β-lactamase activity, and transport contribute to high level of resistance to ampicillin in Lysobacter enzymogenes  ap. 1149-1161.  aDiscovery of multidrug resistance (MDR) in environmental microorganisms provides unique resources for uncovering antibiotic resistomes, which could be vital to predict future emergence of MDR pathogens. Our previous studies indicated that Lysobacter sp. conferred intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics at high levels, especially ampicillin, the first broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for resistance to ampicillin in Lysobacter enzymogenes strain C3 (LeC3) remain unknown. In this study, screening a Tn5 transposon mutant library of LeC3 recovered 12 mutants with decreased ampicillin resistance, and three mutants (i.e., tatC, lebla, and lpp) were selected for further characterization. Our results revealed that genes encoding β-lactamase (lebla) and twin-arginine translocation (tatC) system for β-lactamase transport played a pivotal role in conferring ampicillin resistance in L. enzymogenes. It was also demonstrated that the lpp gene was not only involved in resistance against β-lactams but also conferred resistance to multiple antibiotics in L. enzymogenes. Permeability assay results indicated that decreased MDR in the lpp mutant was in part due to its higher cellular permeability. Furthermore, our results showed that the difference of LeC3 and L. antibioticus strain LaATCC29479 in ampicillin susceptibility was partly due to their differences in cellular permeability, but not due to β-lactamase activities.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016-67013-24812cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLysobacter antibioticus 3aLysobacter enzymogenes 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abeta-lactamase 3aenzyme activity 3amultiple drug resistance 3amutants 3apathogens 3apermeability 3ascreening 3atransposons1 aZhao, Youfu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0728-58920 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 3 p.1149-1161dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10266-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009300168300001600261520242900277592002802706650001002734650001902744650000902763650001902772650000902791700002202800700002002822700002702842700001802869700002202887700002002909773009302929856008103022852000903103655001203112IND60080269520221117192348.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008026952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-014-2219-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiallo, Ismaïla10aSimulation of the West African monsoon onset using the HadGEM3-RA regional climate model  ap. 575-594.  aThe performance of the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 3 regional climate model (HadGEM3-RA) in simulating the West African monsoon (WAM) is investigated. We focus on performance for monsoon onset timing and for rainfall totals over the June–July–August (JJA) season and on the model’s representation of the underlying dynamical processes. Experiments are driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis and follow the CORDEX experimental protocol. Simulations with the HadGEM3 global model, which shares a common physical formulation with HadGEM3-RA, are used to gain insight into the causes of HadGEM3-RA simulation errors. It is found that HadGEM3-RA simulations of monsoon onset timing are realistic, with an error in mean onset date of two pentads. However, the model has a dry bias over the Sahel during JJA of 15–20 %. Analysis suggests that this is related to errors in the positioning of the Saharan heat low, which is too far south in HadGEM3-RA and associated with an insufficient northward reach of the south-westerly low-level monsoon flow and weaker moisture convergence over the Sahel. Despite these biases HadGEM3-RA’s representation of the general rainfall distribution during the WAM appears superior to that of ERA-Interim when using Global Precipitation Climatology Project or Tropical Rain Measurement Mission data as reference. This suggests that the associated dynamical features seen in HadGEM3-RA can complement the physical picture available from ERA-Interim. This approach is supported by the fact that the global HadGEM3 model generates realistic simulations of the WAM without the benefit of pseudo-observational forcing at the lateral boundaries; suggesting that the physical formulation shared with HadGEM3-RA, is able to represent the driving processes. HadGEM3-RA simulations confirm previous findings that the main rainfall peak near 10°N during June–August is maintained by a region of mid-tropospheric ascent located, latitudinally, between the cores of the African Easterly Jet and Tropical Easterly Jet that intensifies around the time of onset. This region of ascent is weaker and located further south near 5°N in the driving ERA-Interim reanalysis, for reasons that may be related to the coarser resolution or the physics of the underlying model, and this is consistent with a less realistic latitudinal rainfall profile than found in the HadGEM3-RA simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSahel 3aclimate models 3aheat 3amonsoon season 3arain1 aBain, Caroline L.1 aGaye, Amadou T.1 aMoufouma-Okia, Wilfran1 aNiang, Coumba1 aDieng, Mame D.

(Digenea: Microscaphidiidae) is described from the pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta (Cryptodira: Carettochelydidae) from the Daly River, Northern Territory, Australia. Doodytrema n. gen. is differentiated from other microscaphidiid genera by the absence of pharyngeal diverticula and the organization of vitellarium, namely the absence of an intercecal vitelline field or vitelline fields that merge behind the ovary. The uterus of Doodytrema carettochelydis n. sp. differs dramatically from other microscaphidiids in that the uterus does not run between the testes, but instead passes dorsal to them. This is only the second microscaphidiid species from Australian freshwater turtles.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPlatyhelminthes 0aDigenea 0aMicroscaphidiidae 0aDoodytrema carettochelydis 0aCarettochelys insculpta 0aturtle 0aparasite 0aNorthern Territory 0aAustralia1 aSnyder, Scott D.0 tComparative parasitology.g2006 July, v. 73, no. 2 p.165-171dHelminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4238.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03007naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245008400198500001900282500002000301520174400321592002802065650001902093650001502112650002702127650002502154650001502179650002902194650000902223650001602232650001902248650001602267650001802283650002302301650001402324650001702338650001602355773014302371856007402514852000902588655001202597IND60725487920221118194850.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072548792DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.151332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöten, Mehmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8232-861010aDevelopment of tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] based gluten‐free tarhana  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to prepare gluten‐free tarhana by using different rates (20:40:40, 40:30:30, 60:20:20, 80:10:10, and 100:0:0%) tef flour (TF), corn flour, and potato starch instead of wheat flour and to determine the effects of tef flour addition levels on the some physical, chemical, nutritional, and sensory properties of tarhana samples. The use of tef flour in tarhana formulation increased the ash, protein, and fat contents of the tarhana samples, and also significantly (p < .05) affected their total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and phytic acid contents. Increasing amount of tef flour in tarhana formulations were resulted in higher oil absorption, foaming capacity, foaming stability, and lower viscosity and water absorption values. Incorporation of tef flour showed slight influence on the sensorial quality of the tarhana samples. The results obtained showed that the tef flour can be used to develop a new gluten‐free tarhana formulation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Tef (Eragrostis tef Zucc.), due to its gluten‐free composition, is an important grain for the daily diet of celiac patients, who should abstain from gluten‐containing foods in their lifetime. Besides, it is a rich nutritional source in terms of a balanced amino acid profile, polyphenols, and phytochemicals. In this study, tef flour (TF), corn flour, and potato starch were used at different rates (20:40:40, 40:30:30, 60:20:20, 80:10:10, and 100:0:0%) for developing a new gluten‐free tarhana formulation, and especially tef flour effects on physical, chemical, nutritional, and sensory properties of tarhana were evaluated. The addition of tef flour in particular increased the chemical and nutritional properties of tarhana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEragrostis tef 3aabsorption 3aamino acid composition 3aantioxidant activity 3acorn flour 3adietary nutrient sources 3aoils 3aphytic acid 3aphytochemicals 3apolyphenols 3apotato starch 3asensory properties 3aviscosity 3awater uptake 3awheat flour0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e15133-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.151333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006600156300001600222500001900238500002000257520122800277592002801505596003301533650002801566650002401594650002601618650002601644650001001670650000901680650001001689650003801699650003001737650001901767651001101786700001901797700001701816700001701833700002301850700002401873700002601897700002501923700001801948773013601966856007302102852000902175655001202184IND60705314820221120184707.0200803e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070531482DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.124382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobar, B.

However, limited information is available of the presence of these pathogens in Mexico. The present study looked at prevalence of Bartonella exposure and/or infection in dogs and their fleas in Central Mexico. Blood samples were collected from 31 stray dogs in August 2014 at the municipal pound, Tulancingo, Mexico, as well as fleas on 26 of them. Bartonella seropositivity was 46.9%, including 35.5% for Bartonella henselae, 45% for Bartonella clarridgeiae and 32.2% for Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. Three (9.7%) dogs were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for the Bartonella gltA gene. Partial sequencing of that gene revealed that these three dogs were infected with B. henselae. In total, 86 fleas were collected from 26 dogs (range 1–9 fleas per dog), including 52 Ctenocephalides felis and 34 Ctenocephalides canis. Of 40 pools of fleas (20 pools of C. canis and 20 pools of C. felis), five (12.5%) were PCR positive for the Bartonella sp. gltA gene, including three C. canis pools (five fleas) and two C. felis pools (three fleas). All sequences showed 99.25% to 100% homology with B. henselae Houston I.  aPublisher supplied data  ayear 2014‐2016cU.C.

For each snack‐type, five samples in the ratio 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:40, and 100:0 of YFSP and wheat flours, respectively, were produced. Sensory evaluation and proximate composition of the snacks were determined. The sensory evaluation showed that 20:80, 40:60, and 20:80% YFSP/wheat flour cakes, biscuits, and chin‐chin, respectively, compared favorably in all the sensory attributes with the control sample (100% wheat flour cake). The proximate composition (%) of the 100:0 of YFSP/wheat flour snacks ranged from 2.99 to 12.06 moisture, 5.16 to 10.88 protein, 11.93 to 20.91 fat, 2.86 to 3.87 ash, 1.65 to 4.15 crude fiber, and 50.48 to 72.88 carbohydrate. The 100:0 ratio of YFSP/wheat flour biscuit, cake, and chin‐chin had the highest energy contents (kcal/100 g). The study further enhances the strengths of YFSP in new product formulation for the snacks food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The possibility of producing snacks from yellow‐fleshed sweet potato (YFSP) and wheat flours, especially where the conventional flour is not financially feasible. The optimized process can be used for commercial production of these snacks (cake, biscuit, and chin‐chin) from YFSP for nutritional, health benefits, food security, and economic impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3acakes 3acarbohydrates 3acrude fiber 3aeconomic impact 3aenergy 3afood industry 3afood security 3aproximate composition 3asensory evaluation 3asweet potatoes 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aYunana, Ruth1 aJideani, Afam Israel Obiefuna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9122-86970 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.e14851-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.148513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015900171300001600330520182100346592002802167650001702195650001902212650001602231650001102247650001802258650001102276650001702287650002902304651001202333653000902345653000702354653001002361653000702371653000902378653000902387653000802396653000902404653001202413653000902425653001302434653001002447653000802457653002502465653002402490653002202514700001602536700001802552700002702570700001702597700002102614700002402635773008302659856008602742852000902828655001202837IND60581709020221118003255.0171005e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058170902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelsch, Manuel10aIncorporating flexibility requirements into long-term energy system models – A case study on high levels of renewable electricity penetration in Ireland  ap. 600-615.  aEfforts to meet climate change mitigation and energy security targets spur investments in variable renewable energy sources. Their implications for the operation of power plants are frequently investigated drawing on unit commitment and dispatch models. However, the temporal granularity and operational detail these models consider is commonly omitted in the broader family of long-term energy system models. To compensate this short-coming, these two types of tools have sometimes been ‘soft-linked’ and harmonised for limited simulation years. This paper assesses an alternative approach. We examine an extended version of an open source energy system model (OSeMOSYS), which is able to capture operating reserve and related investment requirements within a single tool. The implications of these model extensions are quantified through comparison with an Irish case study. That case study examined the effects of linking a long-term energy system model (TIMES) with a unit commitment and dispatch model (PLEXOS). It analysed the year 2020 in detail, applying a yearly temporal resolution that is over 700 times higher than in OSeMOSYS. Without increasing temporal resolution (and computational burden) we show that results of the enhanced OSeMOSYS model converge to results of TIMES and PLEXOS: Investment mismatches decrease from 21.4% to 5.0%. The OSeMOSYS analysis was then extended to 2050 to assess the implications of short-term variability on future capacity investment decisions. When variability was ignored, power system investments in 2050 were found to be 14.3% lower. This might imply that energy policies derived from such long-term models – of which there are many – may underestimate the costs of introducing variable renewables and thus meeting climate change or energy security targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3amodels 3apower plants 3arenewable energy sources 3aIreland 0aAMMO 0aCC 0aCPLEX 0aEU 0aGLPK 0aIGCC 0aKTH 0aLEAP 0aMESSAGE 0aOCGT 0aOSeMOSYS 0aTIMES 0aUCC 0aEnergy system models 0aPower system models 0aOperating reserve1 aDeane, Paul1 aHowells, Mark1 aÓ Gallachóir, Brian,1 aRogan, Fionn1 aBazilian, Morgan1 aRogner, Hans-Holger0 tApplied energy.g2014 Dec. 15, v. 135 p.600-615dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.08.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245007200170300001600242520114200258592002801400650002301428650001101451650001801462650001201480653001901492653001801511653002001529653001901549653002501568700001901593700001701612700002101629700003101650700001801681773009201699856008301791990002301874852000901897655001201906IND60697459620221119191548.0200605e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069745962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCulver, James N.10aPlant virus directed fabrication of nanoscale materials and devices  ap. 200-212.  aBottom-up self-assembly methods in which individual molecular components self-organize to form functional nanoscale patterns are of long-standing interest in the field of materials sciences. Such self-assembly processes are the hallmark of biology where complex macromolecules with defined functions assemble from smaller molecular components. In particular, plant virus-derived nanoparticles (PVNs) have drawn considerable attention for their unique self-assembly architectures and functionalities that can be harnessed to produce new materials for industrial and biomedical applications. In particular, PVNs provide simple systems to model and assemble nanoscale particles of uniform size and shape that can be modified through molecularly defined chemical and genetic alterations. Furthermore, PVNs bring the added potential to “farm” such bio-nanomaterials on an industrial scale, providing a renewable and environmentally sustainable means for the production of nano-materials. This review outlines the fabrication and application of several PVNs for a range of uses that include energy storage, catalysis, and threat detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aviruses 0aNanotechnology 0aBio-materials 0aVirus particles 0aVirus assembly 0aVirus-like particles1 aBrown, Adam D.1 aZang, Faheng1 aGnerlich, Markus1 aGerasopoulos, Konstantinos1 aGhodssi, Reza0 tVirology.g2015 May, v. 479-480 p.200-212dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009900171300001200270520205600282592002802338650001102366650001002377650001002387650001202397650002402409650002102433650001702454650002702471650001702498650001002515650002402525650001102549650001102560650001302571650002202584700002902606700001702635773014102652856008302793852000902876655001202885IND60648532320221118234733.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWickham, Catherine10aP68 FSU Cooks: Culinary Nutrition Workshops Help Participants Learn About Food, Cook, and Eat!  ap. S63.  aFSU Cooks: Learn.Cook.Eat was developed by the Food and Nutrition Department (FND) at Framingham State University (FSU). The purpose of the program is to provide an educational environment focused on food and culinary literacy. Participants learn about food, participate in hand-on cooking, and eat their creations. The aim of the pilot was to assess the feasibility of offering the program to community members.There is increasing evidence that hands-on culinary experiences can empower people to make healthy food choices by increasing exposure to new foods and techniques and increasing self-efficacy.FSU students and Framingham community members.FSU Cooks was piloted during Fall 2018 with two introductory campus and community lectures and three culinary nutrition workshops focused on diet and brain health. Lectures provided a backdrop to the workshops which targeted ‘brainy’ foods: whole grains, dark-green leafy vegetables, and spices. Workshop were led by FND faculty and FSU's executive chef. In addition, students from the FND acted as culinary assistants. Each workshop included an overview of nutrition-related topics, cooking demonstrations, and hands-on culinary experiences.Workshop activities were assessed using process evaluation. Participants rated questions on a scale (5=strongly agree and 1=strongly disagree). Qualitative data about the workshop was also collected.Twenty one participants attended three workshops. All participants indicated that they strongly agreed or agreed that the workshop information was useful and they would recommend the program to family and friends.Hands-on culinary workshops can be a fun and engaging way for participants to become empowered to make healthy choices. Based on information learned from the pilot, plans are in place to continue programing in spring 2019 with a focus on heart healthy foods. Additional evaluation methods will be incorporated to assess changes in participants pre-/post-workshop knowledge and intentions to change eating practices.Framingham State University.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3abrain 3achefs 3acooking 3acooking instruction 3aculinary science 3afood choices 3agreen leafy vegetables 3ahealthy diet 3aheart 3anutrition education 3aspices 3aspring 3astudents 3awhole grain foods1 aNelson-Peterman, Jerusha1 aJohnson, Ann0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S63-S63dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002200170245006800192300001500260520144600275592002801721650001201749650002901761650001201790650001601802650001001818650000901828650002201837650000901859650001101868650001301879650001601892650002101908650001101929650001401940650001401954650000901968650001101977650000901988650001401997650001502011650001502026650001802041650001602059650002202075650001502097650002702112650001102139650004102150650001702191651001802208651001802226700001802244700002502262700002002287700002802307700002902335700002102364700002002385700002002405700003502425700002602460773010002486856008702586852000902673655001202682IND4466809320221120024434.0141112e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446680932DNAL7 a221156142pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBundschuh, Jochen10aArsenic in the human food chain: the Latin American perspective  ap. 92-106.  aMany regions of Latin America are widely reported for the occurrence of high arsenic (As) in groundwater and surface water due to a combination of geological processes and/or anthropogenic activities. In this paper, we review the available literature (both in English and Spanish languages) to delineate human As exposure pathways through the food chain. Numerous studies show that As accumulations in edible plants and crops are mainly associated with the presence of high As in soils and irrigation waters. However, factors such as As speciation, type and composition of soil, and plant species have a major control on the amount of As uptake. Areas of high As concentrations in surface water and groundwater show high As accumulations in plants, fish/shellfish, livestock meat, milk and cheese. Such elevated As concentrations in food may result in widespread health risks to local inhabitants, including health of indigenous populations and residents living close to mining industries. Some studies show that As can be transferred from the water to prepared meals, thereby magnifying the As content in the human diet. Arsenic speciation might also change during food preparation, especially during high temperature cooking, such as grilling and frying. Finally, the review of the available literature demonstrates the necessity of more rigorous studies in evaluating pathways of As exposure through the human food chain in Latin America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLatinos 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3acheese milk 3acrops 3adiet 3aexposure pathways 3afish 3afrying 3agrilling 3agroundwater 3ahuman food chain 3ahumans 3alanguages 3alivestock 3ameat 3amining 3arisk 3ashellfish 3asoil types 3asoil water 3asurface water 3atemperature 2aArsenicxanalysis 2aFood Chain 2aGroundwaterxchemistry 2aHumans 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Supply 3aLatin America 0aLatin America1 aNath, Bibhash1 aBhattacharya, Prosun1 aLiu, Chen-Wuing1 aArmienta, María Aurora1 aMoreno López, Myriam V.1 aLópez, Dina L.,1 aJean, Jiin-Shuh1 aCornejo, Lorena1 aLauer Macedo, Luciene Fagundes1 aFilho, Alfredo Tenuta0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 July 1, v. 429 p.92-106dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245018300158300001600341500001500357520127800372592002801650650000901678650002401687650002401711650001001735650001501745650002001760651001601780651001601796653005001812653001801862653001801880700002201898700002001920700002501940700001601965700003101981700002402012700002102036700002202057700002202079700001902101773013102120856007302251961001202324852000902336655001202345IND60128958420221122215253.0151124e20131213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012895842DNAL7 a10.3417/20111212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, James S.10aToward Target 2 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation: An Expert Analysis of the Puerto Rican Flora to Validate New Streamlined Methods for Assessing Conservation Status1  ap. 199-205.  a2019-12-04  aTarget 2 of the 2020 Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) calls for a comprehensive list of the world's threatened plant species. The lack of such a list is one of the greatest impediments to protecting the full complement of the world's plant species, and work to achieve this has been slow. An efficient system for identifying those species that are at risk of extinction could help to achieve this goal in a timeframe sensitive to today's conservation needs. Two systems that efficiently use available data to assess conservation status were tested against a provisional International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List analysis to evaluate the native seed plant species of Puerto Rico. It was demonstrated that both systems efficiently identify species at risk, which is a step toward both the GSPC Target 2 and a more comprehensive IUCN Red List for plants. Both systems were effective at identifying plant species at risk, with the New York analysis identifying 98% and the Smithsonian analysis 85% of the plant species considered Threatened in the IUCN Red List. Both analyses to some extent overestimated those plants at risk, but the species identified are all range restricted and, thus, of some conservation interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3aconservation plants 3aconservation status 3aflora 3aextinction 3aSpermatophytina 3aPuerto Rico 0aPuerto Rico 0aGlobal Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) 0aSpermatophyta 0aIUCN Red List1 aKrupnick, Gary A.1 aStevens, Hannah1 aPorter-Morgan, Holly1 aBoom, Brian1 aAcevedo-Rodríguez, Pedro,1 aAckerman, James S.,1 aKolterman, Duane1 aSantiago, Eugenio1 aTorres, Christian1 aVelez, Jeanine0 tAnnals of the Missouri Botanical Garden.g2013 Dec. 13, v. 99, no. 2 p.199-205dthe Missouri Botanical Gardenx0026-64937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3417%2F20111213Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016100160500002000321520203500341592002802376650001702404650001102421650004002432650001802472650001902490650002502509650001702534650002002551650001302571650001502584650002002599650001402619650001202633650002702645650003202672650001202704650002302716650002302739650000902762650000902771650001202780650001602792650001402808650002102822650001802843650002202861650002102883650002502904650000902929650001602938650001002954700005902964700002203023700002503045700001803070773012703088856007403215852000903289655001203298IND60698285420221119210442.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069828542DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.132052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLtaif, Mabrouka10aProtective effects of Avena sativa against oxidative stress‐induced kidney damage resulting from an estrogen deficiency in ovariectomized Swiss mice model  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of Avena sativa and to confirm its protective effects on estrogen deficiency in ovariectomized mice (OVX) model. Animals were treated during 21 and 60 days as follows: negative control, positive control treated with oat, ovariectomized, and ovariectomized receiving hormonal or oat treatments, respectively. 21 days post‐surgery, our results showed that ovariectomy increases weight gain and urea level in plasma. After 60 days of treatment, OVX showed a gain in weight, high increases in relative kidney weight, plasmatic creatinine, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity, and protein oxidation as shown by elevated protein carbonyl (PCO) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels. On the other side, a decrease was detected in catalase activity. Meanwhile, no significant changes in urea level, lipid peroxidation, SOD and GSH activity were detected. Conversely, supplementation with oat reduced weight gain, as well as oxidative stress and oxidation protein in the kidney of OVX mice. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In our study, we removed the two ovaries of adult female mice in order to eliminate the essential source of steroid hormones. Deficiency in these sexual hormones, especially estrogen, leads to several physiological and morphological disturbances that are found in post‐menopausal women. The gain in weight and oxidative kidney damages were the main health problems detected in ovariectomized animals. This work explored for the first time the use of oat grains as a safe natural remedy to treat all previous health problems and to avoid carcinogenic effects of the menopausal hormone therapy. Owing to its health benefits, this cereal species has recently gained attention as an important source of antioxidants and fibers. Thanks to these two components, it can be able to restore all indicated disturbances. Therefore, this cereal can be very useful in the prevention of obesity and kidney oxidative damage occurring during menopause.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aadults 3aadvanced oxidation protein products 3aanimal models 3aanimal ovaries 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarcinogenicity 3acatalase 3acreatinine 3aenzyme activity 3aestrogens 3afemales 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahormone replacement therapy 3akidneys 3alaboratory animals 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3aoats 3aobesity 3aovariectomy 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apostmenopause 3aprotective effect 3asteroid hormones 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aurea 3aweight gain 3awomen1 aGargouri, Manel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1803-33081 aMagne, Christian,1 aEl Feki, Abdelfattah1 aSoussi, Ahlem0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.e13205-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012900171300001600300520214900316592002802465650001102493650002702504650001202531650001302543650001402556650001002570650001202580650001702592650003202609650001002641650002202651650001102673650002602684650001502710650002502725650001202750650001802762650002302780650001102803650001202814650002602826651001202852700001702864700001702881773014102898856008303039852000903122655001203131IND60648532420221118234707.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHornbeck, MaryBeth10aP69 Fun with Fresh Food Rainbow Nutrition Program Helps Families Improve Attitudes and Behavior Around Fruits and Vegetables  ap. S63-S64.  aThe Fun with Fresh Food (FFF) Rainbow Nutrition program is designed for families to improve attitudes and behaviors around fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption. This includes improving self-efficacy in adults preparing and serving FV, and increased interest in cooking and willingness to try FV in children.Previous research suggests parental self-efficacy around food affects children's diet quality. Social Cognitive Theory suggests modeling of food preparation is effective at increasing self-efficacy. Additionally, studies show children may need 10 to 30 exposures to foods before accepting them.Children (ages 2-13) and their parents/guardians attending summer community events in suburban Georgia in 2018.FFF uses research-based techniques for addressing picky eating in a six-week series of 20-minute interactive rainbow-themed food “commercials.” Each week centers on a color (i.e. purple), with the specific food (i.e. cabbage) remaining unknown until sessions begin. Children participate in age-appropriate kitchen tasks as part of a recipe demonstration. Sessions include taste tests and produce giveaways.Weekly post-program parent surveys assessed knowledge and behavioral intention. A final post-survey assessed parents’ perceived impact of series overall. Nine parents with > 50% attendance participated in interviews and focus groups to further explore program impact and acceptability.Average weekly attendance was 110 people; 50 children attended ≥ 50% of sessions. Eighty-three percent of adults gained FV knowledge and 78% intended to incorporate a recipe or tactic at home. Focus group data showed increased confidence in serving FV, greater interest in children cooking and eating FV, and the rainbow theme being a significant draw.The FFF program suggests short, repeat exposure to FV can have a strong impact on parental self-efficacy for cooking and eating FV and child interest in FV. Short demos may reduce barriers by illustrating healthy eating does not have to be time consuming or difficult. The FFF model could be employed in many community settings to reach families in a whimsical yet substantive way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3acabbage 3achildren 3acognition 3acolor 3acooking 3afocus groups 3afood and nutrition programs 3afoods 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3ahealthy eating habits 3ainterviews 3anutritional adequacy 3aparents 3aself-efficacy 3asensory evaluation 3asummer 3asurveys 3avegetable consumption 3aGeorgia1 aBerg, Alison1 aPrice, Roxie0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S63-S64dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008200164300001400246520149500260592002801755650002801783650002001811650001601831650001001847650001501857650001801872650001201890650001501902650002401917653002701941653001901968653002001987653002202007700005802029700001502087700001602102700001602118700001502134773009602149856008502245852000902330655001202339IND60603701220221118054607.0180716e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060370122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aFracture behavior of framing coated glass curtain walls under fire conditions  ap. 45-58.  aBreaking glass and its subsequent fallout may markedly affect enclosure fire dynamics. However, little is known about the thermal fracture behavior of framing glass façades in different installation forms. Sixteen 600×600×6mm³ solar control coated glass panes, installed in exposed, semi-exposed and hidden frames, were heated by a 500×500mm² n-heptane pool fire to investigate the influence of frame constraints on glass breakage and fallout. Measurements were taken of the time to breakage occurrence, heat release rates, incident heat flux, central gas temperatures and glass surface temperatures. Measurements in relation to crack initiation and propagation as well as loss of integrity of the glazing assembly were also recorded. The experimental results show that all cracks initiated at the edge of covered sections and intersected rapidly, forming islands. The maximum temperature difference and heat flux that the glass can withstand are primarily in the range of 50–90°C and 9–15kW/m². Using the finite element method (FEM), the breakage mechanism is demonstrated, the predictions of which are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental results. Among four different installation forms, semi-exposed framing façades showed better fire resistance than exposed framing façades. Meanwhile, the fire resistance of hidden framing façades may depend on the fire location. It is intended that these results will provide practical guidelines for fire safety design.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3afire resistance 3afire safety 3aglass 3aguidelines 3aheat transfer 3aheptane 3aprediction 3asurface temperature 0aFraming glass façades 0aFire condition 0aSupported forms 0aBreakage behavior1 aWang, Qingsong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6686-195X1 aSu, Yanfei1 aSun, Jinhua1 aHe, Linghui1 aLiew, K.M.0 tFire safety journal.g2015 July, v. 75 p.45-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245008400184300001600268520163400284592002801918650001101946650002501957650001701982650001101999650001502010650002002025650001502045650001202060650002302072650000902095650002002104650002702124650001302151650001802164650001602182650001202198651001202210653001402222653001802236653002402254653001502278653002002293653001602313700002402329700002402353700001802377700002002395700002202415700001802437773012702455856008702582852000902669655001202678IND60531441920221120145413.0190318e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053144192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGourlez de la Motte, Louis10aCarbon balance of an intensively grazed permanent grassland in southern Belgium  ap. 370-383.  aGrasslands are an important component of the global carbon balance, but their carbon storage potential is still highly uncertain. In particular, the impact of weather variability and management practices on grassland carbon budgets need to be assessed. This study investigated the carbon balance of an intensively managed permanent grassland and its uncertainties by drawing together 5 years of eddy covariance measurements and other organic carbon exchanges estimates. The results showed that, despite the high stocking rate and the old age of the pasture, the site acted as a relatively stable carbon sink from year to year, with a 5-year average net biome productivity of −161 [−134 −180]gCm−2yr−1. Lateral organic carbon fluxes were found to increase the carbon sink because of high carbon imports (organic fertilization, feed complements) and low carbon exports in form of meat compared to dairy pastures. The cattle stocking density was adapted to grass production, which itself depends on weather conditions and photosynthesizing area, in order to maintain a steady meat production. This resulted in a coupling between grazing management and weather conditions. As a consequence, both weather and grazing impacts on net ecosystem exchange were difficult to distinguish. Indeed, no correlation was found between weather variables anomalies and net ecosystem exchange anomalies. This coupling could also partly explain the low C budget inter-annual variability. The findings in this study are in agreement with those reported by other studies that have shown that well-managed grasslands could act as carbon sinks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3acattle 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3agrazing management 3ameat 3ameat production 3anet ecosystem exchange 3apastures 3astocking rate 3auncertainty 3aweather 3aBelgium 0aGrassland 0aCarbon budget 0aCarbon dioxide flux 0aManagement 0aEddy covariance 0aUncertainty1 aJérôme, Elisabeth1 aMamadou, Ossénatou1 aBeckers, Yves1 aBodson, Bernard1 aHeinesch, Bernard1 aAubinet, Marc0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 228-229 p.370-383dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2016.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245013400172300001600306520129800322592002801620650001501648650003101663650003701694650001301731650001401744650002001758651001901778653004401797653004101841653004001882653003401922653003701956700001401993700001202007773010602019856008802125852000902213655001202222IND60632837120221117083603.0191214e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063283712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikari, P.L.10aFate of particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the river-influenced continental margin of the northern Gulf of Mexico  ap. 350-362.  aThis study utilizes suspended particles and seafloor sediments collected from the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) continental margin to study the fate, transport, residence times and accumulation rates of particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Total particulate-PAHs and particulate organic carbon (POC) varied between 0.9 and 7.0 ng/L, and 4–131 μg/L, respectively. Particulate-PAHs were positively correlated with POC, while both particulate-PAHs and POC were negatively correlated with salinity (P-value < 0.05). These results show that the river-derived particle influx and associated POC are important vectors for transport and fate of particulate-PAHs in the river-dominated northern GOM continental ecosystems. The composition of underlying seafloor sediment-PAHs were not correlated to the water column particulate-PAHs, which is attributed to re-mineralization, sediment resuspension/redistribution and different timescales of comparison. The 210Pb-derived residence time of particles and associated particulate-PAHs in water column varied between 2 and 39 days. Residence times of particulate-PAHs were significantly correlated with seafloor sediment-PAHs accumulation rates, shorter water column residence times leading to higher PAHs accumulation rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aparticulate organic carbon 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asalinity 3asediments 3awater pollution 3aGulf of Mexico 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aHydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) 0aResidence times of particulate PAHs 0aNorthern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) 0aParticulate organic carbon (POC)1 aMaiti, K.1 aBam, W.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Apr., v. 141 p.350-362dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.02.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03695naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013700170300001200307520216500319592002802484650005002512650000902562650002702571650001002598650001202608650002102620650002002641650002302661650000902684650001002693650001702703650001102720650001602731650002402747650002602771650001302797650001202810650001802822650001102840650001202851650001502863650001002878651001302888700001902901700002402920773014102944856008303085852000903168655001203177IND60648532520221118234704.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetcalfe, Jessica10aP70 Hands-On Culinary Education Program for Youth Improves Cooking Skills, Attitudes, Self-Efficacy, Behaviors, and Food Preferences  ap. S64.  aEvaluate the impact of a revised version of the Illinois Junior Chefs (IJC) program using pre- and post-intervention surveys and observational assessments of hands-on cooking skills.To date, evaluations of nutrition education and cooking programs in youth have been limited to self-reported assessments of cooking skills. Along with using an established IJC survey, this study developed a novel observational protocol to assess hands-on cooking skills in youth.Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed) eligible youth (n = 591) aged 8-13.IJC is a hands-on culinary and nutrition education program implemented by the University of Illinois Office of Extension and Outreach. IJC is taught over five 2-hour lessons which include nutrition education, culinary skill building activities, recipe preparation, and food tastings.Pre- and post-intervention evaluations assessed hands-on cooking skills (observational assessment, n = 37) and psychosocial predictors of dietary behaviors (IJC survey, n = 591).Analyses of surveys indicated participants experienced significant improvements pre- to post-intervention in cooking self-efficacy (t(590) = 18.63, P < .001), cooking attitudes (t(590) = 7.12, P < .001), fruit and vegetable preferences (t(590) = 5.81, P < .001), and cooking behaviors (t(590) = 3.38, P = .001). Pre- to post-intervention analyses of observational data indicated participants experienced significant improvements in their ability to use a peeler (t(36) = 5.11, P < .001), use a grater (t(36) = 5.62, P < .001), beat (t(36) = 5.05, P < .001) and fold (t(36) = 6.67, P < .001) ingredients, measure water (t(36) = 2.47, P = .018), sugar (t(36) = 4.02, P < .001), and flour (t(36) = 7.07, P < .001), and crack eggs (t(36) = 2.70, P = .010).IJC participants experienced significant improvements in cooking self-efficacy, attitudes, behaviors, and food preferences.

F. arisanus attacks host eggs, whereas the other three attack host larvae; all four parasitoids emerge from host puparia. D. giffardii attacked host puparia that had been previously parasitized by all of the other four parasitoids. Attacks by D. giffardii on young fly puparia in which the secondary (parasitoid) host pupae had not fully formed resulted in high offspring mortality of D. giffardii compared with those developing on older host puparia, in which the host pupae had fully formed. Adult D. giffardii that developed on secondary host species were smaller and had higher mortality than those reared from the primary host, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). Developmental times of male and female D. giffardii were not affected by the host species. D. giffardii preferred to attack older rather than younger host puparia. D. giffardii also preferred to attack the primary rather than the secondary host species and invested more female offspring in primary than in secondary host species. Because of its nature of facultative hyperparasitism, D. giffardii may pose significant nontarget risks to other primary fruit fly parasitoids. 3aparasitoids 3aChalcididae 3anontarget organisms 3ahyperparasitism 3abiological control agents 3ahost-parasite relationships 3adevelopmental stages 3aintroduced species 3afruit flies 3aDiachasmimorpha longicaudata 3aTephritidae 3ahost preferences 3aFopius arisanus 3amortality 3aHawaii 0aDiachasmimorpha kraussii 0aparasitoid interactions 0aBraconidae 0anontarget hosts 0aDirhinus giffardii 0ahost age 0aprimary hosts 0asecondary hosts 0aPsyttalia concolor1 aMessing, R.H.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2004 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.1313-1320dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-33.5.13133Available from publisher's Web site  a20050809b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/12/23  aOther US 7aarticle03476naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010100167300001200268520184500280592002802125650002002153650001002173650001502183650001302198650002302211650001202234650002102246650001702267650001002284650002202294650001102316650002002327650001702347650002402364650001202388650002202400650002302422650001102445650001302456650001102469650002602480650001502506650001002521650001802531650001902549651001202568700002402580700002102604700002002625700002002645773014102665856008302806852000902889655001202898IND60648532620221118234718.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpero, Vanessa10aP71 Healthy Habits for Life: Food-Tastic Youth Programs to Build Healthy Relationships with Food  ap. S64.  aTo empower school-aged, at-risk youth and their families with the knowledge and skills needed to make healthier choices resulting in positive behavior changes using agriculture, nutrition, and health education.Many families don't have access to quality food and nutrition education and are at risk of negative health outcomes including inadequate nutrition and physical activity, leading to obesity and various other diseases (Choi, 2007; Stuart et al, 2008; Valois et al, 2002).School-aged, at-risk youth and their families.Three unique programs offered at schools, over the summer, and within the community: Try It Tuesday, a monthly program held in public elementary schools that gives students the opportunity to try a new fruit or vegetable and is occasionally incorporated into the cafeteria's menu, Tiny Market, a mobile farmer's market brought to summer-camp sites to educate youth on where food comes from and nutrition through activities such as scavenger hunts, healthy snack preparation, and shopping at the market, and Farmers in Training (F.I.T.), a program held at our monthly farmers market where children complete a taste test, physical activity, and nutrition activity focused on an in-season fruit or vegetable for ‘Farmer's Market Bucks’ to shop at the market.Program outcomes are evaluated through pre- and post-surveys.These evaluations have shown that youth exhibited a 55% knowledge gain about the importance of healthy food choices. Youth increased their awareness of fruit consumption by 12% and their vegetable consumption by 10%. In addition, 9% of youth began giving their family suggestions on healthy snacks and meals.These results suggest that youth who explore relationships with foods are empowered to immediately incorporate healthy choices into their lifestyle.University of Florida, IFAS, Extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3abucks 3acafeterias 3achildren 3aelementary schools 3afarmers 3afarmers' markets 3afood choices 3afoods 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3ahealth behavior 3ahealthy diet 3anutrition education 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3asensory evaluation 3asnacks 3astudents 3asummer 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3ayouth 3ayouth at risk 3ayouth programs 3aFlorida1 aElizabeth, Shephard1 aGayle, Whitworth1 aAndrea, Lazzari1 aAngelika, Keene0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S64-S64dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245013500169520103600304592002801340650001901368650001701387650001601404650001501420650001501435650002101450650001301471650002101484650001501505650001301520650001501533700002201548700002301570700002701593773012101620856007901741852000901820655001201829IND60757920320221116164428.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792032DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101125082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbeshri, Abdulaziz 12aA Review of Rhazya stricta Decne Phytochemistry, Bioactivities, Pharmacological Activities, Toxicity, and Folkloric Medicinal Uses  aThe local medicinal plant Rhazya stricta Decne is reviewed for its folkloric medicinal, phytochemical, pharmacological, biological, and toxicological features. R. stricta has been used widely in different cultures for various medical disorders. The phytochemical studies performed on the R. stricta extract revealed many alkaloidal and fatty acid compounds. Moreover, several flavonoid and terpenoid compounds were also detected. Pharmacological activates of R. stricta extracts are approved to possess antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive activities. Additionally, R. stricta extract was found to hold biological activates such as larvicidal and phytoremediation activates R. stricta extract was found to be toxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic. R. stricta contains novel phytochemical compounds that have not been investigated pharmacologically.

An online survey was communicated to senior veterinary students who were in their last two years of study. The questionnaire covered beliefs and attitudes, issues concerning the animal&ndash;human interface and participants&rsquo; confidence in diagnosing zoonoses. In total, 175 students from five Australian veterinary schools/colleges completed the online survey. The majority (96%) of students considered it their duty to promote the One Health approach, but only 36% believed there were sufficient practical frameworks for Australian veterinarian graduates to promote One Health. Interestingly, 81% (142/175) of respondents believed that veterinarians were more knowledgeable than physicians in managing zoonotic cases. Of the final-year students (n = 77), only 39% and 36% were confident in their ability to diagnose zoonoses in common companion animals and production animals, respectively. However, the number of those confident to diagnose zoonoses transmitted from wildlife was notably lower (22% (17/77)). Next-generation Australian veterinarians are keen to embrace their role in interprofessional collaboration; however, training efforts are required to reassure future veterinarians on aspects of zoonoses and One Health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOne Health initiative 3aquestionnaires 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3aveterinarians 3awildlife 3azoonoses1 aLam, Wing  Sze1 aSodagari, Hamid  Reza1 aIrons, Peter 1 aBruce, Mieghan 0 tAnimals.g2019 Aug. 10, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90805443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003200148245011000180300001400290520123400304592002801538650001501566650001501581650001501596650002001611650000901631650001101640650001701651650001301668650001801681650000901699653002701708653002901735653001801764653001801782653003201800700003001832700002801862700002701890700002201917700002701939700002401966773010901990856008302099852000902182655001202191IND60553601420221120084211.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055360142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira-Rodríguez, Myriam10aPoint-of-care detection of extracellular vesicles: Sensitivity optimization and multiple-target detection  ap. 38-45.  aExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanovesicles delivered by different cellular lineages under physiological and pathological conditions. Although these vesicles have shown relevance as biomarkers for a number of diseases, their isolation and detection still has several technical drawbacks, mainly related with problems of sensitivity and time-consumed. Here, we reported a rapid and multiple-targeted lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) system for the detection of EVs isolated from human plasma. A range of different labels (colloidal gold, carbon black and magnetic nanoparticles) was compared as detection probe in LFIA, being gold nanoparticles that showed better results. Using this platform, we demonstrated that improvements may be carried out by incorporating additional capture lines with different antibodies. The device exhibited a limit of detection (LOD) of 3.4×10⁶EVs/µL when anti-CD81 and anti-CD9 were selected as capture antibodies in a multiple-targeted format, and anti-CD63 labeled with gold nanoparticles was used as detection probe. This LFIA, coupled to EVs isolation kits, could become a rapid and useful tool for the point-of-care detection of EVs, with a total analysis time of two hours.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3agold 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3asoot 0aExtracellular vesicles 0aLateral flow immunoassay 0aPoint-of-care 0aNanoparticles 0aMultiple-targeted detection1 aSerrano-Pertierra, Esther1 aGarcía, Agustín Costa1 aLópez-Martín, Soraya1 aYañez-Mo, María1 aCernuda-Morollón, Eva1 aBlanco-López, M.C.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.38-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245012900180300001600309520178800325592002802113650001202141650001302153650002602166650002602192650001202218650001902230650001502249650002402264650004402288650001502332650002002347650002102367650001002388650001002398650001302408650001502421650001502436650002202451650001902473650002202492650001802514650001502532650000902547650002402556650002102580650001602601650001402617650007102631650007202702650001402774650001002788650006902798650002002867650002202887651002502909700001602934700001402950700002202964700001502986773009203001856004803093852000903141655001203150IND4468221120221120024426.0120615e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446822112DNAL7 a222028892pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-011-9995-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoberna, M.10aBurning Fire-Prone Mediterranean Shrublands: Immediate Changes in Soil Microbial Community Structure and Ecosystem Functions  ap. 242-255.  aWildfires subject soil microbes to extreme temperatures and modify their physical and chemical habitat. This might immediately alter their community structure and ecosystem functions. We burned a fire-prone shrubland under controlled conditions to investigate (1) the fire-induced changes in the community structure of soil archaea, bacteria and fungi by analysing 16S or 18S rRNA gene amplicons separated through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; (2) the physical and chemical variables determining the immediate shifts in the microbial community structure; and (3) the microbial drivers of the change in ecosystem functions related to biogeochemical cycling. Prokaryotes and eukaryotes were structured by the local environment in pre-fire soils. Fire caused a significant shift in the microbial community structure, biomass C, respiration and soil hydrolases. One-day changes in bacterial and fungal community structure correlated to the rise in total organic C and NO 3 − –N caused by the combustion of plant residues. In the following week, bacterial communities shifted further forced by desiccation and increasing concentrations of macronutrients. Shifts in archaeal community structure were unrelated to any of the 18 environmental variables measured. Fire-induced changes in the community structure of bacteria, rather than archaea or fungi, were correlated to the enhanced microbial biomass, CO2 production and hydrolysis of C and P organics. This is the first report on the combined effects of fire on the three biological domains in soils. We concluded that immediately after fire the biogeochemical cycling in Mediterranean shrublands becomes less conservative through the increased microbial biomass, activity and changes in the bacterial community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3agenes 3ahabitats 3ahydrolases 3ahydrolysis 3amicrobial biomass 3aplant residues 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomal RNA 3ashrublands 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3atemperature 3awildfires 2aArchaeaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aEcosystem 2aFires 2aFungixgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 0aMediterranean Region1 aGarcía, C.1 aInsam, H.1 aHernández, M.

Zafar-ul,10aModelling the effect of competition for prey and poaching on the population of the Arabian Leopard, Panthera pardus nimr, in Saudi Arabia (Mammalia: Felidae)  ap. 95-106.  aThe Arabian Leopard Panthera pardus nimr, classified by IUCN as “Critically Endangered”, is Saudi Arabia’s flagship predator. The population of this species has declined to approximately 50 individuals and may become extinct in the Arabian Peninsula if threats are not addressed. In addition to habitat destruction, major threats include poaching and competition for diminishing prey species, two factors which may have been underestimated so far. The main competitors of the Arabian Leopard are the Caracal (Caracal caracal schmitzi) and Arabian Wolf (Canis lupus arabs). With a Population Viability Analysis (PVA), we simulated various scenarios to demonstrate the impact of competition for prey and poaching. The population under stable natural conditions without poaching and restocking (supplementation) would have a survival probability of only 37%. Without competition by the Caracal, survivability of the leopard population would increase to 89%, and without the Arabian Wolf to 98%. The likelihood of extinction would be 1% if both competitors were absent. A second set of scenarios, with a poaching rate of six individuals per year, shows that the leopard would not survive over the next 100 years. Further, the stabilization of the population by means of restocking with captive-bred animals was simulated to test a minimal number of individuals required to substitute the Arabian Leopard population. In addition to the competition by Caracal and Wolf, supplementing a minimum of eight individuals would stabilize the population as it is now, and allow a maximum of six poached individuals per year. Our results demonstrate need for urgent protection of the Arabian Leopard as well as its prey with strict minimization of poaching. Our model, however, does not take into account the effect of habitat destruction and fragmentation, which may also have detrimental impacts to the leopards and associated species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aCaracal caracal 3aPanthera pardus 3acaptive animals 3aextinction 3ahabitat destruction 3amodels 3apopulation viability analysis 3aprey species 3aprobability 3aSaudi Arabia 0aResource competition 0apopulation viability analysis 0aextinction 0asurvival 0aCaracal Caracal caracal schmitzi 0aArabian Wolf Canis lupus arabs1 aVolmer, Rebbeka1 aal Boug, Ahmed1 aShehri, Abdullah as1 aGavashelishvili, Alexander0 tZoology in the Middle East.g2020 Apr. 2, v. 66, no. 2 p.95-106dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19697x2326-26807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09397140.2020.17579113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011100175300001200286520196400298592002802262650001402290650001202304650001802316650002702334650002302361650001202384650002302396650001702419650001802436650000902454650002402463650002302487650001202510650002302522650001202545650001102557651001702568700002002585700002102605773014102626856008302767852000902850655001202859IND60648532820221118234600.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOldewage-Theron, Wilna10aP73 Impact of a Soy Nutrition Education Intervention on Knowledge of Smallholder South African Soy Farmers  ap. S65.  aSmallholder farmers have gained importance globally recently and are considered to be fundamental to ensure populations’ food security. A recent study found 45% food insecurity among soy farmers in South Africa (SA) and it was recommended to focus on improving smallholder farmers’ ability to produce, preserve, store and consume food through appropriate interventions.To assess smallholder soy farmers’ knowledge and perceptions of soy after participating in a soy nutrition education intervention.This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study study among a convenience sample of 78 soy smallholder farmers from KwaZulu-Natal (SA). A soy nutrition education program, including soy cooking demonstrations, tasting and recipes, and informed by the Social Cognitive Theory, was implemented for eight hours.Pre- and post-quantitative data measuring soy knowledge and perceptions were collected using a modified version of a survey, tested for face and content validity and reliability, used previously. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25 for descriptive statistics as well as paired-sample t-tests to ascertain change in participants’ perceptions and knowledge of soy after the intervention. Significance was established at level 0.05.Only 41% of the soy farmers used soy in the household and mainly in meat dishes. Participants’ knowledge improved significantly (P < .001) from a mean ± standard deviation (SD) score of 26.33 ± 5.06 before to 32.00 ± 9.46 after the intervention, translated as 64.2% to 78.0% correctly answered questions before to after the intervention respectively. Soy taste preference also significantly (P = .002) improved after the intervention.Soy farmers had average soy knowledge that improved significantly after the soy nutrition education program. Improvement in both soy knowledge and preference should result in more soy being consumed, thus impacting food insecurity and nutritional status.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3acooking 3adata analysis 3adescriptive statistics 3aeducation programs 3afarmers 3afarmers' attitudes 3afood choices 3afood security 3ameat 3anutrition education 3anutritional status 3arecipes 3astandard deviation 3asurveys 3at-test 3aSouth Africa1 aMorales, Sarahi1 aEgal, Abdulkadir0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S65-S65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245009200197300001800289500002000307520106000327592002801387596005001415596006101465650001401526650001701540650001201557650002001569650001501589650000901604650002401613700002101637773013601658856007301794852000901867655001201876IND60675766220221121135304.0191108e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067576622DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.135282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzuppon, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1462-723710aEvolution of mating types in finite populations: The precarious advantage of being rare  ap. 1290-1299.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSexually reproducing populations with self‐incompatibility bear the cost of limiting potential mates to individuals of a different type. Rare mating types escape this cost since they are unlikely to encounter incompatible partners, leading to the deterministic prediction of continuous invasion by new mutants and an ever‐increasing number of types. However, rare types are also at an increased risk of being lost by random drift. Calculating the number of mating types that a population can maintain requires consideration of both the deterministic advantages and the stochastic risks. By comparing the relative importance of selection and drift, we show that a population of size N can maintain a maximum of approximately N¹/³ mating types for intermediate population sizes, whereas for large N, we derive a formal estimate. Although the number of mating types in a population is quite stable, the rare‐type advantage promotes turnover of types. We derive explicit formulas for both the invasion and turnover probabilities in finite populations.  aPublisher supplied data  cMax Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology  aANR‐14‐ACHN‐0003cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aevolution 3amating types 3amutants 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3arisk 3asexual reproduction1 aRogers, David W.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2019 Nov., v. 32, no. 11 p.1290-1299dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.135283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012200168300001600290520058700306536010000893592002800993596001701021650001501038650002301053650001701076650002501093650001801118650001101136651001101147651001101158651002501169653001701194653002001211653003201231653001601263700002201279700001501301700002201316700001601338773011901354856008601473852000901559655001201568IND60695020220221119054923.0200807e20200402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069502022DNAL7 a10.1080/09397140.2020.17579142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamar, Karin10aDiscovery of the Black-headed Ground Snake Rhynchocalamus melanocephalus (Jan, 1862) in Cyprus (Reptilia: Colubridae)  ap. 118-123.  aWe identified two snakes from Paphos district in south-western Cyprus as belonging to the secretive genus Rhynchocalamus.

Morphological features and mitochondrial 16S DNA sequences suggest that these specimens belong to R. melanocephalus, a species widely distributed in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The genetic similarity to a specimen from northern Israel may imply either a human-mediated dispersal or a natural colonization.

Although LSF walls have been used widely, fire design of LSF walls is based on approximate prescriptive methods based on limited fire tests. Also these fire tests were conducted using the standard fire curve (ISO 834-1, 1999 [1]) and the applicability of available design rules to realistic design fire curves has not been verified. This paper investigates the accuracy of existing fire design rules in the current cold-formed steel standards and the modifications proposed by previous researchers. Of these the recently developed design rules by Gunalan and Mahendran (2013) [2] based on Eurocode 3 Part 1.3 (EN 1993-1-3, 2006 [3]) and AS/NZS 4600 (Standards Australia (SA), 2005 [4]) for standard fire exposure (ISO 834-1, 1999 [1]) were investigated in detail to determine their applicability to predict the axial compression strengths and fire resistance ratings of LSF walls exposed to realistic design fire curves. This paper also presents the fire performance results of LSF walls exposed to a range of realistic fire curves obtained using a finite element analysis based parametric study. The results from the parametric study were used to develop a simplified design method based on the critical hot flange temperature to predict the fire resistance ratings of LSF walls exposed to realistic fire curves. Finally, the stud failure times (fire resistance rating) obtained from the fire design rules and the simplified design method were compared with parametric study results for LSF walls lined with single and double plasterboards, and externally insulated with rock fibres under realistic fire curves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstruction industry 3afinite element analysis 3afire resistance 3afire testing 3asteel 3atemperature 3aAustralia 0aLight gauge steel frame walls 0aRealistic design fire curves 0aAxial compression strength of studs 0aFire resistance rating 0aLimiting temperature method 0aFire design rules 0aSimplified design method1 aMahendran, Mahen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7306-88210 tFire safety journal.g2015 Oct., v. 77 p.1-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245019300204500001400397506007600411520153500487592002802022506003702050650000802087650001502095650001302110650002502123650001702148650001802165650001202183650001702195650001602212650001002228650001202238650002002250650000702270650001802277650001902295650002402314650000902338650002402347700002602371700002802397700002302425773011902448856007402567852000902641655001202650IND60660446620221207054408.0190823e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066044662DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90805472doi7 aPMC67190412pmcid7 a314089812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAttia, Youssef  A.10aEffect of Supplementation with Trimethylglycine (Betaine) and/or Vitamins on Semen Quality, Fertility, Antioxidant Status, DNA Repair and Welfare of Roosters Exposed to Chronic Heat Stress  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, we investigated the influence of betaine (Bet, 1000 mg/kg), with or without vitamin C (VC, 200 mg/kg ascorbic acid) and/or vitamin E (VE, 150 mg/kg &alpha;-tocopherol acetate) on semen quality, seminal and blood plasma constituents, antioxidants&rsquo; status, DNA repair, and the welfare of chronic heat stress (CHS)-exposed roosters. A total of 54 roosters were divided into six groups of nine replicates. One group was kept under thermoneutral conditions, whereas the other five were kept under CHS. One of the five groups served as an unsupplemented CHS group, and was fed with a basal diet. The other four CHS groups were supplemented with Bet, Bet + VC, Bet + VE, and Bet + VC + VE, respectively. Our data indicate that supplementation with Bet, Bet + VC, Bet + VE, and Bet + VC + VE, resulted in complete recovery of the CHS effect on sperm concentration and livability, semen pH, and fertility compared to the thermoneutral group. Seminal plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was significantly (p < 0.05) increased with Bet, with or without vitamins, compared to the thermoneutral and CHS groups. Urea and blood plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) were totally recovered with Bet, with or without vitamin treatments. Both the jejunum and ileum DNA were partially recovered following Bet, with or without vitamin supplementation. In conclusion, Bet, at 1000 mg/kg feed, may be a useful agent for increasing semen quality, fertility, welfare, and to improve the breeding strategy of breeder males in hot climates.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aacetates 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abetaine 3ablood plasma 3aheat stress 3aileum 3ajejunum 3amalondialdehyde 3apH 3asemen quality 3aseminal plasma 3asperm concentration 3aurea 3avitamin supplements1 aEl-Naggar, Asmaa  Sh.1 aAbou-Shehema, Bahaa  M.1 aAbdella, Ahmed  A.0 tAnimals.g2019 Aug. 12, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90805473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011400159500001100273520185900284592002802143596006302171596004702234650001302281650001802294650002002312650001902332650001802351650001002369650002502379650002402404650002202428650001602450650001502466650002102481650001702502650001102519650002402530650003702554650001402591650000902605650003602614700005902650773012702709856007402836852000902910655001202919IND60698286020221119204922.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069828602DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.132002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min Jeong10aNutraceuticals for prevention of atherosclerosis: Targeting monocyte infiltration to the vascular endothelium  aREVIEW  aCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death, globally, and is a serious problem in developing countries. Preventing atherosclerosis is key to reducing the risk of developing CVD. Similar to carcinogenesis, atherogenesis can be divided into four stages: initiation, promotion, progression, and acute events. The current study focuses on the promotion stage, which is characterized by circular monocyte penetration into vascular endothelial cells, monocyte differentiation into macrophages, and the formation of foam cells. This early stage of atherogenesis is a major target for nutraceuticals. We discuss nutraceuticals that can potentially inhibit monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium, thereby preventing the promotional stage of atherosclerosis. The mechanisms through which these nutraceuticals prevent monocyte adhesion are classified according to the following targets: NF‐κB, ROS, MAPKs, and AP‐1. Additionally, we discuss promising targets for nutraceuticals that can regulate monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Introduction of atherogenesis with initiation, promotion, progression, and acute events provide specific information and factors for each step in the development of atherosclerosis. Functional food or pharmaceutical researchers can set target stages and use them to develop materials that control atherosclerosis. In particular, because it focuses on vascular inflammation via interaction between monocytes and vascular endothelial cells, it provides specific information to researchers developing functional foods that regulate this process. Therefore, this manuscript, unlike previous papers, will provide material information and potential mechanisms of action to researchers who want to develop functional foods that control vascular inflammation rather than vascular lipids.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018R1D1A1B07050031cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2018R1D1A1B07050031cMinistry of Education 3aadhesion 3aatherogenesis 3aatherosclerosis 3acarcinogenesis 3acell adhesion 3adeath 3adeveloping countries 3adietary supplements 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3afoam cells 3afunctional foods 3ainflammation 3alipids 3amechanism of action 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amonocytes 3arisk 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aJung, Sung Keun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0956-73670 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.e13200-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009000167300001600257520070000273536017300973592002801146596005101174596007201225650002301297650002201320650002501342650001101367650003201378650004401410650001801454650002201472653002201494653003101516653004101547700001201588700001801600700001801618700001601636700001901652700001601671700001301687700002001700773014001720856008501860852000901945655001201954IND60695020320221119055121.0200515e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069502032DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2019.16078412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chun-Ge10aAntioxidative 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones in Chinese eaglewood from Aquilaria sinensis  ap. 639-646.  aTwo new compounds 6,7-dimethoxy-2-[2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]chromone (1) and 6,7-dimethoxy-2-[2-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]chromone (2), together with ten known 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones (3–12) were isolated from the resinous wood of Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.)

(yellow monkey-flower; Phrymaceae) is an important model species for ecological and evolutionary studies, being locally adapted to a wide range of elevation, moisture and temperature gradients, soil types, and pollinator availabilities. In order to advance this species as a model for evolutionary genetic studies, we have developed virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) using the tobacco rattle virus (TRV) to assay gene function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS in two divergent populations of M. guttatus, Iron Mountain 767 (IM767) and Point Reyes (PR). Plants infected with a fragment of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway gene PHYTOENE DESATURASE (PDS) cloned into the TRV2 vector exhibited endogenous PDS silencing and photobleached phenotypes. We further assayed for VIGS-induced floral phenotypes by silencing paralogous genes putatively affecting floral symmetry, CYCLOIDEA1 (CYC1) and CYCLOIDEA2 (CYC2). Simultaneous silencing of CYC1 and CYC2 resulted in organ number defects in the petal and stamen whorls; silencing of CYC1 affected petal margin growth; and silencing of CYC2 had no effect on flower development. Infection with TRV2 and TRV1 is significantly higher and more pervasive in the IM767 versus the PR population and is more efficient after vacuum infiltration. These results demonstrate the efficacy of VIGS for determining the function of developmental genes, including those involved in ecologically important reproductive traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflowering 3abiosynthesis 3aphenotype 3atemperature profiles 3apollinators 3amodels 3agene silencing 3asoil types 3agenes 3acarotenoids 3areproductive traits 3aTobacco rattle virus 3aErythranthe guttata 0aCYCLOIDEA 0aMimulus guttatus 0aMimulus 0aPhrymaceae 0areverse genetics 0aPHYTOENE DESATURASE (PDS) 0avirus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)1 aBarnett, Laryssa L.1 aKost, Matthew A.1 aOborny, Nathan J.1 aHileman, Lena C.0 tAnnals of the Missouri Botanical Garden.g2014 May 15, v. 99, no. 3 p.301-312dthe Missouri Botanical Gardenx0026-64937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3417%2F20101203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011900165300001600284520147400300592002801774650001301802650002101815650001101836650000901847650000901856650000701865650002301872650002301895650001401918653002501932653001101957653001401968653001601982653002201998700001702020700001602037700001502053700001902068700001802087773012502105856008202230852000902312655001202321IND60599307220221117164350.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059930722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.05.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Yueming10aPreparation of zirconium oxy ion-imprinted particle for the selective separation of trace zirconium ion from water  ap. 209-215.  aZr(IV) oxy ion-imprinted particle (Zr-IIP) was prepared using the metal ion imprinting technique in a sol–gel process on the surface of amino-silica. The dosages of zirconium ions as imprinted target, (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) as a functional monomer and teraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a cross-linker were optimized. The prepared Zr-IIP and Zr(IV) oxy ion non-imprinted particle (Zr-NIP) were characterized. pH effect, binding ability and the selectivity were investigated in detail. The results showed that the Zr-IIP had an excellent binding capacity and selectivity in the water. The equilibrium data fitted well to the pseudo-second-order kinetic and the Langmuir model for Zr(IV) binding onto Zr-IIP, respectively. The saturate binding capacity of Zr-IIP was found to be 196.08μmolg⁻¹, which was 18 times higher than that of Zr-NIP. The sequence of binding efficiency of Zr-IIP for various ions was Zr(IV)>Cu(II)>Sb(III)>Eu(III). The coordination number has an important effect on the dimensional binding capacity. The equilibrium binding capacity of Zr-IIP for Zr(IV) decreased little under various concentrations of Pb(II) ions. The analysis of relative selectivity coefficient (Kr) indicated that the Zr-IIP had an appreciable binding specificity towards Zr(IV) although the competitive ions coexisted in the water. The Zr-IIP could serve as an efficient selective material for recovering or removing zirconium from the water environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3abinding capacity 3acopper 3aions 3alead 3apH 3asol-gel processing 3asorption isotherms 3azirconium 0aMetal ion imprinting 0aZr(IV) 0aSol–gel 0aSelectivity 0aWater environment1 aLiu, Pingxin1 aLiu, Xiaoli1 aFeng, Jing1 aFan, Zhuangjun1 aLuan, Tianzhu0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 431 p.209-215dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.05.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011200156300001800268520059100286592002800877650001300905650001100918650002300929650003600952650001900988650001301007650001801020650004401038650001801082650001301100650002001113650003701133700003101170700001801201700001601219700002301235700001501258700001901273773010501292856007501397852000901472655001201481IND60578014620221117012253.0170811e20141014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057801462DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501817n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Sun Gu10aN-Heterocyclic Carbene-Based Conducting Polymer–Gold Nanoparticle Hybrids and Their Catalytic Application  ap. 6566-6571.  aHybrid nanocomposites of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-functionalized conducting polymers (CPs) with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were prepared by concurrent disproportionation and oxidative coupling.

Prepatent diagnosis of H. contortus infection is crucial to improve control strategies as this helminth may remove up to one-fifth of total erythrocytes and may cause anemia, edema, diarrhea, and ultimately death in young animals. In this study, one of the excretory and secretory products, rHc-HCA59, was purified and used as antigen to detect specific antibodies in H. contortus infected goats during prepatent stage of infection using indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as screening test. All goats (n = 38) were housed indoor, experimentally infected with 8000 infective larvae (L3) of H. contortus, and serum samples were collected prior to infection and at 14th day of infection. Immunoblotting was performed to confirm the results of indirect ELISA, evaluate the cross reactivity against rHc-HCA59 in sera of most common co-infecting parasites and rectify the false negative samples. Furthermore, three different batches of rHc-HCA59 were produced to evaluate the repeatability of ELISA. No eggs were detected in feces of all goats collected at 7th and 14th day of infection but, H. contortus eggs were detected at 21 days post infection in the feces. Indirect ELISA performed in this study showed 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The western blot analysis confirmed immunoreactivity in serum samples which scored positive in indirect ELISA and recognized the samples as negative which had OD<inf>450</inf> lower than negative cut-off value in indirect ELISA. Furthermore, all false negative sera (n = 5) that had OD<inf>450</inf> value between positive and negative cut-off value in rHc-HCA59 based ELISA were clearly positive in western blot. Moreover, no cross-reactivity was detected in ELISA and western blotting against rHc-HCA59 in positive sera of Toxoplasma gondii, Fasciola hepatica, and Trichinella spiralis. The results of this study concluded that combined use of indirect ELISA and western blotting with rHc-HCA59 is a potential immunodiagnostic tool for the detection of H. contortus infection during prepatent period in goats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFasciola hepatica 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aWestern blotting 3aanemia 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3across reaction 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3aedema 3aenzymes 3aerythrocytes 3afeces 3afinancial economics 3ahelminths 3amixed infection 3aprepatent period1 aNaqvi, Sana  Zahra1 aMemon, Muhammad  Ali1 aAimulajiang, Kalibixiati 1 aHaseeb, Muhammad 1 aXu, Lixin 1 aSong, Xiaokai 1 aLi, Xiangrui 1 aYan, Ruofeng 0 tAnimals.g2019 Aug. 13, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90805483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245007400171300001600245520081800261592002801079653001501107653002301122653002601145653002301171653001301194653002201207700002201229700001901251700001901270773012101289856008401410852000901494655001201503IND60128566220221120073209.0151116e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012856622DNAL7 a10.4003/0740-2783-22.1.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Meredith M.14aThe concentration of calcium carbonate in shells of freshwater snails  ap. 139-142.  aThe range of concentration of calcium carbonate in the shells of various freshwater gastropods was determined using ion chromatography.

Our data support and validate the previous claim that snail shells are comprised of 95––99.9%% calcium carbonate.  aPublisher supplied data 0aGastropoda 0aion chromatography 0aBiomphalaria glabrata 0aHelisoma trivolvis 0aPhysa sp 0aPomacea bridgesii1 aChejlava, Michael1 aFried, Bernard1 aSherma, Joseph0 tAmerican Malacological Bulletin.g2007 Mar., v. 22, no. 1 p.139-142dAmerican Malacological Societyx0740-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4003%2F0740-2783-22.1.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012800169300001200297520204000309592002802349650001502377650001402392650001302406650001502419650001802434650003002452650002402482650002002506650002602526650001302552650002402565650002402589650001202613650002202625650001802647650001202665650001102677650001302688651001202701700001702713700001702730700001802747773014102765856008302906852000902989655001202998IND60648533020221118234815.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCotwright, Caree10aP75 Improving Teacher Knowledge and Self-Efficacy to Promote Healthy Eating and Physical Activity in the Child Care Setting  ap. S66.  aObesity prevention should begin in early childhood, when children are learning nutrition and physical activity behaviors. Early childhood education (ECE) teachers play a key role in obesity prevention. Teachers’ ability to encourage healthy habits is related to their knowledge and self-efficacy related to obesity prevention strategies.To assess changes in knowledge and self-efficacy among teachers participating in the Healthy Child Care Georgia (HCCG) Intervention.The study design was a pretest-posttest design for ECE teachers (N = 22) in Clarke County, Georgia. The HCCG intervention focused on improving the wellness environment and implementing a six-week nutrition education curriculum, Eat Healthy, Be Active.Teacher knowledge and self-efficacy were measured with the Confidence about Nutrition and Activity (CAN-Teach), containing four subscales. The survey was administered before, immediately after, and four weeks after the intervention. All data were analyzed using paired-samples t-tests to compare baseline scores with end-of-intervention scores and with follow-up scores. Scores were also compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests.Teachers’ average knowledge scores were significantly higher at the end of the intervention (M = 67.4) and at four-week follow-up (M = 71.1, t = -4.1, P = .001) as compared to baseline (M = 59.5, t = -2.4, P = .02). Composite self-efficacy scores increased significantly between baseline (M = 12.0) and post-intervention (M = 12.9) (t = -2.3, P = .03). Teachers’ self-efficacy scores were also significantly higher at the 4-week follow up (M = 13.4, t = -2.0, P < .001) than at baseline.The HCCG intervention shows evidence of improving teachers’ knowledge and self-efficacy related to early obesity prevention. These improvements may serve as an important first step in changing the ECE classroom, in order to help ensure that children develop healthy eating and physical activity habits during early childhood.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3achild care 3achildhood 3achildren 3acurriculum 3adata analysis 3aearly childhood education 3aexperimental design 3ahealth behavior 3ahealthy eating habits 3alearning 3anutrition education 3anutrition knowledge 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aself-efficacy 3asurveys 3at-test 3ateachers 3aGeorgia1 aBales, Diane1 aAkin, Joanna1 aLee, Jung Sun0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S66-S66dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007200168300001600240520052200256536017800778592002800956596005400984596007401038650001201112650001401124650001601138650002301154650001801177650002101195653002001216653002201236653002901258653002001287700001601307700001901323700001701342773014001359856008501499852000901584655001201593IND60695020520221119054936.0200515e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069502052DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2019.16089562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Kai-Qing10aFormal enantioselective total synthesis of bisdehydroneostemoninine  ap. 655-662.  aA formal enantioselective total synthesis of bisdehydroneostemoninine employing L-glutamic acid as the chiral pool is described.

The bulky side groups are cyclotriphosphazene rings substituted with trifluoroethoxy groups connected to the main chain via aryloxy spacers. These bulky units are distributed along the polymer backbone and separated from each other by trifluoroethoxy units linked directly to the main chain. Compared to the well-known poly[(bis-2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phosphazene], [NP(OCH₂CF₃)₂]ₙ, which is a microcrystalline film- and fiber-forming polymer, several of the new materials are elastomers with properties that arise partly from interactions of the protruding cyclotriphosphazene side units with those on nearby polymer chains. Specific elastomers are capable of regaining up to 89% of their original shape when elongated to high strain (up to 1000%) over four elongation cycles and show even longer elongations at break (>1600%). The overall physical properties depend on the ratios of the cyclic trimeric side units to main chain linked trifluoroethoxy side groups. The polymers were characterized using ¹H, ³¹P NMR, DSC, TGA, X-ray diffraction, GPC, and stress–strain techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acrosslinking 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3aphysical properties 3apolymers 3astable isotopes 3athermogravimetry1 aAllcock, Harry R.0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Oct. 14, v. 47, no. 19 p.6776-6782dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501927u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245009300177300001600270520157300286592002801859650001101887650002501898650001201923650001901935650001901954650001801973650001201991650001302003650004402016650002002060653002402080653001802104653001902122653001802141653002702159653001502186653001002201653002902211700002302240700002302263700002402286773012602310856008202436852000902518655001202527IND60599307420221123041617.0180702e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059930742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.05.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín, Victoria Isabel10aSelf-aggregation of cationic dimeric surfactants in water–ionic liquid binary mixtures  ap. 326-336.  aThe micellization of four dimeric cationic surfactants (“gemini surfactants”) derived from N-dodecyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride was studied in pure water and in water–ionic liquid (IL) solutions by a wide range of techniques. The dimeric surfactants are distinguished by their rigid spacer groups separating the two surfactant motifs, which range from C3 to C5 in length. In order to minimize organic ion pairing effects as well as the role of the ionic liquids as potential co-surfactants, ILs with inorganic hydrophilic anions and organic cations of limited hydrophobicity were chosen, namely ethyl, butyl, and hexyl-3-imidazolium chlorides. ¹H NMR two-dimensional, 2D, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy measurements, ROESY, supported this premise. The spacer nature hardly affects the micellization process, neither in water nor in water–IL solutions. However, it does influence the tendency of the dimeric surfactants to form elongated micelles when surfactant concentration increases. In order to have a better understanding of the ternary water–IL surfactant systems, the micellization of the surfactants was also studied in aqueous NaCl solutions, in water–ethylene glycol and in water–formamide binary mixtures. The combined results show that the ionic liquids play a double role in the mixed systems, operating simultaneously as background electrolytes and as polar organic solvents. The IL role as organic co-solvent becomes more dominant when its concentration increases, and when the IL alkyl chain length augments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3acationic surfactants 3acations 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asodium chloride 0aDimeric surfactants 0aMicellization 0aMicelle growth 0aIonic liquids 0aBackground electrolyte 0aCo-solvent 0aROESY 0aDynamic light scattering1 aRodríguez, Amalia1 aLaschewsky, André1 aMoyá, María Luisa0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 430 p.326-336dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.05.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013600171300001600307520097300323592002801296650001701324650002201341650001601363650000901379650001701388650001101405650001401416650002501430650001301455650002001468651003001488651002301518653001701541653002001558653001201578653001201590653001401602653001801616700001801634700002201652700002301674700002401697700002101721700001901742700002001761773010601781856008801887852000901975655001201984IND60632837920221117084312.0191214e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063283792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.02.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiboiron, Max10aLow incidence of plastic ingestion among three fish species significant for human consumption on the island of Newfoundland, Canada  ap. 244-248.  aThis study reports the first baselines of plastic ingestion for three fish species that are common commercial and sustenance food fish in Newfoundland.

As wind power generation in China experiences both an exponential increase trend and a seasonal fluctuation pattern, it cannot be accurately forecasted by traditional models. As the grey model GM(1,1) can capture an exponential growth trend and the Hodrick-Prescott filter is known for its capability of characterizing seasonality factors, this paper proposes a novel seasonal forecasting method that integrates the HP filter into the grey model GM(1,1). The proposed model is then applied to carry out an empirical analysis based on the seasonal wind power generation data between 2013 and 2019 in China. The forecasting results from the new model are then compared with three existing approaches. The comparison results indicate that the proposed model generally outperforms existing methods as it can well capture seasonal fluctuations in the data series. A further prediction of wind power generation in China is conducted into a future horizon of 2020 and 2021 by using our model, followed by a set of policy recommendations for further development of the wind power industry in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apower generation 3aprediction 3awind farms 3awind power 3aChina 0aWind power generation prediction 0aSeasonal fluctuations 0aGM(1,1) model 0aHP filter1 aWang, Jue0 tEnergy.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 209 p.118499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1184993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005300140245014100193500002000334520153900354592002801893596006801921596005701989650003402046650002202080650001702102650002802119650002502147650001702172650001402189650001302203650002702216650002302243650002102266650001202287650001802299650001502317650001802332650001102350650001302361650001902374650001502393650000902408650001902417650001902436650001902455650001502474700001302489700001402502700002102516700002002537700002102557773012702578856007402705852000902779655001202788IND60698286320221119204952.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069828632DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.132222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Fei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6841-692410aCompositional characterization of Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim and their antioxidant activities and induction of apoptosis in Bel‐7402 cell  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this work, a comparison study on active sites (the total phenolic, total flavonoids, and total triterpenes contents) and antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays) of different fractions from Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim was evaluated. Moreover, the inhibition capability on human hepatocarcinoma cells Bel‐7402 cells and the mechanism was also discussed. Results showed that the ethyl acetate fraction significantly scavenged DPPH and ABTS⁺ radicals, exhibited ferric ion reducing antioxidant, and inhibited Bel‐7402 cells proliferation. In addition, oleanolic acid was the dominant compound act on the Bel‐7402 cells in the extract and it induced apoptosis by the caspase pathway and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase by inhibiting the cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway. The extracts of P. ussuriensis Maxim were confirmed to have anti‐oxidative and antiproliferative effects against Bel‐7402 cell in vitro. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Fruits and vegetables which contain high levels of antioxidants can help to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer. Pyrus ussuriensis Maxim is a kind of edible and medical fruit with multiple bioactivities, whereas the capability to anti‐lung cancer activity has not been investigated. The extracts of P. ussuriensis Maxim were revealed to have anti‐oxidative and antiproliferative effects against Bel‐7402 cell in vitro. Accordingly, it is the first time to verify that oleanolic acid was the main chemical components of P. ussuriensis with antitumor potential.  aPublisher supplied data  aB2019407115cBureau of Science and Technology of Hebei Province  aQN2017073cDepartment of Education of Hebei Province 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPyrus ussuriensis 3aactive sites 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3achronic diseases 3acyclins 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3afree radicals 3afruits 3ahepatoma 3ahuman diseases 3ainterphase 3airon 3aneoplasm cells 3aoleanolic acid 3arisk reduction 3avegetables1 aLi, Gang1 aXie, Ying1 aYin, Hong‐yang1 aLi, Xiao‐jing1 aYang, Yue‐dong0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.e13222-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245015500166300001600321500002000337520158300357592002801940650002101968650001701989650002402006650002302030650001102053650002602064650001302090650002202103650001102125650001102136650001502147650001802162650001402180651001802194700002402212700002002236700002302256773013002279856007902409852000902488655001202497IND60592053220221117070228.0180327e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059205322DNAL7 a10.1111/1758-2229.126272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindh, Markus V.10aHabitat filtering of bacterioplankton communities above polymetallic nodule fields and sediments in the Clarion‐Clipperton zone of the Pacific Ocean  ap. 113-122.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDeep‐sea mining of commercially valuable polymetallic nodule fields will generate a seabed sediment plume into the water column. Yet, the response of bacterioplankton communities, critical in regulating energy and matter fluxes in marine ecosystems, to such disturbances is unknown. Metacommunity theory, traditionally used in general ecology for macroorganisms, offers mechanistic understanding on the relative role of spatial differences compared with local environmental conditions (habitat filtering) for community assembly. We examined bacterioplankton metacommunities using 16S rRNA amplicons from the Clarion‐Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the eastern Pacific Ocean and in global ocean transect samples to determine sensitivity of these assemblages to environmental perturbations. Habitat filtering was the main assembly mechanism of bacterioplankton community composition in the epi‐ and mesopelagic waters of the CCZ and the Tara Oceans transect. Bathy‐ and abyssopelagic bacterioplankton assemblages were mainly assembled by undetermined metacommunity types or neutral and dispersal‐driven patch‐dynamics for the CCZ and the Malaspina transect. Environmental disturbances may alter the structure of upper‐ocean microbial assemblages, with potentially even more substantial, yet unknown, impact on deep‐sea communities. Predicting such responses in bacterioplankton assemblage dynamics can improve our understanding of microbially‐mediated regulation of ecosystem services in the abyssal seabed likely to be exploited by future deep‐sea mining operations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacterioplankton 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3amarine ecosystems 3amining 3aoceans 3aprediction 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3aPacific Ocean1 aMaillot, Brianne M.1 aSmith, Craig R.1 aChurch, Matthew J.0 tEnvironmental microbiology reports.g2018 Apr., v. 10, no. 2 p.113-122dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2217x1758-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.126273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03757naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245013200199300002000331520136800351592002801719596008501747596008601832596010101918596007102019596007102090596009402161596006702255650002602322650001102348650001702359650001202376650001702388650001602405650002802421650001802449650001502467650001502482651001502497653001802512653003202530653001602562653002202578653002402600700001702624700002102641700002302662700006202685700002102747700001702768700002202785700005902807700005702866773014302923856008003066852000903146655001203155IND60793601920220920000000.0220920e20220907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079360192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.2c037842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapo, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9143-706110aExpression Levels of hgcAB Genes and Mercury Availability Jointly Explain Methylmercury Formation in Stratified Brackish Waters  ap. 13119-13130.  aNeurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) is formed by microbial methylation of inorganic divalent Hg (Hgᴵᴵ) and constitutes severe environmental and human health risks. The methylation is enabled by hgcA and hgcB genes, but it is not known if the associated molecular-level processes are rate-limiting or enable accurate prediction of MeHg formation in nature. In this study, we investigated the relationships between hgc genes and MeHg across redox-stratified water columns in the brackish Baltic Sea. We showed, for the first time, that hgc transcript abundance and the concentration of dissolved Hgᴵᴵ-sulfide species were strong predictors of both the Hgᴵᴵ methylation rate and MeHg concentration, implying their roles as principal joint drivers of MeHg formation in these systems. Additionally, we characterized the metabolic capacities of hgc⁺ microorganisms by reconstructing their genomes from metagenomes (i.e., hgc⁺ MAGs), which highlighted the versatility of putative Hgᴵᴵ methylators in the water column of the Baltic Sea. In establishing relationships between hgc transcripts and the Hgᴵᴵ methylation rate, we advance the fundamental understanding of mechanistic principles governing MeHg formation in nature and enable refined predictions of MeHg levels in coastal seas in response to the accelerating spread of oxygen-deficient zones.  aPublisher supplied data  a749645cH2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actionsdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010665  a2018-01031cSvenska Forskningsr?det Formasdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001862  aCTSc, Carl Tryggers Stiftelse f?r Vetenskaplig Forskningdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002805  aSMK-1243cKempestiftelsernadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007067  aSMK-1753cKempestiftelsernadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100007067  aCEX2019-000928-ScAgencia Estatal de Investigaci?ndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100011033  a863584cEMFF-Blue Economy project MER-CLUBdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aenvironmental science 3agenome 3ahuman health 3amercury 3ametagenomics 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3aneurotoxicity 3aprediction 3atechnology 3aBaltic Sea 0amethylmercury 0amercury chemical speciation 0ahgcAB genes 0ahgcAB transcripts 0ametatranscriptomics1 aFeng, Caiyan1 aBravo, Andrea G.1 aBertilsson, Stefan1 aSoerensen, Anne L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8490-86001 aPinhassi, Jarone1 aBuck, Moritz1 aKarlsson, Camilla1 aHawkes, Jeffrey1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0664-22421 aBjørn, Erik,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9570-87380 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2022 Sept. 07, v. 56, no. 18 p.13119-13130dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c037843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008600168300001600254520194400270592002802214650002702242650002002269650001202289650000902301650002402310650002102334650001402355650002002369650001402389650001302403650002202416650001802438650001502456650002402471650002202495650001302517650002202530650002002552650001902572650001102591651001302602700002402615773014102639856008302780852000902863655001202872IND60648533320221118234817.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064853332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, Luciana10aP78 Lifestyle Medicine Intervention: Curbing Depression by Creating Food Pleasure  ap. S67-S68.  aLifestyle Medicine encompasses the adoption and maintenance of attitudes and behaviors that affect health and quality of life through diet and physical activity. Lack of motivation to eat healthier and be active is an issue commonly seen in our contemporary society.This was a secondary data analysis of an interdisciplinary and evidence-based Lifestyle Medicine program to promote the adoption and sustainability of positive attitudes and behaviors towards nutrition.Previously collected, de-identified data was obtained from a western Colorado hospital. This was an 18-week in-person program delivered by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers (MD, RDN, PT) that integrated nutrition education, cooking classes, and physical activity sessions to stimulate attitude and behavior change. The initiative aimed to improve employees' (n = 113) mental health and physical well-being by means of nutrition education.Validated Patient Heath Questionnaires (PHQ-9) were taken pre- and post-program to determine changes in health mindset. Questionnaires were analyzed using paired t-tests and descriptive statistics.Scores from the PHQ-9 showed a significant decrease in mean scores (-3.32, P < .0005). Prior to the program, 48.7% (n = 55) of participants presented with mild, moderate, or moderately severe depressive symptoms; post-program this was reduced to 17.7% (n = 20). After the program, 99.1% of all participants scored < 10 (out of 27) on the PHQ-9, changes that allow participants to start creating healthier and more positive relationships with living a healthy life.Implementation of a comprehensive Lifestyle Medicine program by an interdisciplinary team may assist in reducing the severity and prevalence of a negative health mindset. Future research needs to be conducted to establish the impact of Lifestyle Medicine interventions in reducing an unhealthy way of thinking and stimulating food pleasure.None.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abehavior change 3acooking 3adiet 3ahealth care workers 3ahealth education 3ahospitals 3ahuman resources 3alifestyle 3amedicine 3amental depression 3amental health 3amotivation 3anutrition education 3apatient education 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3at-test 3aColorado1 aHicks-Roof, Kristen0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S67-S68dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.4543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245010400204500002000308520147800328592002801806596005401834650001901888650001701907650001301924650001301937650001801950650001801968650001401986650001802000650001802018650002702036650002102063650002102084650002802105650001602133650004302149650001502192650000902207650001202216650002502228700003102253700003002284700007902314773012702393856007402520852000902594655001202603IND60698286520221119204911.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069828652DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.132042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos‐Vega, Rocio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4054-125010aSpent coffee (Coffea arabica L.) grounds promote satiety and attenuate energy intake: A pilot study  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe evaluated the effects of acute intake of biscuits (B) containing either spent coffee grounds (SCG), (added with fructooligosaccharides; SC‐FOS) or SCG antioxidant dietary fiber (SCF), on satiety, energy intake as well as gastrointestinal tolerance of healthy overweight volunteers. The addition of SCG and SCF to the biscuits (SC‐FOS‐B and SCF‐B) increased their protein (11.4% and 12.2%), and total dietary fiber (8.4% and 11.8%) contents. The SCF‐B significantly increased satiety perception, impacting ad libitum energy intake compared to the traditional biscuits recipe (TB; no added fiber). Moreover, SC‐FOS‐B and SCF‐B decreased (no‐observed‐adverse effect) the most frequently reported symptoms by the participants, demonstrating that doses up to 5 g of SCF (per biscuit portion; 45 g) are well tolerated. The use of SCF and SCG as functional ingredients represents a sustainable strategy for the coffee industry and also potentiates the reduction of overweight, one of the leading health problems among the population. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The addition of SCF or SCG as food ingredients increases protein and the dietary fiber content of traditional biscuits. SCF can slow gastric emptying, modulate appetite and thus body weight. SCF attenuates carbohydrate digestion blunting post‐prandial blood glucose spikes reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. SCF can be used as a functional ingredient to formulate foods with health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data  a279751cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología 3aCoffea arabica 3aantioxidants 3aappetite 3abiscuits 3ablood glucose 3adietary fiber 3adigestion 3aenergy intake 3afiber content 3afructooligosaccharides 3afunctional foods 3agastric emptying 3agastrointestinal system 3aingredients 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoverweight 3arisk 3asatiety 3aspent coffee grounds1 aArreguín‐Campos, Andrea1 aCruz‐Medrano, Miguel A.1 adel Castillo Bilbao, María Dolores1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6309-53830 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.e13204-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245009900162300001600261520111600277592002801393650001401421650002401435650001601459650002801475650002301503651001501526653001401541653001601555653001801571653001501589653001401604700002101618700002201639773012801661856007301789852000901862655001201871IND60128959720221122183154.0151124e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012895972DNAL7 a10.3417/20111092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Charlotte M.10aUpdated Taxonomy of Gaertnera (Rubiaceae, Gaertnereae) in Madagascar, with Sixteen New Species  ap. 688-729.  aGaertnera Lam.

This method focuses on the covalent functionalisation of carbon fibre (CF) based on (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane. The functionalisation of CF is carried out in two steps: functionalising the surface of CF using acid treatment to obtain hydroxy and carboxyl groups on the surface, followed by a condensation reaction between the carboxyl or hydroxy groups on the carbon (CF-OH) and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane to form mercapto-CF (CF-SH). FTIR, EDX, SEM, XRD and UV-Vis were utilised to confirm the modification. ICP-MS is utilised to determine the Hg(II) and to assess the influence of the memory effect on the results using Au³⁺ solution and suspended Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs). The result shows that the Au-NPs improve Hg(II) detection and eliminate the memory effect. This study also includes appropriate parameters for contact time, eluent solution, pH, and the foreign metal and ions preconcentration factor. As a result, thiol-CF shows high Hg(II) uptake, flexibility, and stability during the analysis process, with a recovery of 98.96% ± 0.41% for 10 preconcentration factors. These features make FEPT a valuable method for extracting pollutants and overcoming the problems associated with the analysis of such samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid treatment 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acondensation reactions 3ananogold 3apH 3awater1 aBin Durayhim, Nouf M.1 aSulayem, Meral M.1 aAl-Qahtani, Waad A.1 aKhdary, Nezar H.1 aAlhassan, Ahmed M.1 aAlzahrani, Fatimah Mohammed A.1 aKatubi, Khadijah Mohammedsaleh M.1 aAlsaiari, Norah Salem0 tWater.g2021 June 30, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131318293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245016100161500002000322520141100342592002801753596015801781650002001939650002501959650000901984650001901993650001902012650001202031650001102043650001702054650002002071650002102091650003602112650001602148650001802164650001602182650003702198650001402235650001702249650001302266650001702279650001802296650001002314650001402324650002502338650003602363650001002399650003202409650001602441700001502457700002102472700002002493700002002513700005702533773012702590856007402717852000902791655001202800IND60698286620221119205121.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069828662DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.132152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyeon Jeong10aImmunostimulating activity of Lycium chinense Miller root extract through enhancing cytokine and chemokine production and phagocytic capacity of macrophages  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhereas the fruits and a small portion of root bark of Lycium trees are commonly marketed in Korea as traditional medicine or functional foods, majority of their whole roots have been largely discarded. To develop the whole root of these plants as more value‐added materials, this study aimed to evaluate the potential immunostimulating activity of a water extract (GTR‐101) from L. chinense Miller roots using macrophages. The GTR‐101 (0–500 μg/ml) significantly, dose‐dependently increased the secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (TNF‐α and IL‐6), chemokines (RANTES and MIP‐1α), nitric oxide, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and activated the Akt, NF‐κB, and MAPKs (ERK and p38) signaling proteins. GTR‐101 also significantly enhanced the phagocytic activity of RAW 264.7 cells and bone marrow‐derived macrophages. These results suggest that GTR‐101 stimulates the early innate immunity via inducing the pro‐inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion and enhancing the phagocytic activity of macrophages. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The GTR‐101 prepared from L. chinense Miller roots may be useful for enhancing body's defense systems especially in the elderly and cancer patients with an impaired or reduced immune response and may thus be effectively used as a natural immunostimulating ingredient in health foods or complementary medicine.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No. 2017034A00‐1720‐BA01cR&D Program for Forest Science Technology from the Korea Forest Service (Korea Forestry Promotion Institute, KOFPI) 3aLycium chinense 3aalternative medicine 3abark 3achemokine CCL3 3achemokine CCL5 3aelderly 3afruits 3ahealth foods 3aimmune response 3aimmunostimulants 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3aingredients 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasms 3anitric oxide 3apatients 3aphagocytosis 3aroot extracts 3aroots 3asecretion 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atrees 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avalue added1 aLee, Jisun1 aKim, Seong Cheol1 aSeo, Jeong Yeon1 aHong, Seong Bin1 aPark, Yong Il1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1749-06890 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.e13215-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015000162520140700312592002801719650002301747650001101770650001101781650001401792650001301806650003101819650001001850650001601860650001901876650001401895650001901909650001401928650002201942650002001964700002001984700001802004700001802022700001502040700001502055700001502070700001802085700001702103700001902120700001702139773012102156856007902277852000902356655001202365IND60757921420221116170601.0211125e20211119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075792142DNAL7 a10.3390/plants101125172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yajun 10aNanopore-Based Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Potential Mechanism of High-Temperature Tolerance in Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)  aExtreme high temperatures are threatening cotton production around the world due to the intensification of global warming. To cope with high-temperature stress, heat-tolerant cotton cultivars have been bred, but the heat-tolerant mechanism remains unclear. This study selected heat-tolerant (‘Xinluzao36′) and heat-sensitive (‘Che61-72′) cultivars of cotton treated with high-temperature stress as plant materials and performed comparative nanopore sequencing transcriptome analysis to reveal the potential heat-tolerant mechanism of cotton. Results showed that 120,605 nonredundant sequences were generated from the raw reads, and 78,601 genes were annotated. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed that a total of 19,600 DEGs were screened; the DEGs involved in the ribosome, heat shock proteins, auxin and ethylene signaling transduction, and photosynthesis pathways may be attributed to the heat tolerance of the heat-tolerant cotton cultivar. This study also predicted a total of 5118 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)and 24,462 corresponding target genes. Analysis of the target genes revealed that the expression of some ribosomal, heat shock, auxin and ethylene signaling transduction-related and photosynthetic proteins may be regulated by lncRNAs and further participate in the heat tolerance of cotton. This study deepens our understandings of the heat tolerance of cotton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aauxins 3acotton 3acultivars 3aethylene 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ananopores 3aphotosynthesis 3aribosomes 3athermosensitivity 3atranscriptomics1 aGong, Zhaolong 1 aWang, Junduo 1 aZheng, Juyun 1 aMa, Yizan 1 aMin, Ling 1 aChen, Qin 1 aLi, Zhiqiang 1 aQu, Yanying 1 aChen, Quanjia 1 aLi, Xueyuan 0 tPlants.g2021 Nov. 19, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants101125173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013700153500002000290520186000310592002802170596004902198650003202247650002602279650002002305650002702325650001802352650002402370650002002394650001602414650001302430650002402443650001402467650002102481650002802502650002002530650001502550650002102565650001702586650002302603650003202626650000902658650001802667650002502685650001302710650001502723700001302738700005002751773012702801856007402928852000903002655001203011IND60698286720221119204904.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069828672DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.132262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuqi14aThe in vitro bioavailability of anti‐platelet peptides in collagen hydrolysate from silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) skin  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPrevious animal experiments indicated collagen hydrolysates (CHs) intake decreased platelet release indicators in plasma and highlight potential applications as healthcare supplements to combat cardiovascular disease. The oligopeptides (GPR, GPRG, and GPRGP) have anti‐platelet activities. However, it is still unclear whether they are bioactive compounds in CHs from silver carp skin. We investigated the bioavailability of oligopeptides using simulated gastrointestinal digestion and Caco‐2 model. Anti‐thrombotic activities, in vitro platelet aggregation and formation of platelet thrombus, were evaluated. They resisted gastrointestinal digestion and could be absorbed by Caco‐2. Oligopeptides inhibited platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and thrombin with IC₅₀ of 0.160, 0.283, 0.251 mg/ml and 0.714, 1.008, 0.917 mg/ml for GPR, GPRG, and GPRGP, respectively. Oligopeptides prolonged the time of platelet thrombus and inhibited coagulation cascades, but CHs performed no bleeding side effect. These results confirmed that oligopeptides could be used as bioactive compounds of dietary supplements for pre‐thrombotic to prevent thrombosis. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Oligopeptides, GPR, GPRG, and GPRGP, derived from silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) skin collagen, performed anti‐thrombotic activities from their anti‐platelet aggregation and anticoagulation activities. But the collagen hydrolysates containing these peptides had no side effect of bleeding in the mice model. Furthermore, this study investigated the bioavailability of these three bioactive peptides by the Caco‐2 cells model. Thus, oligopeptides GPR, GPRG, and GPRGP are a potential index of bioactive compounds in the preparation of anti‐thrombotic functional foods or healthcare supplements for people at the pre‐thrombotic state.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐46cChina Agriculture Research System 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadverse effects 3aanimal experimentation 3aanimal models 3abioactive compounds 3abioavailability 3acoagulation 3acollagen 3adietary supplements 3adigestion 3afunctional foods 3agastrointestinal system 3ahealth services 3ahemorrhage 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrolysates 3ain vitro digestion 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amice 3aoligopeptides 3aplatelet aggregation 3athrombin 3athrombosis1 aWang, Bo1 aLi, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2726-29000 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.e13226-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.132263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016600167300001400333520167600347592002802023650002302051650001502074650001302089650001302102650001402115650001102129650002402140650001702164650001602181650001602197650001402213650000902227653001502236653001102251653001502262653003102277653002702308653002502335700001602360700002102376773009602397856008502493852000902578655001202587IND60603702520221118054549.0180716e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060370252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTohidi, Ali10aStatistical description of firebrand size and shape distribution from coniferous trees for use in Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations of firebrand flight distance  ap. 21-35.  aThe process of ember/firebrand formation, lofting, wind driven transport, and resulting spot fire ignition during a wildfire is still poorly understood. Lack of a tractable firebrand formation model along with a detailed statistical description of the size and shape distribution of typical firebrand that could be used in simulations of firebrand flight and combustion may result in unrealistic outcomes. In this regard, a simple, yet quite informative, mechanical failure model of the firebrand break-off process is proposed. This model suggests that the previous laboratory scale firebrand generation experiments would likely provide a reasonable analogue for the formation process in a full scale wildfire. In addition, geometric scaling analysis is conducted and shows that the firebrand surface area scales with the firebrand mass raised to the 2/3rds power. This is in close agreement with measurements of firebrand from previously published data in the literature that are obtained under controlled laboratory combustion of coniferous tress of different sizes. Also, a detailed statistical characterization of the size and shape of these firebrands are presented. A nonlinear regression model on the firebrands' data led to the generation of a set of virtual firebrands. The resulting data could be used as inputs to a Monte-Carlo simulation of firebrands' transport through the velocity field induced by the interaction of a fire plume and the atmospheric boundary layer. Moreover, it is shown that the size distribution of firebrands is more dependent on the mechanics of combustion and limb failure than on a simple geometric relationship with the tree height.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acombustion 3aconifers 3ageometry 3amechanics 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3asurface area 3atree height 3atroposphere 3awildfires 3awind 0aFirebrands 0aEmbers 0aSpot fires 0aSize and mass distribution 0aMonte-Carlo simulation 0aNonlinear regression1 aKaye, Nigel1 aBridges, William0 tFire safety journal.g2015 Oct., v. 77 p.21-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2015.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009000202300001800292500002000310520149500330592002801825596004701853650002801900650001601928650001401944650001201958650002401970650001301994650001702007650001402024650001002038650002202048650001602070650001902086650001402105700006102119700001802180700006002198700005702258700006102315773013602376856007302512852000902585655001202594IND60675767020221121070439.0191108e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067576702DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.135292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZajitschek, Susanne1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4676-995010aCosts and benefits of giant sperm and sperm storage organs in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 1300-1309.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn Drosophila, long sperm are favoured in sperm competition based on the length of the female's primary sperm storage organ, the seminal receptacle (SR). This sperm–SR interaction, together with a genetic correlation between the traits, suggests that the coevolution of exaggerated sperm and SR lengths may be driven by Fisherian runaway selection. Here, we explore the costs and benefits of long sperm and SR genotypes, both in the sex that carries them and in the sex that does not. We measured male and female fitness in inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster derived from four populations previously selected for long sperm, short sperm, long SRs or short SRs. We specifically asked: What are the costs and benefits of long sperm in males and long SRs in females? Furthermore, do genotypes that generate long sperm in males or long SRs in females impose a fitness cost on the opposite sex? Answers to these questions will address whether long sperm are an honest indicator of male fitness, male post‐copulatory success is associated with male precopulatory success, female choice benefits females or is costly, and intragenomic conflict could influence evolution of these traits. We found that both sexes have increased longevity in long sperm and long SR genotypes. Males, but not females, from long SR lines had higher fecundity. Our results suggest that sperm–SR coevolution is facilitated by both increased viability and indirect benefits of long sperm and SRs in both sexes.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1257859cNational Science Foundation 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3acoevolution 3afecundity 3afemales 3agenetic correlation 3agenotype 3ainbred lines 3alongevity 3amales 3asperm competition 3aspermatozoa 3astorage organs 3aviability1 aZajitschek, Felix1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6010-61121 aJosway, Sarah1 aAl Shabeeb, Reem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7576-96801 aWeiner, Halli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8732-40641 aManier, Mollie K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9114-86490 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2019 Nov., v. 32, no. 11 p.1300-1309dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867076x1010-061X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.135293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001600279520072800295536022001023592002801243596005901271596009101330650002201421650001701443650002801460650001301488650001401501650001501515653001201530653001401542653001801556653002601574653002601600700001901626700001701645700001601662700002001678700001801698700001501716700001201731700002001743773014001763856008501903852000901988655001201997IND60695021120221119054931.0200515e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069502112DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2019.16162892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, Zhi-Ping10aSynthesis and insecticidal activity of sulfonate derivatives of sesamol against Mythimna separata in vivo  ap. 678-688.  aA series of sulfonate derivatives of sesamol were synthesized and evaluated for their insecticidal activity against a crop-threatening agricultural pest, the pre-third-instar larvae of Mythimna separata in vivo. Among all the target compounds, compounds 3b, 3g, 3h, and 3p exhibited more promising insecticidal activity than sesamol and toosendanin, and the final mortality rates (FMRs) of 3b, 3g, 3h, 3p, 1, and toosendanin were 60.7%/60.7%/67.9%/53.6%/32.1%/50.0%, respectively. Especially compound 3h exhibited the most potent insecticidal activity with FMRs of 67.9%. This suggested that a 4-fluorophenylsulfonyl group introduced at the hydroxyl position of sesamol was necessary for obtaining the most potent compound.  aThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U1604105) and the Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (Grant No. 182300410043, 182300410016, 152300410082).  aPublisher supplied data  aU1604105cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a182300410043a182300410016a152300410082cNatural Science Foundation of Henan Province 3aMythimna separata 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3amoieties 3amortality 3asulfonates 0aSesamol 0asulfonate 0asemisynthesis 0abotanical insecticide 0ainsecticidal activity1 aYang, Jin-Ming1 aShan, Xi-Jie1 aTian, Yue-E1 aLiu, Sheng-Ming1 aLin, Xiao-Min1 aJiang, Jia1 aHu, Mei1 aChen, Gen-Qiang0 tJournal of Asian natural products research.g2020 July 2, v. 22, no. 7 p.678-688dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000098x1477-22137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10286020.2019.16162893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245010700198500001400305506007600319520131900395592002801714506003701742650000801779650001201787650001101799650001901810650002701829650002401856650001601880650001901896650002201915650003001937650002201967650001601989700001802005700001602023700002202039700002102061700001802082700001702100773011902117856007402236852000902310655001202319IND60660447420221207061610.0190823e20190814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066044742DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90805542doi7 aPMC67212372pmcid7 a314161752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Lulan 12aA Missense Mutation of the <i>HSPB7</i> Gene Associated with Heat Tolerance in Chinese Indicine Cattle  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe small heat shock proteins (HSPB) are expressed in response to heat stress, and the heat shock protein family B (small) member 7 (HSPB7) gene has been reported to play an important role in heat tolerance pathways. Only a missense mutation (NC_037329.1: g.136054902 C > G: p.Ala69Gly) was identified in the HSPB7 gene in indicine cattle, which might be a candidate mutation associated with the heat tolerance. Here, we explore the allele frequency of this mutation in 774 individuals belonging to 32 Chinese indigenous cattle breeds using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. The distribution of alleles of NC_037329.1: g.136054902 C > G displays significant geographical difference across native Chinese cattle breeds that the allele C was dominant in northern cattle groups, while allele G was dominant in southern indicine cattle groups. Additionally, the association analysis indicated that the G allele was significantly associated with mean annual temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and temperature humidity index (THI) (p < 0.01), suggesting that cattle carrying allele G were distributed in regions with higher T, RH, and THI. Our results demonstrate that the mutation of the HSPB7 gene in Chinese indicine cattle might be a candidate gene associated with the heat tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aalleles 3acattle 3agene frequency 3ageographical variation 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3amissense mutation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arelative humidity 3atemperature1 aCao, Yanhong 1 aWu, Zhuyue 1 aHuang, Mingguang 1 aZhang, Guoliang 1 aLei, Chuzhao 1 aZhao, Yumin 0 tAnimals.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90805543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245010600180300001600286520112100302592002801423650001501451650001601466650002001482650002301502650002501525650001901550650001001569650002001579650001501599650001001614650002701624650002801651650001401679650002301693650001201716650002401728650000901752650001301761650002201774650002001796651001101816653002001827653003701847653002701884653001301911653001101924700002701935700003001962700002701992700002702019700002802046700002802074700002602102700003402128700001902162700007102181773010602252856008802358852000902446655001202455IND60632838520221117084613.0191214e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063283852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.02.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCortez, Fernando Sanzi10aMarine contamination and cytogenotoxic effects of fluoxetine in the tropical brown mussel Perna perna  ap. 366-372.  aConcerns are growing about the presence of fluoxetine (FLX) in environmental matrices, as well as its harmful effects on non-target organisms. FLX in aquatic ecosystems has been detected in a range varying from pg/L to ng/L, while adverse effects have been reported in several organisms inhabiting freshwater and marine environments. The present study quantifies FLX concentrations in seawater samples from Santos Bay, Brazil and assesses metabolic responses and sublethal effects on the tropical brown mussel Perna perna. Levels of ethoxyresorufin‑O‑deethylase, dibenzylfluorescein dealkylase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, cholinesterase, lipoperoxidation, and DNA damage were assessed in the gills and digestive gland of these animals, and lysosomal membrane stability was also assessed in hemocytes. FLX altered phase I and II enzyme activities, caused cytogenotoxic effects, and negatively impacted the overall health of mussels exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations. These findings contribute to characterize the risks of introducing this drug into the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aPerna perna 3aadverse effects 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiochemical pathways 3acholinesterase 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3afreshwater 3agills 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione transferase 3ahemocytes 3amarine environment 3amussels 3anontarget organisms 3arisk 3aseawater 3asublethal effects 3awater pollution 3aBrazil 0aAntidepressants 0aContaminants of emerging concern 0aTropical ecotoxicology 0aBivalves 0aBrazil1 aSouza, Lorena da Silva1 aGuimarães, Luciana Lopes1 aPusceddu, Fabio Hermes1 aMaranho, Luciane Alves1 aFontes, Mayana Karoline1 aMoreno, Beatriz Barbosa1 aNobre, Caio Rodrigues1 aAbessa, Denis Moledo de Souza1 aCesar, Augusto1 aPereira, Camilo Dias Seabra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8357-81120 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Apr., v. 141 p.366-372dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.02.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245009000205500001400295506007600309520148800385592002801873506003701901650002001938650001101958650001901969650001101988650002201999650001502021650001702036651001402053700002102067700002202088773011902110856007402229852000902303655001202312IND60660447520221207061606.0190823e20190814xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066044752DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90805552doi7 aPMC67205882pmcid7 a314162022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcLeod, Lynette  J.10aChange the Humans First: Principles for Improving the Management of Free-Roaming Cats  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Australia, free-roaming cats can be found in urban and rural areas across the country. They are inherently difficult to manage but it is frequently human behaviour that demands the most attention and is in most need of change. To the frustration of policy makers and practitioners, scientific knowledge, technological developments, and legal and institutional innovations, often run afoul of insufficient public capacity, opportunity and motivation to act. This paper demonstrates how the behavioural science literature can provide important insights into maximising the impact of free-roaming cat control activities within an ethical framework that prioritises acting &ldquo;with&rdquo; all stakeholders, rather than &ldquo;on&rdquo; stakeholders. By better understanding how human values, attitudes and beliefs are shaped, practitioners can more effectively and respectfully interact with how people interpret the world around them, make choices and behave. This literature also has much to say about why certain types of media and marketing messages elicit behaviour change and why other types fall flat. Finally, in addition to explaining the behavioural science and its implications, this review provides researchers, policy makers and engagement specialists with an inclusive, practical framework for conceptualising behaviour change and working to ensure land managers, cat owners and the general public can agree on and adopt best practices for managing free-roaming cats.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior change 3aethics 3ahuman behavior 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amotivation 3astakeholders 3aAustralia1 aHine, Donald  W.1 aDriver, Aaron  B.0 tAnimals.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 9, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90805553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04005naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024001700111024002100128024002800149024001100177040001800188100001900206245014000225300001700365506017300382520161800555650002402173650001102197650001002208650002102218650001002239650001202249650002502261650001402286650001602300650002002316650001202336650001102348650001002359650001202369650001702381650001202398650001202410650001402422650001302436650001202449650003902461650003302500650001102533650005302544650002502597650004402622650000902666650004702675650003802722650002602760700001802786700002102804700003402825773017502859856011203034856004103146956010203187961000903289852000903298655001203307IND4460347320221214230857.0130226e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446034732DNAL7 a216784852pmid7 a2652242aris7 a10113/557512hdl7 a10.1002/arch.204342doi8 ans1004  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Samuel S.10aImmunohistological Localization of Serotonin in the CNS and Feeding System of the Stable Fly Stomoxys calcitrans L.

Neurons immunoreactive (IR) to 5-HT were detected in the central nervous system (CNS) of the larval and adult stages of the stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans, using an immunohistological technique. The location and pattern of the 5-HT IR neurons are described and compared for these two different developmental stages. Anatomical features of the fly feeding system were analyzed in third instar larvae and adult flies using a combination of histological and immunohistological techniques. In third instar larvae, the cibarial dilator muscles were observed within the cibarial pump skeleton and innervated by 5-HT IR neurons in nerves arising from the brain. There were four pairs of nerves arising from the frontal surface of the larval brain that innervate the cibarial pump muscles, pharynx, and muscles controlling the mouth hooks. A strong serotoninergic innervation of the anterior stomatogastric system was observed, which suggests 5-HT may play a role in the coordination of different phases of food ingestion by larvae. Similarly, many 5-HT IR neurons were found in both the brain and the thoracico-abdominal ganglia in the adult, some of which innervate the cibarial pump dilator muscles and the stomatogastric muscles. This is tnhe first report describing neuromuscular structures of the stable fly feeding system. The results reported here suggest 5-HT may play a critical role in feeding behaviors of stable fly larvae and adults. 3aStomoxys calcitrans 3aadults 3abrain 3afeeding behavior 3afoods 3aganglia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aingestion 3ainnervation 3ainsect behavior 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amouth 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3aneurons 3apharynx 3aserotonin 3askeleton 2aAnimals 2aCentral Nervous Systemxmetabolism 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFemale 2aGastrointestinal Tractxinnervationxphysiology. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aLarvaxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMuscidaexanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aMusclesxinnervationxphysiology. 2aSerotoninxmetabolism1 aLi, Andrew Y.1 aWitt, Colleen M.1 aPérez de León, Adalberto A.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2011 Aug., v. 77, no. 4 p.199-2019dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley CompanywJournal:jnl34835x0739-44627nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/557513Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.20434  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Liu%20et%20al%202011%20a.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006200171300001400233520101700247592002801264650001901292650002901311650002001340650001301360650001601373650001401389650001901403650001201422650003101434650001501465650000901480650001901489650001501508650001201523653001501535653001001550653001501560653002501575653000801600700001801608700001801626773008701644856008301731990002301814852000901837655001201846IND60697456120221119191726.0200605e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069745612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcin, Pierre O.10aGalectin-3 plays a role in minute virus of mice infection  ap. 63-72.  aGalectin-3 has previously been found to be required by the parvovirus minute virus of mice prototype strain (MVMp) for infection of mouse fibroblast cells. Since MVMp is an oncotropic virus, and galectin-3 is a multifunctional protein implicated in cancer metastasis, we hypothesized that galectin-3 and Mgat5, the Golgi enzyme that synthesizes high-affinity glycan ligands of galectin-3, might play a role in MVMp infection. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of galectin-3 in mouse cells transformed with polyomavirus middle T antigen and Mgat5⁻/⁻ mouse mammary tumor cells, we found that galectin-3 and Mgat5 are both necessary for efficient MVMp cell entry and infection, but not for cell binding. Moreover, we found that human cancer cells expressing higher levels of galectin-3 were more efficiently infected with MVMp than cell lines expressing lower galectin-3 levels. We conclude that galectin-3 and Mgat5 are involved in MVMp infection, and propose that galectin-3 is a determinant of MVMp oncotropism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolyomaviridae 3aRodent protoparvovirus 1 3aanimal diseases 3aantigens 3afibroblasts 3agalectins 3ahuman diseases 3aligands 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aprototypes 3aviruses 0aGalectin-3 0aMgat5 0aParvovirus 0aMinute virus of mice 0aMVM1 aNabi, Ivan R.1 aPanté, Nelly0 tVirology.g2015 July, v. 481 p.63-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012300169500001900292520161800311592002801929650001301957650001901970650001201989650002302001650001002024650001102034650001602045650002202061650001602083650002202099650003702121653002402158653003002182653003302212653003502245653002002280700001702300700001702317700001802334700005302352700006002405773012302465856008802588852000902676655001202685IND60680483320221122063511.0200318e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068048332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.1078942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Fazhu10aElevation gradients affect the differences of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity between root and rhizosphere soil  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDespite the evident importance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungal) associated with the root and rhizosphere system of elevation gradients, limit is known about the difference in AM fungal diversity between root and rhizosphere and their influencing factors along elevation gradients. AM fungal Here, we designed an elevation gradient experiment, which covered six elevations and three vegetation types, and collected plant and soil samples. We used Illumina gene sequencing to analyze AM fungal diversity in roots and rhizosphere soils; other potential factors, such as plant diversity, leaf C, N, and P, litter, soil and microbial biomass, extracellular enzymes activity, and the bacterial and ITS broad-fungal diversity, were also determined. We found that AM fungal diversity differences between root and rhizosphere soil diminished as elevation increased, despite that AM fungal diversity had a well-known pattern with elevation (unimodal patterns). Compared with plant characteristics, soil properties (soil C, N, P, C:N, C:P, N:P) were stronger effect on AM fungal diversity between root and rhizosphere. Particularly, soil extracellular enzymes activity and bacterial and ITS broad-fungal diversity explained more variation in AM fungal diversity dynamics along the elevation gradients. Our findings indicate that the diminishment of AM fungal diversity in root and rhizosphere soil are a response to elevation gradients through changes of soil extracellular enzymes activity and the bacterial and fungi communities, which provided evidence that AM fungal community dynamics link to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aforests 3afungal communities 3agenes 3aleaves 3ameteorology 3amicrobial biomass 3arhizosphere 3aspecies diversity 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aElevation gradients 0aRoot and rhizosphere soil 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aBacterial and fungal diversity 0aEnzyme activity1 aFeng, Xiuxiu1 aGuo, Yaoxing1 aRen, Chengjie1 aWang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8011-31491 aDoughty, Russell1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5191-21550 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 284 p.107894-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.1078943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094040001800116100002600134245011400160300001600274520042800290592002800718653002100746653002500767653001500792653002100807653002500828653002700853653002600880653003400906653001800940700002100958773012200979856007001101852000901171655001201180IND60126067520221118002408.0151105e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012606752DNAL7 a10.1654/41892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Dennis J.10aGastrointestinal Helminths of the Virginia Opossum (Didelphis virginiana) in South-Central Connecticut, U.S.A  ap. 183-185.  aExamination of 30 Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) from south-central Connecticut revealed the presence of 7 species of gastrointestinal helminths: the nematodes Capillaria sp., Cruzia americana, and Physaloptera turgida; the trematodes Brachylaima virginiana, Brachylaima didelphis, and Didelphodiplostomum variabile; and the cestode Mesocestoides sp.

Phenol is a toxic environmental pollutant and a typical lignin-derived phenolic inhibitor. In this study, we genetically engineered Escherichia coli cells by expressions of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) to promote proteinaceous and aliphatic biofloc formation. Compared with the planktonic E. coli cells, the biofloc-forming cells improved phenol removal rate by up to 2.2-folds, due to their substantially improved tolerance (up to 149%) to phenol and slightly enhanced cellular activity (20%) of phenol hydroxylase (PheH). The engineered bioflocs also improved E. coli tolerance to other toxic compounds such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and guaiacol. Additionally, the strategy of the engineered biofloc formation was applicable to Pseudomonas putida and enhanced its tolerance to phenol. This study highlights a strategy to form engineered bioflocs for improved cell tolerance and removal of toxic compounds, enabling their universality of use in bioproduction and bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFA0901200cNational Key R&D Program of China  a18JC1413600cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality  a18ZR1420500cNatural Science Foundation of Shanghai  a2018011010cOpen Project Program of CAS Key Laboratory of Tropical Marine Bio-resources and Ecology (LMB) 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas putida 3abiofloc technology 3abioremediation 3aenzymes 3afurfural 3agenetic engineering 3aguaiacol 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amicroorganisms 3aphenol 3aplankton 3apollutants 3apolymers 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity1 aZhang, Shun1 aLi, Jiawei1 aXia, Juan1 aYao, Ruilian1 aZhao, Xinqing1 aWu, Bing1 aBai, Fengwu1 aXiao, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5232-85130 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 104, no. 3 p.1187-1199dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-10289-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013600159300002000295520176400315592002802079650001502107650001202122650001402134650002002148650002202168650000902190650001302199650001602212650001402228650001002242650001402252650001402266650001602280650001802296650001902314650001702333650003702350700001802387700002302405700001702428773012402445856007502569852000902644655001202653IND60636162120221122083812.0190506e20170719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063616212DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04281g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatima, Sabeen14aThe high photocatalytic activity and reduced band gap energy of La and Mn co-doped BiFeO₃/graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) nanohybrids  ap. 35928-35937.  aRecently, bismuth ferrites have attracted great interest in the field of photocatalysis due to their magnetic nature and narrow band gap. Herein, nanohybrids of lanthanum (La) and manganese (Mn) co-doped BiFeO₃ (BLFMO)/graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have been synthesized. The hybrids were prepared by two different but simple and low-cost synthesis routes: (i) co-precipitation (namely the C-series), and (ii) hydrothermal (namely the H-series) methods. This article details a comparison of the C-series and H-series BLFMO/GNP nanohybrids based on their photocatalytic activity and band gap. The H-series nanohybrids showed a more crystalline structure, reduced band gap and less dye removal compared to the C-series nanohybrids. The enhanced dye removal (92%) of the C-series nanohybrids is attributed to their high surface area (55 m² g⁻¹) due to GNP incorporation inside the BLFMO/GNP nanohybrids. The higher surface area enables more adsorption of dye molecules over the catalyst surface under dark conditions. In addition, the band gap of the BLFMO/GNP nanohybrids was reduced from 2.04 eV (pure BiFeO₃) to 1.40 eV (BLFMO/GNPs) because of the presence of new donor energy levels with Mn loading. The calculated particle sizes from Scherrer’s formula were 19.3–23.5 nm (C-series) and 22.5–26 nm (H-series). The estimated particle size calculated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is approximately 31 nm for the C-series nanohybrids. The graphene based nanohybrids significantly enhanced dye removal compared to pure BiFeO₃ (44%) under visible light irradiation. The low cost, easy preparation and higher catalytic activity of the BLFMO/GNP nanohybrids reported here make nanohybrids suitable candidates for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abismuth 3acatalysts 3acoprecipitation 3acrystal structure 3adyes 3agraphene 3airradiation 3alanthanum 3alight 3amagnetism 3amanganese 3ananohybrids 3aparticle size 3aphotocatalysis 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAli, S.

Thirty-eight multiparous cows were blocked into 19 pairs and then randomly allocated to either one of 2 treatments. The treatments were supplementation either with or without (control) rumen-protected choline. Treatments were applied from 3 wk before until 6 wk after calving. Both groups received the same basal diet, being a mixed feed of grass silage, corn silage, straw, and soybean meal, and a concentrate mixture delivered through transponder-controlled feed dispensers. For all cows, the concentrate mixture was gradually increased from 0kg/day (wk −3) to 0.9kg of dry matter (DM)/d (day of calving) and up to 8.1kg of DM/d on d 17 postcalving until the end of the experiment. Additionally, a mixture of 60g of a rumen-protected choline supplement (providing 14.4g of choline) and of 540g of soybean meal or a (isoenergetic) mixture of 18g of palm oil and 582g of soybean meal (control) was offered individually in feed dispensers. Individual feed intake, milk yield, and body weight were recorded daily. Milk samples were analyzed weekly for fat, protein, and lactose content. Blood was sampled at wk −3, d 1, d 4, d 7, d 10, wk 2, wk 3, and wk 6 and analyzed for glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, and β-hydroxybutyric acid. Liver biopsies were taken from 8 randomly selected pairs of cows at wk −3, wk 1, wk 4, and wk 6 and analyzed for triacylglycerol concentration. We found that choline supplementation increased DM intake from 14.4 to 16.0kg/d and, hence, net energy intake from 98.2 to 109.1 MJ/d at the intercept of the lactation curve at 1 day in milk (DIM), but the effect of choline on milk protein yield gradually decreased during the course of the study. Choline supplementation had no effect on milk yield, milk fat yield, or lactose yield. Milk protein yield was increased from 1.13 to 1.26kg/d at the intercept of the lactation curve at 1 DIM, but the effect of choline on milk protein yield gradually decreased during the course of the study. Choline supplementation was associated with decreased milk fat concentration at the intercept of the lactation curve at 1 DIM, but the effect of choline on milk fat concentration gradually decreased as lactation progressed. Choline supplementation had no effect on energy-corrected milk yield, energy balance, body weight, body condition score, and measured blood parameters. Choline supplementation decreased the concentration of liver triacylglycerol during the first 4 wk after parturition. Results from this study suggest that hepatic fat export in periparturient dairy cows is improved by choline supplementation during the transition period and this may potentially decrease the risk for metabolic disorders in the periparturient dairy cow.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aanimal feeders 3ablood 3ablood composition 3abody condition 3abody weight 3acalving 3acholine 3acorn silage 3adairy cows 3adietary supplements 3aenergy intake 3afeed intake 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3agrass silage 3alactation 3alactation curve 3alactose 3aliver 3ametabolic diseases 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein yield 3apalm oils 3arisk 3asoybean meal 3astraw 3atriacylglycerols 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCattlexbloodxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCholinexpharmacology 2aDietary Supplements 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aLiverxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aMilkxchemistryxsecretion. 2aPeripartum Periodxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPregnancy 2aTriglyceridesxanalysis1 avan Baal, J.1 aGoselink, R.M.A.1 aBakker, J.A.1 ade Veth, M.J.1 avan Vuuren, A.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Aug., v. 94, no. 8 p.4016-4027dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2011-42333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245004400208300001600252520108400268592002801352650002401380650001101404650002201415650001301437650002601450650001901476650002501495650001401520650002501534700001901559700002101578700002001599773011101619856008201730852000901812655001201821IND60557520520221118202714.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055752052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2016.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCsörgő, Bálint1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0397-684510aSystem-level genome editing in microbes  ap. 113-122.  aThe release of the first complete microbial genome sequences at the end of the past century opened the way for functional genomics and systems-biology to uncover the genetic basis of various phenotypes. The surge of available sequence data facilitated the development of novel genome editing techniques for system-level analytical studies. Recombineering allowed unprecedented throughput and efficiency in microbial genome editing and the recent discovery and widespread use of RNA-guided endonucleases offered several further perspectives: (i) previously recalcitrant species became editable, (ii) the efficiency of recombineering could be elevated, and as a result (iii) diverse genomic libraries could be generated more effectively. Supporting recombineering by RNA-guided endonucleases has led to success stories in metabolic engineering, but their use for system-level analysis is mostly unexplored. For the full exploitation of opportunities that are offered by the genome editing proficiency, future development of large scale analytical procedures is also vitally needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic engineering 3agenome 3agenomic libraries 3agenomics 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroorganisms 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3arecalcitrant species1 aNyerges, Ákos1 aPósfai, György1 aFehér, Tamás,0 tCurrent opinion in microbiology.g2016 Oct., v. 33 p.113-122dElsevier LtdwJournal:12432x1369-52747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245011800186520099800304592002801302650001301330650001801343650001101361650001201372650001301384650001301397650001901410650001901429650002001448650001401468650002201482650001601504653001701520653001301537653002801550653002001578653002401598653002001622700001901642700004101661700003301702700003501735773011001770856008701880852000901967655001201976IND60722775920221117161128.0220606e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072277592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2021.1104802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulla-Huillca, Palmer Vicente10aWettability of gelatin-based films: The effects of hydrophilic or hydrophobic plasticizers and nanoparticle loads  aThe effects on surface properties of films with compositions based on gelatin plasticized with glycerol, without or with montmorillonite (MMT), and plasticized with acetyl tributyl citrate (ATC) was investigated. The water contact angle (WCA), wettability and free surface energy were determined by measuring the WCA using the sessile drop method. The surface topography was measured by AFM. The film plasticized by glycerol presented the smoothest surface, while the film loaded with MMT presented the greatest surface roughness followed by that plasticized by ATC. All films showed a hydrophobic character (WCA>65°), and the same trend was observed for wettability. It is worth mentioning that there was no significant correlation between the values of WAC and roughness. The films showed low polar component values, which corroborate the high WCA values obtained. In conclusion, the MMT load or the use of ATC did not expressively improve the humidity resistance of films based on gelatin.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitrates 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3agelatin 3aglycerol 3ahumidity 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amontmorillonite 3aroughness 3asurface roughness 3awettability 0aEdible films 0aGlycerol 0aAcetyl tributyl citrate 0aMontmorillonite 0aWater contact angle 0aSurface tension1 aGomes, Andresa1 aQuinta Barbosa Bittante, Ana Mônica1 aLourenço, Rodrigo Vinícius1 aSobral, Paulo José do Amaral,0 tJournal of food engineering.g2021 May, v. 297 p.110480-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2021.1104803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01669naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006300166300001600229520073200245592002800977650001301005650001501018650001801033650001601051650001501067650002601082700002301108700002201131773011101153856008201264852000901346655001201355IND60557520620221118202702.0180904e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055752062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mib.2016.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLibis, Vincent10aSensing new chemicals with bacterial transcription factors  ap. 105-112.  aBacteria rely on allosteric transcription factors (aTFs) to sense a wide range of chemicals.

From digging into the ever changing repertoire of natural regulatory circuits, to advances in aTF engineering, we review here different strategies that are pushing the boundaries of this chemical space.

Several studies have demonstrated spatial and temporal activity shifts of animals in response to human disturbance. However, most studies investigate effects on how animals use an area of high tourism disturbance, such as a tourist resort or hiking trail, and not the effects of human disturbance at a key site for the animal, such as a denning or breeding site. In this study, we use photos from remote camera monitoring of arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) dens with the aim to investigate the effects of various levels of tourism disturbance on the diurnal activity pattern and vigilance of breeding adult arctic foxes at the den site. We find a temporal shift towards a higher daytime activity at the den in response to high intensity tourism (71 ± 3.9% in disturbed areas compared with 53 ± 6.2% in undisturbed areas), which stands in contrast to an increased nocturnality seen in studies of many other species, including another study of arctic foxes. We suggest that the difference could be explained by the higher cost of avoiding a key site for the animal, as in this study, compared with avoiding a more general human disturbance in an area within the distribution range of the animal, as in most other studies. Increased time spent avoiding the perceived threat of humans could compromise other important activities and have potential negative effects on e.g. hunting or provisioning for the juveniles. Human disturbance focused at a key site, such as a denning or breeding site, can thereby be expected to have larger consequences than what is observed in most studies of disturbance effects on wildlife. Based on observations of both tourists and arctic foxes during close encounters in an area of high intensity tourism, we also find that they both respond behaviorally to each other. The potential for positive or negative feedback mechanisms in such relationships between tourists and wildlife highlights the importance of considering both sides of the complex interaction to find a balance between preserving biodiversity and ensuring continued possibilities for recreation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVulpes lagopus 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3acameras 3adiurnal activity 3aresorts 3atourism 3atourists 3awildlife 0aWildlife tourism 0aHuman-wildlife interactions 0aRecreation 0aHuman disturbance 0aMutual relationship 0aArctic fox1 aNorén, Karin1 aAngerbjörn, Anders,0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 June, v. 27 p.e01602-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e016023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014800164300001600312520165600328592002801984650001202012650001902024650002402043700001902067773009302086856008102179852000902260655001202269IND60080266620221117192803.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008026662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-013-1862-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeo, Sae-Rim10aGlobal warming, low-frequency variability, and biennial oscillation: an attempt to understand the physical mechanisms driving major ENSO events  ap. 771-786.  aThree primary global modes of sea surface temperature (SST) variability during the period of 1871–2010 are identified through cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis. The first mode exhibits a clear trend and represents global SST warming with an ‘El Niño-like’ SST pattern in the tropical Pacific. The second mode is characterized by considerable low-frequency variability in both the tropical Pacific and the North Pacific regions, indicating that there is a close connection between the two regions on interannual and decadal time scales. The third mode shows a seesaw pattern between El Niño and La Niña within a two-year period; this mode is derived by the oscillatory tendency of the tropical Pacific ocean–atmosphere coupled system. A SST reconstruction based on these three modes captures a significant portion of the SST variability in the raw data, which is primarily associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the tropical Pacific. Additionally, this study attempts to interpret the major ENSO events that have occurred since the 1970s in terms of the interplay originating from these three modes of variability. In particular, two key points are derived from this analysis: (1) the most extreme El Niño events occurred in 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 are attributed to the positive contributions of all three modes; and (2) the central Pacific (CP) El Niño events in the 1990s and 2000s have different physical mechanisms, that is, the CP El Niño events in the early 1990s originated mainly from the low-frequency mode, while those in the early 2000s derived mainly from the global warming mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aglobal warming 3asurface temperature1 aKim, Kwang-Yul0 tClimate dynamics.g2014 Aug., v. 43, no. 3-4 p.771-786dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-013-1862-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245023300158300001600391520095600407592002801363653002001391653001701411653001901428653001501447653001401462653002701476653001001503700002401513773012201537856007201659852000901731655001201740IND60126068220221118002436.0151105e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012606822DNAL7 a10.1654/4174.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholz, Tomááš10aFirst Report of Metacestodes of Cyclustera ralli (Underwood and Dronen, 1986) (Cestoda: Cyclophyllidea) from the Fish Intermediate Host Fundulus heteroclitus (Linnaeus, 1766) (Cyprinodontiformes: Fundulidae) from Virginia, U.S.A  ap. 130-133.  aMetacestodes of the tapeworm Cyclustera ralli (Cestoda: Cyclophyllidea) are reported from the mesenteries and liver of the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, from Virginia, U.S.A.

Besides aiding host colonization, bacterial biofilms play an important role in resistance against antimicrobial agents, for instance antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Here, we show that gomesin, a potent AMP from a tarantula spider, modulates X. fastidiosa gene expression profile upon 60 min of treatment with a sublethal concentration. DNA microarray hybridizations revealed that among the upregulated coding sequences, some are related to biofilm production. In addition, we show that the biofilm formed by gomesin-treated bacteria is thicker than that formed by nontreated cells or cells exposed to streptomycin. We have also observed that the treatment of X. fastidiosa with a sublethal concentration of gomesin before inoculation in tobacco plants correlates with a reduction in foliar symptoms, an effect possibly due to the trapping of bacterial cells to fewer xylem vessels, given the enhancement in biofilm production. These results warrant further investigation of how X. fastidiosa would respond to the AMPs produced by citrus endophytes and by the insect vector, leading to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of these molecules on bacterial virulence. 3aAraneae 3aCitrus 3aDNA microarrays 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aanti-infective properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aendophytes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahosts 3ainsect vectors 3amechanism of action 3astreptomycin 3asublethal effects 3atobacco 3atrees 3avirulence 3axylem vessels 0aantimicrobial 0aphytopathogen 0amicroarray 0agene expression profile1 aZaini, Paulo A.1 aWulff, Nelson A.1 ada Silva, Patrícia I.P.1 aFázio, Marcos A.1 aMiranda, Antonio.1 aDaffre, Sirlei1 ada Silva, Aline M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 May, v. 306, no. 2 p.152-159dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2010.01950.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02081naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245011300169300001600282520089500298650002101193650001401214650001301228650001301241650001001254650001301264650001101277650001401288650002201302651001801324653001401342653001801356700001601374700001901390773012901409852000901538856009201547930003301639946001101672655001201683IND4436619020221120221336.0100507e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443661902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00728.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRYDELL, J.J.14aThe influence of abiotic factors on gillnet catch rates of yellow perch in southern Lake Michigan, 1989-2006  ap. 284-290.  aThe difference in yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), catch rates were evaluated for gillnets set on the bottom at 10- and 15-m depths in southern Lake Michigan during June, July and August from 1989 to 2006. More yellow perch were captured in gillnets set at 10 m than at 15 m. Differences in water temperature were significant in explaining variation in catch rates, but differences in Secchi depth and wave height were not significant. These results suggest that yellow perch may associate with habitat based on water temperature during the summer and move in response to thermal changes. In addition, this portion of the lake lacks noticeable heterogeneous structural habitat features that normally influence yellow perch behaviour. Fisheries managers should consider sampling based on temperature in addition to depth or other habitat features when designing sampling protocols. 3aPerca flavescens 3afisheries 3agillnets 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amanagers 3asummer 3aturbidity 3awater temperature 3aLake Michigan 0aabundance 0awater clarity1 aLAUER, T.E.1 aFORSYTHE, P.S.0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2010 June, v. 17, no. 3 p.284-290dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0969-997X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2009.00728.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03156naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001800186245009200204300001800296506007600314520154700390506003701937650001601974650001101990650002002001650002602021650001502047650002202062650002902084650002102113650001402134650003602148650002302184650003802207650002802245650002102273650002802294653002902322653001002351700002702361773013602388852000902524856008502533930003302618946001102651655001202662IND4438857820221207061452.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443885782DNAL7 a204370352pmid7 aPMC30822882pmcid7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3705-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dongli 10aAnalysis of thyroid hormones in serum by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 1831-1839.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThyroid hormones are essential hormones for regulating growth and development in humans and wildlife. Methods to monitor precise and low levels of these hormones in serum and tissues are needed to assess overall health, whether from disease considerations or possibly from environmental contaminant exposures. Common and routine methods typically rely upon radioimmunoassays, which can be expensive, and typically only measure thyroxine and 3,3′,5-triidothyronine, which can be a limitation in fully evaluating impacts on thyroid regulation. In this study we developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous analysis of five thyroid hormones—thyroxine, 3,3′,5-triidothyronine, 3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine, 3,3′-diiodothyronine, and 3,5-diiodothyronine—in serum samples. The LC-MS/MS parameters were optimized and calibrated over a wide concentration range (1.0-500 ng/mL) with on-column detection limits of 1.5-7.0 pg. With use of spiked bovine serum samples, the mean method recoveries were calculated to be 81.3-111.9% with relative standard deviations of 1.2-9.6% at spiking levels ranging from 10 to 100 ng/mL. This method was compared with measurements made by standard radioimmunoassays and with measurements made in a serum Standard Reference Material (SRM 1951b). Development of this method expands the capacity to measure thyroid hormones by including a larger suite of thyroid hormones, and has promising applications for measuring catabolism of thyroid hormones in vitro.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3acattle 3adetection limit 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3aradioimmunoassays 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athyroid hormones 3athyroxine 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aLimit of Detection 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aThyroid Hormonesxblood 2aThyroxinexblood 2aTriiodothyroninexblood 0aTandem mass spectrometry 0aSerum1 aStapleton, Heather M. 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 July, v. 397, no. 5 p.1831-1839dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-010-3705-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03368naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002900171245009800200300001400298520130500312650001001617650001501627650002001642650001001662650001701672650001901689650003701708650001201745650002801757650001901785650002101804650002701825650001601852650001601868650002601884650001101910650002301921650002601944650002901970650002901999650003702028650002402065650001502089650005002104650007402154650007302228650004502301653001902346653001602365653001102381653001002392700001702402700001702419700002302436773011402459852000902573856009202582930003302674946001102707655001202718IND4431340920221120204907.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443134092DNAL7 a199304642pmid7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00591.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Bono, Bárbara10aYeast karyopherins Kap123 and Kap95 are related to the function of the cell integrity pathway  ap. 28-37.  aThe characterization of mutant strains in the gene encoding karyopherin Kap123 has revealed several morphogenetic defects. Inactivation of KAP123 caused alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in hyperpolarization and resistance to the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin B. In fact, the level of actin filaments is increased in kap123 mutant cells. In addition to the defect in actin cytoskeleton, the kap123 mutant cells showed a weakened cell wall, cell lysis and a growth defect in either the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate or at high temperatures, which is alleviated by osmotic stabilizers. These defects in cell integrity and the actin cytoskeleton suggested a relationship with the protein kinase C (PKC) cell integrity pathway. Slt2, the mitogen-activated protein kinase of the PKC cell integrity pathway, is constitutively activated in the absence of Kap123, which is consistent with the existence of cell integrity defects. Analysis of the subcellular localization of nuclear proteins involved in cell wall gene expression indicated that the localization of the Slt2 kinase and the transcription factors Rlm1, Swi6 and Paf1 was not affected by Kap123. Finally, we identified karyopherin Kap95 as the transport factor responsible for the nuclear import of Slt2 and Rlm1. 3aactin 3acell walls 3agene expression 3agenes 3akaryopherins 3amicrofilaments 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3aphysiological transport 3apolymerization 3aprotein kinase C 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aCell Wallxphysiology 2aCytoskeletonxphysiology 2aGene Knockout Techniques 2aMADS Domain Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMicroscopy 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2abeta Karyopherinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0acell integrity 0aPKC pathway 0aKap123 0aKap951 aQuilis, Inma1 aZalve, Elena1 aIgual, Juan Carlos0 tFEMS yeast research.g2010 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.28-37dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00591.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03118naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245008600191300001300277520097800290650002301268650001401291650001401305650002801319650001001347650001001357650001801367650001501385650001301400650002001413650002401433650002701457650002101484650008001505650003601585650012001621650002801741650001401769650004401783650002301827650003101850650003401881650002601915653004001941653002001981653001702001653001602018700001602034700002002050700001902070700002402089700001802113700001902131700002102150700002002171773012002191852000902311856009202320930003302412946001102445655001202456IND4431097420221120204921.0100111e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443109742DNAL7 a200153382pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01849.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStals, Ingeborg10aIdentification of a gene coding for a deglycosylating enzyme in Hypocrea jecorina  ap. 9-17.  aAn enzyme with mannosyl glycoprotein endo-N-acetyl-β- d-glucosaminidase (ENGase)-type activity was partially purified from the extracellular medium of the mould Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei). Internal peptides were generated and used to identify the gene in the T. reesei genome. The active enzyme is processed both at the N- and at the C-terminus. High-mannose-type glycoproteins are good substrates, whereas complex-type glycans are not hydrolysed. The enzyme represents the first fungal member of glycoside hydrolase family 18 with ENGase-type activity. Bacterial ENGases and the fungal chitinases belonging to the same family show very low homology with Endo T. Database searches identify several highly homologous genes in fungi and the activity is also found within other Trichoderma species. This ENGase activity, not coregulated with cellulase production, could be responsible for the extensive N-deglycosylation observed for several T. reesei cellulases. 3aTrichoderma reesei 3achitinase 3adatabases 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungi 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosides 3apeptides 3apolysaccharides 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aCluster Analysis 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHypocreaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidasexchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aendo-N-acetyl-β- d-glucosaminidase 0adeglycosylation 0aGH family 18 0aEC 3.2.1.961 aSamyn, Bart1 aSergeant, Kjell1 aWhite, Theresa1 aHoorelbeke, Katleen1 aCoorevits, An1 aDevreese, Bart1 aClaeyssens, Marc1 aPiens, Kathleen0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 Feb., v. 303, no. 1 p.9-17dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01849.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100111b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04061naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002800186245011300214300001600327506007600343520151700419506003701936650002201973650001201995650001802007650001002025650001302035650001502048650001702063650001202080650001302092650002202105650001402127650001302141650002102154650003502175650001602210650001102226650001502237650002502252650001202277650002602289650003102315650004402346650003802390650004902428650005302477650004302530650004202573650005202615650005202667650005702719650002902776650001602805653001702821653001802838653001702856653002502873700003602898700002702934700002602961700002702987700002403014773011503038852000903153856008503162930003303247946001103280655001203291IND4439735520221207061415.0100709e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443973552DNAL7 a204908942pmid7 aPMC28981082pmcid7 a10.1007/s11103-010-9647-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolters, Anne-Marie A. 10aIdentification of alleles of carotenoid pathway genes important for zeaxanthin accumulation in potato tubers  ap. 659-671.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have investigated the genetics and molecular biology of orange flesh colour in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). To this end the natural diversity in three genes of the carotenoid pathway was assessed by SNP analyses. Association analysis was performed between SNP haplotypes and flesh colour phenotypes in diploid and tetraploid potato genotypes. We observed that among eleven beta-carotene hydroxylase 2 (Chy2) alleles only one dominant allele has a major effect, changing white into yellow flesh colour. In contrast, none of the lycopene epsilon cyclase (Lcye) alleles seemed to have a large effect on flesh colour. Analysis of zeaxanthin epoxidase (Zep) alleles showed that all (diploid) genotypes with orange tuber flesh were homozygous for one specific Zep allele. This Zep allele showed a reduced level of expression. The complete genomic sequence of the recessive Zep allele, including the promoter, was determined, and compared with the sequence of other Zep alleles. The most striking difference was the presence of a non-LTR retrotransposon sequence in intron 1 of the recessive Zep allele, which was absent in all other Zep alleles investigated. We hypothesise that the presence of this large sequence in intron 1 caused the lower expression level, resulting in reduced Zep activity and accumulation of zeaxanthin. Only genotypes combining presence of the dominant Chy2 allele with homozygosity for the recessive Zep allele produced orange-fleshed tubers that accumulated large amounts of zeaxanthin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalleles 3abeta-carotene 3acolor 3adiploidy 3ahaplotypes 3ahomozygosity 3aintrons 3alycopene 3amolecular biology 3aphenotype 3apotatoes 3aretrotransposons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atetraploidy 3atubers 3azeaxanthin 3azeaxanthin epoxidase 2aAlleles 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aCarotenoidsxbiosynthesis. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIntramolecular Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Tubersxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aXanthophyllsxmetabolism 2aZeaxanthins 0aSNP analysis 0aAllele mining 0aOrange flesh 0aZeaxanthin epoxidase1 aUitdewilligen, Jan G.

The most valuable product of the jojoba seeds is the liquid wax or jojoba oil which is marketed extensively in the cosmetic industry. Differing from the most of the cultivated crop species, jojoba has slow-growing habit, difficulties in the determination of sex at the early seedling stages, a male-biased ratio and low seed yield. In jojoba, the development of molecular strategies for the identification of sexes at early stages has been a priority in plantations and breeding programs. Two previous studies reported two candidate male-specific jojoba DNA markers. However, present study indicated that these markers were not useful in jojoba sex identification. A reliable gender diagnostic marker for jojoba is, therefore, needed. In the present study a novel jojoba male-specific touch-down polymerase chain reaction based DNA marker (JMS900) was reported using a total of 120 individual jojoba plants bulked into 16 samples. This sex specific DNA marker may have considerable theoretical and practical applications in the establishment of jojoba plantation and breeding studies. 3aSimmondsia chinensis 3abreeding 3acrops 3across pollination 3agender 3agenetic markers 3aindustry 3ajojoba 3ajojoba oil 3aplantations 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseed yield 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asex determination 3ashrubs 3aSonoran Desert 0aGender specific DNA marker 0aSex identification 0aTouch-down PCR1 aKaraca, Mehmet 1 aOnus, A.

We studied three possible sources of error for uncoupled and spatially coupled distributed crop models: (1) error from biases (towards unrepresentatively wet or dry weather) in the sampling of years of yield data used for the parameterization process, (2) errors due to lack of knowledge of initial soil water conditions, and (3) error from lack of spatial coupling and water transport among different landscape locations. We show analytical evidence that the spatiotemporal infiltration behavior of a simple spatially coupled water balance model cannot be reproduced through a modification of the parameters of an uncoupled model. The corresponding yield prediction limitations of the uncoupled model are confirmed, using an example, both at the parameter estimation and the validation stages. In our example, however, parameter error due to weather biases and the error from lack of knowledge of initial conditions greatly impacted the predictive capability of the spatially coupled model, and had less effect on its uncoupled counterpart. This effect of biased weather has not been reported previously in the crop modeling IM literature. We conclude that the use of spatially coupled distributed crop models requires high-quality data. Practical precision agriculture applications are characterized by uncertain initial conditions and the possibility of biased weather. Under these circumstances, the use of a spatially coupled model may not be justified, especially for low landscape positions. 3acrop models 3asimulation models 3aequations 3asoybeans 3aprecision agriculture 3aweather 3acrop yield 3aspatial data 3asoil water 3aedaphic factors 3aaccuracy 3aprediction 0amodel error 0ainverse modeling 0aenvironmental factors 0aCROPGRO 0aspatially coupled models1 aJones, J.W.1 aGraham, W.D.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 5 p.1547-1561wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/18  aOther US 7aarticle03183naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245006600158300001800224520205900242650002902301650001802330650001502348650001602363650001502379650001702394650001502411650000902426650002702435650001502462650003102477653002502508700002102533700001602554700001602570773009502586852000902681930003302690945002502723946001302748655001202761IND4387425420221122235145.0070202e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438742542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSingh, P.10aAlum Settling and Filtration Treatment of Liquid Swine Manure  ap. 1487-1494.  aA physical/chemical treatment train, which involved preliminary settling for 24 h followed by coagulation/flocculation of supernatant, and filtration, was applied to raw flushed swine manure in bench- and pilot-scale experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the treatment train against the removal of total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP). Alum was used as a coagulant at an average dose of 1600 mg L(-1). In the bench-scale experiments, alum treatment was performed using a jar test apparatus, and filtration was achieved by using polycarbonate track-etched membrane filters of pore sizes of 10 and 20 micrometer. At the pilot plant, coagulation, flocculation, and clarification were achieved in a custom-designed sludge blanket clarifier equipped with inclined plate settlers, followed by media filtration in a set of three patented Martin filter columns containing glass beads of different void sizes ranging from 5 to 25 micrometer. Overall percent reductions in TSS and TP were 85% (from 9944 to 1470 mg L(-1)) and 64% (from 449 to 163 mg L(-1)) in the bench-scale experiments and were 76% (from 3945 to 936 mg L(-1)) and 75% (from 164 to 40 mg L(-1)) in the pilot plant treatment, respectively. Preliminary settling was found to be a very effective step, which removed 53% to 56% and 22% to 28% of TSS and TP, respectively, from the raw liquid swine manure. Moderate reduction in chemical oxygen demand was also observed, while the treatment train had little effect on total Kjeldahl nitrogen and dissolved solids. Particle size distribution analysis showed that most of the phosphorus in the liquid manure was associated with particles <10 micrometer in size and that coagulation and flocculation could enhance the phosphorus removal considerably. At the end of the pilot-scale experiment, approximately 70% and 50% of the initial mass of TSS and TP was removed from the liquid swine manure, respectively, as preliminary settling sludge, whose volume was accounted for approximately 36% of the volume of initial raw manure. 3aanimal manure management 3aliquid manure 3apig manure 3acoagulation 3afiltration 3aflocculation 3acoagulants 3aalum 3atotal suspended solids 3aphosphorus 3aparticle size distribution 0apreliminary settling1 aGamal El-Din, M.1 aBromley, D.1 aIkehata, K.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 5 p.1487-1494wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/16  aOther US 7aarticle02667naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245010600162300001800268500001500286520138300301650001901684650001701703650001201720650001701732650001701749650000801766650001301774650001501787650001601802650001301818650001701831650001501848653001601863653002301879653002201902653001801924653003001942653001801972700002001990773009502010852000902105930003302114945002502147946001302172655001202185IND4387425020221122225129.0070202e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438742502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVigneault, C.10aIndirect Measurement Method for Laminar to Turbulent Airflow through Horticultural Produce Simulators  ap. 1455-1461.  a2019-12-06  aSixty-four plastic balls were instrumented for use as horticultural produce simulators and strategically distributed in an orthogonal matrix along with 448 other plastic spheres to simulate precooling of column-stacked produce. This research tool was based on the correlation between the cooling rate of produce simulators and the air approach velocity. Since a range of airflow rates was already recognized as creating particular difficulties for indirect air velocity measurement, particular care was taken with the air velocity measurement of the theoretical range of each airflow pattern, namely, laminar, transient, and turbulent. Correlations were determined by measuring the half-cooling time of each instrumented ball positioned at a fixed location inside a ball matrix that was inserted into an open-ended ventilation tunnel and subjected to various airflows. The results obtained allowed the laminar flow pattern to be distinguished from the transient and turbulent patterns using a specific correlation relating the half-cooling time to the air velocity for this type of airflow pattern. However, a single equation was used to correlate half-cooling time to air velocity for transient and turbulent airflow patterns. The new calibration decreased the experimental error and standard deviation obtained with the indirect measurement method system previously developed. 3aturbulent flow 3alaminar flow 3acooling 3afood storage 3aporous media 3aair 3avelocity 3avegetables 3ameasurement 3aair flow 3acold storage 3aprediction 0asimulations 0aforced-air cooling 0ahalf-cooling time 0afruits (food) 0atransient airflow pattern 0aplastic balls1 aCastro, L.R. de0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 5 p.1455-1461wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/14  aOther US 7aarticle03093naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245008100160300001800241520207600259650002202335650001302357650002202370650001502392650002002407650002302427650002402450651001702474700001602491700001902507700001802526773009502544852000902639930003302648945002502681946001302706655001202719IND4387424720221122224956.0070202e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438742472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKiker, G.A.12aA Java-Based, Object-Oriented Modeling System for Southern African Hydrology  ap. 1419-1433.  aAn object-oriented modeling system, ACRU2000 (Agricultural Catchments Research Unit 2000), was created to enable users to simulate the hydrological and environmental effects of various land uses in the Republic of South Africa. The ACRU2000 modeling system was entirely re-designed and re-coded from the concepts used in the previously developed ACRU agro-hydrological model. The model was designed in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and implemented in the Java programming language. The ACRU2000 model was designed to process distributed catchments in a parallel manner during each simulation time step to facilitate the modeling of artificial water flows, particularly with regard to the implementation of the South African National Water Act of 1998. The object-oriented design methodology used to restructure the ACRU model produced a more flexible and extensible model structure, which will facilitate future model expansion. The ACRU2000 modeling system was then tested in the Mgeni River watershed, a medium-sized (4387 km2) watershed in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The ACRU2000 model was parameterized for 137 sub-catchments to simulate daily streamflows. Monthly totals of simulated flows were compared with observed data from several management catchments for a 15-year period (1979-1993). The model gave satisfactory results in simulating upstream management catchments with the variable high and low flows that are endemic to southern African hydrology. The model had less success in areas encompassing large reservoir and transfer schemes combined with urban and peri-urban areas. Coefficient of determination, model efficiency, and root mean squared error of monthly totals of daily streamflow ranged from 0.43 to 0.85, -4.17 to 0.81, and 4% to 51% of median observed streamflow for individual management catchments, respectively. Further study is necessary to determine whether the differences between model and observed results were caused by model inadequacies, poor estimates of crucial input parameters, or faulty/missing flow data. 3ahydrologic models 3aland use 3acomputer software 3awatersheds 3awater resources 3aevapotranspiration 3awatershed hydrology 3aSouth Africa1 aClark, D.J.1 aMartinez, C.J.1 aSchulze, R.E.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 5 p.1419-1433wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/14  aOther US 7aarticle02059naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245007500142300001800217500001500235520085700250650002101107650002601128650002201154650001701176650001501193650001301208650001301221650001701234650001501251650001801266650001301284650001101297650001201308653001401320653001201334653002101346700001701367700001601384700001401400773009501414852000901509930003301518945002501551946001301576655001201589IND4388164020221122225041.0070223e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438816402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The physical characteristics of the pellets were measured. It was found that the bulk density, particle density, durability, and hardness of the pellets were significantly affected by moisture content. The maximum values of bulk density and particle densities were 708 and 1462 kg/m3, respectively. The force required to rupture the pellets varied from 32 N at 6.3% moisture content to 22 N at 17.4% moisture content. Durability of the pellets was also affected by moisture content and was maximum at 8.6% (wet basis) moisture content. The pellets absorbed moisture at rates that were significantly affected by air relative humidity (P < 0.05). The EMC-ERH data for the pellets were sigmoidal in shape and were best predicted by the modified Chung-Pfost equilibrium moisture equation. 3aPanicum virgatum 3aprocessing technology 3arelative humidity 3aenergy crops 3aabsorption 3ahardness 3aporosity 3abulk density 3adurability 3awater content 3abiofuels 3aforces 3apellets 0apelleting 0adensity 0aparticle density1 aFasina, O.O.1 aBransby, D.1 aLee, Y.Y.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 6 p.1845-1851wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/21  aOther US 7aarticle01909naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245007500142300001800217500001500235520092800250650001201178650000901190650001701199650002301216650002201239650001101261650001201272653000901284653003501293700001801328700001401346773009501360852000901455930003301464945002501497946001301522655001201535IND4387427120221122225049.0070202e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438742712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSharma, V.10aEffect of Hybrid Variability on Modified E-Mill Dry-Grind Corn Process  ap. 1651-1655.  a2019-12-06  aIn the E-mill dry-grind corn process, ethanol is the primary product and germ, pericarp fiber, and endosperm fiber are separated as co-products. The E-mill dry-grind corn process has been modified with the use of a granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme, which improves recovery of co-products. Effect of hybrid variability on ethanol concentration and co-product yields in a modified E-mill dry-grind process was evaluated. Four commercial corn hybrids from two locations were processed through the modified E-mill dry-grind corn process to evaluate the effect of hybrids on ethanol and co-product yields. Differences were observed in ethanol concentrations and co-products yield among hybrids. The mean final ethanol concentration ranged from 12.9% to 14.6% (v/v). Overall variation was 8.8% to 9.5% d.b. for germ, 6.0% to 10.4% d.b. for pericarp fiber, 3.9% to 6.6% d.b. for endosperm fiber, and 7.4% to 10.8% d.b. for DDGS. 3ahybrids 3acorn 3aplant fibers 3aethanol production 3adistillers grains 3ayields 3aethanol 0agerm 0aenzymatic dry-grain processing1 aGraeber, J.V.1 aSingh, V.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 5 p.1651-1655wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/23  aOther US 7aarticle03235naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002400161245010800185300001800293500001500311520199700326650002302323650001602346650002202362650001202384650002302396650001202419650001502431651001202446653002402458653002902482653003502511700001902546700001702565700001402582700001802596773009502614852000902709930003302718945002502751946001302776655001202789IND4388166620221122225011.0070223e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438816662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGarcia y Garcia, A.10aAnalysis of the Inter-Annual Variation of Peanut Yield in Georgia Using a Dynamic Crop Simulation Model  ap. 2005-2015.  a2019-12-06  aIt is common practice to use crop simulation models and long-term weather data to study the impact of climate variability on yield. Simulated yields mainly reflect the weather variability but not the adoption of new technologies; both sources of variation are reflected in long-term observed yields. Therefore, long-term observed yields, if available, cannot be readily used for evaluation of crop models. The objectives of this study were to analyze the impact of climate variability on long-term historical peanut yield in Georgia obtained with a dynamic crop simulation model and to assess the applicability of using long-term average county yield determined from statistical estimates for evaluation of the simulated yield. Observed yields obtained from state variety trials as well as yield estimates from the USDA-NASS for three counties in the Georgia peanut belt from 1934 to 2003 were used for evaluating simulated yield series. Simulated yields based on the CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model were categorized into three technological periods (TP). A weighted average based on the acreage of the soil type, the peanut type, and the irrigated land in each county was calculated to obtain a unique simulated yield. Then yields and weather data of the 70-year period were grouped with respect to El Nino Southern Oscillation phases and TPs. Pearson's coefficient of correlation, the least significant difference (LSD), and the t-test were used to evaluate the results. When compared with observed yields, NASS estimates failed to estimate the weather variability at the beginning of the period, but simulated yields clearly reflected that variability during the 70-year period. NASS yield estimates seemed to be useful for evaluating simulated yields from the mid-1970s. The results showed that crop models can be useful in understanding the inter-annual variation of yield due to climate variability if appropriate adjustments are made to account for changes and improvements in agrotechnology. 3atemporal variation 3acrop models 3asimulation models 3apeanuts 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aweather 3acrop yield 3aGeorgia 0amathematical models 0aCSN-CROPGRO-Peanut model 0adynamic crop simulation models1 aHoogenboom, G.1 aGuerra, L.C.1 aPaz, J.O.1 aFraisse, C.W.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 6 p.2005-2015wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/05/21  aOther US 7aarticle01947naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245009400169300001400263500002400277520091800301650002601219650002001245650001101265650002801276650001501304650001501319650001501334650001401349650001401363650001101377700001501388773012801403852000901531856005701540655001201597IND4456267520221122211635.0110408e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445626752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1991.tb01522.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, S.K.10aDetoxification spectrum of the cigarette beetle symbiont Symbiotaphrina kochii in culture  ap. 51-59.  aIncludes references  aThe ability of cultures of the cigarette beetle symbiont, Symbiotaphrina kochii Jurzitza ex.

  1 aBera, P.10aApplication of MARS in simulating pesticide concentrations in soil  ap. 297-307.  a2019-12-06  aEfforts were made to predict pesticide concentrations at three different depths in the soil profile, using models developed with Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), a regression analysis model. The models were developed with independently collected data from the Eugene F. Whelan Experimental Farm (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Woodslee, Ontario, Canada) from 1992 to 1994. Data from 16 plots, subjected to four different tillage treatments and two different water table management practices, were used. The fate of three herbicides, namely atrazine 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine, metribuzin 4-amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-(methylthio)-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one, and metolachlor 2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(-2-methoxyl-1-methylethyl) acetamide, at three different soil depths were studied. The input variables for the models included Julian day, days after application of pesticide, measured herbicide concentrations, and cumulative figures for rainfall depth, air temperature, soil temperature, and potential evapotranspiration. Considering the limited size of the data set, a 10-fold cross-validation was performed to test and validate the model. Model predictions at the 0-10 cm depth were very close to the measured values, with model efficiencies varying from 83% to 99%. The predictions at the 10-15 cm depth generally varied from 33% to 83%, while the ones at the 15-20 cm depth were within 42% to 95%, with a few exceptions where the model predicted a single value, of the average observed concentrations. These results demonstrate that MARS was able to do a commendable job in simulating pesticide fate and transport in soil with limited data. 3aatrazine 3aapplication timing 3asimulation models 3asoil temperature 3agroundwater contamination 3atillage 3adepth 3aregression analysis 3ametribuzin 3aphysicochemical properties 3arain 3asoil water 3ametolachlor 3acomputer software 3adrainage 3astatistical models 0aMultivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) 0apollution 0amathematical models 0asoil 0acomputer simulations 0aherbicides1 aPrasher, S.O.1 aPatel, R.M.1 aMadanī Kirmānī, ʻĀrifah.1 aLacroix, R.1 aGaynor, J.D.1 aTan, C.S.1 aKim, S.H.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.297-307wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/14  aOther US 7aarticle03078naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245016100174300001600335500002400351500001500375520154100390650001501931650001901946650001101965650002101976650002601997650003702023650001202060650003102072650001802103650001302121650001602134650002302150650001502173650002702188653004302215653002502258653003702283653002902320653002302349700001102372773009702383852000902480930003302489945002502522946001302547655001202560IND4387338520221122141116.0070129e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438733852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Selection of optimal wavelengths and development of prediction models  ap. 269-275.  aSecond in a series.  a2019-12-06  aFirmness of apple fruit is an important quality attribute, which varies in the same lot of fruit due to inherent biological variability, climatic condition, cultural practice, harvest time or maturity level, and postharvest handling and storage. This article reports on prediction of apple fruit firmness by using modified Lorentzian distribution (MLD) parameters of light scattering images, which were acquired by a compact multispectral imaging system over wavelengths between 650 and 1000 nm. Optimal wavelengths for firmness prediction were determined with the multi-linear regression (MLR) and cross-validation method. In addition, diffuse reflectance spectra between 550 and 1100 nm were acquired from Red Delicious and Golden Delicious apples by using a visible/near-infrared spectrometer (Vis/NIRS) in interactance mode. Multispectral scattering predictions of fruit firmness were compared with those from Vis/NIRS. For Red Delicious, seven wavelengths (690, 770, 790, 810, 920, 980, and 1000 nm) were optimal for multispectral scattering prediction of fruit firmness, whereas for Golden Delicious, eight wavelengths (650, 690, 740, 750, 820, 880, 910, and 990 nm) were needed. The prediction models established based on the optimal wavelengths gave good firmness predictions with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.82 and a standard error of validation (SEV) of 6.64 N for Red Delicious apples, and r = 0.81 and SEV = 6.58 N for Golden Delicious apples. These results were considerably better than those obtained with Vis/NIRS. 3aestimation 3aimage analysis 3aapples 3alight scattering 3amultispectral imagery 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3atesting 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3afruit quality 3afirmness 3areflectance 3astatistical models 3aprediction 3anondestructive methods 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy 0awavelength selection 0amodified Lorentzian distribution 0amultispectral scattering 0aanalytical methods1 aLu, R.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.269-275wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070808b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/14  aOther US 7aarticle02903naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001300161245007500174300001600249500001500265520162700280650001601907650002201923650001901945650001401964650001801978650001101996650002602007650002002033650001502053653002402068653002802092653002702120653003102147653001002178653001302188653000902201700001902210700001902229773009302248852000902341930003302350945002502383946001302408655001202421IND4382876620221122110527.0060817e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAsaf, Z.10aPredicting soil-rigid wheel performance using distinct element methods  ap. 607-616.  a2019-12-06  aA two-dimensional discrete element model (DEM) for the interaction between a rigid wheel and soil is presented using PFC2D code. The soil particles are modeled by clumps of two discs. The contact model between the particles includes cohesion by a so-called softening model. The parameters of the model represent soil having a cone index (CI) of 200 kPa or 400 kPa. The model of the wheel is based on 30 grousers, spaced equally around a drum 200 mm in diameter and 100 mm in width. Dynamic simulations were performed with different combinations of drawbar force, vertical load, and soil conditions. The traction performance of the wheel was calculated, and the results were compared with known theories and reported test results. The simulation results show reasonably good correlation, quantitatively and qualitatively, with previously reported results and theories, and emphasize the ability of the DEM to simulate soil-wheel interaction for design purposes. Prediction of wheel performance as a function of slip for driven, self-propelled, and towed wheels is presented for different combinations of soil conditions and vertical loads. The ability to investigate soil deformation, stress distribution beneath the wheel, and the influence of slip on sinkage is shown. Contrary to the prediction of empirical theories, the simulations suggest that vertical load and soil CI have different influences on tractive performance; this point warrants further investigation. The model also predicts a different behavior of motion resistance and net traction at high slip rates compared with empirical and semi-empirical methods. 3adeformation 3asimulation models 3adynamic models 3aequations 3asoil strength 3awheels 3aequipment performance 3asoil compaction 3aprediction 0amathematical models 0adiscrete element models 0asoil-wheel interaction 0asoil mechanical properties 0aloads 0atraction 0aslip1 aShmulevich, I.1 aRubinstein, D.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 3 p.607-616wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/05/12  aOther US 7aarticle03013naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245005600144300001800200500001500218520178300233650001502016650002002031650001102051650001102062650002202073650001302095650002202108650001802130650001702148650002002165650001102185650002402196650000902220650002302229650001102252650002102263653001702284653002402301700001902325700001202344773009502356852000902451930003302460945002502493946001302518655001202531IND4416484020221122110540.0090219e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441648402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSoupir, M.L.14aDie-off of E. coli and enterococci in dairy cowpats  ap. 1987-1996.  a2019-12-06  aE. coli and enterococci re-growth and decay patterns in cowpats applied to pasturelands were monitored during the spring, summer, fall, and winter. First-order approximations were used to determine die-off rate coefficients and decimal reduction times (D-values). Higher-order approximations and weather parameters were evaluated by multiple regression analysis to identify environmental parameters impacting in-field E. coli and enterococci decay. First-order kinetics approximated E. coli and enterococci decay rates with regression coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.90. Die-off rate constants were greatest in cowpats applied to pasture during late winter and monitored into summer months for E. coli (k = 0.0995 d-1) and applied to the field during the summer and monitored until December for enterococci (k = 0.0978 d-1). Decay rates were lowest in cowpats applied to the pasture during the fall and monitored over the winter (k = 0.0581 d-1 for E. coli, and k = 0.0557 d-1 for enterococci). Higher-order approximations and the addition of weather variables improved regression coefficients to values ranging from 0.82 to 0.96. Statistically significant variables used in the models for predicting bacterial decay included temperature, solar radiation, rainfall, and relative humidity. Die-off rate coefficients previously reported in the literature are usually the result of laboratory-based studies and are generally higher than the field-based seasonal die-off rate coefficients presented here. To improve predictions of in-field E. coli and enterococci concentrations, this study recommends that higher-order approximations and additional parameters such as weather variables are necessary to better capture re-growth and die-off trends over extended periods of time. 3adairy cows 3asolar radiation 3awinter 3aautumn 3arelative humidity 3apastures 3apathogen survival 3acattle manure 3aEnterococcus 3aair temperature 3aspring 3aregression analysis 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aEscherichia coli 0adairy cattle 0amultiple regression1 aMostaghimi, S.1 aLou, J.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2008 , v. 51, no. 6 p.1987-1996wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20090323b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/20  aOther US 7aarticle02141naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245009300158300001800251500001500269520089200284650001101176650002201187650001501209650001801224650002501242650001201267650002401279650001601303653000901319653001701328653003501345653001601380653002401396653002001420700001401440700001401454700001401468700001401482773009501496852000901591930003301600945002501633946001301658655001201671IND4383908820221122110541.0060927e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438390882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The attenuation and phase shift produced by Korean short-grain rough rice, brown rice, and barley were analyzed to estimate the relationships between moisture density in the grain and the attenuation and phase shift. Second- and third-order polynomial attenuation models were a better measure of moisture density than were phase shift models. A grain moisture meter using microwave attenuation in free-space was constructed. A prototype grain moisture meter consisting of a 10.5 GHz oscillator, patch array antennas, isolator, detector, and digital voltmeter provided a coefficient of determination, standard error of prediction (SEP), and bias of 0.975, 0.62% moisture content, and -0.05% moisture content, respectively. 3abarley 3ameasuring devices 3abrown rice 3awater content 3astatistical analysis 3adensity 3amicrowave radiation 3ameasurement 0arice 0asmall grains 0amicrostrip patch array antenna 0aphase shift 0asmall cereal grains 0asignal analysis1 aKim, J.H.1 aLee, C.J.1 aNoh, S.H.1 aKim, M.S.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 4 p.1089-1093wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070502b20070602c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle02994naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245005900184300001600243500001500259520192400274650001502198650002002213650002302233650001402256650002202270650001602292650002102308653002702329653002302356653001502379653002902394773009302423852000902516930003302525945002502558946001302583655001202596IND4383898420221122110535.0060926e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438389842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aShuttleworth, W.J.10aTowards One-Step Estimation of Crop Water Requirements  ap. 925-935.  a2019-12-06  aThis article provides theoretical analyses that facilitate the use of the Penman-Monteith equation to make a one-step estimate of crop water requirements. Reluctance to using a one-step estimate results from two outstanding issues, both of which are addressed. First, no method has been yet defined to handle the problem that meteorological variables are commonly available only at 2 m above the ground while, when using the Penman-Monteith equation, they are required at some level above the crop. To resolve this, a blending height is defined in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) where meteorological conditions are independent of the underlying crop. Expressions are derived to calculate the aerodynamic resistances to, and the vapor pressure deficit at, the blending height from climate variables at 2 m. Consequently, 2 m climate data can be used in the Penman-Monteith equation, either to estimate transpiration from surface resistance or to calculate surface resistance from measured transpiration. Second, no table of effective values currently exists for the surface resistance of different crops equivalent to that for the crop coefficient. This article calls for field studies to address this need. However, recognizing the need for an interim source of crop-specific surface resistances, a methodology is given for translating the crop coefficient into equivalent surface resistance. To make this translation, it is necessary to specify the relationship between the radiative and aerodynamic energy inputs to evapotranspiration when the crop coefficients were calibrated. Finally, a Penman-Monteith-based, one-step estimation equation is derived that makes proper allowance for the different aerodynamic characteristics of crops in all conditions of atmospheric aridity, and that estimates crop evaporation for any crop of specified height from existing crop coefficients using standard 2 m climate data. 3aestimation 3acrop production 3aevapotranspiration 3aequations 3awater requirement 3aevaporation 3aclimatic factors 0aaerodynamic resistance 0asurface resistance 0aatmosphere 0aPenman-Monteith equation0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 4 p.925-935wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070429b20070502c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/04/28  aOther US 7aarticle02978naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245013500161300001600296500001500312520174100327650001302068650001602081650003402097650002102131650001402152650001702166650001802183650002802201650001302229650001202242650004302254653001902297653001702316653002302333700001502356773009302371852000902464930003302473945002502506946001302531655001202544IND4382879820221122110524.0060817e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aManeerat, C.10aEfficiency of TiO2 photocatalytic reaction on delay of fruit ripening and removal of off-flavors from the fruit storage atmosphere  ap. 833-837.  a2019-12-06  aA titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalytic reaction treatment was applied to tomato fruit during storage to investigate the variation in the efficiency of this treatment for delaying ripening time and removing off-flavors in the storage atmosphere. Its efficiency was evaluated at various TiO2 concentrations and ultraviolet-A (UV-A, 315-400 nm) light intensities during fruit storage. In this study, TiO2 was applied to the fruit storage chamber in the form of TiO2 slurry. The results presented here demonstrated that the presence of TiO2 and UV-A light can remove ethylene gas from the storage atmosphere and extend the ripening time of green tomatoes. The extent of ethylene removal and ripening delay due to the TiO2 photocatalytic reaction depended on the TiO2 concentration and the UV-A light intensity. More than 90% of the ethylene gas was removed when TiO2 was applied at 10 g/Land the UV-A light intensity was 5 W/m2. Reduction of the TiO2 concentration and UV-A light intensity to 0.1 g/L and <0.01 W/m2, respectively, resulted in decreasing ethylene removal capacity. Such conditions also mitigated the observed delay in ripening. The TiO2 photocatalytic reaction also successfully removed acetaldehyde (AA), ethanol (EtOH), and off-flavors (fermented or alcoholic odor) generated in the storage atmosphere from 0 to 8 days of storage. However, toward the end of the storage period, by day 10, when the production of AA and EtOH from tomatoes was higher, the TiO2 treatment was apparently less effective in removing off-flavors. This finding suggests that produce metabolism must be taken into consideration for effective utilization of the TiO2 photocatalytic reaction to improve storage life of fresh fruits and vegetables. 3aethylene 3aoff flavors 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3atitanium dioxide 3acatalysts 3aacetaldehyde 3afruit quality 3aphotochemical reactions 3aripening 3aethanol 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aphotocatalysis 0afood quality 0astorage technology1 aHayata, Y.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 3 p.833-837wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/05/14  aOther US 7aarticle02121naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245006600145300001600211520109700227650002201324650001401346650002101360650001601381650001501397650001201412650001301424650001401437650001801451650002101469650000701490700001801497700001701515700001801532773009301550852000901643930003301652945002501685946001301710655001201723IND4382879620221122110548.0060817e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438287962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBechara, M.A.10aAgaricus bisporus mushroom cultivation in hydroponics systems  ap. 825-832.  aClosed-cycle, open-cycle, and non-circulating hydroponic systems were evaluated for Agaricus bisporus (white button mushroom) cultivation. Sucrose-based and dextrin-based solutions were used as nutrient sources. The yield of mushrooms obtained from the closed-cycle system was 0.11 kg/m2 for sucrose solutions and 0.43 kg/m2 for dextrin solutions. The yield of mushrooms in the open-cycle system with calcium carbonate added for pH control was 1.92 kg/m2 for the sucrose solution, while that of de-ionized water was 0.69 kg/m2. The yields of mushrooms in the open-cycle system with antimicrobial compounds for the sucrose, dextrin, dextrin with peat moss, and de-ionized water were 1.8, 2.3, 2.1, and 1.5 kg/m2, respectively. The non-circulating system, which utilized different concentrations of dextrin (10, 30, and 50 g/L), produced 2.96 kg/m2 in the 30 g/L treatment, which was the highest yield recorded among the hydroponic systems. However, the yield of mushrooms from the non-circulating hydroponic 30 g/L dextrin treatment was lower than the yield of mushroom from compost (8 kg/m2). 3aAgaricus bisporus 3amushrooms 3amushroom growing 3ahydroponics 3acrop yield 3asucrose 3adextrins 3asolutions 3agrowing media 3aactivated carbon 3apH1 aHeinemann, P.1 aWalker, P.N.1 aRomaine, C.P.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2006 , v. 49, no. 3 p.825-832wJournal:2276x2151-00327nnas  aDNAL  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/05/14  aOther US 7aarticle02390naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245009900172300001600271500001900287500002400306520118200330650002201512650000801534650001501542650000901557650002001566650001401586650002001600650001401620650000901634653002301643653002301666653002701689700001901716700002901735700002201764700002001786773010501806852000901911856004801920655001201968IND4393054020221122051356.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439305402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-006-0156-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietramellara, Giacomo10aAdsorption of pure and dirty bacterial DNA on clay minerals and their transformation frequency  ap. 731-739.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aSeveral studies have investigated the adsorption of pure DNA on soil particles and its transformation ability. However, the presence of not purified (dirty) rather than pure DNA is more common in the extracellular soil environment. For this reason, we have investigated the adsorption and binding of dirty DNA on montmorillonite (M) and kaolinite (K) and their transforming ability in comparison to pure DNA. After lysis of Bacillus subtilis cells, induced by KCl, dirty DNA was characterized by the presence of cellular wall debris (cwd) and other constitutional organic components (coc). The dirty DNA was then divided into two fractions, one with cellular wall debris (DNA +cwd) and the other without cellular wall debris (DNA -cwd). B. subtilis BD 1512 (Cmr) and BD 170 (Cms) were selected as donor and recipient bacteria, respectively, for adsorption and transformation studies. Both cwd and coc seem to facilitate the adsorption of DNA to clay minerals, whereas only cwd promote the DNA binding on clays, protecting also the DNA fragments below 400 bp against nucleases. Both dirty DNA fractions adsorbed and bound on clay minerals were able to transform competent cells. 3aBacillus subtilis 3aDNA 3aadsorption 3aclay 3aedaphic factors 3akaolinite 3amontmorillonite 3anucleases 3asoil 0aDNA-clay complexes 0aDirty and pure DNA 0aNatural transformation1 aAscher, Judith1 aCeccherini, Maria Teresa1 aNannipieri, Paolo1 aWenderoth, Dirk0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2007 Aug., v. 43, no. 6 p.731-739dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-006-0156-8 7aarticle02646naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245010200164300001600266500001900282500002400301520135400325650002801679650002501707650002201732650001201754650001401766650002201780650001301802650001401815650004701829650004501876651001001921653002001931653001301951653000801964653000901972700001901981700002002000700001802020773010502038852000902143856004802152655001202200IND4395262520221122041134.0070923e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439526252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-007-0196-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei Tao10aGenetic diversity and phylogeny of indigenous rhizobia from cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.)

Genotype I was composed of 14 isolated strains and the reference strains of B. japonicum and B. liaoningense. This group was divided into two sub-groups respectively related to B. japonicum and B. liaoningense by 16S rRNA sequencing, IGS restriction fragment length polymorphism and RAPD assays. Genotype II composed of 27 isolates from a variety of geographic regions. Four different assays confirmed this group was genetically distinct from B. japonicum and B. liaoningense and probably represent an uncharacterised species. Strains isolated from Hongan, Central China and B. elkanii were grouped to genotype III. Strain DdE4 was solely clustered into genotype IV and related to Rhizobium leguminosarum. Genotypes V and VI consisted of six fast-growing isolates and clustered with reference strain of Sinorhizobium fredii. Comparing with the miscellaneous slow-growing isolates, fast-growing isolates mainly isolated from cowpea cultivar Egang I exhibited strict microbe-host specificity except SjzZ4. 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aSinorhizobium fredii 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3aphylogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aChina 0aCowpea rhizobia 0a16S rRNA 0aIGS 0aRAPD1 aYang, Jiang Ke1 aYuan, Tian Ying1 aZhou, Jun Chu0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2007 Oct., v. 44, no. 1 p.201-210dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-007-0196-8 7aarticle01589naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006300171300001400234500002400248520055900272650002500831650002600856650002000882650001000902650001900912650002300931650000900954650001200963650001000975653002300985653001501008653001701023773012301040852000901163856005501172655001201227IND4431617820221122030517.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443161782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.2009.00552.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMOATSOU, GOLFO10aIndigenous enzymatic activities in ovine and caprine milks  ap. 16-31.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this review paper is the presentation of research findings about enzymes of ovine and caprine milks taking into consideration the bovine milk indigenous enzymatic activities as a reference.

These and other measures will be most efficient when targeted at ships posing the greatest risks. Here, we analyse world‐wide ship movements and port environmental conditions to explore how these risk components differ across arriving ships. Location Global, with a case study of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Methods We gathered salinity and temperature data for all global shipping ports, and data for all global ship movements during a 12 ‐month period. We applied these data to the Laurentian Great Lakes to determine which global ports may donate new species to the Great Lakes via ship traffic, and which are most environmentally similar to the Great Lakes. Results We show that ships regularly travel to the Great Lakes from all major coastal, and many inland, regions of the world. Most global ports, and thus the species in them, are separated from the Great Lakes by no more than two ship voyages. Combined with a measure of environmental similarity among global ports, we identify ship routes likely to transport species adapted for survival in the Great Lakes and global regions that may be the source of increasing future invasions. Main conclusions The Great Lakes account for a small fraction of global shipping yet are closely connected to all other ports, and the species in them, by the shipping network. Our methods and data allow risks from individual ships to be ranked so that management activities can be targeted at ships most likely to introduce new invaders. Because our data sets are global, they could be applied to ship arrivals at any global port. 3aballast water 3acase studies 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3anew species 3arisk 3asalinity 3atemperature 3atraffic1 aDrake, John M.1 aDrew, Mark B.1 aLodge, David M.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2011 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.93-102dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00696.x 7aarticle02774naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001600135245012700151300001600278500001900294500002400313520158800337650001301925650002001938650002601958650001101984650001201995650002102007650002002028650002402048650001702072650001902089650002102108700001902129700002002148700001702168700002002185773011202205852000902317856003802326655001202364IND4458285220221121192747.0110520e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445828522DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.9922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPajares, S.10aEnzyme activity as an indicator of soil quality changes in degraded cultivated Acrisols in the Mexican Trans-volcanic Belt  ap. 373-381.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncludes references  aSoils located at the Mexican Trans-Volcanic Belt (MTB) have a worrying degree of degradation due to inappropriate management practices. Early indicators of soil changes are very useful to alert about negative impacts of wrong managements on these volcanic soils. The aim of this work was to evaluate the short-term effects (4 years) of different agricultural practices on soil organic matter (SOM) quality and to validate the potential of the selected biochemical properties as optimal early indicators of soil quality in Mexican cultivated Acrisols. During 2002-2005 four agronomic management systems: conventional (Tc); improved conventional (Ti); organic (To) and fallow (Tf) were assayed in plots located at the MTB. An uncultivated soil under grass cover (Sg) was used as reference. Soil samples were collected at 0-10 cm depth and were analysed chemically (soil organic C, total N, water-soluble C and humic C), and biochemically (total and extra-cellular enzyme activity). After 4 years, soil organic C, total N, water-soluble C, and dehydrogenase activity had higher values in To, followed by Ti treatment. A similar response pattern was observed in the extra-cellular enzyme activity. The highest total enzyme activity was found in Sg, followed by Ti and To treatments, and the lowest values appeared in Tc and Tf. To and Ti increased SOM contents of the degraded Acrisols studied, while Tc and Tf managements decreased the quality of these soils. The results showed that the assayed soil enzymes can be used as indicators of quality changes of these Mexican volcanic soils. 3aAcrisols 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3afallow 3agrasses 3aland degradation 3aoxidoreductases 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil quality 3atotal nitrogen 3awater solubility1 aGallardo, J.F.1 aMasciandaro, G.1 aCeccanti, B.1 aEtchevers, J.D.0 tLand degradation & development.g2011 May, v. 22, no. 3 p.373-381dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1085-32787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.992 7aarticle03938naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001700149245020500166300001800371520152700389650001901916650001301935650002101948650001701969650002701986650001002013650001802023650002502041650002602066650001402092650003002106650002002136650006002156650004002216650001602256650001602272650002802288650003902316650002402355650003002379650001402409650003902423650004602462650003402508650002202542653002802564653002602592653002102618653002102639653002102660653002102681653002102702653002102723653002102744653002102765653002102786653002102807653002102828653002102849653002102870653002102891653002102912653002102933700001802954700001702972773009902989852000903088930003303097945001303130946001303143655001203156IND2204078020221121121007.0000425e199909  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220407802DNAL7 a104734292pmid7 aPMC997542pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendum, T.A.10aUse of molecular and isotopic techniques to monitor the response of autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing populations of the beta subdivision of the class Proteobacteria in arable soils to nitrogen fertilizer  ap. 4155-4162.  aThis study examined the effects of NH4NO3 fertilizer on the size and activity of nitrifying, autotrophic, ammonia-oxidizing populations of the beta subdivision of the class Proteobacteria in arabic soils. Plots under different long-term fertilizer regimes were sampled before and after NH4NO3 additions, and the rates of nitrification were determined by (15)N isotopic pool dilution assays. Ammonia-oxidizing populations in the plots were quantified by competitive PCR assays based on the amoA and ribosomal 16S genes. Prior to fertilizer addition, ammonium concentrations and nitrification rates in the plots were comparatively low; ammonia-oxidizing populations were present at 10(4) to 10(5) gene copies g of soil(-1). Three days after the application of fertilizer, nitrification rates had risen considerably but the size of the ammonia-oxidizing population was unchanged. Six weeks after fertilizer treatment, ammonium concentrations and nitrification rates had fallen while the ammonia-oxidizing populations in plots receiving fertilizer had increased. The rapidity of the rise in nitrification rates observed after 3 days suggests that it results from phenotypic changes in the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial population. Associated increases in population sizes were only observed after 6 weeks and did not correlate directly with nitrifying activity. Phylogenetic analyses of PCR products from one of the plots revealed a population dominated by Nitrosospira-type organisms, similar to those prevalent in other soils. 3aProteobacteria 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrate 3aarable soils 3afertilizer application 3agenes 3anitrification 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation size 2aBetaproteobacteriaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aFertilizers 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogen Radioisotopesxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidoreductasesxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoil Microbiology 0amolecular sequence data 0aammonia monooxygenase 0agenbank/aj238189 0agenbank/aj238190 0agenbank/aj238191 0agenbank/aj238192 0agenbank/aj238193 0agenbank/aj238194 0agenbank/aj238195 0agenbank/aj238196 0agenbank/aj238197 0agenbank/aj238198 0agenbank/aj238199 0agenbank/aj238200 0agenbank/aj238201 0agenbank/aj238202 0agenbank/aj238203 0agenbank/aj2382051 aSockett, R.E.1 aHirsch, P.R.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Sept., v. 65, no. 9 p.4155-4162x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02974naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001600149245008500165300001800250520119900268650002401467650002201491650002101513650002401534650001301558650001101571650001001582650002201592650002801614650002601642650001601668650001501684650002401699650003301723650002201756650002301778650003001801650002101831650002601852650002801878650004201906650005301948650002802001650004102029653002802070653001902098700001802117700001802135700003102153700002102184773009902205852000902304930003302313945001302346946001302359655001202372IND2205378520221121121022.0000621e199910  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220537852DNAL7 a105080582pmid7 aPMC915762pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibello, A.10aCloning and analysis of the L-lactate utilization genes from Streptococcus iniae  ap. 4346-4350.  aThe presence of lactate oxidase was examined in eight Streptococcus species and some related species of bacteria. A clone (pGR002) was isolated from a genomic library of Streptococcus iniae generated in Escherichia coli, containing a DNA fragment spanning two genes designated lctO and lctP. We show that these genes are likely to be involved in the L-lactic acid aerobic metabolism of this organism. This DNA fragment has been sequenced and characterized. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of LctP protein demonstrated that the protein had significant homology with the L-lactate permeases of other bacteria. The amino acid sequence of the LctO protein of S. iniae also showed a strong homology to L-lactate oxidase from Aerococcus viridans and some NAD-independent lactate dehydrogenases, all belonging to the family of flavin mononucleotide-dependent alpha-hydroxyacid-oxidizing enzymes. Biochemical assays of the gene products confirm the identity of the genes from the isolated DNA fragment and reveal a possible role for the lactate oxidase from S. iniae. This lactate oxidase is discussed in relation to the growth of the organism in response to carbon source availability. 3aAerococcus viridans 3aDNA fragmentation 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptococcus iniae 3abacteria 3acarbon 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3alactate 2-monooxygenase 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactic acid 3ametabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBiotransformation 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aLactic Acidxmetabolism 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aStreptococcusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/y076221 aCollins, M.D.1 aDominguez, L.1 aFernandez-Garayzabal, J.F.1 aRichardson, P.T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Oct., v. 65, no. 10 p.4346-4350x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02238naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001200149245009600161300001800257520084600275650002701121650002701148650002701175650002701202650002901229650001901258650001501277650002401292650001201316650001001328650003901338650003101377650004501408650003001453650004101483650001501524650002401539700002101563700001701584773009901601852000901700930003301709945001301742946001301755655001201768IND2205376220221121121058.0000621e199910  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220537622DNAL7 a105080552pmid7 aPMC915732pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Y.14aThe outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria inhibits antibacterial activity of brochocin-C  ap. 4329-4333.  aBrochocin-C is a two-peptide bacteriocin produced by Brochothrix campestris ATCC 43754 that has a broad activity spectrum comparable to that of nisin. Brochocin-C has an inhibitory effect on EDTA-treated gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide mutants, and spheroplasts of Typhimurium strains LT2 and SL3600. Brochocin-C treatment of cells and spheroplasts of strains of LT2 and SL3600 resulted in hydrolysis of ATP. The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria protects the cytoplasmic membrane from the action of brochocin-C. It appears that brochocin-C is similar to nisin and possibly does not require a membrane receptor for its function; however, the difference in effect of the two bacteriocins on intracellular ATP indicates that they cause different pore sizes in the cytoplasmic membrane. 3aBrochothrix campestris 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantibacterial properties 3acell membranes 3ahydrolysis 3alipopolysaccharides 3amutants 3anisin 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aBacteriocinsxpharmacology 2aCell Membranexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effects 2aHydrolysis 2aNisinxpharmacology1 aVan Belkum, M.J.1 aStiles, M.E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Oct., v. 65, no. 10 p.4329-4333x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03270naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001500149245015700164300001800321520192100339650001502260650001302275650001402288650002002302650001302322650001202335650001302347650002302360650001602383650002002399650001202419650003902431650003102470650002802501650004202529650004002571650002002611700001402631773009902645852000902744930003302753945001302786946001302799655001202812IND2205386520221121091706.0000621e199910  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220538652DNAL7 a105080812pmid7 aPMC915992pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTholen, A.10aLocalization and in situ activities of homoacetogenic bacteria in the highly compartmentalized hindgut of soil-feeding higher termites (Cubitermes spp.)  ap. 4497-4505.  aMethanogenesis and homoacetogenesis occur simultaneously in the hindguts of almost all termites, but the reasons for the apparent predominance of methanogenesis over homoacetogenesis in the hindgut of the humivorous species is not known. We found that in gut homogenates of soil-feeding Cubitermes spp., methanogens outcompete homoacetogens for endogenous reductant. The rates of methanogenesis were always significantly higher than those of reductive acetogenesis, whereas the stimulation of acetogenesis by the addition of exogenous H2 or formate was more pronounced than that of methanogenesis. In a companion paper, we reported that the anterior gut regions of Cubitermes spp. accumulated hydrogen to high partial pressures, whereas H2 was always below the detection limit (<100 Pa) in the posterior hindgut, and that all hindgut compartments turned into efficient H2 sinks when external H2 was provided (D. Schmitt-Wagner and A. Brune, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:4490-4496, 1999). Using a microinjection technique, we found that only the posterior gut sections P3/4a and P4b, which harbored methanogenic activities, formed labeled acetate from H14CO3-. Enumeration of methanogenic and homoacetogenic populations in the different gut sections confirmed the coexistence of both metabolic groups in the same compartments. However, the in situ rates of acetogenesis were strongly hydrogen limited; in the P4b section, no activity was detected unless external H2 was added. Endogenous rates of reductive acetogenesis in isolated guts were about 10-fold lower than the in vivo rates of methanogenesis, but were almost equal when exogenous H2 was supplied. We conclude that the homoacetogenic populations in the posterior hindgut are supported by either substrates other than H2 or by a cross-epithelial H2 transfer from the anterior gut regions, which may create microniches favorable for H2-dependent acetogenesis. 3aCubitermes 3aacetates 3aacetogens 3adetection limit 3aformates 3ahindgut 3ahydrogen 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3areducing agents 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aIntestinesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aIsopteraxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMicroinjections1 aBrune, A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Oct., v. 65, no. 10 p.4497-4505x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02442naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001900149245016100168300001800329520088100347650004001228650002901268650001901297650001601316650001001332650002001342650003101362650001601393650001101409650000701420650002401427650001301451650001901464650001101483650001501494650001701509650005101526650002801577650002801605650002501633700001501658700001501673700001501688700001501703700001501718773009901733852000901832930003301841945001301874946001301887655001201900IND2205389120221121091650.0000621e199910  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220538912DNAL7 a105081112pmid7 aPMC916292pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitamoto, H.K.10aPrevention of aerobic spoilage of maize silage by a genetically modified killer yeast, Kluyveromyces lactis, defective in the ability to grow on lactic acid  ap. 4697-4700.  aIn this study, we propose a new process of adding a genetically modified killer yeast to improve the aerobic stability of silage. Previously constructed Kluyveromyces lactis killer strain PCK27, defective in growth on lactic acid due to disruption of the gene coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a key enzyme for gluconeogenesis, inhibited the growth of Pichia anomala inoculated as an aerobic spoilage yeast and prevented a rise in pH in a model of silage fermentation. This suppressive effect of PCK27 was not only due to growth competition but also due to the killer protein produced. From these results, we concluded that strain PCK27 can be used as an additive to prolong the aerobic stability of maize silage. In the laboratory-scale experiment of maize silage, the addition of a killer yeast changed the yeast flora and significantly reduced aerobic spoilage. 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3acarboxy-lyases 3acorn silage 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3alaboratory experimentation 3alactic acid 3amodels 3apH 3asilage fermentation 3aspoilage 3aspoilage yeast 3ayeasts 2aAerobiosis 2aFermentation 2aKluyveromycesxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aLactic Acidxmetabolism 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aZea maysxmetabolism1 aHasebe, A.1 aOhmomo, S.1 aSuto, E.G.1 aMuraki, M.1 aIimura, Y.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Oct., v. 65, no. 10 p.4697-4700x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02586naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013400127300001800261520139100279650002601670650001201696650002901708650001301737650001701750650001401767650001601781650001601797650002101813650001901834650001401853650001801867650001101885650001301896651001801909653002001927653002101947700001701968773009901985852000902084930003302093945001302126946001302139655001202152IND2205853520221121091646.0000718e199912  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220585352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjjarapu, S.10aFate of pGFP-bearing Escherichia coli Q157:H7 in ground beef at 2 and 10 degrees C and effects of lactate, diacetate, and citrate  ap. 5394-5397.  aAlthough beef has been implicated in the largest outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection in the United States, studies on the fate of this pathogen have been limited. Problems in such studies are associated with detection of the pathogen at levels considerably lower than the levels of the competing microorganisms. In the Present study, a green fluorescent protein-expressing E. coli O157:H7 strain was used, and the stable marker allowed us to monitor the behavior of the pathogen in ground beef stored aerobically from freshness to spoilage at 2 and 10 degrees C. In addition, the effects of sodium salts of lactate (SL) (0.9 and 1.8%), diacetate (SDA) (0.1 and 0.2%), and buffered citrate (SC) (1 and 2%) and combinations of SL and SDA were evaluated. SC had negligible antimicrobial activity, and SL delayed microbial growth, while SDA and SL plus SDA were most inhibitory to the total-aerobe population in the meat. At 2 degrees C, the initial numbers of E. coli O157:H7 (3 and 5 log(10) CFU/g) decreased by approximately log(10) CFU/g when spoilage was manifest (>7 log(10) CFU of total aerobes/g), irrespective of the treatment. There was no decline in the numbers of the pathogen during storage at 10 degrees C. Our results showed that the pathogen was resistant to the salts tested and confirmed that refrigerated meat contaminated with the pathogen remains hazardous. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aaerobes 3aantimicrobial properties 3acitrates 3afluorescence 3afreshness 3aground beef 3alactic acid 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3arefrigeration 3asodium 3aspoilage 3aUnited States 0asodium lactatte 0asodium diacetate1 aShelef, L.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Dec., v. 65, no. 12 p.5394-5397x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03607naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245016000126300001800286520139400304650002701698650003001725650001601755650001801771650001101789650001001800650001401810650002501824650001401849650003001863650001801893650002301911650001001934653002801944653002101972653002101993653002102014653002102035653002102056653002102077653002102098653002102119653002102140653002102161653002102182653002102203653002102224653002102245653002102266653002102287653002102308653002102329653002102350653002102371653002102392653002102413653002102434653002102455653002102476653002102497653002102518653002102539653002102560653002202581700002102603700001802624700001602642773009902658852000902757930003302766945001302799946001302812655001202825IND2205853020221121091744.0000718e199912  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220585302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPryde, S.E.10aMolecular analysis of the microbial diversity present in the colonic wall, colonic lumen, and cecal lumen of a pig.

Sequences were also obtained for cultures isolated anaerobically from the same colonic-wall sample. Phylogenetic analysis showed that many sequences were related to those of Lactobacillus or Streptococcus spp. or fell into clusters IX, XIVa, and XI of gram-positive bacteria. In addition, 59% of randomly cloned sequences showed less than 95% similarity to database entries or sequences from cultivated organisms. Cultivation bias is also suggested by the fact that the majority of isolates (54%) recovered from the colon wall by culturing were related to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus, whereas this group accounted for only one-third of the sequence variation for the same sample from random cloning. The remaining cultured isolates were mainly Selenomonas related. A higher proportion of Lactobacillus reuteri-related sequences than of Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus amylovorus-related sequences were present in the colonic-wall sample. Since the majority of bacterial ribosomal sequences recovered from the colon wall are less than 95% related to known organisms, the roles of many of the predominant wall-associated bacteria remain to be defined. 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aSelenomonas 3aStreptococcus 3aclones 3acolon 3adatabases 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence diversity 3aswine 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/aj241718 0agenbank/aj241719 0agenbank/aj241720 0agenbank/aj241721 0agenbank/aj241722 0agenbank/aj241723 0agenbank/aj241724 0agenbank/aj241725 0agenbank/aj241726 0agenbank/aj241727 0agenbank/aj241728 0agenbank/aj241729 0agenbank/aj241730 0agenbank/aj241731 0agenbank/aj241732 0agenbank/aj241733 0agenbank/aj241734 0agenbank/aj241735 0agenbank/aj241736 0agenbank/aj241737 0agenbank/aj241738 0agenbank/aj241739 0agenbank/aj241740 0agenbank/aj241741 0agenbank/aj241742 0agenbank/aj241743 0agenbank/aj241744 0agenbank/aj241745 0agenbank/aj241746 0agenbank/aj241747+1 aRichardson, A.J.1 aStewart, C.S.1 aFlint, H.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1999 Dec., v. 65, no. 12 p.5372-5377x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03893naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213100002500230245007800255300001800333500001500351520209000366650001602456650001702472650001702489650001402506650001702520650001202537650001702549650002302566650002202589650002002611650001002631650001202641650001802653650002102671650004502692650002002737650001902757650001302776650002302789650001202812650002602824650001702850650003202867651002502899653002102924653001002945700002302955700002802978773007603006852000903082856008303091930003303174945002503207946001103232655001203243IND4429776120221121043853.0091210e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442977612DNAL7 a198015562pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpp0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLinares, Juan Carlos10aPlastic responses of Abies pinsapo xylogenesis to drought and competition  ap. 1525-1536.  a2019-12-04  aRadial growth and xylogenesis were studied to investigate the influence of climate variability and intraspecific competition on secondary growth in Abies pinsapo Boiss., a relic Mediterranean fir. We monitored the responses to three thinning treatments (unthinned control –C–, 30% –T30– and 60% –T60– of basal area removed) to test the hypothesis that they may improve the adaptation capacity of tree growth to climatic stress. We also assessed whether xylogenesis was differentially affected by tree-to-tree competition. Secondary growth was assessed using manual band dendrometers from 2005 to 2007. In 2006, xylogenesis (phases of tracheid formation) was also investigated by taking microcores and performing histological analyses. Seasonal dynamics of radial increment were modeled using Gompertz functions and correlations with microclimate and radiation were performed. Histological analyses revealed it as fundamental to calibrate the dendrometer estimates of radial increment and to establish the actual onset and end dates of tracheid production. The lower radial-increment rates and number of produced tracheids were observed in the trees subjected to high competition in the unthinned plots. The growing season differed among the plots, and its duration ranged from an average of 78 days in unthinned plots to 115 days in thinned ones (T60). Variations in the beginning of the growing season (13 April to 22 May) and earlywood–latewood transition (early August) were mainly determined by the temperature pattern, while the onset and the end of the growing season were related to both annual precipitation and tree-to-tree competition. The tracheid-formation phases of radial enlargement and cell-wall thickening showed similar patterns in the trees from thinned and unthinned plots subjected to low and high competition, respectively, but the mean number of tracheids in each phase was always higher in the trees from the thinned plots. The reduction of competition through thinning induced a longer growing season and enhanced the radial growth in A. pinsapo. 3atree growth 3agrowth rings 3aforest trees 3atracheids 3amicroclimate 3adrought 3awater stress 3aseasonal variation 3aplant competition 3aforest thinning 3awidth 3acambium 3aAbies pinsapo 3aclimatic factors 2aAbiesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aAcclimatization 2aClimate Change 2aDroughts 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 2aStress, Physiological 2aTime Factors 2aXylemxgrowth & development 3aMediterranean region 0aradial increment 0axylem1 aCamarero, J.

  1 aKitaoka, Satoshi14aThe effects of cleared larch canopy and nitrogen supply on gas exchange and leaf traits in deciduous broad-leaved tree seedlings  ap. 1503-1511.  aTo understand the leaf-level responses of successional tree species to forest gap formation and nitrogen deposition, we performed canopy clearing and nitrogen-amendment treatments in larch plantations and investigated the changes in the light-use characteristics and the leaf structure of the invading deciduous broad-leaved tree seedlings. We hypothesized that the responses of the tree seedlings to clearing and nitrogen input would reflect specific traits in the shoot development that would be related to the species-specific successional characteristics. The gap phase species Magnolia hyporeuca Siebold et Zucc. and the mid-late successional tree species Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Ledeb. var. crispula (Blume) Ohashi., which grow in or near the forest gaps, had higher light-saturated photosynthetic rates (Psat), enhanced mesophyll surface area (Smes) and increased leaf mass per area (LMA) under both the clearing treatment and the clearing with nitrogen-amendment treatment. These two species therefore increased their Psat via an increase in Smes and LMA. The LMA values of the late successional tree species Prunus ssiori F. Schmidt and Carpinus cordata Blume, which grow in the forest understory, were enhanced by the clearing treatment. However, they displayed lesser responses to the clearing treatment under which there were no marked increases in Psat or Smes values in the second year. These results indicate distinct and varied responses to disturbance regimes among the four seral tree seedlings. The Psat value largely increased in line with the increase in Smes value during the second year in M. hyporeuca and Q. mongolica. The nitrogen supply accelerated the change in LMA and increased the Smes value in the leaves of Q. mongolica. 3aforest trees 3aecological succession 3aforest canopy 3acanopy gaps 3alight intensity 3aMagnolia obovata 3aQuercus mongolica 3aleaves 3aleaf area 3aplant morphology 3amesophyll 3anitrogen 3afertilizer application 3aplant response 3aplant growth 3agrowth traits 3ashoots 3aatmospheric deposition 3aphotosynthesis 2aAcclimatization 2aEcosystem 2aLarixxphysiology 2aLinear Models 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStress, Physiological 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 0aleaf morphology1 aWatanabe, Yōko.1 aKoike, Takayoshi0 tTree physiology.g2009 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.1503-1511x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpp0803Available from publisher's Web site  a20091214b20100101c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03876naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213100001400230245011900244300001800363520189100381650001902272650001002291650001502301650001502316650002202331650002702353650001302380650001002393650001602403650002602419650002102445650002002466650002002486650005302506650001202559650002802571650004802599650002702647650005902674650003102733650006502764650006602829650000902895653003202904700001502936700001602951700001702967700001702984773007603001852000903077856008303086930003303169945002503202946001103227655001203238IND4429777420221121035025.0091210e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442977742DNAL7 a198409952pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpp0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAli, M.A.10aPinus pinaster seedlings and their fungal symbionts show high plasticity in phosphorus acquisition in acidic soils  ap. 1587-1597.  aYoung seedlings of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Soland in Aït.) were grown in rhizoboxes using intact spodosol soil samples from the southwest of France, in Landes of Gascogne, presenting a large variation of phosphorus (P) availability. Soils were collected from a 93-year-old unfertilized stand and a 13-year-old P. pinaster stand with regular annual fertilization of either only P or P and nitrogen (N). After 6 months of culture in controlled conditions, different morphotypes of ectomycorrhiza (ECM) were used for the measurements of acid phosphatase activity and molecular identification of fungal species using amplification of the ITS region. Total biomass, N and P contents were measured in roots and shoots of plants. Bicarbonate- and NaOH-available inorganic P (Pi), organic P (Po) and ergosterol concentrations were measured in bulk and rhizosphere soil. The results showed that bulk soil from the 93-year-old forest stand presented the highest Po levels, but relatively higher bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels compared to 13-year-old unfertilized stand. Fertilizers significantly increased the concentrations of inorganic P fractions in bulk soil. Ergosterol contents in rhizosphere soil were increased by fertilizer application. The dominant fungal species was Rhizopogon luteolus forming 66.6% of analysed ECM tips. Acid phosphatase activity was highly variable and varied inversely with bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels in the rhizosphere soil. Total P or total N in plants was linearly correlated with total plant biomass, but the slope was steep only between total P and biomass in fertilized soil samples. In spite of high phosphatase activity in ECM tips, P availability remained a limiting nutrient in soil samples from unfertilized stands. Nevertheless young P. pinaster seedlings showed a high plasticity for biomass production at low P availability in soils. 3aPinus pinaster 3atrees 3aphosphorus 3aacid soils 3amycorrhizal fungi 3afertilizer application 3anitrogen 3aroots 3arhizosphere 3anutrient availability 3aacid phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3aseedling growth 2aBasidiomycotaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aBiomass 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aPhosphoric Monoester Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPinusxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSoil 0aectomycorrhizal morphotypes1 aLouche, J.1 aLegname, E.1 aDuchemin, M.1 aPlassard, C.0 tTree physiology.g2009 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.1587-1597x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpp0883Available from publisher's Web site  a20091214b20100101c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle03709naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100002200194245011900216300001800335520178200353650005202135650001802187650002402205650001502229650002302244650002802267650001802295650001002313650001902323650003902342650003302381650001802414650002702432650002202459650004502481650002002526650002302546650003102569650006102600650007202661650002702733653006202760653001702822700002202839700002102861773008802882852000902970856008102979930003303060945002503093946001303118655001203131IND4429984620221121024726.0091214e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442998462DNAL7 a197154272pmid7 a10.1089/fpd.2009.03222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aD'Souza, Doris H.10aReal-Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for the Rapid Detection of Salmonella Using invA Primers  ap. 1097-1106.  aRecent outbreaks of Salmonella linked to fresh produce emphasize the need for rapid detection methods to help control the spread of disease. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can detect the presence of mRNA (shorter half-life than DNA) with greater potential for detecting viable pathogens. The chromosomally located invA gene required for host invasion by Salmonella is widely used for detection of this pathogen by PCR. Detection of Salmonella was undertaken by real-time RT-PCR (rt-RT-PCR) using newly designed invA gene primers to develop a sensitive and specific assay. Salmonella serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis were grown (7.68 log10CFU/mL) in Luria-Bertani broth overnight at 37°C, and RNA was extracted, followed by rt-RT-PCR with and without SYBR green I and agarose gel electrophoresis. All experiments were replicated at least thrice. Detection for both serovars using traditional RT-PCR was lower (approximately 10(5) CFU/mL) than rt-RT-PCR (10(3) CFU/mL) by gel electrophoresis. Melt curve analysis showed melt temperatures at 87.5°C with Ct values from 12 to 15 for up to 10(3)CFU/mL and improved to 10(2)CFU/mL after further optimization. Further, addition of RNA internal amplification control constructed using in vitro transcription with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter, to the RT-PCR assay also gave detection limits of 10(2) CFU/mL. Cross-reactivity was not observed against a panel of 21 non-Salmonella bacteria. Heat-inactivated (autoclaved) Salmonella showed faint or no detection by rt-RT-PCR or gel electrophoresis. This method has potential to be applied for the detection of Salmonella serovars in fresh produce and the simultaneous detection of foodborne viral (RNA viruses) and bacterial pathogens in a multiplex format. 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3amicrobial detection 3aSalmonella 3afood contamination 3abacterial contamination 3amessenger RNA 3agenes 3afood pathogens 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aFood Microbiology 2aFoodborne Diseasesxprevention & control 2aHot Temperature 2aLimit of Detection 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSalmonella entericaxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aTransition Temperature 0areal-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 0ainvA Primers1 aCritzer, Faith J.1 aGolden, David A.0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2009 Nov., v. 6, no. 9 p.1097-1106x1535-31417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2009.03223Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle02642naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211072001700228100001600245245010600261300001800367520098500385650002201370650002601392650001701418650001901435650001601454650001801470650002001488650002501508650001201533650004501545650002701590650006401617650004801681650001101729650003701740650003101777651001801808700001701826773010801843852000901951856008101960930003302041945002502074946001302099655001202112IND4429985220221121024626.0091214e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442998522DNAL7 a196945552pmid7 a10.1089/fpd.2008.02562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Many times, it is implied that most foodborne illnesses originate from food consumed where dishes are prepared to order, such as restaurants or in private homes. The manner in which the question is posed and answered frequently reveals a speculative bias that either favors homemade or foodservice meals as the most common source of foodborne pathogens. Many answers have little or no scientific grounding, while others use data compiled by passive surveillance systems. Current surveillance systems focus on the place where food is consumed rather than the point where food is contaminated. Rather than focusing on the location of consumption—and blaming consumers and others—analysis of the steps leading to foodborne illness should center on the causes of contamination in a complex farm-to-fork food safety system. 3afoodborne illness 3ahome food preparation 3afood service 3afood pathogens 3afood safety 3apublic health 3adisease control 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnimals 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Servicesxclassificationxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFoodborne Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aHumans 2aPopulation Surveillancexmethods 2aSafety Managementxmethods 0aUnited States1 aPowell, D.A.0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2009 Nov., v. 6, no. 9 p.1121-1123wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2008.02563Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle03552naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001800194245014600212300001800358500001500376520169600391650002202087650001902109650002502128650001602153650001902169650002702188650001902215650003502234650002002269650004202289650003702331650005002368650002502418650002402443650001502467650006802482650002602550650001802576653001502594700001802609700002502627700002402652700002702676700002202703773008802725852000902813856008102822930003302903945002502936946001302961655001202974IND4429985620221121001941.0091214e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442998562DNAL7 a196945532pmid7 a10.1089/fpd.2009.02862doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAgoston, Reka10aDifferential Expression of Proteins in Listeria monocytogenes Under Thermotolerance-Inducing, Heat Shock, and Prolonged Heat Shock Conditions  ap. 1133-1140.  a2019-12-04  aListeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen capable of employing stress adaptive responses to evade a variety of stressors including temperature stress. We employed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight analysis to study the differential expression of L. monocytogenes (ATCC 43256) soluble proteins at heat shock (60°C) conditions, prolonged heat shock (60°C for 9 minutes) conditions, and thermotolerance-inducing (48°C for 30 minutes followed by 60°C for 9 minutes) conditions. We compared the proteome of L. monocytogenes under these conditions to the proteome at 37°C. Eighteen proteins were differentially expressed at 60°C (6 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated), 21 proteins were differentially expressed (12 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated) when the cells were exposed to 60°C for 9 minutes, and 20 proteins were differentially expressed (10 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated) when cells were initially exposed to 48°C for 30 minutes before 60°C for 9 minutes. There was one unidentifiable protein with observed molecular weight of 50kDa which was differentially expressed across the three temperature treatments. Thermotolerance-inducing conditions caused the up-regulation of a protein by as much as 12-fold. DnaN, a previously identified stress protein, was up-regulated almost threefold at 60°C. TcsA, a lipoprotein (CD4 T cell–stimulating antigen), and Gap (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase) were selectively expressed under prolonged heat shock conditions suggesting their potential as candidate marker proteins targets for identifying temperature-stressed L. monocytogenes cells. 3aprotein synthesis 3aheat tolerance 3amicrobial physiology 3aheat stress 3afood pathogens 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aheat treatment 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDown-Regulation 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aListeria monocytogenesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProteomexmetabolism 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSolubility 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aStress, Physiological 2aUp-Regulation 0aadaptation1 aSoni, Kamlesh1 aJesudhasan, Palmy R.1 aRussell, William K.1 aMohacsi-Farkas, Csilla1 aPillai, Suresh D.0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2009 Nov., v. 6, no. 9 p.1133-1140x1535-31417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2009.02863Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle03479naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002100163245019800184300001600382500001500398520169200413650000802105650002602113650002102139650002302160650002602183650001502209650001902224650002202243650002302265650002702288650001502315650005002330650004602380650002502426650003402451650003302485650003202518650003602550650001902586650002402605653000902629653003102638653001602669653001602685700002102701700001602722773008302738852000902821930003302830945002502863946001302888655001202901IND4425728920221120230648.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442572892DNAL7 a196103582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKittlaus, Stefan10aNew Approaches for Determination of Glyphosate and Aminomethylphosphonic Acid from Different Tea Samples--Prospects and Limits of Cleanup with Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Titanium Dioxide  ap. 703-714.  a2019-12-04  aGlyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide worldwide. To identify glyphosate and its metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), in the difficult-to-analyze matrix of tea, new methods were developed. The main emphasis was placed on the cleanup procedure. Two different solid-phase extraction methods were tested and evaluated: one with molecularly imprinted polymers, and the other with immobilized titanium dioxide. The optimization was carried out on the basis of aqueous standard solutions and spiked tea extracts. Validated results were presented for pipet tips that contained immobilized titanium dioxide. After the extraction of glyphosate from tea samples using hydrochloric acid (0.1%), glyphosate and AMPA were concentrated on the adsorbent by pipetting up and down several times without changing the tip. The elution was carried out subsequent to a washing step with 5% ammonia. The extract was derivatized with 2,2,2-trifluoroacetic acid and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol and then analyzed by GC with MS detection in the negative chemical ionization mode. Quantification was carried out in the selected-ion monitoring mode based on the m/z ratio of characteristic ions due to the ionization process. For glyphosate m/z = 370 was applied, and m/z = 351 for AMPA. The detection limit was 0.03 mg/kg tea for glyphosate and 0.006 mg/kg tea for AMPA. The recoveries for the tested working range (0.1 to 2.8 mg/kg tea) were low but constant at 14 and 12%, respectively. Altogether, the method presented here can be carried out easily and quickly, and it gives reliable information on the presence of the analytes in a sample. Quantification is also possible using standard addition. 3atea 3aquantitative analysis 3atitanium dioxide 3aherbicide residues 3asecondary metabolites 3aglyphosate 3atea (beverage) 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3asolid phase extraction 2aAdsorption 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aHerbicidesxanalysis 2aMolecular Imprintingxmethods 2aOrganophosphonatesxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSolid Phase Extractionxmethods 2aTeaxchemistry 2aTitaniumxchemistry 0aAMPA 0aaminomethylphosphoric acid 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aLipinski, Jurgen1 aSpeer, Karl0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.703-714x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20090929b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle02721naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001500146245011200161300001600273500001500289520110000304650002601404650001501430650001801445650003701463650003401500650002101534650001901555650002301574650002301597650005801620650001501678650002401693650001301717650001401730650002101744650001501765650002601780650001601806650005001822650002501872651001401897651001501911653001701926653001501943700001601958700001801974773008301992852000902075930003302084945002502117946001302142655001202155IND4425729720221120230815.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442572972DNAL7 a196103662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Shih by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  ap. 773-778.  a2019-12-04  aA high-performance liquid chromatographic technique coupled with photodiode array detection was proposed for the simultaneous determination of 7 flavonoids, i.e., quercetin, kaempferol, 7-hydroxyflavanone, 7-methoxyflavanone, 2',4'-dihydroxychalcone, 2',4'-dihydroxydihydrochalcone, and 7,2'-dihydroxy-3', 4'-dimethoxyisoflavane, in extracts of the plant Ixeridium gracile. Optimum separation was obtained by using a reversed-phase C18 method. Because of the different UV characteristics of these components, 5 detection wavelengths were used for the quantitative analysis. All of the flavonoids showed good linearity (r > 0.9999). The limit of detection and limit of quantitation values for the analytes ranged from 0.06 to 0.46 μg/mL and from 0.18 to 1.48 μg/mL, respectively. The method was validated by evaluating repeatability, precision, stability, and accuracy. Five different extraction and purification procedures were investigated for preparation of the sample solution. The optimized method was applied to the determination of flavonoids in I. gracile and was found to be efficient. 3aquantitative analysis 3akaempferol 3arepeatability 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aOriental traditional medicine 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3achemical structure 3aindigenous species 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aAsteraceae 3adietary supplements 3aaccuracy 3aquercetin 3aherbal medicines 3aflavanones 2aAsteraceaexchemistry 2aCalibration 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 3aEast Asia 3aSouth Asia 0aoptimization 0aflavonoids1 aMa, Xue-Mei1 aShi, Yan-Ping0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.773-778x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20090930b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle02965naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100002100146245017500167300001600342500001500358520133800373650001801711650001201729650002101741650001901762650002801781650001601809650002501825650002301850650002401873650002101897650002001918650002701938650005001965650001802015650002202033650004102055653002102096653002302117653001702140700002102157700002202178700002102200700001902221700002002240773008302260852000902343930003302352945002502385946001302410655001202423IND4425730220221120230620.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442573022DNAL7 a196103702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNinfali, Paolino10aImprovement in Botanical Standardization of Commercial Freeze-Dried Herbal Extracts by Using the Combination of Antioxidant Capacity and Constituent Marker Concentrations  ap. 797-805.  a2019-12-04  aBotanical extracts are standardized to >or=1 marker compounds (MCs). This standardization provides a certain level of quality control, but not complete quality assurance. Thus, industries are looking for other satisfactory systems to improve standardization. This study focuses on the standardization of herbal medicines by combining 2 parameters: the concentration of the MC and antioxidant capacity. Antioxidant capacity was determined with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method and the concentrations of the MCs, by high-performance liquid chromatography. Total phenols were also determined by the Folin-Ciocolteau method. The ORAC values, expressed as μmol Trolox equivalents/100 g (ORAC %), of 12 commercial herbal extracts were related to the ORAC values of the respective pure MCs at the concentrations at which the MCs occur in products (ORAC-MC %). The ORAC %values of 11 extracts were higher than those of the respective MCs and the ratios ORAC-MC %/ORAC %ranged from 0.007 to 0.7, whereas in the case of Olea europaea leaves, the same ratio was 1.36. The ORAC parameters and their ratios, as well as the linear relationship between ORAC-MC %and ORAC %, are described and discussed as tools for improving the standardization of herbal products and detecting modifications due to herb processing and storage. 3afreeze drying 3aphenols 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3afree radical scavengers 3adried herbs 3aantioxidant activity 3aactive ingredients 3adietary supplements 3aherbal medicines 3aquality control 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aFreeze Drying 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxstandards. 0amarker compounds 0abotanical extracts 0aantioxidants1 aGennari, Lorenzo1 aBiagiotti, Enrica1 aCangi, Francesca1 aMattoli, Luisa1 aMaidecchi, Anna0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.797-805x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20090930b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle02516naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245016000180300001600340520074600356650002401102650002401126650002101150650002301171650003401194650002101228650001001249650000901259650002501268650002801293650001701321650003001338650001801368650002001386650004001406650002301446650002901469650003901498650003201537650002401569651001001593700002301603700001801626700001901644700001701663700002201680700001701702700001701719700001501736773008301751852000901834930003301843945002501876946001301901655001201914IND4425729920221120230754.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442572992DNAL7 a196103682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Under optimum conditions, the increased chemiluminescence intensity was proportional to the concentration of phosphamidon in the range of 0.01-1.0 μg/mL and the detection limit was 0.0038 μg/mL (3 sigma). The relative standard deviation was <2% for 0.5 μg/mL phosphamidon (n = 11). The proposed method was applied to the determination of phosphamidon residue in an environmental water sample with satisfactory results. Further study was focused on the mechanism of phosphamidon, and a possible mechanism was proposed. 3awater pollution 3aenvironmental fate 3achemiluminescence 3aquantitative analysis 3amaximum residue limits 3awater analysis 3aphosphamidon 3apesticide residues 3asodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate 3awater 3aenvironmental exposure 2aFresh Waterxanalysis 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aLuminescent Measurementsxmethods 2aLuminolxchemistry 2aPhosphamidonxanalysis 0aorganophosphorus pesticides1 aLiu, Xiaoyu1 aKong, Juan1 aHu, Haoyu1 aSun, Linghui1 aQian, Zhen0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.914-918x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle02795naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245012200163300001600285500001500301520155800316650000901874650002101883650001901904650001201923650003501935650002501970650002601995650001102021650001702032650002102049650002802070650003002098650001802128650001902146650001102165653001002176773008302186852000902269930003302278945002502311946001302336655001202349IND4425730520221120230619.0090909e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442573052DNAL7 a196103812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAziz, Alfred14aThe Glycemic Index: Methodological Aspects Related to the Interpretation of Health Effects and to Regulatory Labeling  ap. 879-887.  a2019-12-04  aThe glycemic index (GI) is an experimental system that classifies carbohydrates (CHO) and CHO-containing foods according to their blood glucose-raising potential. It is based on the glycemic response following the ingestion of a test food containing a defined amount of available CHO relative to that of an equi-carbohydrate portion of either white bread or glucose. The concept has been extended to mixed meals and whole diets where the GI of the meal/diet is expressed as the weighted average of the GI of each food, based on the percentage of the total meal/diet CHO provided by each food. Over the last few decades, a substantial number of epidemiological and interventional studies have reported beneficial associations/effects of lower GI diets across a wide spectrum of pathophysiological conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and certain forms of cancer. This has prompted proponents of the GI to recommend its use for dietary planning and labeling purposes. However, the currently recommended GI methodology is not well standardized and has several flaws, which brings into question the strength of evidence attributed to the health effects of low-GI diets. This review focuses exclusively on the methodological aspects of the GI, how they might impact the interpretation of data related to the purported health benefits of low GI diets, and the considerations for the use of the GI in food labeling. In addition, alternative systems for classifying the glycemic effects of CHO-containing foods are briefly discussed. 3adiet 3anutrient content 3aglycemic index 3aglucose 3apercentage ingredient labeling 3acarbohydrate content 3anutrition information 3abreads 3ameals (menu) 2aArea Under Curve 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Specimen Collection 2aFood Labeling 2aGlycemic Index 2aHumans 0afoods0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2009 , v. 92, no. 3 p.879-887x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20090930b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle03316naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002400149245012900173300001600302520143900318650002801757650002901785650002401814650001601838650001501854650001301869650001501882650002401897650001801921650002201939650001101961650002401972650001101996650002602007650003702033650002502070650004502095650002602140650001502166650002402181650004702205650001502252650005702267650003902324650002302363650006102386700002202447700001802469700001802487700001502505700001802520773009602538852000902634930003302643945001302676946001302689655001202702IND2056890920221120230719.0970505e199702  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205689092DNAL7 a90239392pmid7 aPMC1683512pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaart, J.M. van der10aComparison of cell wall proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as anchors for cell surface expression of heterologous proteins  ap. 615-620.  aThe carboxyl-terminal regions of five cell wall proteins (Cwp1p, Cwp2p, Ag alpha 1p, Tip1p, and Flo1p) and three potential cell wall proteins (Sed1p, YCR89w, and Tir1p) all proved capable of immobilizing alpha-galactosidase in the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The fraction of the total amount of fusion protein that was localized to the cell wall varied depending on the anchor domain used. The highest proportion of cell wall incorporation was achieved with Cwp2p Ag alpha 1p, or Sed1p as an anchor. Although 80% of these fusion proteins were incorporated in the cell wall, the total production of alpha-galactosidase-Ag alpha 1p was sixfold lower than that of alpha-galactosidase-Cwp2p and eightfold lower than that of alpha-galactosidase-Sed1p. Differences in mRNA levels were not responsible for this discrepancy, nor was an intracellular accumulation of alpha-galactosidase-Ag alpha 1p detectable. A lower translation efficiency of the alpha-galactosidase-AG alpha 1 fusion construct is most likely to be responsible for the low level of protein production. alpha-Galactosidase immobilized by the carboxyl-terminal 67 amino acids of Cwp2p was most effective in the hydrolysis of the high-molecular-weight substrate guar gum from Cyamopsis tetragonoloba. This indicates that the use of a large anchoring domain does not necessarily result in a better exposure of the immobilized enzyme to the exterior of the yeast cell. 3aCyamopsis tetragonoloba 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalpha-galactosidase 3aamino acids 3acell walls 3aguar gum 3ahydrolysis 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3asilver 3astructural proteins 3ayeasts 2aCell Compartmentation 2aCell Wallxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnzymes, Immobilized 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGalactansxmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aMannansxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlant Gums 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSurface Properties 2aalpha-Galactosidasexbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aBiesebeke, R. te.1 aChapman, J.W.1 aToschka, H.Y.1 aKlis, F.M.1 aVerrips, C.T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Feb., v. 63, no. 2 p.615-620x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02030naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245014900164300001600313520055800329650002700887650004300914650002700957650002300984650002201007650003501029650003201064650002401096650004901120650002601169650003101195650005501226650001801281700001601299700001301315700001401328700001501342700002101357700001801378773009601396852000901492930003301501945001301534946001301547655001201560IND2056898420221120230708.0970505e199702  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205689842DNAL7 a90239532pmid7 aPMC1683652pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteele, M.10aAnalysis of whole-cell fatty acid profiles of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis with the microbial identification system  ap. 757-760.  aDifferentiation of strains within bacterial species, based on gas chromatographic analysis of whole-cell fatty acid profiles, was assessed with 115 strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli and 315 strains of Salmonella enteritidis.

An agar smear technique was developed for enumerating oocysts in soil and barnyard sediment samples. Enhanced counting efficiency and sensitivity (detection limit, 5.2 X 10(2) oocysts . g [dry weight]-1) were achieved by using a semiautomatic counting procedure and confocal laser scanning microscopy to enumerate immunostained oocysts and fragments of oocysts in the barnyard sediment. An agarose-acridine orange mounting procedure was developed for high-resolution confocal optical sectioning of oocysts in soil. Stereo images of serial optical sections revealed the three-dimensional spatial relationships between immunostained oocysts and the acridine orange-stained soil matrix material. In these hydrated, pyrophosphate-dispersed soil preparations, oocysts were not found to be attached to soil particles. A fluorogenic dye permeability assay for oocyst viability (A. T. Campbell, L. J. Robertson, and H. V. Smith, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:3488-3493, 1992) was modified by adding an immunostaining step after application of the fluorogenic dyes propidium iodide and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Comparison of conventional color epifluorescence and differential interference contrast images on one video monitor with comparable black-and-white laser-scanned confocal images on a second monitor allowed for efficient location and interpretation of fluorescently stained oocysts in the soil matrix. This multi-imaging procedure facilitated the interpretation of the viability assay results by overcoming the uncertainties caused by matrix interference and background fluorescence. 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aagar 3aagricultural soils 3acalves 3acolor 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adetection limit 3afeces 3afluorescence 3aoocysts 3apermeability 3apropidium 3asediments 3auncertainty 3aviability 3aviability assays1 aGhiorse, W.C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Feb., v. 63, no. 2 p.724-733x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02686naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012700129300001600256520160800272650001901880650001101899650001301910650001301923650001201936650004001948650003601988650001802024650001802042650002902060650002202089650001902111700001802130773009602148852000902244930003302253945001302286946001302299655001202312IND2056894320221120230756.0970505e199702  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205689432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, J.E.10aTransformation yields of chlorinated ethenes by a methanotrophic mixed culture expressing particulate methane monoxygenase  ap. 687-693.  aTransformation yields for the aerobic cometabolic degradation of five chlorinated ethenes were determined by using a methanotrophic mixed culture expressing particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). Transformation yields (expressed as moles of chlorinated ethene degraded per mole of methane consumed) were 0.57, 0.25, 0.058, 0.0019, and 0.00022 for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (t-DCE), vinyl chloride (VC), cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (c-DCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), and 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE), respectively. Degradation of t-DCE and VC was observed only in the presence of formate or methane, sources of reducing energy necessary for cometabolism. The t-DCE and VC transformation yields represented 35 and 15%, respectively, of the theoretical maximum yields, based on reducing-energy availability from methane dissimilation to carbon dioxide, exclusive of all other processes that require reducing energy. The yields for t-DCE and VC were 20 times greater than the yields reported by others for cells expressing soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO). Transformation yields for c-DCE, TCE, and 1,1-DCE were similar to or less than those for cultures expressing sMMO. Although methanotrophic biotreatment systems have typically been designed to incorporate cultures expressing sMMO, these results suggest that pMMO expression may be highly advantageous for degradation of t-DCE or VC. It may also be much easier to maintain pMMO expression in treatment systems, because pMMO is expressed by all methanotrophs whereas sMMO is expressed only by type II methanotrophs under copper-limited conditions. 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aethylene 3aformates 3amethane 3amethane monooxygenase (particulate) 3amethane monooxygenase (soluble) 3amethanotrophs 3amixed culture 3aorganochlorine compounds 3atrichloroethylene 3avinyl chloride1 aMcCarty, P.L.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Feb., v. 63, no. 2 p.687-693x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle01367naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009000144300001600234520039100250650002400641650001300665650001200678650002000690650001300710650001600723650001100739650001300750650001400763650001600777650002100793700001500814773009600829852000900925930003300934945001300967946001300980655001200993IND2056899820221120230656.0970505e199702  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205689982DNAL7 a165355262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBockle, B.10aReduction of disulfide bonds by Streptomyces pactum during growth on chicken feathers  ap. 790-792.  aFor disintegration of chicken feathers by Streptomyces pactum keratinolytic proteinases and extracellular reduction of disulfide bonds were necessary.

The locus is present in race I isolates but absent from isolates of the other races, which do not produce the toxin. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern analysis with HTS1 sequences and chromosome-specific markers, the HTS1 gene was detected on a 4-Mb chromosome in one group of isolates and on a 2.3-Mb chromosome in another group, which lacked the 4-Mb chromosome. A chromosome-specific marker from C. heterostrophus hybridized to a 2.3-Mb chromosome in non-toxin-producing isolates and in toxin-producing isolates, including those with a 4-Mb chromosome. A marker from C. carbonum hybridized to the 4-Mb chromosome, but in isolates lacking the 4-Mb chromosome, this marker hybridized to a smaller, 2.0-Mb chromosome. Thus, the Tox2 locus is on different chromosomes in different groups of race 1 isolates. Single ascospore progeny from crosses between isolates having HTS1 on different chromosomes were analyzed for toxin-producing ability, virulence, and the presence and chromosomal location of HTS1. All progeny produced HC toxin in culture, incited race 1-type lesions on susceptible maize genotypes, and contained HTS1 sequences, as determined by PCR amplification with gene-specific primers. Analysis of the chromosomal complements of several progeny indicated that they all had only one Tox2-containing chromosome. Thus, despite their differences in size, these chromosomes behave as homologs during meiosis and may have arisen by a translocation. 3aBipolaris maydis 3aBipolaris zeicola 3aascospores 3achromosome number 3achromosome translocation 3acorn 3acrossing 3afungi 3agenes 3agenotype 3aloci 3ameiosis 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3araces 3avirulence1 aDunkle, L.D.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.996-1001x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02590naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245014800165300001600313520138000329650001801709650002801727650001301755650001001768650001401778650002101792650001101813650002801824650005201852650003501904650001301939650003201952650001401984700001801998773009602016852000902112930003302121945001302154946001302167655001202180IND2057467620221120230626.0970604e199703  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205746762DNAL7 a90554142pmid7 aPMC1683882pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForst, S.A.10aRole of the histidine kinase, envZ, in the production of outer membrane proteins in the symbiotic-pathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophilus  ap. 962-968.  aWe show that inactivation of envZ, the gene encoding the histidine kinase sensor protein, EnvZ, of Xenorhabdus nematophilus, affected the production of several outer membrane proteins (Opns). X. nematophilus produced five major Opns during exponential growth. Insertional inactivation of envZ led to a decrease in the production of OpnP, the OmpF-like pore-forming protein which constitutes approximately 50% of the total outer membrane protein in X. nematophilus. OpnA production was also reduced, while the remaining Opns were produced normally. During the transition to stationary phase, three new outer membrane proteins, OpnB, OpnS, and OpnX, were induced in the wild-type strain. The envZ-minus strain, ANTI, did not produce OpnB and OpnX, while OpnS was induced at markedly reduced levels. These results suggest that EnvZ was required for the high-level production of OpnP during exponential growth and may be involved in the production of OpnB, OpnS, and OpnX during stationary-phase growth. We also show that ANT1 was more pathogenic than the wild-type strain when as few as five cells were injected into the hemolymph of the larval stage of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta). The larvae died before significant numbers of bacteria were detectable in the hemolymph. These results are discussed in relation to the role of EnvZ in the life cycle of X. nematophilus. 3aManduca sexta 3aXenorhabdus nematophila 3abacteria 3agenes 3ahemolymph 3ahistidine kinase 3alarvae 3aouter membrane proteins 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aEnterobacteriaceaexenzymology 2aPlasmids 2aProtein Kinasesxphysiology 2aSymbiosis1 aTabatabai, N.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Mar., v. 63, no. 3 p.962-968x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02204naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245017500145300001800320520111300338650002301451650001501474650000901489650002501498650001801523650002301541650001601564650001901580650001801599700001601617700001401633700001701647773009801664852000901762930003301771945001301804946001301817655001201830IND2057468420221120220702.0970604e199703  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205746842DNAL7 a165355392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGqaleni, N.10aEffects of temperature, water activity, and incubation time on production of aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid by an isolate of Aspergillus flavus in surface agar culture  ap. 1048-1053.  aAn experiment with a full factorial design was used to study the effects of and interactions among temperature, water activity (aw), incubation period, and substrate on coproduction of aflatoxins (AF) and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) by an isolate of Aspergillus flavus.

The CFA composition of B. sphaericus 2362, isolated from a microbial larvicide, and those of B. sphaericus reference strains obtained from public collections were also determined. Samples were grouped by hierarchical cluster analysis based on the unpaired-group method using arithmetic averages. Samples that linked at a Euclidean distance of less than or equal to 2.0 U were considered to belong to the same strain. NCTC 11025 and the type strain of B. sphaericus, ATCC 14577, were mixed; all other isolates were monotypic. The predominant fatty acid in NCTC 11025 was 12-methyltetradecanoic acid, while the predominant fatty acid in the remaining isolates was 13-methyltetradecanoic acid. NCTC 11025 linked to the other isolates at a Euclidean distance of 83.8 U, and we concluded that it belongs to a different species that we could not identify. We could distinguish among six DNA homology groups of B. sphaericus by using fatty acids. Within DNA homology group IIA, strain 2362 could be distinguished from other strains belonging to serotype H5a, 5b.

Seventy-five of these isolates were further subtyped by restriction analysis of genomic DNA with the enzyme XhoI and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using the enzymes ApaI and SmaI. The results show that several L. monocytogenes clones identified by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis are frequently found in fish products of different origins. One of these clones is the same as another previously shown to be frequently associated with meat and meat products. The epidemic-associated electrophoretic type 1 was only rarely found in fish products. No association was found between any type of fish product and a particular lineage of L. monocytogenes. Both long-term persistence of a strain and simultaneous presence of several clearly distinct strains in the products of single producers were observed. The comparison of L. monocytogenes isolates from human clinical listeriosis cases in Switzerland and those from imported fish products by use of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis showed that they do not form two clearly distinct lineages but nevertheless belong to two separate populations. None of the 48 subtypes distinguished by the combination of all four typing methods could be found in both populations of human origin and those of fish origin. 3aDNA 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aclones 3aenzymes 3afish 3afish products 3ahumans 3alisteriosis 3ameat 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aFishesxmicrobiology 2aFood Microbiology 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aListeria monocytogenesxclassification 2aListeriosisxmicrobiology 3aSwitzerland1 aBoerlin-Petzold, F.1 aBannerman, E.1 aBille, J.1 aJemmi, T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Apr., v. 63, no. 4 p.1338-1343x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02968naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245008900163300001800252520160600270650002301876650001101899650001501910650001401925650001701939650002801956650001801984650001002002650002002012650001002032650001202042650001302054650001202067650001802079650001302097650001302110650002402123650003902147650001802186650002602204700001802230700001702248700001902265773009802284852000902382930003302391945001302424946001302437655001202450IND2058080720221120220642.0970628e199704  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205808072DNAL7 a90974272pmid7 aPMC1684242pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlmen, M.10aRegulation of cellulase gene expression in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei  ap. 1298-1306.  aBasic features of regulation of expression of the genes encoding the cellulases of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei QM9414, the genes cbh1 and cbh2 encoding cellobiohydrolases and the genes egl1, egl2 and egl5 encoding endoglucanases, were studied at the mRNA level. The cellulase genes were coordinately expressed under all conditions studied, with the steady-state mRNA levels of cbh1 being the highest. Solka floc cellulose and the disaccharide sophorose induced expression to almost the same level. Moderate expression was observed when cellobiose or lactose was used as the carbon source. It was found that glycerol and sorbitol do not promote expression but, unlike glucose, do not inhibit it either, because the addition of 1 to 2 mM sophorose to glycerol or sorbitol cultures provokes high cellulase expression levels. These carbon sources thus provide a useful means to study cellulase regulation without significantly affecting the growth of the fungus. RNA slot blot experiments showed that no expression could be observed on glucose-containing medium and that high glucose levels abolish the inducing effect of sophorose. The results clearly show that distinct and clear-cut mechanisms of induction and glucose repression regulate cellulase expression in an actively growing fungus. However, derepression of cellulase expression occurs without apparent addition of an inducer once glucose has been depleted from the medium. This expression seems not to arise simply from starvation, since the lack of carbon or nitrogen as such is not sufficient to trigger significant expression. 3aTrichoderma reesei 3acarbon 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3aclearcutting 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afungal growth 3afungi 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3alactose 3amessenger RNA 3anitrogen 3asorbitol 2aCellulasexgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aTrichodermaxgenetics1 aSaloheimo, A.1 aOnnela, M.L.1 aPenttila, M.E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Apr., v. 63, no. 4 p.1298-1306x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle03477naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002000149245025300169300001600422520166600438650002702104650003002131650001602161650002102177650001702198650001902215650001902234650001302253650001302266650002502279650001302304650002102317650001302338650003902351650001602390650004102406650002402447650002602471650001202497650004302509650004802552650003202600650002802632650002402660650002302684650002202707700001802729773009602747852000902843930003302852945001302885946001302898655001202911IND2056888120221120205749.0970505e199702  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205688812DNAL7 a90239202pmid7 aPMC1683322pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalmokoff, M.L.10aIsolation and characterization of a bacteriocin (Butyrivibriocin AR10) from the ruminal anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens AR10: evidence in support of the widespread occurrence of bacteriocin-like activity among ruminal isolates of B. fibrisolvens  ap. 394-402.  aForty-nine isolates of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and a single isolate of Butyrivibrio crossotus were screened for the production of inhibitors by a deferred plating procedure. Twenty-five isolates produced factors which, to various degrees, inhibited the growth of the other Butyrivibrio isolates. None of the inhibitory activity was due to bacteriophages. The inhibitory products from 18 of the producing strains were sensitive to protease digestion. Differences in the ranges of activity among the Butyrivibrio isolates and protease sensitivity profiles suggest that a number of different inhibitory compounds are produced. These findings suggest that the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitors may be a widespread characteristic throughout the genus Butyrivibrio. The bacteriocin-like activity from one isolate, B. fibrisolvens AR10, was purified and confirmed to reside in a single peptide. Crude bacteriocin extracts were prepared by ammonium sulfate and methanol precipitation of spent culture supernatants, followed by dialysis and high-speed centrifugation. The active component was isolated from the semicrude extract by reverse-phase chromatography. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that the peptide was purified to homogeneity, having an estimated molecular mass of approximately 4,000 Da. The N terminus of the peptide was blocked. A cyanogen bromide cleavage fragment of the native peptide yielded a sequence of 20 amino acids [(M)GIQLAPAXYQDIVNXVA AG]. No homology with previously reported bacteriocins was found. Butyrivibriocin AR10 represents the first bacteriocin isolated from a ruminal anaerobe. 3aButyrivibrio crossotus 3aButyrivibrio fibrisolvens 3aamino acids 3aammonium sulfate 3abacteriocins 3abacteriophages 3acentrifugation 3acyanogen 3adialysis 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteinases 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBacteriocinsxisolation & purification 2aGram-Negative Anaerobic Bacteriaxchemistry 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRumenxmicrobiology 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis1 aTeather, R.M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1997 Feb., v. 63, no. 2 p.394-402x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdRF1  aOther US 7aarticle02687naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245012300168300001400291520152400305653002301829653002501852653001201877653002801889653002301917653002501940653001201965653002801977700002202005700001802027700002202045773011302067852000902180856009202189930003302281946001102314655001202325IND4413636820221120200015.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441363682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01935.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedirko, N.10aRegulation of early response genes in pancreatic acinar cells: external calcium and nuclear calcium signalling aspects  ap. 51-60.  aNuclear calcium signalling has been an important topic of investigation for many years and some aspects have been the subject of debate. Our data from isolated nuclei suggest that the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are open even after depletion of the Ca²⁺ store in the nuclear envelope (NE). The NE contains ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and Ins(1,4,5)P₃ receptors [Ins(1,4,5)P₃Rs], most likely on both sides of the NE and these can be activated separately and independently: the RyRs by either NAADP or cADPR, and the Ins(1,4,5)P₃Rs by Ins(1,4,5)P₃. We have also investigated the possible consequences of nuclear calcium signals: the role of Ca²⁺ in the regulation of immediate early genes (IEG): c-fos, c-myc and c-jun in pancreatic acinar cells. Stimulation with Ca²⁺-mobilizing agonists induced significant increases in levels of expression. Cholecystokinin (CCK) (10 n m) evoked a substantial rise in the expression levels, highly dependent on external Ca²⁺: the IEG expression level was lowest in Ca²⁺-free solution, increased at the physiological level of 1 m m [Ca²⁺]o and was maximal at 10 m m [Ca²⁺]o, i.e.: 102 ± 22% and 163 ± 15% for c-fos; c-myc -73 ± 13% and 106 ± 24%; c-jun -49 ± 8% and 59 ± 9% at 1 and 10 m m of extracellular Ca²⁺ respectively. A low CCK concentration (10 p m) induced a small increase in expression. We conclude that extracellular Ca²⁺ together with nuclear Ca²⁺ signals induced by CCK play important roles in the induction of IEG expression. 0acalcium signalling 0aearly response genes 0anuclear 0apancreatic acinar cells 0acalcium signalling 0aearly response genes 0anuclear 0apancreatic acinar cells1 aGerasimenko, J.V.1 aTepikin, A.V.1 aGerasimenko, O.V.0 tActa physiologica.g2009 Jan., v. 195, no. 1 p.51-60dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1748-17087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-1716.2008.01935.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090501b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02939naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001900193245008000212300001800292520152800310650001401838650001401852650003001866650001801896650003301914650001501947650001101962650003901973653001302012653001602025653003402041653000902075700002902084700001502113700001802128700002202146700002202168700002802190773010602218852000902324856009202333930003302425946001102458655001202469IND4412800120221120190025.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441280012DNAL7 a187859942pmid7 aPMC26826222pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00830.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrecktrah, Dan10aDynamic Behavior of Salmonella-Induced Membrane Tubules in Epithelial Cells  ap. 2117-2129.  aSalmonella Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes acute gastroenteritis in man. Intracellular Salmonella survive and replicate within a modified phagosome known as the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). The onset of intracellular replication is accompanied by the appearance of membrane tubules, called Salmonella-induced filaments (Sifs), extending from the SCV. Sifs are enriched in late endosomal/lysosomal membrane proteins such as lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, but their formation and ability to interact with endosomal compartments are not characterized. In this study, we use live cell imaging techniques to define the dynamics of Sif formation in infected epithelial cells. At early time-points, Sifs are simple tubules extending from the surface of SCVs. These tubules are highly dynamic and exhibit bidirectional, microtubule-dependent movement. At the distal ends of individual Sif tubules, furthest from the SCV, a distinct 'leader' domain was often observed. At later times, Sifs develop into highly complex tubular networks that extend throughout the cell and appear less dynamic than nascent Sifs; however, individual tubules continue to display bidirectional dynamics. Sifs can acquire endocytic content by fusion, indicating a sustained interaction with the endocytic pathway. Together, these results show that these Salmonella-induced tubules form a highly dynamic network that involves both microtubule-dependent motility and interactions with endosomal compartments. 3aendosomes 3alysosomes 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCell Survival 2aEpithelial Cellsxmetabolism 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxphysiology 0aconfocal 0amicrotubule 0aSalmonella-containing vacuole 0aSifs1 aLevine-Wilkinson, Seamus1 aDam, Tapen1 aWinfree, Seth1 aKnodler, Leigh A.1 aSchroer, Trina A.1 aSteele-Mortimer, Olivia0 tTraffic.g2008 Dec., v. 9, no. 12 p.2117-2129dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00830.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03533naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245018400190300001600374520151600390650001601906650001001922650001101932650002901943650001201972650001401984650001401998650002102012650000902033650001502042650005102057650002802108650003802136650001702174650006202191650001302253650005502266650001402321650006202335650004202397650002702439653001502466653001802481653002002499653003202519653001402551700002002565700002002585700002202605700001802627700001902645773011002664852000902774856009202783930003302875946001102908655001202919IND4414095720221120180554.0081226e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441409572DNAL7 a187784052pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03670.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Yutaka.10aTwo short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice  ap. 120-131.  aYellowing, which is related to the degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-protein complexes, is a notable phenomenon during leaf senescence. NON-YELLOW COLORING1 (NYC1) in rice encodes a membrane-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) that is thought to represent a chlorophyll b reductase necessary for catalyzing the first step of chlorophyll b degradation. Analysis of the nyc1 mutant, which shows the stay-green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light-harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed the existence of NYC1-LIKE (NOL) as the most closely related protein to NYC1. In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay-green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i.e. the degradation of chlorophyll b was severely inhibited and light-harvesting complex II was selectively retained during senescence, resulting in the retention of thylakoid grana even at a late stage of senescence. The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation. NOL was localized on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane despite the lack of a transmembrane domain. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro. These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice. 3achlorophyll 3agrana 3aleaves 3alight harvesting complex 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aprecipitin tests 3arice 3athylakoids 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aOryzaxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aThylakoidsxmetabolism 0astay-green 0aChl breakdown 0aOryza sativa L. 0alight-harvesting complex II 0athylakoid1 aMorita, Ryouhei1 aKatsuma, Susumu1 aNishimura, Minoru1 aTanaka, Ayumi1 aKusaba, Makoto0 tPlant journal.g2009 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.120-131dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03670.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081226b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02355naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245012700171300001800298500002800316520136500344650002601709653001501735653001201750653001201762653001701774700001901791773013101810852000901941856009201950946001102042655001202053IND4410389620221120180741.0080919s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441038962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03851.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCawthorn, D.-M10aSelective PCR detection of viable Enterobacter sakazakii cells utilizing propidium monoazide or ethidium bromide monoazide  ap. 1178-1185.  aPublisher supplied data  aThe detection of viable Enterobacter sakazakii cells is important due to the association of this pathogen with outbreaks of life-threatening neonatal infections. The aim of this study was to optimize a PCR-based method for selective detection of only viable Ent. sakazakii cells in the presence of dead cells, utilizing propidium monoazide (PMA) or ethidium bromide monoazide (EMA). PMA or EMA was added to suspensions of viable and/or dead Ent. sakazakii cells at varying concentrations (10, 50 or 100 μg ml⁻¹) prior to DNA isolation and PCR with Ent. sakazakii-specific primers. At concentrations of 50 and 100 μg ml⁻¹, PMA completely inhibited PCR amplification from dead cells, while causing no significant inhibition of the amplification from viable cells. PMA was also effective in allowing selective PCR detection of only viable cells in mixtures of varying ratios of viable and dead cells. EMA was equally effective in preventing amplification from dead cells, however, it also inhibited DNA amplification from viable cells. This study demonstrated the efficiency of PMA for viable and dead differentiation of Ent. sakazakii, as well as the lack of selectivity of EMA for this purpose. PMA-PCR, in particular, will be useful for monitoring the resistance, survival strategies and stress responses of Ent. sakazakii in foods and the environment. 3aCronobacter sakazakii 0adead cells 0aEMA-PCR 0aPMA-PCR 0aviable cells1 aWitthuhn, R.C.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2008 Oct., v. 105, no. 4 p.1178-1185dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03851.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle04316naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245014800173300001400321520247600335650001402811650001402825650003002839650002002869650002002889650001202909650001902921650003002940650001102970650002602981650001403007650002403021650001203045650001203057650001103069650001703080650001903097650001503116650001303131650001603144650001403160650000903174653001903183653001703202653001703219653002103236653003103257653002003288653002003308653003003328653003403358700002003392700002003412773011303432852000903545856009203554930003303646946001103679655001203690IND4413602220221120180609.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441360222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01449.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCherry, Julia A.10aElevated CO₂ enhances biological contributions to elevation change in coastal wetlands by offsetting stressors associated with sea-level rise  ap. 67-77.  a1. Sea-level rise, one indirect consequence of increasing atmospheric CO₂, poses a major challenge to long-term stability of coastal wetlands. An important question is whether direct effects of elevated CO₂ on the capacity of marsh plants to accrete organic material and to maintain surface elevations outweigh indirect negative effects of stressors associated with sea-level rise (salinity and flooding). 2. In this study, we used a mesocosm approach to examine potential direct and indirect effects of atmospheric CO₂ concentration, salinity and flooding on elevation change in a brackish marsh community dominated by a C₃ species, Schoenoplectus americanus, and a C₄ grass, Spartina patens. This experimental design permitted identification of mechanisms and their role in controlling elevation change, and the development of models that can be tested in the field. 3. To test hypotheses related to CO₂ and sea-level rise, we used conventional anova procedures in conjunction with structural equation modelling (SEM). SEM explained 78% of the variability in elevation change and showed the direct, positive effect of S. americanus production on elevation. The SEM indicated that C₃ plant response was influenced by interactive effects between CO₂ and salinity on plant growth, not a direct CO₂ fertilization effect. Elevated CO₂ ameliorated negative effects of salinity on S. americanus and enhanced biomass contribution to elevation. 4. The positive relationship between S. americanus production and elevation change can be explained by shoot-base expansion under elevated CO₂ conditions, which led to vertical soil displacement. While the response of this species may differ under other environmental conditions, shoot-base expansion and the general contribution of C₃ plant production to elevation change may be an important mechanism contributing to soil expansion and elevation gain in other coastal wetlands. 5. Synthesis. Our results revealed previously unrecognized interactions and mechanisms contributing to marsh elevation change, including amelioration of salt stress by elevated CO₂ and the importance of plant production and shoot-base expansion for elevation gain. Identification of biological processes contributing to elevation change is an important first step in developing comprehensive models that permit more accurate predictions of whether coastal marshes will persist with continued sea-level rise or become submerged. 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aSchoenoplectus americanus 3aSpartina patens 3aadverse effects 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3aequations 3aexperimental design 3agrasses 3amarshes 3amodels 3aplant growth 3aplant response 3aprediction 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asea level 3asoil 0abrackish marsh 0aC₃ species 0aC₄ species 0aelevation change 0aelevated atmospheric CO₂ 0aflooding stress 0asalinity stress 0aSchoenoplectus americanus 0astructural equation modelling1 aMcKee, Karen L.1 aGrace, James B.0 tJournal of ecology.g2009 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.67-77dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01449.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02217naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245012000144300001600264500009300280500001500373520043900388650004400827650001000871650001400881650003600895650001700931650001900948650002200967650002200989650001501011650001601026650002301042650008601065650003201151650003701183650005901220650001101279650006101290650002201351650002401373650002201397650002101419650001001440650002601450651001101476653001301487700001301500773007201513852000901585930003301594945001301627946001101640655001201651IND2200995320221120150207.0991008e199903  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220099532DNAL7 a102328842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavez, D.10aPurpuracenin: a new cytotoxic adjacent bis-tetrahydrofuran annonaceous acetogenin from the seeds of Annona purpurea  ap. 823-828.  aPart 36 in the series "Chemical Studies on Mexican Plants Used in Traditional Medicine".  a2019-12-05  aPurpuracenin, a novel cytotoxic acetogenin and annoglaucin, a known compound, were isolated from the seeds of Annona purpurea.

Freezing injury was less in cold-acclimated leaves than in control leaves. In cold-acclimated leaves, the freezing injury increased when apoplastic solution is extracted. In addition, ice nucleation activity was lower with apoplastic proteins extracted from cold-acclimated leaves than from control leaves. These results suggest that the proteins present in the apoplast during cold acclimation are an important component of the mechanism by which cabbage and winter wheat leaves inhibit extracellular ice formation. Winter wheat has greater freezing tolerance than cabbage because winter wheat leaves have lower freezing injury and apoplastic proteins in winter wheat leaves have lower ice nucleation activity. 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aice nucleation 3afrost injury 3afrost resistance 3aTriticum aestivum 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3aleaves 3aplant proteins 0acold tolerance1 aNalbantoglu, B.0 tPhytochemistry.g1999 Mar., v. 50, no. 5 p.755-761x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01756naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004100126300001600167500001500183520055100198650004400749650002200793650002500815650001000840650003600850650001600886650002100902650002600923650002200949650001400971650000900985650002300994651001001017653003301027653002601060653002301086700001701109700001801126700001601144773007201160852000901232930003301241945001301274946001101287655001201298IND2200829520221120133959.0990929e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220082952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, G.10aPhenolics from Maytenus senegalensis  ap. 689-694.  a2019-12-05  aTwo new methylated flavan-3-ol glucosides and a methylated proanthocyanidin were isolated from the MeOH extract of the stem-bark of Maytenus senegalensis, together with five known compounds.

The major polyamine present was putrescine (put), especially in the oldest leaves. Spermidine (spd) was present in considerable amounts, showing a tendency to decrease with the increasing physiological age of the leaves. At harvest, the put content in the floral stalk was similar to that in older leaves and it increased during postharvest. The opposite was found for spd, being similar to younger leaves and being constant during postharvest. Free sterol content increased with postharvest and also with physiological age of the leaves. Sitosterol was always the major free sterol present, followed by stigmasterol and campesterol. The stigmasterol to sitosterol ratio rose with time after harvest, older leaves showing higher ratios than younger leaves. 3aCichorium intybus 3achemical composition 3ainflorescences 3astems 3aspermidine 3aputrescine 3apostharvest physiology 3achemical constituents of plants 3acampesterol 3astigmasterol 3aleaves 0aphytosterols 0aleaf age 0asterols1 aGeuns, J.M.C.1 aProft, M. de.0 tPhytochemistry.g1999 Feb., v. 50, no. 4 p.549-553x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02203naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006100126300001600187500001500203520123500218650002501453650002301478650001801501650001901519650002201538650002301560650001601583653002801599653004001627700001701667700001901684773007201703852000901775930003301784945001301817946001101830655001201841IND2200827020221120114104.0990929e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220082702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiersch, O.10aJasmonates and related compounds from Fusarium oxysporum  ap. 517-523.  a2019-12-05  aThe culture filtrate of Fusarium oxysporum f sp matthiolae was inspected on the occurrence of jasmonates and related compounds.

In the manuka oil, monoterpenes are present at low levels (<(or)=3%). Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons are predominant (>(or)=60%) and include groups possessing cubebene/copaene, elemene, gurjunene/aromadendrene, farnesene/ caryophyllene, selinene, calamenene and cadinene skeletons. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes and triketones are present (<(or)=30%). The antimicrobial activity of the manuka oil was associated with a fraction containing three major and three trace triketones, two of the latter were previously unreported. Kanuka oil was characterized by high levels of alpha-pinene (> 50%) and lower levels (< 10%) of viridiflorol and viridiflorene. GC-MS and GC-FID detector responses to the same components were noticeably different for some major components, including the triketones. Non-commercial manuka oils from different sites differed widely in composition and could be separated into four groups by the presence and levels of distinctive components. The density and refractive index of manuka and kanuka oils were closely correlated with the total sesquiterpene levels. The density of the commercial manuka oil was closely correlated with the level of the triketones.

We tested whether secondary forests follow equilibrium or non-equilibrium dynamics by evaluating community reassembly over time, across different successional stages, and among multiple life stages. Based on long-term and static data from six 1-ha plots in NE Costa Rica, we show that secondary forests are undergoing reassembly of canopy tree and palm species composition through the successful recruitment of seedlings, saplings, and young trees of mature forest species. Such patterns were observed over time within sites and across successional stages. Floristic reassembly in secondary forests showed a clear convergence with mature forest community composition, supporting an equilibrium model. This resilience stems from three key factors co-occurring locally: high abundance of generalist species in the regional flora, high levels of seed dispersal, and local presence of old-growth forest remnants. 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aflora 3amodels 3aold-growth forests 3asaplings 3asecondary forests 3aseed dispersal 3aseedlings 3aspecies diversity 3atropical rain forests 3atropics 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTreesxgrowth & development 2aTropical Climate 3aCosta Rica 0aCosta Rica 0aCommunity reassembly 0afloristic composition 0asuccession1 aChazdon, Robin L.1 aChao, Anne1 aJiang, Yi-Huei1 aVílchez-Alvarado, Braulio0 tEcology letters.g2009 May, v. 12, no. 5 p.385-394dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01292.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02546naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012600167300001600293520095500309650002001264650002201284650002701306650002501333650001901358650001301377650001601390650001301406650002201419650002001441650001701461650003601478650001101514650002301525650001901548650001901567650002501586650002501611650001301636650001001649653002901659653002601688653005001714653001801764773010801782852000901890856008501899930003301984946001102017655001202028IND4410477020221120144030.0080919e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441047702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11099-008-0062-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubrahmanyam, D. 10aEffects of chromium toxicity on leaf photosynthetic characteristics and oxidative changes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 339-345.  aCr(VI) significantly reduced rates of net photosynthesis and transpiration and of stomatal conductance.

A central enzyme in the proline biosynthesis is the bifunctional enzyme Δ¹-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) that includes two functional catalytic domains: the γ-glutamyl kinase and the glutamic-γ-semialdehyde dehydrogenase. This enzyme catalyzes the first two steps of the proline biosynthetic pathway and plays a central role in the regulation of this process in plants. To determine the evolutionary events that occurred in P5CS genes, partial sequences from four Neotropical trees were cloned and compared to those of other plant taxa. Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that P5CS duplication events have occurred several times following the emergence of flowering plants and at different frequencies throughout the evolution of monocots and dicots. Despite the high number of conserved residues in plant P5CS sequences, positive selection was observed at different regions of P5CS paralogous genes and also when dicots and monocots were contrasted. 3aLiliopsida 3agenes 3aosmotic stress 3aphylogeny 3aplant residues 3aproline 3atropics1 aMargis-Pinheiro, Marcia1 aMargis, Rogerio0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2009 Jan., v. 281, no. 1 p.87-97dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-008-0396-4 7aarticle02479naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008200171300001800253500002400271520119500295650001701490650001401507650001601521650001201537650001101549650002401560650001601584650001201600650002101612653002601633653002701659653002301686653002401709700001801733700001801751700002601769700002801795700002101823773013701844852000901981856005501990655001202045IND4424518020221120133731.0090814e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442451802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.01985.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIssaoui, Manel10aEffect of extraction systems and cultivar on the quality of virgin olive oils  ap. 1713-1720.  aIncludes references  aThis research was carried out to compare the effects of two industrial scale processes (super press and triple phase systems) and a traditional Tunisian family-sized operation with laboratory milling for two varieties of olives: Chemlali and Chemchali. Analyses of the effect of the extraction system, on the oils' characteristics, revealed statistically significant differences in some parameters, mainly in antioxidant compounds (P < 0.05). Major fatty acids presented significant differences (P < 0.05) with respect to the cultivar kind (55.93% vs. 72.21%). Oxidative stability of Chemchali was nearly two times higher than Chemlali (94.58 vs. 50.37 day kg⁻¹). Results appear to confirm the general consensus that Chemchali oils are of much higher quality compared with the tolerable quality of Chemlali. The traditional method is a valid form of producing high quality oil with very high stability (48.87 and 109.07 day kg⁻¹ for Chemlali and Chemchali oil, respectively). However, industrial mills showed that triple-phase scale could cause considerable loss in polyphenols. Finally, olive oil quality is mainly dependant on the quality of the olives and on the extraction method. 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3afatty acids 3amilling 3aolives 3aoxidative stability 3apolyphenols 3apresses 3avirgin olive oil 0aAntioxidant compounds 0aantiradical activities 0aextraction systems 0aolive oil cultivars1 aDabbou, Samia1 aBrahmi, Faten1 aHassine, Kaouther Ben1 aEllouze, Myriem Hajaïj1 aHammami, Mohamed0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.1713-1720dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2009.01985.x 7aarticle03131naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001100171245009800182300001600280520154900296650001201845650001901857650001301876650001501889650002201904650003001926650001201956650001301968650002001981650002802001650002402029650001202053650001102065650002202076650001302098650001502111650000902126650002002135650002802155650002302183653001902206653002302225653001702248700002202265700002002287773013702307852000902444856009202453930003302545946001102578655001202589IND4410378320221120123434.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441037832DNAL7 a188037872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2007.00717.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Y.10aSelection on multiple QTL with control of gene diversity and inbreeding for long-term benefit  ap. 320-329.  aThe purpose of this study was to develop and investigate selection strategies that aim at maximizing long-term genetic response while conserving gene diversity and controlling inbreeding in populations of limited effective size, assuming complete knowledge of all genes affecting a quantitative trait. Three selection strategies were proposed to select on 100 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and compared with truncation selection on breeding value. Alternative selection strategies aimed at maximizing the average breeding value of parents with a penalty on (1) the number of unfavourable QTL genotypes among parents (OS-I), (2) the negative of the logarithm of the frequency of the favourable allele at each QTL among parents (OS-II), and (3) the average pedigree relationship among parents (OS-III). When all QTL and their effects were known, the strategies examined were able to obtain extra long-term responses, conserve QTL diversity and reduce inbreeding, compared with truncation selection. Strategy OS-II was the most effective in conserving QTL diversity and OS-III in reducing inbreeding. By changing the magnitude of the penalties applied, the impact on long-term response, inbreeding and diversity can be controlled. Extra long-term responses over truncation selection of OS-I and OS-II were even greater when effects of QTL were estimated rather than assumed known, indicating the applicability of results to practical strategies for marker-assisted selection. Extra responses are expected to be reduced for larger population sizes. 3aalleles 3abreeding value 3agenotype 3ainbreeding 3along term effects 3amarker-assisted selection 3aparents 3apedigree 3apopulation size 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aInbreeding 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSelection, Genetic 0agene diversity 0along-term response 0amultiple QTL1 aKadarmideen, H.N.1 aDekkers, J.C.M.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2008 Oct., v. 125, no. 5 p.320-329dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2007.00717.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02732naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009200167300001600259500002400275520159700299650002401896650002001920650001201940650001501952650001501967650001301982650001501995650001402010650001002024650002502034650001002059650001202069650001702081650001302098650001302111651001302124700002002137773009602157852000902253856004802262655001202310IND4435669220221120123519.0100416e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443566922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-010-9459-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatrick, David A.10aPopulation structure and movements of freshwater turtles across a road-density gradient  ap. 791-801.  aIncludes references  aUnderstanding interactions between roadways and population structure and movements of wildlife is key to mitigating “road effects” associated with increasing urbanization of the landscape. Aquatic turtles are a useful focal group because (1) population persistence is sensitive to mortality of individuals upon roads; (2) turtles frequently move among wetlands and encounter roads, and (3) turtles are an important component of vertebrate biomass in aquatic ecosystems. From 2005 to 2007, we examined the effects of urbanization on local- and landscape-scale populations of turtles. To do so, we sampled and marked turtles in 15 ponds arranged along a steep, urban-rural gradient in central New York State. We captured 494 turtles, representing 327 individuals, the majority of which were common snapping turtles Chelydra serpentina (n = 191) and eastern painted turtles Chrysemys picta picta (n = 122). At the local population (pond) scale, a higher proportion of female snapping turtles in ponds was associated with lower road densities within 500 m of ponds. The mean size of both species of turtle increased in ponds with a lower density of roads within 100 m. At the landscape-level, we observed fewer turtles dispersing through urbanized habitat than forested, and fewer movements through areas with a higher density of roads. Our study suggests that roads alter both local- and landscape-level turtle populations through a loss of female turtles, and by reducing movement between ponds. By extension, the study targets key landscape features upon which to focus mitigation efforts. 3aChelydra serpentina 3aChrysemys picta 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amortality 3aponds 3apopulation structure 3aroads 3aturtles 3aurbanization 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aNew York1 aGibbs, James P.0 tLandscape ecology.g2010 May, v. 25, no. 5 p.791-801dSpringer Netherlandsx0921-29737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-010-9459-0 7aarticle02746naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245009400188300001600282500002400298520094400322650001801266650001201284650000801296650001801304650001301322650001201335650001501347650001001362650001101372650003001383650001201413650004501425650004601470650001201516650004001528650004101568650003801609650004801647650001401695650002701709650004301736650004401779650003901823650004601862650004701908650001101955651001601966700001401982700002301996773009202019852000902111856004802120655001202168IND4409928220221120123444.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440992822DNAL7 a182646582pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-008-9365-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManerkar, Mayura A.10aQ-RT-PCR for Assessing Archaea, Bacteria, and Fungi During Leaf Decomposition in a Stream  ap. 467-473.  aIncludes references  aLeaf disks of Tilia cordata were exposed for up to 5 weeks in a first-order stream in Nova Scotia, Canada.

Methods Questionnaires regarding the frequency of heartburn and sleep disorders were distributed and endoscopic findings were assessed among patients who visited 35 participating institutions from March through September 2005, with a target sample size of 100 consecutive endoscopy patients per institution. Results A total of 2426 patients were included in the analysis population. The prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease in patients was 26.5% (n = 644). Mean sleeping time was 6.5 ± 1.2 h, and 48.3% (n = 1172) of all patients reported experiencing sleep disorders. Sleep disorders were significantly more prevalent among patients with heartburn, at 56.3% (615/1093 patients, P < 0.0001), with the number of sleep disorder events increasing with the frequency of heartburn. Conversely, those with sleep disorders reported experiencing heartburn at a significantly higher rate (approximately 75%). However, sleep disorders occurred in only 51.6% (197/382) of patients with reflux esophagitis, showing no significant difference compared with those without reflux esophagitis. No definite tendency was seen in relation to the severity of reflux esophagitis. Conclusions In Japanese people, patients with heartburn had a significantly higher prevalence of sleep disorders than those without heartburn. 3aepidemiological studies 2aAdult 2aAged 2aEndoscopy, Gastrointestinal 2aFemale 2aGastroesophageal Refluxxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aHeartburnxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPopulation Surveillancexmethods 2aPrevalence 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSleep Wake Disordersxepidemiologyxetiology. 0aJapanxepidemiology. 0agastroesophageal reflux disease 0aheartburn 0areflux esophagitis 0asleep disorders1 aKouzu, Teruo 1 aKawano, Tatsuyuki 1 aOhara, Shuichi 0 tJournal of gastroenterology.g2008 Nov., v. 43, no. 11 p.833-841dJapan : Springer Japanx0944-11747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-008-2235-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03978naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245019300180300001400373500001500387520185800402650002002260650000902280650003102289650002802320650001902348650002002367650002602387650002302413650003202436650004102468650003702509650001202546650001102558650001102569650001502580650000902595650001602604650003302620650001702653650002402670653002802694653003402722653003802756653002902794700001502823700002102838700001702859700002002876700001802896700001802914700002502932700002502957700001402982700001802996700001503014700002003029773010503049852000903154856008503163930003303248946001103281655001203292IND4413447220221120123558.0081205e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441344722DNAL7 a189790832pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-008-1173-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoebus, S. 10aAssociation of impaired fasting glucose and coronary artery calcification as a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis in a population-based cohort--results of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study  ap. 81-89.  a2019-12-04  aAims/hypothesis Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases are often present at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Whether subclinical atherosclerosis can be detected in the pre-diabetic (borderline fasting hyperglycemia) state is not clear. This study investigated the association of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, among participants without a history of coronary heart disease or manifest diabetes mellitus. Methods Study participants (aged 45-75 years) of the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study were categorised into those with normal fasting glucose (glucose <6.1 mmol/l) and those with IFG (glucose >=6.1 to <7.0 mmol/l), excluding participants with a history of CHD or diabetes mellitus. CAC was assessed by electron-beam computed tomography, and risk factors were assessed by extended interviews, anthropometric measurements and laboratory tests. Various CAC cut-off points were used in multiple logistic and ordinal logistic regression models to estimate ORs and 95% CIs. Results Of the 2,184 participants, more men had IFG than did women (37% vs 22%). Participants with IFG showed a higher prevalence of CAC > 0 (men OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.33-2.70; women 1.63, 1.23-2.15). Risk factor adjustment weakened this association in both sexes (men 1.63, 1.12-1.36; women 1.26, 0.93-1.70). When the age- and sex-specific 75th percentile was used as the cut-off point for CAC, the association further decreased in men (1.10, 0.81-1.50), but became stronger in women (1.41, 1.02-1.94). Conclusions/interpretation These data support the hypothesis that CAC is already present in the pre-diabetic state and that IFG has a modest and independent impact on the atherosclerotic process. Biological sex appears to modify the association between IFG and CAC. 3aatherosclerosis 2aAged 2aAtherosclerosisxpathology 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Mass Index 2aCalcinosisxpathology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCoronary Vesselsxpathology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xpathology 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxpathology 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrediabetic Statexpathology 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Characteristics 0acardiovascular diseases 0aCoronary artery calcification 0aElectron-beam computed tomography 0aImpaired fasting glucose1 aStang, A. 1 aMöhlenkamp, S. 1 aDragano, N. 1 aSchmermund, A. 1 aSlomiany, U. 1 aHoffmann, B. 1 aBauer, M.q(Manfred)1 aBroecker-Preuss, M. 1 aMann, K. 1 aSiegrist, J. 1 aErbel, R. 1 aJöckel, K.-H. 0 tDiabetologia.g2009 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.81-89dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-008-1173-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081205b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03228naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245007400167300001600241500002400257520206500281650002302346650003402369650002002403650001102423650002402434650002102458650003402479650002402513650001702537650002002554650002402574650002402598700001902622700001802641773011902659852000902778856005502787655001202842IND4423881220221120123316.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442388122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00230.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDASH, K.K.10aModeling of respiration rate of sapota fruit under aerobic conditions  ap. 528-543.  aIncludes references  aAccurate measurement of respiration rate is an important aspect to the success of design and operational features of techniques like controlled and modified atmosphere storage. Two different models based on regression analysis and enzyme kinetics were developed with the help of respiration data generated at temperatures of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30C for sapota fruit using a closed system method. Temperature was found to influence the model parameters. In the model based on enzyme kinetics, the dependence of respiration rate on O₂ and CO₂ was found to follow the uncompetitive inhibition. The developed models were tested for its validity at 12C. The models showed good agreement with the experimentally estimated respiration rate, although the model based on enzymatic kinetic with Arrhenius-type temperature dependence was found to have a closer agreement than the other model studied. The levels of agreement between the respiration rates of sapota at 12C predicted by regression analysis and that obtained through experiments were 18.44 and 22.18% for O₂ consumption and CO₂ evolution, respectively, while those for the model based on enzyme kinetics were found to be 16.79 and 12.12%. Manipulation of respiration rate is the underlying principle behind storage techniques like controlled atmosphere (CA) storage and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). However, besides being specific to horticultural parameters, respiration rate is also dependent on factors like storage temperature and composition of storage atmosphere. Hence, a mathematical approach to predict the respiration rate under given conditions would be an immense help in both design and process control of such storage systems. For example, predictive models for respiration rate would aid in the selection of packaging material of appropriate permeability for MAP. Also, it would help in protocols for the control of gas compositions in CA systems. In this study, mathematical models have been developed and tested to predict the respiration rate of sapota (cv. Calcutta). 3aaerobic conditions 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3aenzyme kinetics 3afruits 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3apackaging materials 3apermeability 3aprocess control 3aregression analysis 3astorage temperature1 aRAVINDRA, M.R.1 aGOSWAMI, T.K.0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2009 Aug., v. 32, no. 4 p.528-543dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00230.x 7aarticle02388naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009800166300001600264500002400280520139500304650001501699650002201714650001401736650001401750650001901764650001101783650001001794650001601804650003301820650001701853700002201870773008901892852000901981856004801990655001202038IND4433985020221120113831.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443398502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-009-9316-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilder, Matthias10aSurface-sensitive method to determine calcium carbonate filler contents in cellulose matrices  ap. 407-415.  aIncludes references  aThis paper describes a method using attenuated total reflectance infra-red spectroscopy to determine the surface concentration of calcium carbonate in paper samples, by applying the linear relationship between the relative infra-red absorption integrals and the concentration. The method was able to detect micro-variations in the surface concentration and could also distinguish between different sheets as well as between the top and bottom side of one sheet. The samples were also split and the calcium carbonate concentration was determined within and compared to bulk calcium carbonate concentration determined from ash testing. The surface results were also compared with analysed scanning electron microscopy images generated from back-scattering electrons. The comparison shows that both sets of results are in excellent agreement. Depending on the sample, large errors (95% confidence) were observed. These, however, are caused by micro-variations of the surface concentration, rather than by inaccuracies of the technique, which is estimated to be less than 1%. Furthermore, measurements of various sample orientations suggest that anisotropic polarisation effects can be neglected. The method can be applied to paper and cellulose matrices having calcium carbonate filler contents of less than 50%. Due to spectral overlaps it is not suitable to determine kaolin filler contents. 3aabsorption 3acalcium carbonate 3acellulose 3aelectrons 3aimage analysis 3akaolin 3apaper 3areflectance 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy1 aBatchelor, Warren0 tCellulose.g2010 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.407-415dSpringer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-009-9316-y 7aarticle03515naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245009000170300001600260520236400276650001502640650001402655650001302669650000902682650002002691650001202711650001002723650001402733650001502747650001302762653002502775653002102800653001202821653002402833773011502857852000902972856009202981930003303073946001103106655001203117IND4410367520221120113848.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441036752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01436.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowell, Scott10aEcological specialization and the evolution of a specialized caste in Cephalotes ants  ap. 902-911.  a1. Ecology can have a profound influence on social evolution. However, the role of ecology in the evolution of specialized altruistic phenotypes or 'castes', a recurrent theme in insect societies, is poorly understood. 2. Cephalotes ants nest in pre-existing arboreal cavities, and extant species span four incremental steps in the evolution of a soldier caste that is morphologically specialized for blocking cavity entrances. I address the hypothesis that ecological specialization, defined as specialized use of cavities with entrances close to the area of one ant head, has selected for a morphologically and behaviourally specialized soldier in Cephalotes. This is done with comparative studies of four Cephalotes species, with one representative for each of the four character states of soldier evolution. 3. By quantifying nesting ecology, nest defence and foraging behaviour, I provide strong support for two key predictions of the focal hypothesis. First, the least specialized nesting ecology is seen in the species with the ancestral state of no-soldier. Thus, more individuals are needed to block the average entrance than in other species, and the variation in entrance area is also greater. Second, a systematic increase in ecological specialization (lower mean and variance of entrance area), and behavioural specialization of soldiers, is associated with each of the three transitions to more specialized soldier morphology. This pattern culminates in the consistent use of cavities with an entrance area equal to one soldier head, and a strict soldier-only blocking defence, in the species representing the most specialized and derived soldier morphology. All species used some entrances equal to one ant head, thus it was specifically the specialization on such nests that was associated with increased morphological and behavioural specialization of the soldier. 4. Overall, theses findings provide strong comparative support for the hypothesis that ecological specialization has played a key role in the evolution of a specialized soldier caste in Cephalotes. This pattern is opposite to classic theoretical prediction that a broader resource base should select for caste evolution. The idea that ecological specialization could be a general force in caste evolution is explored, with critical comparative and experimental tests discussed. 3aCephalotes 3aevolution 3aforaging 3ahead 3ainsect colonies 3anesting 3anests 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3avariance 0acomparative analysis 0asocial evolution 0asoldier 0aworker polymorphism0 tFunctional ecology.g2008 Oct., v. 22, no. 5 p.902-911dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0269-84637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01436.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02489naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245005800169300001600227520149700243650001101740650003601751650000801787651001501795653001301810700002301823700002001846700002001866773013701886852000902023856008502032930003302117946001302150655001202163IND4416709920221120113810.0090220e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441670992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11469-008-9178-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlankenship, Jason 10aGambling Trends in the State of New Mexico: 1996-1998  ap. 203-216.  aNew Mexico experienced a surge in the gaming industry during the mid-1990s with the initiation of a state lottery and other new gaming opportunities, as well as the development of many Indian gaming establishments. This paper explores patterns associated with gambling in two random samples of the adult population (N = 2674) in the entire State of New Mexico in 1996 and 1998. Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to describe the relationship between gambling and such variables as age, gender, and ethnicity. Overall, an increase occurred in the number of people who reported having ever gambled, from 86.4% in 1996 to 92.5% in 1998. From 1996 to 1998, respondents' reports of their past month gambling showed that certain forms of gambling (e.g., playing cards and betting on animals for money) decreased, while other forms of gambling either remained unchanged or increased in frequency (e.g., sports and investment gambling). The relationship of gender and age to gambling was also examined. Survey results indicated that while males and females reported many similar gambling habits, there are gender differences, particularly with regard to investment gambling. Specifically, females show a greater increase in investment gambling from 1996 to 1998, than do males. Overall results indicate a small positive correlation between age and dollar amount spent on gambling in the past month. In addition, ethnicity and age-specific patterns for certain forms of gambling are described. 3agender 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aage 3aNew Mexico 0aGambling1 aStarling, Randall 1 aWoodall, W.

Cin8 and dynein are synthetically lethal, yet the arrest phenotypes of cells eliminated for their function had not been identified. We found that at a non-permissive temperature, dyn1Δ cells that carry a temperature-sensitive cin8 - 3 mutation arrest at mid-anaphase with a unique phenotype, which we named TAN (two microtubule asters in one nucleus). These cells enter anaphase, but fail to proceed through the slow phase of anaphase B. At a permissive temperature, dyn1Δ, cin8 - 3 or dyn1Δcin8 - 3 cells exhibit perturbed spindle midzone morphologies, with dyn1Δcin8 - 3 anaphase spindles also being profoundly bent and nonrigid. Sorbitol, which has been suggested to stabilize microtubules, corrects these defects and suppresses the TAN phenotype. We conclude that dynein and Cin8 cooperate in anaphase midzone organization and influence microtubule dynamics, thus enabling progression through the slow phase of anaphase B. 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaphase 3aaster (cell structure) 3adynein ATPase 3amicrotubules 3amolecular motor proteins 3amutation 3aphenotype 3asorbitol 3atemperature 2aAnaphasexphysiology 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDyneinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIndicators and Reagentsxmetabolism 2aKinesins. 2aMicrotubule-Associated Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxphysiology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSorbitolxmetabolism 2aSpindle Apparatusxmetabolismxultrastructure. 0aCin8 0adynein 0aanaphase B1 aMovshovich, N. 1 aAvunie, R. 1 aFridman, V. 1 aMoyal, K. 1 aKatz, B. 1 aHoyt, M.

OTA-producing A. carbonarius and B. cinerea were grown on grape-like medium at 20°C for 7 days. Radii of colonies were daily recorded and OTA was analysed. In addition, each B. cinerea isolate was inoculated on grape-like synthetic nutrient medium (SNM) paired with each A. carbonarius isolate at a distance of 45 mm. Botrytis cinerea isolates were also grown in OTA-spiked SNM. Growth rates of B. cinerea and A. carbonarius were 20 and 7·5 mm day⁻¹, respectively. The growth of the colonies of each species stopped when they contacted each other in paired cultures. OTA production by A. carbonarius in the contact area was affected by B. cinerea, but no clear trend was observed. All B. cinerea isolates showed to degrade between 24·2% and 26·7% of OTA from spiked SNM. The ecological advantage of B. cinerea, in terms of growth rate, vs. OTA-producing Aspergillus in some wine-growing regions and its ability to degrade OTA may explain the low levels of this toxin in noble wines. At determinate conditions, the presence of B. cinerea in grapes with A. carbonarius may help in reducing OTA accumulation. 3aAspergillus carbonarius 3aBotrytis cinerea 3agrapes 3ain vitro studies 3aochratoxin A 3awines 2aAspergillusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBotrytisxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aOchratoxinsxanalysisxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aVitisxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aWine 0agrape-like medium1 aSanchis, V.1 aRamos, A.J.1 aMarín, S.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2008 Oct., v. 47, no. 4 p.327-332dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02434.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02891naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001700186245011700203300001400320520178900334650001102123653003502134653001202169653002102181700001902202700002202221700001902243700002002262773012102282852000902403856008502412930003302497946001102530655001202541IND4412400220221120113745.0081107e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441240022DNAL7 a196694932pmid7 aPMC25777422pmcid7 a10.1007/s10867-008-9105-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, Elia 10aHDF1 and RAD17 Genes are Involved in DNA Double-strand Break Repair in Stationary Phase Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 63-71.  aDNA repair, checkpoint pathways and protection mechanisms against different types of perturbations are critical factors for the prevention of genomic instability. The aim of the present work was to analyze the roles of RAD17 and HDF1 gene products during the late stationary phase, in haploid and diploid yeast cells upon gamma irradiation. The checkpoint protein, Rad17, is a component of a PCNA-like complex--the Rad17/Mec3/Ddc1 clamp--acting as a damage sensor; this protein is also involved in double-strand break (DBS) repair in cycling cells. The HDF1 gene product is a key component of the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ). Diploid and haploid rad17Δ/rad17Δ, and hdf1Δ Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains and corresponding isogenic wild types were used in the present study. Yeast cells were grown in standard liquid nutrient medium, and maintained at 30°C for 21 days in the stationary phase, without added nutrients. Cell samples were irradiated with ⁶⁰Co γ rays at 5 Gy/s, 50 Gy <= Dabs <= 200 Gy. Thereafter, cells were incubated in PBS (liquid holding: LH, 0 <= t <= 24 h). DNA chromosomal analysis (by pulsed-field electrophoresis), and surviving fractions were determined as a function of absorbed doses, either immediately after irradiation or after LH. Our results demonstrated that the proteins Rad17, as well as Hdf1, play essential roles in DBS repair and survival after gamma irradiation in the late stationary phase and upon nutrient stress (LH after irradiation). In haploid cells, the main pathway is NHEJ. In the diploid state, the induction of LH recovery requires the function of Rad17. Results are compatible with the action of a network of DBS repair pathways expressed upon different ploidies, and different magnitudes of DNA damage. 3ayeasts 0aDNA double-strand break repair 0aγ rays 0aStationary phase1 aCandreva, Ema 1 aBracesco, Nelson 1 aSánchez, Ana.1 aDell, Mercedes 0 tJournal of biological physics.g2008 Apr., v. 34, no. 1-2 p.63-71dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0092-06067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10867-008-9105-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20081107b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03254naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245014400123300001600267500001500283520173100298650001802029650001602047650002302063650001602086650000902102650002302111650002002134650003302154650002302187650002102210650001702231650001802248650001502266650001802281650001302299650002102312650001502333650001802348653001602366653001302382653002102395653001802416653001302434653001502447700001802462700001802480700001402498700001402512773009402526852000902620930003302629945001302662946001302675655001202688IND2332170120221120113756.0030424e200209  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233217012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSato, K.10aIdentification of factors regulating lipoprotein lipase catalyzed hydrolysis in rats with the aid of monoacid-rich lipoprotein preparations  ap. 528-538.  a2019-12-05  aTo identify the substrate specificity and regulatory factors in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) catalyzed hydrolysis of triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein, monoacid-rich lipoproteins were used to study the kinetic parameters of LPL. Feeding growing rats with diets rich in palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1) or linoleic acid (18:2) for 10 days increased the corresponding acid content in the triacylglycerols of the lipoproteins. Force-feeding the monoacid-rich triacylglycerols, particularly 16:0 or 18:1, increased the respective fatty acid content in both chylomicrons and VLDLs. Major apolipoproteins and lipid compositions were essentially similar among all lipoproteins differing in monoacid species, except for apo A-IV. The Vmax of LPL for 16:0-rich chylomicrons and VLDLs were higher than for 18:1- or 18:2-rich lipoproteins. Order parameter (S), an indicator of the surface fluidity of lipoproteins, decreased with the chain length and unsaturation of monoacid in similar manner as the Vmax. The Vmax of LPL increased linearly (P < 0.05) with an increase in either the palmitic acid content of the lipoprotein triacylglycerols or order parameter (S) of the lipoproteins. The order parameter (S) and Vmax of LPL were higher in 16:0 triacylglycerol emulsions with apo B than with 18:1 or 18:2 triacylglycerols. The apo A-IV in triacylglycerol emulsions stimulated Vmax of LPLs in the presence of apo B and apo C-II. The binding of apo A-IV to 16:0 triacylglycerol emulsions was higher than to other triacylglycerol emulsions. These findings suggest that lipoprotein catalysis by LPL is modulated by the 16:0 level in the lipoprotein triacylglycerol, which affects the surface fluidity and apo A-IV content of lipoproteins. 3alinoleic acid 3afood intake 3alipoprotein lipase 3adietary fat 3arats 3aexperimental diets 3aapolipoproteins 3avery low density lipoprotein 3acatalytic activity 3atriacylglycerols 3achylomicrons 3aanimal models 3ahydrolysis 3apalmitic acid 3akinetics 3alipid metabolism 3aoleic acid 3aphospholipids 0afatty acids 0aapo a-iv 0asurface fluidity 0afat emulsions 0aproteins 0aregulation1 aTakahashi, Y.1 aTakahashi, T.1 aKatoh, N.1 aAkiba, Y.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2002 Sept., v. 13, no. 9 p.528-538x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdPNN  aOther US 7aarticle02849naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013600126300001600262500001500278520169600293650001601989650001302005650001502018650002502033650002702058650001702085650001402102650003702116650001402153650002002167650001702187653002702204653001502231700001602246700001502262773009402277852000902371930003302380945001302413946001302426655001202439IND2332170720221120103922.0030424e200210  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233217072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurusoy, M.10aAssessment of the relationship between the antimutagenic action of riboflavin and glutathione and the levels of antioxidant enzymes  ap. 598-602.  a2019-12-05  aIn this study the role of antioxidant enzymes on the antimutagenic actions of riboflavin and reduced glutathione against mutagenic potentials of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and mitomycin C have been investigated. For this purpose the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes have been determined in Salmonella typhimurium TA102 and TA100 strains preincubated with different combinations of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, mitomycin C, riboflavin and reduced glutathione for thirty minutes. Also in part of the same samples, the mutagenicity has been determined for each combination of chemicals by using Salmonella preincubation test. The correlation between the levels of antioxidant enzymes and mutagenicity and antimutagenicity has been investigated. While riboflavin displayed a weakly antimutagenic effect on 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide mutagenicity in TA102 and TA100 (0.25, 0.35 inhibition respectively), it did not have any effect on the strong mutagenicity of mitomycin C in both strains. Reduced glutathione, a well known antioxidant, had no antimutagenic effect against the mutagenicity of both compounds in TA102 and TA100 strains. The antioxidant enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase, seemed to have no direct effect on the antimutagenic action of riboflavin and mutagenic action of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and mitomycin C because no change in the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase was detected in relation to antimutagenicity of riboflavin and mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and mitomycin C in both strains. It should be noted that many antimutagens have more than one mechanism of action and their effect depends on the mutagens being tested. 3aglutathione 3acatalase 3ariboflavin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3amutagenicity 3abioassays 3astructure-activity relationships 3amitomycin 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidants 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0ainhibition1 aKaragoz, E.1 aOzturk, K.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2002 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.598-602x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdPNN  aOther US 7aarticle03874naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245010500178300001800283500001500301520202200316650002202338650001002360650001102370650001102381650001702392650001902409650002002428650001702448650001202465650002002477650002302497650001102520650002102531650001602552650001602568650001702584650002602601650002602627650002102653650002502674650002102699651001002720653002302730653003402753653002902787653002402816653003102840653001502871653001802886700001702904700001402921700001702935700001802952773012102970852000903091856009203100930003303192946001103225655001203236IND4412789920221120103929.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441278992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01685.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMARTÍNEZ-VILALTA, J.10aTwentieth century increase of Scots pine radial growth in NE Spain shows strong climate interactions  ap. 2868-2881.  a2019-12-04  aStem radial growth responds to environmental conditions, and has been widely used as a proxy to study long-term patterns of tree growth and to assess the impact of environmental changes on growth patterns. In this study, we use a tree ring dataset from the Catalan Ecological and Forest Inventory to study the temporal variability of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stem growth during the 20th century across a relatively large region (Catalonia, NE Spain) close to the southern limit of the distribution of the species. Basal area increment (BAI) was modelled as a function of tree size and environmental variables by means of mixed effects models. Our results showed an overall increase of 84% in Scots pine BAI during the 20th century, consistent with most previous studies for temperate forests. This trend was associated with increased atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and, possibly, with a general increase in nutrient availability, and we interpreted it as a fertilization effect. Over the same time period, there was also a marked increase in temperature across the study region (0.19 °C per decade on average). This warming had a negative impact on radial growth, particularly at the drier sites, but its magnitude was not enough to counteract the fertilization effect. In fact, the substantial warming observed during the 20th century in the study area did not result in a clear pattern of increased summer drought stress because of the large variability in precipitation, which did not show any clear time trend. But the situation may change in the future if temperatures continue to rise and/or precipitation becomes scarcer. Such a change could potentially reverse the temporal trend in growth, particularly at the driest sites, and is suggested in our data by the relative constancy of radial growth after ca. 1975, coinciding with the warmer period. If this situation is representative of other relatively dry, temperate forests, the implications for the regional carbon balance would be substantial. 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3acarbon 3asummer 3abiogeography 3acarbon dioxide 3adata collection 3awater stress 3aclimate 3astem elongation 3atemporal variation 3amodels 3aPinus sylvestris 3atemperature 3atree growth 3agrowth rings 3anutrient availability 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest inventory 3aenvironmental impact 3astand basal area 3aSpain 0awater availability 0aPinus sylvestris (Scots pine) 0aclimate-growth responses 0aCO₂ fertilization 0abasal area increment (BAI) 0abasal area 0adendroecology1 aLÓPEZ, B.C.1 aADELL, N.1 aBADIELLA, L.1 aNINYEROLA, M.0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 Dec., v. 14, no. 12 p.2868-2881dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01685.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081121b20081206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03370naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010400130300001600234520187600250650001602126650003202142650002102174650001702195650002302212650001602235650001802251650002302269650002602292650003202318650001702350650001602367650002802383650002902411650001002440650002302450650001802473650002102491650002302512650001002535650003302545650002602578653002702604700001502631700001202646700002002658773009402678852000902772930003302781945001302814946001302827655001202840IND2331728720221120104108.0030401e200112  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233172872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, M.L.10aDietary fat saturation an gender/hormonal status modulate plasma lipids and lipoprotein composition  ap. 703-710.  aMale, female and ovariectomized (to mimic menopause) guinea pigs were fed a saturated (SFA) or a polyunsaturated (PUFA) fat diet for 4 weeks to determine the effects of dietary fat saturation on lipoprotein levels and composition and to assess whether gender and hormonal status modulate the cholesterolemic response. Both diets contained 15g/100 g fat and 0.04 g/100 g cholesterol and were identical in composition except for the type of fat. The SFA diet contained 50% saturated fat (25% lauric + myristic fatty acids), 25% PUFA and 25% monounsaturated fatty acids while the PUFA diet had 50% PUFA (linoleic acid), 25% monounsaturated and 25% SFA fatty acids. Plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) was an average 21% lower in guinea pigs fed PUFA compared to those fed SFA (P < 0.05). In addition, ovariectomized guinea pigs, both in the SFA and PUFA groups, had 20-33% higher LDL-C than either males or females (P < 0.01). VLDL cholesterol was 70% higher in the PUFA-fed animals (P < 0.0001). A gender effect was observed in plasma HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) with females and ovariectomized guinea pigs having 30-42% higher HDL-C than males (P < 0.01). LDL susceptibility to oxidation was not affected by dietary fat saturation or gender. In contrast, VLDL and LDL composition were significantly influenced by diet and gender. VLDL particles were larger in size in guinea pigs fed the SFA diets (P < 0.01) while LDL particles were larger in female guinea pigs (P < 0.001). Hepatic lipids were influenced by the interaction between diet and group. Hepatic cholesterol (P < 0.01) and TAG concentrations (P < 0.0001) were highest in female guinea pigs fed the PUFA diet. Since the liver is the major site of lipoprotein synthesis and catabolism, these results suggest that not only diet but also gender may play a major role in determining the composition and size of lipoproteins. 3adietary fat 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3alipid metabolism 3ablood lipids 3agender differences 3aguinea pigs 3aanimal models 3aexperimental diets 3asaturated fatty acids 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3ablood plasma 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aliver 3acholesteryl esters 3aphospholipids 3atriacylglycerols 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3avery low density lipoprotein 3abiological resistance 0aovariectomized females1 aWest, K.L.1 aRoy, S.1 aRamjiganesh, T.0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2001 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.703-710x0955-28637nnas  aDNAL  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02625naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245015800172300001800330520129000348592002801638650001401666650001901680650002801699650001401727650001201741650000901753650001401762650003701776650001601813651001901829653002201848653001901870653000901889653001701898653001401915653002201929700001601951700002001967700001501987773007902002856008902081852000902170655001202179IND60531488920221120072950.0170719e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053148892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.10.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEchols, B.S.14aThe use of ephyrae of a scyphozoan jellyfish, Aurelia aurita, in the aquatic toxicological assessment of Macondo oils from the Deepwater Horizon incident  ap. 1893-1900.  aEphyrae of the scyphozoan jellyfish, Aurelia aurita, were evaluated in 96-hr acute toxicity tests for lethal response to Macondo crude oils from the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) incident in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), Corexit 9500, and oil-dispersant mixtures. Water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of weathered and unweathered Macondo crude oils were not acutely toxic to ephyrae (LC50s > 100% WAF).

Mortality was significantly (p = <0.0001) higher in the three highest exposure concentrations (184–736 µg TPAH/L) of chemically dispersed WAFs (CEWAF) compared to controls. Dispersant only tests resulted in a mean LC50 of 32.3 µL/L, which is in the range of previously published LC50s for marine zooplankton. Changes in appearance and muscle contractions were observed in organisms exposed to CEWAF dilutions of 12.5 and 25%, as early as 24 h post-exposure. Based on the results of these tests, crude oil alone did not cause significant acute toxicity; however, the presence of chemical dispersant resulted in substantial mortality and physical and behavioral abnormalities either due to an increase in hydrocarbons or droplet exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScyphozoa 3aacute toxicity 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3amuscles 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3azooplankton 3aGulf of Mexico 0aDeepwater Horizon 0aAcute toxicity 0aPAHs 0aCorexit 9500 0aJellyfish 0aStress indicators1 aSmith, A.J.1 aGardinali, P.R.1 aRand, G.M.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Feb., v. 144 p.1893-1900dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.10.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04740naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245018400173520276800357592002803125650003103153650001903184650002503203650002603228650001603254650001703270650001903287650002303306650001703329650001903346650002603365650002303391650002003414650003103434650001803465650001003483650002803493650001103521650001403532650002603546650002403572650001103596650001603607650001803623650001703641650001203658650001603670651001003686653001803696653002303714653001503737653001203752700001703764700001703781700001503798700001503813700001703828700001703845773011803862856008903980852000904069655001204078IND60701389220221120110357.0200824e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070138922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1043722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qing-Hai14aThe response strategies of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.s. due to the stress caused by biological control agent Bacillus amyloliquefaciens deciphered by transcriptome analyses  aWalnut is cultivated all over the world for its precious woody nut and edible oil. Walnut anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a disastrous disease in the walnut plantation. In China, this disease is difficult to control. The efficacies of the traditional preventing and controlling measures are inadequate. It causes serious losses every year. In the interaction systems of ‘antagonistic organism-pathogen’, the response mechanisms of the pathogen to the stress of antagonistic organisms were largely unknown. To understand the response mechanisms of walnut anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) TS-09R was treated with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and RNAseq gene expression analyses were performed. A total of 610 genes expressed differentially (DEGs). Among these genes, 387 genes were up-regulated and 223 genes were down-regulated. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that 409 DEGs involved in the categories of biological process, and cellular component. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that all up-regulated DEGs were enriched in amino acid metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. Further analyses indicated that C. gloeosporioides s.s. TS-09R up-expressed significantly some DEGs associated with cell membrane synthesis and, or maintaining stabilization, antioxidant and anti-stress to build the cell membrane, maintain the normal physiological function of cells. At the same time, it improved detoxification efficiency and reduced its sensitivity to the exogenous antimicrobial substance (EAS). It also improved the activity of the efflux pump translocating EAS out of the cells, reduced accumulation, and minimized injuries to cells. C. gloeosporioides s.s. TS-09R also up-expressed significantly genes associated with sporulation to promote spore production for survival in adversity. C. gloeosporioides s.s. TS-09R recruited numerous genes to respond to or resist the biocontrol of B. amyloliquefaciens. The response model was a holistic and complex network involving multiple genes and multiple signaling pathways. Additionally, the glutathione-S-transferases (GST) activities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. TS-09R, TS-09 cultured for 5 days and 9 days were calculated, and the GST activity had a similar change trend to the GST-related gene expression. The result indicated that the hypothetical response strategies were reliable.In this paper, we provided new insights into the onset of the interaction system of ‘C. gloeosporioides s.s. – B. amyloliquefaciens’. The results will contribute to exploring comprehensively the mechanism of B. amyloliquefaciens according to the response mechanisms of C. gloeosporioides s.s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aColletotrichum 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aamino acid metabolism 3aanthracnose 3aantioxidants 3abiodegradation 3abiological control 3abiosynthesis 3acell membranes 3acooking fats and oils 3afungal antagonists 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aglutathione transferase 3amodels 3apathogens 3asecondary metabolites 3asignal transduction 3aspores 3asporulation 3atranscriptome 3atransporters 3awalnuts 3axenobiotics 3aChina 0aJuglans regia 0aWalnut anthracnose 0aBiocontrol 0aRNA-Seq1 aJi, Yan-Ping1 aQu, Yong-Yun1 aQi, Yu-Kun1 aLi, De-Wei1 aLiu, Zhen-Yu1 aWu, Xiao-Qin0 tBiological control.g2020 Nov., v. 150 p.104372-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2020.1043723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03923naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245009000196300001600286500001900302500002000321520181100341592002802152596004002180596005102220596005902271596006402330650002802394650001702422650001602439650001502455650002302470650001502493650001002508650001302518650001002531650002502541650001602566700007102582700006102653700005602714700006002770700006102830700005702891700005802948700006103006700005503067700006003122773011703182856007303299852000903372655001203381IND60727919820221119211523.0210214e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072791982DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.157742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Peiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8346-913214aThe comparative genomic landscape of adaptive radiation in crater lake cichlid fishes  ap. 955-972.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFactors ranging from ecological opportunity to genome composition might explain why only some lineages form adaptive radiations. While being rare, particular systems can provide natural experiments within an identical ecological setting where species numbers and phenotypic divergence in two closely related lineages are notably different. We investigated one such natural experiment using two de novo assembled and 40 resequenced genomes and asked why two closely related Neotropical cichlid fish lineages, the Amphilophus citrinellus species complex (Midas cichlids; radiating) and Archocentrus centrarchus (Flyer cichlid; nonradiating), have resulted in such disparate evolutionary outcomes. Although both lineages inhabit many of the same Nicaraguan lakes, whole‐genome inferred demography suggests that priority effects are not likely to be the cause of the dissimilarities. Also, genome‐wide levels of selection, transposable element dynamics, gene family expansion, major chromosomal rearrangements and the number of genes under positive selection were not markedly different between the two lineages. To more finely investigate particular subsets of the genome that have undergone adaptive divergence in Midas cichlids, we also examined if there was evidence for ‘molecular pre‐adaptation’ in regions identified by QTL mapping of repeatedly diverging adaptive traits. Although most of our analyses failed to pinpoint substantial genomic differences, we did identify functional categories containing many genes under positive selection that provide candidates for future studies on the propensity of Midas cichlids to radiate. Our results point to a disproportionate role of local, rather than genome‐wide factors underlying the propensity for these cichlid fishes to adaptively radiate.  aPublisher supplied data  aP30686‐B29cAustrian Science Fund  aFR 3399/1‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aGenAdapt #293700cFP7 Ideas: European Research Council  aP300PA_177852cSwiss National Science Foundation fellowship 3aAmphilophus citrinellus 3aArchocentrus 3aCentrarchus 3aNeotropics 3aadaptive radiation 3ademography 3agenes 3agenomics 3alakes 3aphenotypic variation 3atransposons1 aHulsey, Christopher Darrin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9653-67281 aFruciano, Carmelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1659-97461 aWong, Wai Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2329-25661 aNater, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4805-55751 aKautt, Andreas F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7792-07351 aSimakov, Oleg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3585-45111 aPippel, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8134-59291 aKuraku, Shigehiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1464-83881 aMeyer, Axel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0888-81931 aFranchini, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8184-14630 tMolecular ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 30, no. 4 p.955-972dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.157743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011400165520185800279592002802137650001902165650001802184650001802202650001502220650001402235650001602249650001602265650001902281650001902300650001702319650002302336650001602359650002602375650001202401650001802413650001402431650002002445650003602465653001402501653001802515653001302533700001302546700002002559700005702579700001702636773009202653856008202745852000902827655001202836IND60710766520221119094039.0201023e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071076652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2020.1525792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zixiong10aDual TBK1/IKKε inhibitor amlexanox mitigates palmitic acid-induced hepatotoxicity and lipoapoptosis in vitro  aThe common causes of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Metabolic disorders and lipotoxic hepatocyte damage are hallmarks of NAFLD. Even though amlexanox, a dual inhibitor of TRAF associated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IκB kinase epsilon (IKKε), has been reported to effectively improve obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions in mice models, its molecular mechanism has not been fully investigated. This study was designed to investigate the effects of amlexanox on in vitro nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model induced by treatment of palmitic acid (PA, 0.4 mM), using a trans-well co-culture system of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs). Stimulation with PA significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of TBK1 and IKKε in both hepatocytes and KCs, suggesting a potential role of TBK1/IKKε in PA-induced NASH progression. Treatment of amlexanox (50 μM) showed significantly reduced phosphorylation of TBK1 and IKKε and hepatotoxicity as confirmed by decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase released from hepatocytes. Furthermore, PA-induced inflammation and lipotoxic cell death in hepatocytes were significantly reversed by amlexanox treatment. Intriguingly, amlexanox inhibited the activation of KCs and induced polarization of KCs towards M2 phenotype. Mechanistically, amlexanox treatment decreased the phosphorylation of interferon regulator factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB in PA-treated hepatocytes. However, decreased phosphorylation of NF-κB, not IRF3, was found in PA-treated KCs upon amlexanox treatment. Taken together, our findings show that treatment of amlexanox attenuated the severity of PA-induced hepatotoxicity in vitro and lipoapoptosis by the inhibition of TBK1/IKKε-NF-κB and/or IRF3 pathway in hepatocytes and KCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIKappaB kinase 3aKupffer cells 3aanimal models 3acell death 3acoculture 3afatty liver 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterferons 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aobesity 3apalmitic acid 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aAmlexanox 0aLipoapoptosis 0aIn vitro1 aQi, Jing1 aLim, Chae Woong1 aKim, Jong-Won1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7041-53111 aKim, Bumseok0 tToxicology.g2020 Nov., v. 444 p.152579-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2020.1525793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245025400167300001400421520148700435592002801922650002101950650001501971650001501986650002402001650001802025650001802043650001502061650001902076650002002095650002102115650002002136650001502156650002402171650001302195650001702208650001702225650001202242650002202254650001802276653002302294653003002317653003302347653002702380653001602407653002802423700001602451700001702467773014902484856008202633852000902715655001202724IND60639452220221122013740.0190712e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2019.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeimouri, Zahra10aMicrowave-assisted for clean and rapid fabrication of highly efficient magnetically separable activated carbon from agriculture shells for low grade industrial corn syrup decoloration: A novel strategy for impregnation of ternary catalytic composite  ap. 78-88.  aThe ternary catalytic composites, ZnCl2 + FeCl3 + FeCl2, were prepared according to the mixture design methodology and successfully impregnated on walnut and almond shells by microwave-assisted technique followed by carbonization at 500 °C in different atmospheres. The efficiency of fabricated adsorbents was evaluated by decoloration of industrial corn syrup, and the optimum catalytic composites were determined to enhance the performance of activated carbon. The efficiency of adsorbent produced from walnut shell was intensively enhanced with loading 50.0% FeCl3 onto the starting bio-resource. The decoloration efficiency of activated carbon can be increased up to 98% if 16.7% FeCl3 and the same content of FeCl2 are loaded on the almond shell. Also, to achieve appropriate efficiency, the microwave power should be controlled at level of 600 W to produce tar-like materials, independent of agriculture waste composition. Moreover, the carbonization time should be controlled at 30 min to improve the performance of adsorbents. The magnetic activated carbons fabricated as above procedure can be easily separated from corn syrup effluent by applying an external magnetic field. The adsorption efficiency of adsorbents fabricated from bio-resources in the closed vessel is at least 30% higher than those prepared in nitrogen atmosphere which is due to formation of micropores, 2.4 nm, providing a large surface area, 1000 m2 g−1, for syrup decoloration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagricultural wastes 3aalmond shells 3acarbonization 3acorn syrup 3adecolorization 3aferric chloride 3aferrous chloride 3amagnetic fields 3amicropores 3amicrowave treatment 3anitrogen 3asurface area 3awalnut hulls 3awalnuts 3awaste composition 3azinc chloride 0aAgriculture shells 0aMagnetic activated carbon 0aMicrowave-assisted technique 0aCatalytic impregnation 0aNano-porous 0aCorn syrup purification1 aSalem, Amin1 aSalem, Shiva0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2019 July, v. 116 p.78-88dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2019.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245015400163300001600317500001400333520143100347592002801778650002001806650001301826650001401839650001301853650001701866650001601883650001001899650001501909650001001924650002601934650001701960650001301977650004701990650001302037650002002050650001202070650001302082651001102095653002202106653002202128653000802150653001602158700002702174700003502201700002202236700002102258700002502279773010102304856007802405852000902483655001202492IND60698410620221118031645.0200612e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069841062DNAL7 a10.2478/acve-2020-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDejana, Savić10aEnterotoxin and Emetic Toxin Genes Profiles and Genetic Diversity of Bacillus cereus Isolated from Food, Environmental and Clinical Samples in Serbia  ap. 182-193.  aNAL-light  aBacillus cereus, usually ingested by food, can cause two types of disease due to the presence of toxins: vomiting and diarrhea syndrome. Systemic infections can also occur. The aim was to detect genes for enterotoxins (hblA, entFM) and emetic toxin (cer) and to investigate the genetic heterogeneity of B. cereus isolates from food, environment and human stool. Identification of B. cereus was performed by means of selective medium, classical biochemical test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Toxin genes were detected by PCR. Typing was performed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). EntFM gene was present in all stool and food samples and in 28/30 environmental isolates. HblA gene was present in 29/30 stool, 23/30 food and 24/30 environmental isolates. Cer gene was present in 30/30 stool, 28/30 food and 25/30 environmental isolates. The RAPD results show high heterogeneity among the isolates from each group. In the cumulative dendrogram, representative isolates from all three groups formed two clusters with a difference of 53%. The detection of toxin genes in all B. cereus isolates indicated these bacteria as potentially pathogenic and a serious threat for human health. The presence of isolates from all three groups in the same cluster suggests the existence of similar strains in the environment, food and patients, which is in line with the circulation of strains in nature through the food chain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3abacteria 3adetection 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxins 3aenvironment 3afeces 3afood chain 3agenes 3agenetic heterogeneity 3ahuman health 3apatients 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3asampling 3aselective media 3astrains 3avomiting 3aSerbia 0aenterotoxin genes 0aemetic toxin gene 0aPCR 0aRAPD typing1 aElizabeta, Ristanović1 aBiljana, Miljković Selimović1 aSonja, Radaković1 aDragana, Jošić1 aZorica, Lepšanović0 tActa veterinaria.g2020 June 01, v. 70, no. 2 p.182-193dSciendowJournal:22567x1820-74487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/acve-2020-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245008800195300001600283500001700299520094900316592002801265650002501293650000901318650001401327650001901341650001001360650002201370650001501392650002601407650001701433650001201450700001501462700002001477773013501497856007401632852000901706655001201715IND60749891720221116234706.0210908e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074989172DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.132402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlondel, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7473-507510aType IV dermoid sinus, intramedullary dermoid cyst and spina bifida in a Cane Corso  ap. 810-815.  aCase Reports  aA 1‐year‐old male Cane Corso was presented for progressive hindlimb neurologic deficits, with a history of suspected recurrent meningitis. Physical examination and advanced diagnostic imaging findings were suggestive of a thoracic dermoid sinus extending into the dura mater, and spina bifida. After initial medical treatment, the lesion was surgically excised, and the presence of an intramedullary cyst in continuation with the dermoid sinus was confirmed, requiring partial durectomy and myelotomy for removal. Histopathological examination of the excised tissue confirmed the diagnosis of a dermoid sinus associated with an intramedullary dermoid cyst. After surgery, the dog temporarily declined neurologically but then showed progressive neurological improvement. This report describes presentation and successful surgical treatment of a type IVa dermoid sinus associated with an intramedullary dermoid cyst and spina bifida in a dog.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical examination 3adogs 3ahindlimbs 3ahistopathology 3amales 3amedical treatment 3ameningitis 3asmall animal practice 3aspina bifida 3asurgery1 aDeprey, J.1 aMoissonnier, P.0 tjournal of small animal practice.g2021 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.810-815dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl45484x0022-45107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsap.132403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007700147245011600224300001400340520170000354592002802054650000802082650001102090650001402101650000902115650001802124650002502142650001202167650001502179650001302194650001702207650001002224650001602234650001902250650001802269653002202287653003002309653001302339653002502352653002702377653003302404700002202437700002202459773014902481856008202630852000902712655001202721IND60639452320221122013545.0190712e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2019.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamachandran, Rani Puthukulangara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7030-644910aComputational modelling of superheated steam drying of compacted distillers’ spent grain coated with solubles  ap. 63-77.  aSuperheated steam (SS) could be a more effective medium than hot air for drying slurry-like materials such as distillers spent grain. As large scale drying of spent grain slurry has many challenges related to handling and transportation, a multilayered/coated product drying approach, where wet material is dried over a relatively dry core, could provide a potential solution for effective drying. The present study focuses on 3D modelling of SS drying of compacted distillers’ spent grain coated with solubles. The drying experiments were conducted with cylindrical spent grain pellets with 25% moisture content coated with a thin layer of solubles (79 ± 2% moisture) at different SS temperatures (120, 150, 180 °C) and velocities (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 m/s). The effective moisture diffusivity and the thermo-physical properties of wet distillers’ grain pellets with or without solubles (0, 10, 30%, 100% w/w) were determined by experimentation. A coupling model was developed by combining the Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes and energy equations for the SS flow and the diffusion models for the coated pellet using computational fluid dynamics approach. The prediction model showed appreciable accuracy with maximum percentage error values for moisture and temperature curves of coated pellet as 9.1 and 8.0%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis for the SS operating conditions showed that the effect of SS temperatures is more prominent than that of SS velocities on drying time. Such models, capable of predicting heat and mass transfer phenomena of SS drying of multilayered products, can provide valuable information for the design or optimization of industrial-scale SS drying units.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adrying 3aequations 3aheat 3amass transfer 3amoisture diffusivity 3apellets 3aprediction 3aslurries 3aspent grains 3asteam 3atemperature 3atransportation 3awater content 0aSuperheated steam 0aDistillers’ spent grain 0aSolubles 0aMultilayered product 0aHeat and mass transfer 0aComputational fluid dynamics1 aPaliwal, Jitendra1 aCenkowski, Stefan0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2019 July, v. 116 p.63-77dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2019.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009100165300001600256500002000272520155600292592002801848650002301876650001401899650002101913650001401934650001301948650000901961650001901970650002601989700001702015700001802032700002002050773013502070856007402205852000902279655001202288IND60749891820221116234240.0210908e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074989182DNAL7 a10.1111/jsap.133092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaumet, A.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire evaluated the prevalence and perception of insurance among owners at a small animal specialty hospital over a 2 month period. Respondents provided demographic information including age, sex, educational level and household income. Respondents without insurance were asked reasons for not having insurance, approximate cost of insurance per month desired and percentage of coverage of medical expenses they would want insurance to provide. Respondents with insurance were asked how they chose their current plan, how it affects their medical decisions for their pet and their overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Sixty‐seven (28.5%) owners reporting having insurance for at least one pet. Owners most commonly selected their current insurance plan based on online research (27, 40.3%). Fifty‐two respondents (77.6%) reported being satisfied with their insurance plan and 49 (73.2%) stated that would recommend their current insurance plan to a friend. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Insurance had a relatively high prevalence in this study group with most owners being satisfied with their current plan and would be likely to recommend it to a friend. The role of insurance in how it affects owner's medical decisions, care for their pet and interactions with veterinarians in companion animal medicine requires further evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducational status 3ahospitals 3ahousehold income 3ainsurance 3amedicine 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3asmall animal practice1 aRossi, T.

In this study, an inoculum collected from an anaerobic reactor of a municipal WWTP was conditioned to suppress methanogenic activity. The heat-shock conditioning method of the inoculum proved to be more efficient than acid and alkaline conditioning methods for methanogens inhibition. Then, the pre-conditioned inoculum was used to determine the acidogenic potential of different wastes: three waste activated sludge (WAS) samples generated at different sludge retention times (SRTs, 2, 7 and 14 days), olive mill wastewater (OMW), glycerol, apple pomace (AP) and winterization oil cake (WOC). Batch tests were performed in quintuplicate at 37 °C and pH 7. A higher degree of acidification was observed for high-rate activated sludge (2 days of SRT) (69%), followed by olive mill wastewater (OMW) (43%), while the lowest was for glycerol (16%). The results for the winterization oil cake (WOC) samples interestingly elucidated a high content of propionic acid with a high odd-to-even ratio (0.86) after fermentation. Feeding the VFA profile obtained from WOC into a PHA production system led to a significant production of 0.64 g PHA g⁻¹ C with 30% polyhydrobutyrate (PHB) to 69% polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) as monomeric units of HB-co-HV, decoupling the need for a related carbon source for co-polymer production.  aPublisher supplied data  aCTQ2017-82404-RcMinisterio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España 3aacidification 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digesters 3aapple pomace 3abiomass 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acomposite polymers 3afermentation 3afood industry 3aglycerol 3ainoculum 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3aolive mill wastewater 3apH 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3apropionic acid 3avolatile fatty acids1 aGea, Teresa1 aArtola, Adriana1 aFuentes, Javier1 aCarrera, Julián,1 aSuárez-Ojeda, María Eugenia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2520-27010 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.6861-6873dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-021-01480-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012500159300001600284500002000300520125700320592002801577596003501605596003101640596003901671596003701710650002501747650002101772650001401793650002301807650000901830650001101839650001301850650001101863650001101874650002201885650001501907651002101922700006201943773012302005856007402128852000902202655001202211IND60787040720221122105604.0220807e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078704072DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.140692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsner, Rick A.10aBehavioural changes during the parr–smolt transformation in coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch: is it better to be cool?  ap. 793-801.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBehavioural changes that occur during the parr–smolt transformation were investigated in juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch. Fish from two populations were examined from the Fraser River catchment in British Columbia, Canada; a short and a long‐distance migrating population. Fish showed a significant decrease in condition factor and significant increase in gill Na⁺K⁺‐ATPase activity during the spring indicating that they became competent smolts, but no difference between populations. Temperature preference trials were conducted using a shuttlebox system throughout the spring. Mean temperature preference did not differ between the two populations, but preferred temperature decreased with development from 16.5 ± 0.3°C for parr to 15.5 ± 0.4°C for smolts. Mean swimming velocity was also greater in smolts than parr, but there was no difference between the two populations. The preference for warmer water temperature observed for parr in early spring may be advantageous for stimulating smolt development. Preference for slightly cooler temperatures observed for smolts would sustain elevated seawater tolerance during the smolt window by a short time and may ensure successful transition to the marine environment.  aPublisher supplied data  a227873‐2012cNSERC Discovery  cNSERC graduate scholarship  cUNBC graduate entrance scholarship  cResearch project award from UNBC 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3acondition factor 3ajuveniles 3amarine environment 3aparr 3arivers 3aseawater 3asmolts 3aspring 3awater temperature 3awatersheds 3aBritish Columbia1 aShrimpton, J.

Thirty Anglo Nubian crossbred does received a diet for 4 weeks to satisfy the nutritional requirements of breeding for adult non‐dairy goats. Seven days prior to oocyte recovery (OR), a group of does (n = 10) was supplemented with ground full‐fat linseed in the diet (Diet A), whereas a second group of does (n = 10) received crude glycerine in the diet (Diet B). The total mixed ration (TMR) diet was maintained as the Control Diet (n = 10). All animals were oestrous‐synchronized by the use of a progesterone insert for 12 days prior to OR. Follicles were stimulated by using pFSH (five 40‐mg/ml doses) during the supplementation time. At OR, follicles were counted and recovered oocytes were classified as viable or degenerated. Follicular dynamics was monitored by ultrasonography, and plasma glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured during supplementation. Glucose was higher in Diet B and cholesterol in Diet A. Diet B had a lower proportion of small (<3 mm) and large follicles (≥3 mm; p = 0.01). The follicular growth rate was higher in Diet A (p < 0.01), with follicles emerging in the 5th day of supplementation. No differences were observed for follicles counted and oocytes recovered. Thus, the type of energy source supplemented for a short term was capable to alter the follicular dynamics, without affecting the proportion of morphologically viable oocytes upon recovery.  aPublisher supplied data  a408623/2016-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3abreeding 3acholesterol 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3aenergy 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3agoats 3alinseed 3anutrient requirements 3aoocytes 3aprogesterone 3atotal mixed rations 3atriacylglycerols 3aultrasonography1 aFernandes, César Carneiro Linhares1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6205-70861 aRossetto, Rafael1 aSilva, Caroline Pessoa da1 aGalvão, Iolly Tábata Oliveira Marques1 aBertolini, Marcelo1 aRondina, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0474-88950 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.1206-1216dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.135003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245016500210300001400375520188100389592002802270596005702298596005702355596005702412596006202469596006202531650002202593650001102615650001902626650001602645650001702661650002902678650001102707650001902718650001902737650002302756650001602779650001302795650002502808700005902833773012102892856008303013852000903096655001203105IND60739388620221119045503.0220220e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073938862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-021-00833-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsujimoto, Katsuto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1619-816810aEstimating leaf photosynthesis of C3 plants grown under different environments from pigment index, photochemical reflectance index, and chlorophyll fluorescence  ap. 33-46.  aPhotosynthetic rates vary depending on growth conditions, even within species. Remote sensing techniques have a great potential to predict the photosynthetic rates of leaves with different characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that the photosynthetic rates of leaves acclimated to different light and nutrient conditions can be estimated based on the chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF), the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and a chlorophyll index. Chenopodium album plants were grown under different light and nutrient conditions. PRI, ChlF parameters, and CO₂/H₂O gas exchange rates of leaves were simultaneously determined under the various light and CO₂ conditions. PRI was used to assess non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), but the relationship between NPQ and PRI was weakened when the data on leaves grown under different conditions were pooled, because PRI in darkness ([Formula: see text]) changed with the leaf pigment composition. Among 15 pigment indices, we found that [Formula: see text], a reflectance index related to the leaf chlorophyll content, had the best correlation with [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) across the studied leaves, and the correction of PRI by [Formula: see text] improved the predictability of NPQ ([Formula: see text]). Using the steady-state ChlF, the NPQ estimated from PRI and [Formula: see text], and the stomatal conductance coefficient, we calculated the CO₂ assimilation rates, which were strongly correlated with the actual rates (RMSE = 4.85 [Formula: see text]mol m[Formula: see text] s[Formula: see text]), irrespective of growth conditions. Our approach has the potential to contribute to a more accurate estimation of photosynthetic rates in remote sensing. However, further studies on species variations and connecting with radiative transfer models are needed to demonstrate this at the canopy scale.  aPublisher supplied data  a17J05444cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a18H03350cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a17H03727cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a25660113cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JP)  a2-1903cEnvironmental Restoration and Conservation Agency 3aChenopodium album 3acanopy 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3agas exchange 3aleaf chlorophyll content 3aleaves 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosynthesis 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance 3aresearch 3astomatal conductance1 aHikosaka, Kouki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1744-37750 tPhotosynthesis research.g2021 May, v. 148, no. 1-2 p.33-46dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-021-00833-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245008300211300001800294520162400312592002801936596012501964596004402089596005602133650001202189650001702201650001702218650001602235650001102251650000902262650001802271650002602289650000902315650001402324650002002338700002302358700002302381700002202404700002102426773012702447856008302574852000902657655001202666IND60756326720221123034032.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075632672DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-021-01474-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNevrlý, Vlastimír1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6613-034010aOffshore Conceptual Plastic Waste Collection and Treatment Towards Clean Ocean  ap. 6523-6541.  aThe recent social care about the concentration of plastics in the ocean arises with the necessity of developing solutions to this problem. Some projects are dealing with the technology of collection, however, the follow-up transfer onshore is not usually included in the solution. This study suggests designing a vessel with available waste treatment technologies that can use the waste to recover energy. Simultaneously, the technologic vessel has to regularly visit collectors and ports to supply produced commodities and crew. A mixed integer linear model is developed to find the optimal balance between capacities of considered technologies and also to simulate the voyage with all respective operations. Waste-to-Energy, pyrolysis, desalination, sorting and other mechanical processes are assumed onboard. The vessel is designed to utilize the produced energy and products onboard including heat generation, electricity, water, and oil. The evaluation of suitable technologies is realized through techno-economic models which are needed for all considered subsystems from the complex treatment chain. The analysis of project viability requires detailed multi-disciplinary data. The main output of the presented approach is sensitivity analysis for critical parameters, which gives greater insight into the issue and directs further research from a general level through the concept to refine the input data and boundary conditions of the task in the model. The Pacific Garbage Patch was chosen as the testing area for the case study. The presented approach enables to compare different ways of plastic processing.  aPublisher supplied data  aCZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15_ 003/0000456cCzech Republic Operational Programme Research and Development, Education, Priority 1  aCZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_026/0008413cERDF  aTE02000236cTechnology Agency of the Czech Republic 3abiomass 3acase studies 3adesalination 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aheat 3alinear models 3amunicipal solid waste 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3awaste treatment1 aŠomplák, Radovan1 aSzásziová, Lenka1 aPluskal, Jaroslav1 aProcházka, Vít0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.6523-6541dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-021-01474-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245011900203520130200322592002801624650001401652650001101666650001301677650001801690650001001708650002401718650001401742653004101756653002401797653002701821653002301848653002401871700001801895700001801913700005801931700002001989773009002009856008502099852000902184655001202193IND60731450220221120061133.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073145022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7262-092512aA novel methodology for design optimization of heat recovery steam generators with flow-induced vibration analysis  aDesign of compact, lightweight, and robust heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) is important for the implementation of offshore bottoming cycles. In this work, a novel methodology integrating flow-induced vibration analysis is proposed for the design optimization of HRSG. The vibration analysis considers four main flow-induced vibration mechanisms, namely turbulent buffeting, vortex shedding, fluidelastic instability, and acoustic resonance. The corresponding sub-models are selected from literature for estimating vibrations of finned tube bundles. The design criteria for vibration are included in the optimization problem as constraints, which affect the decision of the solver simultaneously. The methodology is demonstrated by three cases, in which not only geometric parameters but also operating parameters are set as design variables. With activating vibration constraints, the solver finds appropriate geometric and operating parameters to meet the design requirements. The comparison between the optimizations with and without the vibration constraints shows a trade-off between compactness, lightweight, efficient heat transfer, and the possibility of flow-induced vibration problems. This indicates the importance of consideration of vibration problems when designing such HRSGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aenergy 3ageometry 3aheat recovery 3asteam 3asystem optimization 3avibration 0aHeat recovery steam generator (HRSG) 0aDesign optimization 0aFlow-induced vibration 0aVibration analysis 0aFinned tube bundles1 aSkaugen, Geir1 aNæss, Erling1 aZhang, Mingjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6872-74821 aØiseth, Ole A.0 tEnergy.g2021 July 01, v. 226 p.120325-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245006500168300001800233520123200251592002801483650002401511650002401535650001001559650002301569650001101592651001801603700002601621700001901647700002001666700002201686700003101708773009201739856004801831852000901879655001201888IND4474887120221118063346.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447488712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-011-9975-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinter, Stephen L.10aFire tolerance of a resprouting Artemisia (Asteraceae) shrub  ap. 2085-2094.  aIn North America, most Artemisia (Asteraceae) shrub species lack the ability to resprout after disturbances that remove aboveground biomass. We studied the response of one of the few resprouting Artemisia shrubs, Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), to the effects of prescribed fires. We collected data on A. filifolia density and structural characteristics (height, canopy area, and canopy volume) in an A. filifolia shrubland in the southern Great Plains of North America. Our study sites included areas that had not been treated with prescribed fire, areas that had been treated with only one prescribed fire within the previous 5 years, and areas that had been treated with two prescribed fires within the previous 10 years. Our data were collected at time periods ranging from ½ to 5 years after the prescribed fires. Density of A. filifolia was not affected by one or two fires. Structural characteristics, although initially altered by prescribed fire, recovered to levels characteristic of unburned areas in 3–4 years after those fires. In contrast to most non-sprouting North American Artemisia shrub species, our research suggested that the resprouting A. filifolia is highly tolerant to the effects of fire.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia filifolia 3aaboveground biomass 3afires 3aprescribed burning 3ashrubs 3aNorth America1 aFuhlendorf, Samuel D.1 aGoad, Carla L.1 aDavis, Craig A.1 aHickman, Karen R.1 aLeslie, David M., Jr.cJr.0 tPlant ecology.g2011 Dec., v. 212, no. 12 p.2085-2094dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-011-9975-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007600170300001600246520133800262592002801600650002701628650002501655650002001680700002101700700002301721700002101744773012401765856008301889852000901972655001201981IND60682748720221119001803.0200215e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068274872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-019-02444-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrđević, Zorica10aHybrid Constructed Wetland Selection as a Group Decision-Making Problem  ap. 295-310.  aThis paper proposes a framework based on the group analytic hierarchy process for identifying most desirable technologies for constructed wetland segmentation. A method is defined how to select decision makers whose evaluations should be included into the group decision by calculating different consistency and statistical conformity measures, and their aggregation into the new metrics. The consistency ratio, the total Euclidean distance, and the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient are used to create the three two-dimensional metrics and the one three-dimensional metric to determine the distances of the decision makers from the reference points corresponding to full consistency and statistical conformity. The mapping the decision makers into the consistency/conformity scatter plots enables visualizing the outlier(s), that is, the decision makers who have different opinions about which technologies to apply in wetland segmentation than the decision makers on average. The scatter plots may guide the decision-making process towards grouping the decision makers into sub groups, thus heading towards consensus in both sub groups and global group. The approach is demonstrated on a numerical example application in which five decision makers are assessing six criteria of a constructed wetland segmentation selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aconstructed wetlands 3adecision making1 aSrđević, Bojan1 aSuvočarev, Kosana1 aGalamboš, Laslo0 tWater resources management.g2020 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.295-310dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02444-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245010100202300001400303520148100317592002801798596005901826650001101885650002401896650001801920650000901938650001701947650001201964650002201976650001501998700001402013700001702027700001802044773012202062856008302184852000902267655001202276IND60682748820221119001453.0200215e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068274882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-019-02392-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ting1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1330-593010aOverland Flow along Stone Covered Slope Land Simulated with Semi-Analytical and Numerical Models  ap. 51-69.  aOverland flow is an important hydrological response of catchments to rainstorms and contributes to soil erosion and nutrient loss. The kinematic wave model is known to describe the transformation of rainfall to overland flow. Through this, field studies were conducted on a hillslope to simulate water scouring from upstream with a complex surface condition, which was covered with different sizes and percentages of stones. Existing semi-analytical and numerical models were adopted to describe the overland flow in the field. Results indicate that both semi-analytical and numerical models could be applied to describe the process of overland flow. Furthermore, predicted outflow rates by the semi-analytical and the numerical model showed strong correlation with the field measured outflow rates, respectively (NS = (0.926, 0.942, 0.992), RE = (5.5%, 4.7%, 1.7%) for the semi-analytical model, and NS = (0.817, 0.952, 0.992), RE = (5.5%, 5.5%, 2.1%) for the numerical model). Besides, hydraulic parameters (Reynolds number-Re, Froude numbers-Fr, Darcy-Weisbach-f, hydraulic shear stress-τ, stream power-ω, water wave celerity-vw) at any time and distance could be described by the semi-analytical method, and the parameter n/h (an important factor indicating the energy of water and wave flow celerity) could successfully characterize the average hydraulic parameters, and all of the hydraulic parameters are fitted to the expression of y = a(n/h)ᵇ.  aPublisher supplied data  a51239009cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3aoverland flow 3arain 3asoil erosion 3astreams 3atopographic slope 3awatersheds1 aSu, Lijun1 aWu, Laosheng1 aWang, Quanjiu0 tWater resources management.g2020 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.51-69dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02392-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014300159300001800302500002000320520124500340592002801585596006701613650001001680650002101690650002701711650002301738650001301761650002301774650001101797650002001808650003201828650002601860650001001886650001601896700001801912700002001930700006201950773013502012856007302147852000902220655001202229IND60669592720221118102515.0190920e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066959272DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.135082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sang‐Hee10aEffect of nicotinic acid on the plasma membrane function and polyunsaturated fatty acids composition during cryopreservation in boar sperm  ap. 1251-1257.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effect of nicotinic acid on plasma membrane integrity and fatty acid composition in frozen–thawed boar sperm. Boar semen was cryopreserved using freezing extender containing nicotinic acid (NA), then plasma membrane integrity, osmotic equilibration, lipid peroxidation and fatty acid were analysed. The plasma membrane integrity of frozen–thawed sperm was significantly higher in the 10 mM NA than in the 0 and 20 mM NA treatment groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, the osmotic equilibration ability was not different in treatment groups, but lipid peroxidation was significantly decreased in the 10 mM NA treatment group (p < 0.05). The saturated fatty acids were significantly decreased in the 10 mM NA treatment group, and C18:1n‐9, C18:2n‐6, C20:4n‐6, C22:5n‐6 and C22:6n‐3, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were significantly increased in the 10 mM NA treatment groups (p < 0.05). In summary, 10 mM NA improved plasma membrane integrity, inhibited lipid peroxidation and increased PUFAs in frozen–thawed boar sperm. These results suggest that NA may be useful to protect the plasma membrane and inhibit the loss of PUFAs for sperm cryopreservation in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF 2017R1D1A3B03036349cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aboars 3acryopreservation 3afatty acid composition 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3alipid peroxidation 3aniacin 3aplasma membrane 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3asemen 3aspermatozoa1 aKim, Yu‐Jin1 aHo Kang, Byeong1 aPark, Choon‐Keun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7226-80950 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 Sept., v. 54, no. 9 p.1251-1257dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.135083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245012800164520111400292592002801406650002701434650001701461650002701478650001601505650001701521650002001538650001301558650001301571650001701584650002001601653002601621653005101647653002501698653002701723653002001750700001701770700002001787700001801807700001601825773010601841856008701947852000902034655001202043IND60639453020221120034609.0190606e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Jin10aComparative analysis of rhamnolipid congener synthesis in neotype Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and two marine isolates  aA comparative study of rhamnolipid congener synthesis was performed using the neotype Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and two marine isolates (1A01151 and 1A00364). Compared with the neotype, 1A01151 and 1A00364 showed increased production of rhamnolipids containing higher proportion of congeners with longer fatty acid chains (C10-C12 and C10-C12:1) and/or di-rhamnose moiety. These could reduce surface tension of water to lower minimum values of 21.3 mN m−1 and 25.7 mN m−1. The comparative profile of rhamnolipid congener composition, fatty acid content and gene expression suggested that elevated expression of rhlAB and rhlC throughout the fermentation process and enhanced accumulation of dTDP-l-rhamnose and fatty acid precursors (C12 and C12:1) at the onset of rhamnolipid accumulation were related to improved rhamnolipid production and surface-active property. This work provides insights into the metabolic relationship between rhamnolipids and related precursor biosynthesis, and could therefore be beneficial for process optimization for efficient rhamnolipid congener production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abiosynthesis 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3agene expression 3amoieties 3aneotypes 3arhamnolipids 3asurface tension 0aRhamnolipid congeners 0a3-(3-Hydroxyalkanoyloxy) alkanoic acids (HAAs) 0aFatty acid synthesis 0aPseudomonas aeruginosa 0aMarine isolates1 aZhang, Aijun1 aZhang, Xiaoqing1 aSi, Xiaoguang1 aCao, Junrui0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Aug., v. 286 p.121380-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245010900195300001800304500001900322500002000341520154900361592002801910596004601938596003901984596004902023596005202072650001502124650001802139650001902157650001502176650001002191650001302201650002502214650002502239651001202264651001602276700006002292700002202352700002102374700002602395700002002421700001902441700001802460700002302478700002002501700002102521700006002542773011902602856007302721852000902794655001202803IND60727920620221119210107.0210214e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072792062DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.157762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Zhishuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2971-057010aAquatic food webs in deep temperate lakes: Key species establish through their autecological versatility  ap. 1053-1071.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicrobial planktonic communities are the basis of food webs in aquatic ecosystems since they contribute substantially to primary production and nutrient recycling. Network analyses of DNA metabarcoding data sets emerged as a powerful tool to untangle the complex ecological relationships among the key players in food webs. In this study, we evaluated co‐occurrence networks constructed from time‐series metabarcoding data sets (12 months, biweekly sampling) of protistan plankton communities in surface layers (epilimnion) and bottom waters (hypolimnion) of two temperate deep lakes, Lake Mondsee (Austria) and Lake Zurich (Switzerland). Lake Zurich plankton communities were less tightly connected, more fragmented and had a higher susceptibility to a species extinction scenario compared to Lake Mondsee communities. We interpret these results as a lower robustness of Lake Zurich protistan plankton to environmental stressors, especially stressors resulting from climate change. In all networks, the phylum Ciliophora contributed the highest number of nodes, among them several in key positions of the networks. Associations in ciliate‐specific subnetworks resembled autecological species‐specific traits that indicate adaptions to specific environmental conditions. We demonstrate the strength of co‐occurrence network analyses to deepen our understanding of plankton community dynamics in lakes and indicate biotic relationships, which resulted in new hypotheses that may guide future research in climate‐stressed ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aSTO414/13‐1cGerman Research Foundation  aI2238‐B25cAustrian Science Fund  a31003A‐182489cNational Science Foundation  a310030E‐160603/1cNational Science Foundation 3aCiliophora 3aDNA barcoding 3aclimate change 3aextinction 3alakes 3aplankton 3aprimary productivity 3atime series analysis 3aAustria 3aSwitzerland1 aForster, Dominik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2332-76501 aBruni, Estelle P.1 aFrantal, Daniela1 aKammerlander, Barbara1 aNachbaur, Laura1 aPitsch, Gianna1 aPosch, Thomas1 aPröschold, Thomas1 aTeubner, Katrin1 aSonntag, Bettina1 aStoeck, Thorsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5180-56590 tMolecular ecology.g2021 Feb., v. 30, no. 4 p.1053-1071dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.157763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245008900163300001400252520079600266592002801062650001701090650002401107650001101131650001001142650002501152650002701177650003701204650001001241650002501251650002301276650001301299650000901312650001101321650003401332650001201366650002101378653001401399653001101413653001601424653002701440653001501467700002501482700002301507700002501530773011201555856007701667852000901744655001201753IND60698411620221118031652.0200612e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069841162DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2020-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkinyemi, Banjo10aInnovative Husk-Crete Building Materials from Rice Chaff and Modified Cement Mortars  ap. 67-72.  aThe study considers the use of rice chaffs (husks) as an aggregate in a composite cement matrix system.

The antibacterial mode of brevibacillins against Salmonella typhimurium CICC 21493 was investigated by quantum chemistry calculation in this study. The addition of LPS, Mg²⁺, and Ca²⁺ partially reduced the antimicrobial activity of brevibacillin and brevibacillin V against S. typhimurium, which indicated that the two cationic lipopeptides could bind to LPS and displaced the divalent cations on the LPS network. Release of LPS from S. typhimurium by brevibacillin and brevibacillin V resulted in destroying the dense LPS network and increasing the permeability of the outer membrane. Quantum chemistry calculation analysis revealed that Lys7 is the most critical amino acid residue to destroy the outer membrane. The total average N-H charge difference of the three protonated amino groups (Orn3-NH₃, Lys7-NH₃, and Lys10-NH₃) determined the ability of brevibacillin V to bind LPS stronger than brevibacillin. Calcein complete leakage from liposomes and release of DiSC₃-5 from the cytoplasmic membrane (CM) indicated that brevibacillin and brevibacillin V may destroy the CM. Brevibacillin and brevibacillin V exhibited their antimicrobial activities through membrane damages, where the OM permeability with high concentration of 64-256 µg/mL and membrane damage of CM with a low concentration of 4 μg/mL. Our finding might be helpful to understand the broad-spectrum antimicrobial mechanism of cationic lipopeptide and to design the novel antimicrobial peptide. KEY POINTS: • Brevibacillin V had stronger affinity for LPS than brevibacillin. • The N-H charge difference was the key of the difference in the affinity to LPS. • Brevibacillins inhibited Salmonella by displacing the divalent cations on the LPS.  aPublisher supplied data  a32072182cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31771948cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBrevibacillus laterosporus 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibacterial proteins 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial cationic peptides 3abacterial outer membranes 3acalcium 3alipopeptides 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliposomes (artificial) 3amagnesium 3amembrane permeability1 aNie, Ting1 aMeng, Fanqiang1 aZhou, Libang1 aChen, Meirong1 aSun, Jing1 aLu, Zhaoxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9288-74191 aLu, Yingjian0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2021 July, v. 105, no. 13 p.5643-5655dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11398-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245011800173300001800291520164100309592002801950596002201978596002202000596002702022596003502049650004402084650001802128650001202146650001202158650001402170650002302184650002502207650001302232650001302245650001102258650001302269650001402282650002402296650001802320650001102338650002302349650002102372650001202393650001102405700002002416700002202436700002702458700002002485700002102505700002302526700002802549773012702577856008302704852000902787655001202796IND60756327520221122224335.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075632752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-021-01494-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsorio-Vargas, Paula10aThermal Behavior, Reaction Pathways and Kinetic Implications of Using a Ni/SiO2 Catalyst for Waste Tire Pyrolysis  ap. 6465-6479.  aCatalytic pyrolysis has been used to upgrading the quality of pyrolytic liquids. Herein, we report a comprehensive study on the catalytic pyrolysis of waste tires using Ni/SiO₂ as catalysts. The analyses were carried out by combining thermogravimetry (TGA), TGA interfaced to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (TGA–FTIR), and pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (Py–GC/MS) techniques. During waste tire decomposition, the main functional groups detected in the FTIR were alkenes, aromatics, and heteroatoms-containing groups such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. Meanwhile, by Py–GC/MS were identified mainly D,L-limonene, isoprene, benzene, toluene, xylenes (BTX), and p-cymene. The Py–GC/MS experiments at three different temperatures (350, 400, and 450 °C) suggested an effect of the catalyst on product distribution. The Ni catalyst promoted cyclization reactions and subsequently aromatization, leading to an improved vapors composition. The use of iso-conversional kinetic models along with master plots allows proposing a multiple-step reaction mechanism, which was well described by the Avrami–Erofeev, Random Scission, and truncated Sestak–Berggren models. The values of activation energies show differences for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed pyrolysis (111.0 kJ mol⁻¹ and 168.4 kJ mol⁻¹), validating the effectivity of Ni/SiO₂. Finally, the thermal Biot (> 1) and Pyᴵ and Pyᴵᴵ numbers (10–³ < Pyᴵ < 10–¹ and 10–² < Pyᴵᴵ < 10–³) confirms that the process is being occurred between the kinetic and the convection-limited regimes.  aPublisher supplied data  a3190610cFONDECYT  a1190063cFONDECYT  a170077cFONDEQUIP EQMI  a170007cCONICYT PIA/Apoyo CCTE 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaromatization 3abenzene 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acleavage (chemistry) 3aisoprene 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3ap-cymene 3apyrolysis 3areaction mechanisms 3aspectrometers 3asulfur 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3atoluene 3awastes1 aLick, Ileana D.1 aSobrevía, Felipe1 aCorrea-Muriel, Daniela1 aMenares, Tamara1 aManrique, Raydel1 aCasella, Monica L.1 aArteaga-Pérez, Luis E.0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.6465-6479dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-021-01494-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245010000179520138400279592002801663650001201691650001601703650001401719650001701733650001101750650001501761650001301776650001901789650002401808650001101832653002401843653002601867653001101893653002801904700002101932700002401953700002501977700006902002773009002071856008502161852000902246655001202255IND60731450920221120132723.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073145092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiranarongkorn, Kunlanan10aExergy and exergoeconomic analyses of sustainable furfural production via reactive distillation  aLignocellulosic biomass is a potential renewable resource for production of high-value, sustainable products. Furfural is among the important bio-based chemicals in biorefineries. However, the conventional process of furfural production using a reaction-separation network entails low product yield but high fixed and operating costs owing to the complex process of separation. In this study, a process of furfural production via reactive distillation (RD) was investigated and designed based on the concept of process intensification. Exergy and exergoeconomic analyses were applied to evaluate the process performance. When the RD column was operated at its optimal configuration, furfural production of 81.78 kg h⁻¹ was achieved with xylose conversion and furfural yield of 97.9% and 97.4%, respectively. The exergy efficiency of furfural production was 56.41%, while the RD column exhibited the maximum exergy destruction rate among all components with an exergy efficiency of 69.82%. The exergy destruction rate declined with decrease in the reboiler duty of the RD column and increase in xylose concentration. The exergoeconomic analysis revealed that decreasing the reboiler duty had the highest impact on the total cost of furfural production. Decreases in feedstock and catalyst costs as well as interest rate additionally lowered the total cost rate of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acatalysts 3adistillation 3aexergy 3afeedstocks 3afurfural 3alignocellulose 3arenewable resources 3axylose 0aFurfural production 0aReactive distillation 0aExergy 0aExergoeconomic analysis1 aIm-orb, Karittha1 aPanpranot, Joongjai1 aMaréchal, François1 aArpornwichanop, Amornchai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9259-50100 tEnergy.g2021 July 01, v. 226 p.120339-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245017600179300001800355520171700373592002802090596004002118596004002158650001402198650001402212650002302226650002002249650001502269650001302284650002102297650001502318650001202333650001202345650001502357650002502372651001702397700002002414700006402434773012702498856008302625852000902708655001202717IND60756327620221122224302.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075632762DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-021-01492-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGumbi, S’fiso Thuthukani10aNutrient Removal from Dairy and Poultry Wastewater with Simultaneous Biomass and Biodiesel Production by Chlorella sp. T4 Isolated from a Freshwater Stream in South Africa  ap. 6931-6943.  aINTRODUCTION: Huge amounts of wastewater are generated during food process, and usually contain high nutrient concentration. The present study investigated the feasibility of dairy and poultry wastewaters as growth media for Chlorella sp. T4 cultivation for concomitant nutrient removal and biomass propagation for biofuel production. METHODS: Microalgae Chlorella sp. T4 was cultivated in poultry and dairy wastewater collected at different stage of wastewater treatment to study the growth, physiological respond, nutrient removal efficiency and biochemical composition. RESULTS: The strains showed phycoremediation potential resulting to high nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency in dairy and poultry wastewater ranging from 85–95% and 35–93%, respectively. High biomass yield of 1.28 ± 0.1 g L⁻¹ was obtained in poultry wastewater compared to 0.85 ± 0.02 g L⁻¹ obtained in dairy wastewater. The biomass contained significant amounts of lipids (16.2–25.7 % Dry wt.), carbohydrates (20.7–33.1 % Dry wt.), and proteins (24.5–34.6 % Dry wt.), regardless of the wastewater type. The fatty acid analysis revealed that palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), and linoleic (18:2) acids were the major fatty acids accumulated by Chlorella sp. T4 when cultivated in poultry and dairy wastewater. Biodiesel properties of lipids extracted from the cell grown in poultry and dairy wastewater complied with most of the international standards by ASTM D6751 and EN 14214. CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed that Chlorella sp. T4 is a potential candidate for dairy and poultry wastewater treatment, with a significant accumulation of lipid, protein and carbohydrates for use in biofuel production.  aPublisher supplied data  a92803cNational Research Foundation  a94043cNational Research Foundation 3aChlorella 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3afuel production 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3apoultry 3astreams 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aSouth Africa1 aMutanda, Taurai1 aOlaniran, Ademola O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0586-05580 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.6931-6943dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-021-01492-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015600209300002000365500001900385520171700404592002802121650001602149650002202165650001402187650001402201650003502215650001502250650001102265650001402276650001302290651002502303651001202328700001902340700002302359700001902382773015402401856008302555852000902638655001202647IND60739389420221119045328.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073938942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05060-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucarelli, Chiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9028-247510aMicrochemical, structural and mineralogical study of ancient Moroccan pyrometallurgical remains and data sharing through the support of a QGIS software  ap. 25155-25165.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe mining areas of the Middle Atlas, already inhabited in the Neolithic period, have been under the influences of different cultures, firstly Phoenician, then Punic or Ibero-Punic, Berber, Roman and finally Islamic. The impact of external cultures on the evolution and development of ancient metallurgy in the north-central Atlas region and the Southern Rift occurred since prehistoric times to Arab domination in the Middle Ages. This study proposes the development of an up-to-date protocol for archaeometallurgical investigation, based on the correlation between the chemical-physical analysis of the pyrometallurgical materials and the contextual systematic geoarchaeological excavations. The microchemical analysis has been carried out on opportunely selected pyrometallurgical materials, coming from different mining areas of the Middle Atlas regions in Morocco (Tabarouch for Cu and Aouam for Pb/Ag) in order to understand the evolution of the technological knowledge in archaeometallurgical work of local people. After that, the analytical results have been included in a Geographic Information System (GIS) software with the aim of creating an easily usable database that will support multidisciplinary research on the ancient metallurgical activities also with its future development and implementation. The GIS application could indeed correlate all the data coming from different extraction/work sites, present in the exploited mining veins. Furthermore, the GIS application is a starting point for an integrated study of the different mining archaeological sites in the Mediterranean basin proposing an innovative method of data exchange of archaeological, physical and geological chemical results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchaeology 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3aevolution 3ageographic information systems 3ametallurgy 3apeople 3apollution 3aresearch 3aMediterranean region 3aMorocco1 aFerro, Daniela1 aSusanna, Fiammetta1 ade Caro, Tilde0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 20 p.25155-25165dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05060-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010100168500002200269520137700291592002801668650001601696650002401712650001201736650002501748650001801773650002001791650000901811650002801820650001901848650001501867650001101882650001301893653001001906653001001916653001001926653000801936653000801944653000701952653000801959653000801967653000801975653000701983653000801990653000901998653001002007653001102017653001702028653000902045653000902054653001702063653001402080700002002094700001802114700001902132700001702151700001602168773009002184856008602274852000902360655001202369IND60656997120221121023400.0190819e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065699712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1052732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYen, Hsiu-Ju10aToxic effects of silver and copper nanoparticles on lateral-line hair cells of zebrafish embryos  aPre-press version  aThe potential toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs) to the early stages of fish is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the toxic effects of silver (AgNPs) and copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) on lateral-line hair cells of zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish embryos were incubated in different concentrations of AgNPs and CuNPs at 0˜96 h post-fertilization (hpf). Both AgNPs and CuNPs were found to cause toxic effects in zebrafish embryos in a dose-dependent manner. Values of the 96-h 50% lethal concentration (LC50) of AgNPs and CuNPs were 6.1 ppm (56.5 μM) and 2.61 ppm (41.1 μM), respectively. The number of FM1-43-labeled hair cells and the microstructure of hair bundles were significantly impaired by AgNPs [≥1 ppm (9.3 μM)] and CuNPs [≥0.01 ppm (0.16 μM)]. Ca2+ influxes at hair bundles of hair cells were measured with a scanning ion-selective microelectrode technique to evaluate the function of hair cells. AgNPs [≥0.1 ppm (0.9 μM)] and CuNPs [≥0.01 ppm (0.16 μM)] were both found to significantly reduce Ca2+ influxes. Similar toxic effects were also found in hatched embryos subjected to 4 h of exposure (96˜100 hpf) to AgNPs and CuNPs. This study revealed that lateral-line hair cells of zebrafish are susceptible to AgNPs and CuNPs, and these contaminants in aquatic environments could pose a threat to fish survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aaquatic environment 3acalcium 3acopper nanoparticles 3adose response 3aembryo (animal) 3afish 3alethal concentration 50 3amicrostructure 3ananosilver 3asilver 3atoxicity 0aAgNPs 0aANOVA 0aCuNPs 0ahpf 0aPBS 0aLC 0aMET 0aNPs 0aAFW 0aSE 0aSEM 0aSIET 0aTUNEL 0aDASPEI 0ananoparticle 0agill 0askin 0alateral line 0ahair cell1 aHorng, Jiun-Lin1 aYu, Ching-Hua1 aFang, Ching-Ya1 aYeh, Ya-Hsin1 aLin, Li-Yih0 tAquatic toxicology.g2019 Aug. 13, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2019.1052733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003000143245012800173300001400301520171500315592002802030650002902058650000902087650002402096650002402120650001202144650001802156650002602174650001402200650001702214650001402231650001002245650001402255650002102269650002102290650001102311653001902322653001602341653001802357653001802375700003102393700003402424700003502458700002102493700003702514700003002551773011202581856007702693852000902770655001202779IND60698411820221119114701.0200612e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069841182DNAL7 a10.2478/ata-2020-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Castro, Bruno Dorneles10aRecycled Green PE Composites Reinforced with Woven and Randomly Arranged Sisal Fibres Processed by Hot Compression Moulding  ap. 81-86.  aGreen plastics are constantly being used to minimize the negative impacts of the polymers made of fossil fuels such as petroleum. Non-renewable petroleum-based products are employed in wide range of human activities, yet plastic waste accumulation represents a serious issue for the environment (Mohd Rafee et al., 2019). On the other hand, the use of natural fibres in composite materials, such as sisal fibres, in substitution for synthetic fibres, has increased considerably. The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost manufacturing process of composites with reuse of polyethylene bags made of sugarcane ethanol (green polyethylene) reinforced with sisal fibres. The hot compression moulding (185 °C) was used to mould composite structural board. Tensile tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of the reinforcement configuration on the mechanical properties of the composites, considering two arrangements: woven fibres in (0°/90°) and randomly arranged. The results indicated that the use of woven sisal fibres in (0°/90°) as reinforcement of the green HDPE showed an increase in the tensile strength (33.30%) in contrast to the pure traditional HDPE. Randomly arranged sisal fibre-reinforced green HDPE composites showed higher modulus of elasticity than pure traditional HDPE (76.83%). Composites with woven sisal fibres showed higher values for tensile strength and ultimate strain, and lower modulus of elasticity than composites with randomly arranged sisal fibres. In addition, failure modes of the composites were observed. The results showed the viability of producing these composites by the developed equipment and the potential use of these materials as structural components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abags 3acomposite materials 3acompression molding 3aethanol 3amanufacturing 3amodulus of elasticity 3apetroleum 3apolyethylene 3arecycling 3asisal 3asugarcane 3asynthetic fibers 3atensile strength 3awastes 0asustainability 0abiopolymers 0awaste plastic 0anatural fibre1 aDe Faria, Paulo Eustáquio1 aVieira, Luciano Machado Gomes1 aRubio, Claudia Victoria Campos1 aMaziero, Rômulo1 aDe Matos Rodrigues, Paulo César1 aRubio, Juan Carlos Campos0 tActa technologica agriculturae.g2020 June 01, v. 23, no. 2 p.81-86dSciendowJournal:6159x1338-52677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/ata-2020-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245008900210300001800299520172400317592002802041596011502069650001602184650001202200650001502212650001102227650002002238650001602258650001302274650001402287650001302301650001202314650001302326650000902339650001302348650001102361700002102372700002002393773012702413856008302540852000902623655001202632IND60756327720221122224402.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075632772DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-021-01482-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVershinina, Ksenia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9803-696210aLab-Scale Combustion of High-Moisture Fuels From Peat, Coal Waste and Milled Lignite  ap. 6619-6634.  aThis paper focuses on the experimental study and comparative analysis of characteristics, boundary conditions and ignition behavior of slurry fuels prepared from peat, coal processing waste (slime and filter cake), and lignite. Waste turbine oil (with a fraction of 10%) was an additional combustible component. The use of waste oils in waste-derived blends can provide a significant increase in the integral characteristics of fuel ignition as well as increase its calorific value. We measured the ignition delay times, duration of burning, ignition temperatures, peak combustion temperatures, and emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. These characteristics are fundamental for designing the production areas involving fuel supply, atomization, and combustion, as well as flue gas treatment. The experiments were conducted using a lab-scale furnace and small fuel portions. The relative efficiency ratios (considering energy, environmental, and cost criteria) of waste-derived blends were evaluated relative to conventional fuels, such as coal and fuel oil. We established that the most promising fuel slurries have a heterogeneous composition and consist of milled coal, slime, and peat. The averaged efficiency indicator of the studied mixtures varies in the range of 1.6–9.5 (versus coal) and 3.9–30.2 (versus fuel oil). In accordance with experimental data and calculations, the fuel consisting of 30% filter cake, 20% coal slime, and 50% water has the greatest potential in terms of a combination of energy, environmental, and cost criteria. The data obtained can be used to develop waste-to-energy technologies as well as to rationalize the involvement of low-rank fuels and wastes into the energy sector.  aPublisher supplied data  aAgreement No 075-15-2020-806 (Contract No 13.1902.21.0014)cMinistry of Science and Higher Education of Russia 3aatomization 3abiomass 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3afilter cake 3aflue gas 3afuel oils 3afurnaces 3alignite 3anitrogen 3apeat 3aslurries 3asulfur1 aNyashina, Galina1 aStrizhak, Pavel0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.6619-6634dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-021-01482-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245014900210520142500359592002801784650003201812650001101844650002401855650001401879650001401893650001101907650000901918650001301927651000901940653002801949653001001977653000901987653001201996653002102008653001702029700005702046773009002103856008502193852000902278655001202287IND60731451020221122110336.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073145102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsmaeili, Parisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2778-158610aDynamics analysis of factors affecting electricity consumption fluctuations based on economic conditions: Application of SVAR and TVP-VAR models  aIran is known as a high electricity-consuming country that has an undeniable share in total energy consumption. Therefore, we intend to scrutinize the impact of structural shocks of GDP, oil revenues, and inflation on Iran’s electricity consumption. Thereby, we combined SVAR with DAG technique to describe economic structures and Markov-switching in line with the TVP-VAR model to examine Iran style facts. The SVAR model results represent that inflation shocks have a significant effect on electricity consumption, while the effects of GDP and oil revenues are insignificant. Meanwhile, the most effective variable on electricity consumption fluctuations is inflation, which affects electricity consumption negatively and strongly. TVP-VAR model results show that electricity consumption is affected by structural shocks of variables differently depending on Iran’s economic conditions. Thereby, electricity consumption responds positively to the shocks of variables in most periods and years. Since 2011, when sanctions were imposed on Iran, the effect of structural shocks of variables on electricity consumption has become weaker. Finally, we proposed to policymakers to adopt energy conservation policies based on Iran’s economic and political realities. Iran must also reduce its dependence on oil revenues and imported energy equipment so that sanctions do not significantly affect the country’s economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aequipment 3ainflation 3amodels 3aoils 3apolitics 3aIran 0aElectricity consumption 0aShock 0aSVAR 0aTVP-VAR 0aMarkov-switching 0aPC algorithm1 aRafei, Meysam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9295-03070 tEnergy.g2021 July 01, v. 226 p.120340-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1203403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014300206300001500349520117800364592002801542596003301570650001101603650002101614650001101635650001101646650001101657650001401668700002501682700002001707773012301727856008301850852000901933655001201942IND60682749320221119001850.0200215e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068274932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-019-02395-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEghlidi, Elnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8648-349010aLaboratory Investigation of Stilling Basin Slope Effect on Bed Scour at Downstream of Stepped Spillway: Physical Modeling of Javeh RCC Dam  ap. 87-100.  aStepped spillway and stilling basin are one of the most important energy dissipation structures. Eventhough, most of energy dissipated by these structures, but in skimming flow, the upstream flow motion is nonaerated and the residual energy capable to destroyed structures during floods. In this study, effect of stilling basin slope on bed scour, downstream of Javeh dam was investigating. Experiments performed in hydraulic structures laboratory of the University of Kerman with six different discharges (5, 7, 13, 17, 25 and 30 l/s.m) and five various stilling basin slope (0.02, 0.01, 0, −0.01 and − 0.02). The parameters such as maximum scour depth (dₛ), flow velocity (in three point), water depth on upstream and downstream of stepped spillway and stilling basin, the distance of the maximum scour depth to sill (Lₛ) and the gheometery of scour hole measured. Result shown that when stilling basin slopes was 0.02, the average of maximum relative scour depth, 47% Increased and in −0.02, 52.2% Decreased. In addition, the distance of maximum scour depth until stilling basin increased by increasing and decreased by decreasing the stilling basin slope.  aPublisher supplied data  a00989171502142celnazeghlidi 3abasins 3adams (hydrology) 3aenergy 3afloods 3amodels 3aspillways1 aBarani, Gholam-Abbas1 aQaderi, Kourosh0 tWater resources management.g2020 Jan., v. 34, no. 1 p.87-100dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02395-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245010700203300001600310506007600326520105300402592002801455596004401483506003701527650002201564650002701586650002001613650002601633650001601659650001201675650001601687650001101703650001401714650002901728650001301757700002101770700002101791700005601812773012801868856008201996852000902078655001202087IND60630336020221207112609.0200110e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-018-0427-92doi7 aPMC63653422pmcid7 a308153022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jaeho10aStrain improvement of Aspergillus sojae for increased L-leucine aminopeptidase and protease production  ap. 121-128.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConventional random mutagenesis was implemented to improve L-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and protease production in Aspergillus sojae. Through successive mutagenesis by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), UV, and 1-methyl-2-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (NTG), EMS25, EU36, and EUN13 mutants from each mutagenesis process were screened using a newly developed quick and easy screening method. The mutant EUN13 exhibited a 9.6-fold increase in LAP [50.61 ± 4.36 U/g-initial dried substrate (IDS)] and a 3.8-fold increase in protease production (13.36 ± 0.31 U/g-IDS) on solid-state fermentation. This mutant showed more frequent branching and higher lap1 mRNA expression as compared to the parent strain SMF 131, which at least in part contributed to the increased LAP and protease production. The mutant EUN13 can be used as a starter organism for diverse industrial soybean fermentation processes for the production of conventional products such as meju, doenjang, and ganjang as well as for the production of new fermented soybean-based sauces.  aPublisher supplied data  aS2483241cMinistry of SMEs and Startups0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus sojae 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3agene expression 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aproteinases 3asauces 3ascreening 3asolid state fermentation 3asoybeans1 aCh'oe, Yŏng-ho,1 aHurh, Byung-Serk1 aLee, Inhyung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1508-16540 tFood science and biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.121-128dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-018-0427-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04258naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007300148245009900221300002000320500001900340520211900359592002802478596007502506596007502581596007502656596008302731596008302814596008602897650002102983650001003004650001403014650001603028650001803044650002203062650002303084650001303107650001303120650002103133650000703154650002203161650001403183650000903197650001303206650002303219650001303242700003603255700003003291700002903321700002803350700002703378700002903405773015403434856008303588852000903671655001203680IND60739389620221119045155.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073938962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13553-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcantara, Berenice Kussumoto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5758-753010aTolerance of tomato to cadmium-induced stress: analyzing cultivars with different fruit colors  ap. 26172-26181.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of the present study was to assess the response of tomato cultivars with different fruit colors to exposure to increasing Cd levels in the substrate by measuring the impacts of Cd on the oxidative stress indicators and physicochemical features of fruits, as well as plant development and yield components. A completely randomized experiment in a 3 × 3 factorial design [tomato cultivar (which produces purple, red, or white fruits) vs Cd level in the substrate (0, 3.6, or 12 mg kg⁻¹)] was performed. The cultivation of plants in substrate containing 3.6 mg kg⁻¹ Cd did not affect yield, but fruits exhibited nonpermissive Cd concentrations in both peel and mesocarp across all cultivars. By contrast, yield was decreased in plants with red and white fruits after their cultivation in substrate containing 12 mg kg⁻¹ Cd, while the productivity of plants with purple fruits was maintained under such conditions. The hydrogen peroxide content in the fruit mesocarp depended only on cultivar. However, an increased lipid peroxidation level was detected in the mesocarp of purple fruits at the highest Cd concentration. No parameters of fruit quality [i.e., diameter, length, °Brix, pH, titratable acidity, color (L*, a*, and b*), and concentrations of lycopene and β-carotene in mesocarp] were affected by long-term exposure to Cd at 12 mg kg⁻¹. In conclusion, the results of this study suggested that the potential Cd side effects on diverse tomato quality features can be buffered at the fruit level because these features were maintained at the usual values despite high Cd concentrations in tomato peel and pulp. Moreover, these buffering mechanisms are independent of lycopene and β-carotene concentrations in fruit peel, since the three tomato cultivars that were evaluated in the present study (white fruits, possessing no or negligible concentrations of these carotenoids, and red and purple tomato, possessing high lycopene and β-carotene concentrations) were able to sustain several fruit quality parameters after long-term exposure to high Cd concentrations in the substrate.  aPublisher supplied data  a2009/54676-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2013/15217-5cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2015/26640-1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a303749/2016-4cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a155926/2018-7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aFinance Code 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3achronic exposure 3acolor 3acultivars 3afruit peels 3afruit quality 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alipid peroxidation 3alycopene 3amesocarp 3aoxidative stress 3apH 3aplant development 3apollution 3apulp 3aresearch 3atitratable acidity 3atomatoes1 aCarvalho, Marcia Eugenia Amaral1 aGaziola, Salete Aparecida1 aBorges, Karina Lima Reis1 aPiotto, Fernando Angelo1 aJacomino, Angelo Pedro1 aAzevedo, Ricardo Antunes0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 May, v. 28, no. 20 p.26172-26181dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13553-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245009100192300001600283500002000299520130700319592002801626596008401654596005901738596005901797596006401856650002301920650001201943650001401955650002401969650001401993650001702007650001202024650002202036650001402058650001402072650003002086650001302116650002102129650001002150700001902160700001802179700001902197700001602216700001302232700001402245700001602259700001602275700001402291700006102305773012002366856007302486852000902559655001202568IND60749892820221116234214.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074989282DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.175752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Yaoqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2545-444X10aNe2, a typical CC–NBS–LRR‐type gene, is responsible for hybrid necrosis in wheat  ap. 279-289.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHybrid necrosis, caused by complementary genes Ne1 and Ne2, is a serious barrier for combining desirable traits from different genotypes of wheat, affecting the full utilisation of heterosis. To date, both Ne1 and Ne2 are still not isolated although they were documented decades ago. We report here the map‐based cloning and functional characterisation of Ne2, encoding a coiled coil–nucleotide‐binding site–leucine‐rich repeat (CC–NBS–LRR) protein. Homozygous frameshift mutations generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach confirmed the Ne2‐inducing hybrid necrosis in wheat. Upregulated expression of Ne2 induced by Ne1 and excess hydrogen peroxide accumulation are associated with the necrosis formation. Genetic analyses of a Ne2 allele (Ne2ᵐ) and leaf rust resistance gene LrLC10/Lr13 revealed that they might be the same gene. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the frequency of the Ne2 allele was much lower in landraces (2.00%) compared with that in modern cultivars (13.62%), suggesting that Ne2 allele has been partially applied in wheat genetic improvement. Our findings open opportunities of thoroughly investigating the molecular mechanism of hybrid necrosis, selecting Lr13 and simultaneously avoiding hybrid necrosis in wheat breeding through marker‐assisted selection.  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2019ZD15cMajor Basic Research Program of Shandong Natural Science Foundation  a31971877cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91935304cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20326311DcResearch Program of Hebei Science and Technology 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aalleles 3acultivars 3agenetic improvement 3aheterosis 3ahomozygosity 3ahybrids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alandraces 3aleaf rust 3amarker-assisted selection 3anecrosis 3aresistance genes 3awheat1 aZheng, Shusong1 aNiu, Jianqing1 aTian, Shuiquan1 aGu, Mengjun1 aLu, Qiao1 aHe, Yilin1 aZhang, Juan1 aShi, Xiaoli1 aLi, Yiwen1 aLing, Hong‐Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9988-22820 tThe new phytologist.g2021 Oct., v. 232, no. 1 p.279-289dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.175753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245013100166520101300297592002801310650002101338650001101359650002101370650001301391650002601404650001301430650001501443650002201458650001301480650002201493653002801515653003101543653002401574653002401598700001701622700001901639700001301658700001501671773010601686856008701792852000901879655001201888IND60639453620221120034650.0190606e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063945362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aEnhanced aerobic granulation by inoculating dewatered activated sludge under short settling time in a sequencing batch reactor  aThe effect of dewatered activated sludge on aerobic granulation was investigated in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under short settling time. The results showed that dewatered sludge accelerated aerobic granulation and the granulation was completed within 5 days. On day 5, the aerobic granules were regular, compact, fast-settling and high granular strength and possessed excellent removal performance of carbon and nitrogen. The change trend of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was basically consistent with granular strength and granulation rate, indicating that EPS in granules played a vital function for granulation. Microbial community succession was investigated by pyrosequencing. In 5 days, microbial diversity was reduced and certain strains were rapidly enriched in the granules to become dominant species, serving on a crucial role in rapid granulation and pollutant removal as they could secrete excess EPS and possess the excellentability removing carbon and nitrogen pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3acarbon 3adominant species 3agranules 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apolymers 3asequence analysis 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aDewatered activated sludge 0aShort settling time 0aMicrobial community1 aZhan, Hanhui1 aWang, Qingqing1 aWu, Gang1 aCui, Dabin0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Aug., v. 286 p.121386-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1213863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245008600161300002000247520106700267592002801334650001301362650001401375650001301389650001401402650002201416650001101438650002101449650001101470650001801481651001101499653001601510653001101526653002201537653000801559653001401567653001901581653001201600700001901612700001601631700001501647700002001662773010001682856008301782852000901865655001201874IND60683510620221121060003.0211206e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068351062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lu10aIdentifying and Interpreting Apparent Neanderthal Ancestry in African Individuals  ap. 677-687.e16.  aAdmixture has played a prominent role in shaping patterns of human genomic variation, including gene flow with now-extinct hominins like Neanderthals and Denisovans. Here, we describe a novel probabilistic method called IBDmix to identify introgressed hominin sequences, which, unlike existing approaches, does not use a modern reference population. We applied IBDmix to 2,504 individuals from geographically diverse populations to identify and analyze Neanderthal sequences segregating in modern humans. Strikingly, we find that African individuals carry a stronger signal of Neanderthal ancestry than previously thought. We show that this can be explained by genuine Neanderthal ancestry due to migrations back to Africa, predominately from ancestral Europeans, and gene flow into Neanderthals from an early dispersing group of humans out of Africa. Our results refine our understanding of Neanderthal ancestry in African and non-African populations and demonstrate that remnants of Neanderthal genomes survive in every modern human population studied to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aEuropeans 3aancestry 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aintrogression 3aAfrica 0aNeanderthal 0aAfrica 0aarchaic admixture 0aIBD 0aevolution 0aback-migration 0apre-OOA1 aWolf, Aaron B.1 aFu, Wenqing1 aLi, Liming1 aAkey, Joshua M.0 tCell.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 180, no. 4 p.677-687.e16dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011000172300001600282520107800298592002801376650002201404650003001426650001201456650001801468650001501486650002501501650001201526650002301538650001701561650001001578650001201588650001201600650001201612650001201624650001201636650001801648650001501666650001101681650001501692650001101707650001101718700002001729700002001749700002001769773010601789856008701895852000901982655001201991IND60087662820221119175607.0141102e20110307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008766282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamoto, Kenji10aDirect ethanol production from starch, wheat bran and rice straw by the white rot fungus Trametes hirsuta  ap. 273-277.  aThe white rot fungus Trametes hirsuta produced ethanol from a variety of hexoses: glucose, mannose, cellobiose and maltose, with yields of 0.49, 0.48, 0.47 and 0.47g/g of ethanol per sugar utilized, respectively. In addition, this fungus showed relatively favorable xylose consumption and ethanol production with a yield of 0.44g/g. T. hirsuta was capable of directly fermenting starch, wheat bran and rice straw to ethanol without acid or enzymatic hydrolysis. Maximum ethanol concentrations of 9.1, 4.3 and 3.0g/l, corresponding to 89.2%, 78.8% and 57.4% of the theoretical yield, were obtained when the fungus was grown in a medium containing 20g/l starch, wheat bran or rice straw, respectively. The fermentation of rice straw pretreated with ball milling led to a small improvement in the ethanol yield: 3.4g ethanol/20g ball-milled rice straw. As T. hirsuta is an efficient microorganism capable of hydrolyzing biomass to fermentable sugars and directly converting them to ethanol, it may represent a suitable microorganism in consolidated bioprocessing applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus hirsutus 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abiomass 3abioprocessing 3acellobiose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afungi 3aglucose 3ahexoses 3amaltose 3amannose 3amilling 3arice products 3arice straw 3astarch 3awheat bran 3axylose 3ayields1 aNitta, Yasuyuki1 aMaekawa, Nitaro1 aYanase, Hideshi0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2011 Mar. 7, v. 48, no. 3 p.273-277dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013700164300001800301520189500319592002802214650001902242650002102261650001202282650001902294650001502313650002802328650002002356650002302376650004102399650002102440650002002461650001302481650003002494650001802524650001702542650002702559650001702586650001302603650001002616651001002626700001402636700001802650700001902668700001802687700001602705700001602721773014602737856008102883852000902964655001202973IND60575636120221120082203.0170728e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057563612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-8208-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yuanfang10aAssociation of breast adipose tissue levels of polychlorinated biphenyls and breast cancer development in women from Chaoshan, China  ap. 4778-4790.  aPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are implied to be potential risk factors for breast cancer in wildlife and in in vivo and in vitro studies. Epidemiological studies revealed some individual or groups of PCB congeners associated with breast cancer risk, but consistent conclusions are scarce. This study aimed to explore the association between PCB exposure and breast cancer development. Breast adipose tissues were collected, and seven PCB congeners were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Demographic characteristics, basic clinical data, and pathological diagnosis information were obtained from medical records. The differences in PCB exposure levels among different groups and indices were compared, and the correlation among PCB congeners was evaluated. The order of congener profile by molar concentration was PCB-153 > PCB-138 > PCB-180 > PCB-118 > PCB-101 > PCB-52 > PCB-28. ∑PCB level differed by occupation and residence and was significantly higher at 55–59-year-old group than at the other age groups. ∑PCB level was higher in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women. Decreasing ∑PCB levels were related with increasing parity among women with progesterone receptor (PR)-positive breast tumors. With increased clinical stage, the ∑PCB level increased significantly. ∑PCB level did not differ by tumor–node–metastasis classification and PR or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression but did differ by estrogen receptor (ER) expression (P = 0.04) without a regularly increasing trend in breast adipose tissue. These results suggest a potential association between PCB exposure and breast cancer development. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm these findings and explain the underlying mechanisms.

In Baie des Veys (Lower Normandy, France), the common cockle Cerastoderma edule constitutes the major bioturbator in the ecosystem in terms of biomass. In this ecosystem, cockle bioturbation is a key process regulating the MPB erosion flux in the water column. This bivalve intensely modifies the top layer of the sediment by increasing the sediment erodibility and the fluxes of suspended chlorophyll a through the valve movements. More precisely, cockle bioturbation destabilizes the sediment surface by creating a biogenic layer that is easily eroded with tidal hydrodynamic forces. Associated MPB can then be exported to the water column to fuel higher trophic levels of the planktonic food web. The aim of this study was to develop a numerical model that reproduces the export of MPB associated to the biogenic layer erosion. Kinetics of suspended MPB, in response to increasing stress, were obtained from flume experiments in lab controlled conditions and in situ natural conditions. Following this, the suspended MPB were analyzed to respectively parameterize the model by (1) a calibration approach, and (2) an independent validation. The analysis has highlighted that the higher the biomass of cockles, the higher the MPB resuspension rates. Our model consistently reproduces the tendency encountered in laboratory analysis and with in situ natural conditions. During the validation, a small site-specific lack of adjustment was identified, but, among the macrozoobenthic community, the model can be significantly improved by considering the bioturbation activities of another ecosystem engineer, Pygospio elegans. This study thus provides reliable estimates of the daily food availability from benthic primary consumers in an estuarine system where cockles dominate the bioturbating assemblage. This model can be inserted in various model designs (0D, 1D-vertical or 3D).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerastoderma edule 3abiomass 3abioturbation 3achlorophyll 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystems 3aerodibility 3aestuaries 3afood availability 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3aplankton 3asediments 3atrophic levels 3aFrance 0aSediment transport 0aErodibility 0aModelling 0aMicrophytobenthos 0aCerastoderma edule 0aBioturbation1 aGrangeré, Karine1 aUbertini, Martin1 aForêt, Martin1 aOrvain, Francis0 tEcological modelling.g2015 Nov. 24, v. 316 p.155-167dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011700165300001200282520098100294592002801275650001501303650002001318650001901338650001701357650001601374650003901390650001901429650003101448650001301479650002601492650001101518650001301529650001701542650001201559650002001571700001801591700001401609773012001623856008201743852000901825655001201834IND60590382420221118142925.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059038242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-017-9605-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Cheng-yu10aRecovery of Protease Inhibitors from Potato Fruit Water by Expanded Bed Adsorption Chromatography in Pilot Scale  ap. 1-8.  aThe current study was conducted to investigate the recovery of native potato protein from potato fruit water (PFW) by expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography.

In addition, deletion of FgSWI6 reduces mycelial growth as well as production and development of conidia. F. graminearum cells lacking FgSWI6 show reduced production efficiency and sizes of perithecia as well as a defect in the production of ascus and ascospore. FgSWI6 is required for the cellulose utilization, lithium tolerance and deoxynivalenol (DON) production of this pathogen. Furthermore, deletion of FgSWI6 significantly attenuates the virulence of F. graminearum on wheat. Therefore, FgSwi6p plays an important role in growth and development of the economically important fungal pathogen F. graminearum as well as its resistance to MBC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aascospores 3abarley 3acarbendazim 3acellulose 3aconidia 3adeoxynivalenol 3afungi 3afungicides 3agrowth and development 3alithium 3aloci 3amycelium 3apathogens 3avirulence 3awheat 2aBenzimidazolesxpharmacology 2aCarbamatesxpharmacology 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aDrug Resistance, Fungal 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aFusariumxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aLithiumxmetabolism 2aMyceliumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrichothecenesxbiosynthesis. 2aTriticumxmicrobiology 2aVirulence 0aSWI6 0aGrowth 0aCarbendazim 0aCellulose 0aLithium 0aVirulence1 aFan, Feiyu1 aQiu, Dewen1 aJiang, Linghuo0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2013 Sept.,  Oct., v. 58-59 p.42-52dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2013.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245010100215300001400316520178000330592002802110650002702138650001402165650001802179650001402197650001302211650001602224650001102240653002302251653002602274653002002300653002302320653003002343653001402373700002802387700006202415700002602477700001702503773014902520856008602669852000902755655001202764IND60682934320221118061936.0200405e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068293432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhellemmes, Félicie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2043-465310aComparing behavioural syndromes across time and ecological conditions in a free-ranging predator  ap. 23-33.  aPersonality traits (i.e. consistent individual differences in behaviour) often covary, forming behavioural syndromes. Such associations, if driven by an underlying proximate mechanism, could limit the independent evolution of each behaviour. In contrast, a behavioural syndrome may be the result of selection favouring the behavioural correlation under certain ecological circumstances. In this context, investigating the stability and the potential drivers of behavioural syndromes is a fundamental step towards understanding how they might shape the evolution of behaviours. We assessed syndrome stability across time in two subpopulations of free-ranging juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris. We measured two behaviours, exploration in an open field and sociability in a group, over 5years. We tested whether these behaviours were associated in a behavioural syndrome, how stable this syndrome was and whether its strength was predicted by ecological conditions in this system: predator abundance, juvenile survival, newborn recruitment and total subpopulation size. We found that a behavioural syndrome was only observed in the subpopulation where predatory shark abundance was higher. Across years, newborn recruitment was the main driver for the strength of the syndrome. During years of low recruitment, the subpopulations probably experienced lower competition due to fewer newborns joining the population. In these years, sharks that were more explorative were also less social. These results indicate that the behaviours we tested were plastic and responsive to ecological conditions. Since this could signify that they are only favoured under certain ecological conditions, we argue in this case that the correlation of two behavioural traits is adaptive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNegaprion brevirostris 3aevolution 3afish behavior 3ajuveniles 3aneonates 3apersonality 3asharks 0aanimal personality 0abehavioural syndromes 0abehaviour types 0aecological drivers 0aintraspecific competition 0apredation1 aFinger, Jean-Sébastien1 aLaskowski, Kate L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1523-93401 aGuttridge, Tristan L.1 aKrause, Jens0 tAnimal behaviour.g2020 Apr., v. 162 p.23-33dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2020.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012300166300001600289520216300305592002802468650000902496650001602505650002002521650001502541650001802556650002402574650002902598650000902627650001402636650002102650650001502671650001502686653001902701653001602720653002402736653002302760653002802783700001202811700001502823700001702838773009702855856008502952852000903037655001203046IND60670371020221119012310.0191214e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067037102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Weibo10aExperimental and numerical investigations on the thermal performance of a horizontal spiral-coil ground heat exchanger  ap. 979-995.  aHorizontal spiral coil ground heat exchanger (HSGHE) has been used in ground source heat pump due to its efficiency and low cost. The influence laws of different factors on thermal performance of HSGHE are vital for its optimal design and operation. In this paper, a small scale test device of HSGHE was constructed to investigate thermal performance of HSGHE with different inlet temperatures, spiral pitches, surface wind speeds, and coil styles. The results indicate that the soil temperature interference distance is about 0.4 m for various inlet temperatures under the test conditions. At the same time, reducing spiral pitch can increase total HER, but it also decreases the HER per unit length of pipe. As for surface wind speed, the heat transfer of HSGHE can be enhanced by increasing surface wind speed, and the shallower the burial depth, the better the heat transfer enhancement effect. As far as heat transfer performance is concerned, the spiral coil is superior to slinky coil, but the slinky coil is higher than spiral coil in terms of soil thermal interference. From angle of improving heat exchange efficiency, it is advisable to increase wind speed and inlet fluid temperature, reduce the pitch and use spiral coil. A 3-D numerical model has been developed by COMSOL soft to further explore the influences of operation modes, soil types and coil diameters on thermal performance of HSGHE. The simulation results indicate that the soil temperature can be restored to a certain extent by using intermittent operation mode. The longer the interval time, the better the soil temperature resume and the more obvious the improvement of thermal performance. For the effects of soil type, the sandstone has the best heat transfer effect, followed by sand, and the clay is the worst. Nevertheless, in term of reducing the soil thermal interference, clay is the most advantageous. Additionally, increasing the coil diameter can improve total HER of HSGHE slightly, but it will also cause the reduction of the HER per unit length. Therefore, the coil diameter should be set reasonably according to the specific conditions in the engineering design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aengineering 3aheat exchangers 3aheat pumps 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3arenewable energy sources 3asand 3asandstone 3asoil temperature 3asoil types 3awind speed 0aHorizontal GHE 0aSpiral coil 0aThermal performance 0aExperimental study 0aNumerical investigation1 aXu, Rui1 aWang, Feng1 aChen, Shikun0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Mar., v. 147 p.979-995dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245014500174300001600319520161000335592002801945650003701973650001702010650001202027650001902039650001902058650002002077650002202097650001202119650001802131650002602149650001302175650000902188650002002197650001002217653000802227653001902235653002102254653002202275653002002297653003102317700006102348700002502409700002402434773010702458856008802565852000902653655001202662IND60539005820221119213220.0190319e20151124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053900582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMellert, Karl H.10aModeling sensitivity to climate change and estimating the uncertainty of its impact: A probabilistic concept for risk assessment in forestry  ap. 211-216.  aMany uncertainties emerge dealing with future climate conditions and their possible impacts on forests. In this paper we suggest a probabilistic approach extending existing ensemble species distribution modeling concepts by addressing important sources of uncertainty. We exemplify our approach using European beech as the target tree species and bioclimatic predictors derived from WorldClim data. Model parameter uncertainty is represented by 1000 parameter samples from a Bayesian generalized linear model. Climate change impact (CCI) is based on 63 different climate model outputs using four RCP-scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) in addition to the parameter uncertainty. The proposed difference of the probability of occurrence pocc to a predefined threshold, allows for evaluation of parameter uncertainty as well as for the uncertainty of future climate and describes the changing niche position. Further, we suggest the probability that the probability of occurrence exceeds a predefined threshold (pexc) as a metric for the distance of a site to the niche edge. These metrics are unambiguously determinable, intuitive and evident. Stands at a central, a marginal and an intermediate niche position are taken to exemplify deduction and application of pocc and pexc. A regional exercise shows how a map of pexc may support forest management planning and decision making under severe uncertainty. A key advantage of our novel metrics is the reformulation of common species distribution model (SDM) outputs in terms of risk thereby accounting for two important sources of uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3adecision making 3aforest management 3aforests 3alinear models 3aparameter uncertainty 3aplanning 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atrees 0aSDM 0aNiche modeling 0aClimate envelope 0aEnsemble modeling 0aFagus sylvatica 0aForest management planning1 aDeffner, Veronika1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5542-41321 aKüchenhoff, Helmut,1 aKölling, Christian0 tEcological modelling.g2015 Nov. 24, v. 316 p.211-216dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245016500205300001400370506007600384520139000460592002801850506003701878650001201915650001901927650002001946650001301966650001501979650001101994650000902005650001502014700001802029700001702047700001802064700001802082773011302100856008102213852000902294655001202303IND60083195220221207082218.0141101e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008319522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2012.12.0072doi7 aPMC36161532pmcid7 a232467862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Zhiqun10aStructural and kinetic effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy related mutations R146G/Q and R163W on the regulatory switching activity of rat cardiac troponin I  ap. 56-67.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMutations in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have been reported to change the contractility of cardiac myofilaments, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to investigate the specific structural and kinetic effects that HCM related rat cTnI mutations R146G/Q and R163W exert on Ca²⁺ and myosin S1 dependent conformational transitions in rat cTn structure. Ca²⁺-induced changes in interactions between cTnC and cTnI were individually monitored in reconstituted thin filaments using steady state and time resolved FRET, and kinetics were determined using stopped flow. R146G/Q and R163W all changed the FRET distances between cTnC and cTnI in unique and various ways. However, kinetic rates of conformational transitions induced by Ca²⁺-dissociation were universally slowed when R146G/Q and R163W were present. Interestingly, the kinetic rates of changes in the inhibitory region of cTnI were always slower than that of the regulatory region, suggesting that the fly casting mechanism that normally underlies deactivation is preserved in spite of mutation. In situ rat myocardial fiber studies also revealed that FRET distance changes indicating mutation specific disruption of the cTnIIR−actin interaction were consistent with increased passive tension.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium 3acardiomyopathy 3aenergy transfer 3amutation 3amyofibrils 3amyosin 3arats 3atroponin I1 aRieck, Daniel1 aLi, King-Lun1 aOuyang, Yexin1 aDong, Wen-ji,0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2013 July 1, v. 535, no. 1 p.56-67dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2012.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013000155300002000285520135900305592002801664650001701692650001601709650001301725650001901738650002301757650001701780650001001797650001901807650002101826650002701847650001901874650002001893650001301913700001901926700001801945700002001963700001501983700001501998700001302013700001402026700001702040773012502057856007502182852000902257655001202266IND60760927120221122042409.0211223e20211214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076092712DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra06832f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Cheng10aPreparation and catalytic behavior of antioxidant cassava starch with selenium active sites and hydrophobic microenvironments  ap. 39758-39767.  aThe preparation of antioxidant starch with the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) for scavenging free radicals can not only enrich the types of modified starch but also alternate native GPx to overcome its drawbacks. In this work, an antioxidant cassava starch (AO-ca-starch) was prepared by the sequential esterification and selenylation of cassava starch. The process was optimized based on the selenium content. Various characterizations for the AO-ca-starch indicated that the catalytic center of GPx, the selenium, was anchored on the starch. The catalytic activity of AO-ca-starch, a starch-based biomimetic GPx, was about 4.95 × 10⁵ times higher than that of the typical artificial selenoenzyme (diphenyl diselenide, PhSeSePh), and it exhibited a typical saturation kinetic catalytic behavior. The surface changes of the starch during the modification were conducive to the formation of hydrophobic microenvironments, which played an important role in the catalytic reaction of biomimetic GPx due to the binding of the hydrophobic substrates. The match of the catalytic center and the hydrophobic microenvironments was the key factor for maintaining the high catalytic activity of AO-ca-starch. Without cytotoxicity, AO-ca-starch exemplified a new and promising modified starch as a selenium-enriched functional food and antioxidant drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiomimetics 3abiphenyl 3acassava starch 3acatalytic activity 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aesterification 3afunctional foods 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahydrophobicity 3amodified starch 3aselenium1 aHuang, Qiugang1 aZhang, Ruirui1 aLiang, Xingtang1 aWang, Feng1 aLiu, Zijie1 aLiu, Min1 aHu, Huayu1 aYin, Yanzhen0 tRSC advances.g2021 Dec. 14, v. 11, no. 63 p.39758-39767dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra06832f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010900156300001800265520040300283592002800686650001400714650001500728650001200743650001900755650001800774650001100792700001700803700001800820700001900838700001700857700001700874700001400891700001700905700001600922773013300938856007401071852000901145655001201154IND60626909120221122030454.0190128e20190122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062690912DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc06650g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xi-Jie12aA facile synthetic strategy for the creation of hollow noble metal/transition metal oxide nanocomposites  ap. 1076-1079.  aWe have reported an efficient synthetic protocol to build different hollow hybrid nanocomposites with tunable compositions, such as Au/TiO₂, Pt/ZrO₂, and Au/CeₓTi₁₋ₓO₂.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) can be estimated through a formula, based on comprehensive assessment of concentration of air pollutants, which can be used by government agencies to characterize the status of air quality at a given location. The present study aims to develop forecasting model for predicting daily AQI, which can be used as a basis of decision making processes. Firstly, the AQI has been estimated through a method used by US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for different criteria pollutants as Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM), Sulfur dioxide (SO₂), Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM). However, the sub-index and breakpoint concentrations in the formula are made according to Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard. Secondly, the daily AQI for each season is forecasted through three statistical models namely time series auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (model 1), principal component regression (PCR) (model 2) and combination of both (model 3) in Delhi. The performance of all three models are evaluated with the help of observed concentrations of pollutants, which reflects that model 3 agrees well with observed values, as compared to the values of model 1 and model 2. The same is supported by the statistical parameters also. The significance of meteorological parameters of model 3 has been assessed through principal component analysis (PCA), which indicates that daily rainfall, station level pressure, daily mean temperature, wind direction index are maximum explained in summer, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter respectively. Further, the variation of AQI during the weekends (holidays) and weekdays are found negligible. Therefore all the days of week are accounted same in the models.  aPublisher supplied data 3asulfur dioxide 3asummer 3anitrogen dioxide 3awind direction 3adecision making 3amonsoon season 3ahuman health 3aair 3astatistical models 3aatmospheric pressure 3aair quality 3awinter 3aair temperature 3aprincipal component analysis 3apollutants 3aparticulates 3atime series analysis 3arain 3aair pollution 3aUnited States 3aIndia 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aGoyal, P.0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 409, no. 24 p.5517-5523dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01209naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245005400159300001800213520025700231592002800488650002700516650002300543650001900566650000900585700002300594700002300617700002200640700001900662773013200681856007300813852000900886655001200895IND60658567520221120112708.0190826e20100209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065856752DNAL7 a10.1039/b921911k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaerz, Andrew K.10aDimeric nanocapsule induces conformational change  ap. 1235-1237.  aAn induced cis–trans–trans (rctt) chair to cone structural rearrangement is forced by the addition of a pentacoordinate zinc(ii) complex, overcoming thermodynamic and kinetic factors to produce the first phenyl-substituted zinc dimeric nanocapsule.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3athermodynamics 3azinc1 aThomas, Haunani M.1 aPower, Nicholas P.1 aDeakyne, Carol A.1 aAtwood, J.

The spore-displayed β-Gal was found to be stable when an amphiphilic 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) was used as a co-solvent; the transgalactosylation efficiency and octyl-gal conversion were optimal at 50% (v/v) DME. In addition, the product was maximally obtained from 100mM lactose in a phosphate buffer/n-octanol/DME (25/25/50, v/v) mixture. By increasing the agitation speed and the amount of spores displaying β-Gal, a yield of 33.7mM octyl-gal was obtained over 24h in a batch mode, which is much higher than in other octyl-gal bioconversion processes, such as those involving lipid-coating, reverse micelles, or whole cells. On the other hand, intermittent addition of spore-displayed β-Gal and/or lactose in the reaction medium had no effect on the octyl-gal yield. The synthesized octyl-gal was hydrolyzed by the spore-displayed β-Gal, and a high concentration of octyl-gal competitively inhibited the enzymes (Kᵢ value of 10.8mM). In summary, we demonstrate that octyl-gal synthesis by spore-displayed β-Gal in non-aqueous medium can be significantly improved with the use of DME as a co-solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aagitation 3abeta-galactosidase 3abiotransformation 3alactose 3amicelles 3aphosphates 3aspores1 aChoi, Eun Hwa1 aPan, Jae-Gu0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2011 Mar. 7, v. 48, no. 3 p.232-238dElsevier Inc.x0141-02297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2010.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008500156300002000241520072200261592002800983650001501011650002101026650001501047650001801062650001401080700001601094700001701110700001801127773012501145856007501270852000901345655001201354IND60781729020221120184905.0220701e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078172902DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01273a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Qiuye10aEchem methods and electrode types of the current in vivo electrochemical sensing  ap. 17715-17739.  aFor a long time, people have been eager to realize continuous real-time online monitoring of biological compounds.

S.10a42 Nrf2 and nuclear factor kappa B cross-talk in bovine granulosa cells under lead challenge  ap. 147.  aLead (Pb2+), one of the pervasive and protracted environmental heavy metals, is known to affect the female reproductive system by inducing oxidative stress. The Nrf2 and NF-κB are two key transcriptional factors (TF) known to regulate cellular redox status and response against stress and inflammation, respectively. Evidence showed that these TF undergo functional cross-talk. Although the properties of Pb2+ have been extensively studied, little is known about its effect on bovine granulosa cells with respect to Nrf2/NF-κB interaction. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Pb2+ on the response of bovine granulosa cells with regard to the cross-talk between Nrf2 and NF-κB. For this, bovine granulosa cells aspirated from small growing follicles (3-5mm of diameter) from ovaries obtained from a local slaughterhouse were in vitro cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2. Sub-confluent cells were exposed to different doses of lead acetate [Pb (C2H3O2)2] (1, 2, or 3µg mL−1) for 2h. Following this, the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species was measured using the H2DCFDA fluorescent probe (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany). The cell viability was assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Munich, Germany) 24h after treatments. Moreover, cells were harvested and subjected to total RNA isolation using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by cDNA synthesis using First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and the gene expression was determined using quantitative PCR. Data were analysed using comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCT) method and normalized against the expression of GAPDH and β-actin genes. Furthermore, the protein lysate was isolated from cells to assess carbonylated protein using OxyBlot protein oxidation detection kit (abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Results showed that exposure of granulosa cells to lead acetate provoked intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation and protein carbonylation. This was accompanied by cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, reduction in cell viability, and decrease in the expression of cell proliferation marker genes (CCND2 and PCNA). Moreover, lead acetate elicited down-regulation of both Nrf2 and NF-κB and their downstream antioxidant genes (SOD and CAT), whereas no significant difference was shown in the level of other genes involved in both TF pathways (Keap-1, HO-1, Trx, IKK, and TNF-α). In addition, lead acetate challenge increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker genes (GRP78 and CHOP) and the pro-apoptotic gene (Caspase-3), whereas it reduced the anti-apoptotic gene (BCL-2). Our findings suggest that Pb+2 driven-oxidative stress deregulates granulosa cell viability and proliferation, enhances endoplasmic reticulum stress, induces cell cycle arrest, and mediates apoptosis probably via disruption of Nrf2/NF-κB cross-talk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aactin 3aantioxidant genes 3aapoptosis 3acarbon dioxide 3acaspase-3 3acatalase 3acattle 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acomplementary DNA 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3afluorescent dyes 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic markers 3agranulosa cells 3aheavy metals 3ain vitro culture 3ainflammation 3ainterphase 3alead 3alead acetate 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3aslaughterhouses 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aGermany 3aMassachusetts1 aGebremedhn, S.1 aSalilew-Wondim, D.1 aNeuhoff, C.1 aTholen, E.1 aHeld, A.1 aHoelker, M.1 aSchellander, K.1 aTesfaye, D.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2019, v. 31, no. 1 p.147-147dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RDv31n1Ab423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007800155300001600233520099300249592002801242650001201270650001101282650002501293650001101318650002801329650001001357650001901367650001201386650002201398650001801420650001401438700002101452700002201473773013101495856007401626852000901700655001201709IND60626909520221122003637.0190128e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062690952DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc07107a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Puja14aThe application of click chemistry for targeting quadruplex nucleic acids  ap. 731-750.  aThe Cu(i)-catalyzed azide and alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC), commonly known as the “click reaction”, has emerged as a powerful and versatile synthetic tool that finds a broad spectrum of applications in chemistry, biology and materials science.

The cation solutions are highly concentrated and include alkali and alkaline-earth metals. It is known that the pH-dependent edge surface of kaolinite is more reactive than the basal surfaces and more eager to adsorb metal ions; however, knowledge of the atomic scale is scarce regarding the structure of the surface edge, charge distribution, solvation, and structure of layers of adsorbed cations. First, ab initio calculations are used to determine the energetically most favorable surface terminations and the distribution of partial atomic charges on both neutral (protonated) and negatively charged (deprotonated) edge surfaces of kaolinite. Then, molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the solvation of kaolinite and the adsorption of cations. Results include density profiles of adsorbed cations, orientation profiles of water molecules close to the mineral surface for different cations, and the distance at which such surfaces become neutral or reverse their charges. Results compare well with available experimental and simulation data. Findings are expected to contribute to the selection or design of organic compounds that effectively adhere to kaolinite in aqueous electrolyte solutions in water recovery processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalkaline earth metals 3acations 3akaolinite 3ametal ions 3amolecular dynamics 3aorganic compounds 3apH 3asimulation models 3asodium chloride 3asolvation1 aRozas, Roberto E.1 aToledo, Pedro G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2863-79970 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 30, v. 123, no. 37 p.22971-22980dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b053393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245009400152300002000246520110300266592002801369650001401397650002301411650001101434650002301445650001801468650001201486650001401498700002001512700001801532700001501550700001801565700001601583773012501599856007501724852000901799655001201808IND60760927920221122042557.0211223e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076092792DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra07266h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Bo10aLigand-enabled and magnesium-activated hydrogenation with earth-abundant cobalt catalysts  ap. 39934-39939.  aReplacing expensive noble metals like Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, and Rh with inexpensive earth-abundant metals like cobalt (Co) is attracting wider research interest in catalysis. Cobalt catalysts are now undergoing a renaissance in hydrogenation reactions. Herein, we describe a hydrogenation method for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and olefins with a magnesium-activated earth-abundant Co catalyst. When diketimine was used as a ligand, simple and inexpensive metal salts of CoBr₂ in combination with magnesium showed high catalytic activity in the site-selective hydrogenation of challenging PAHs under mild conditions. Co-catalyzed hydrogenation enabled the reduction of two side aromatics of PAHs. A wide range of PAHs can be hydrogenated in a site-selective manner, which provides a cost-effective, clean, and selective strategy to prepare partially reduced polycyclic hydrocarbon motifs that are otherwise difficult to prepare by common methods. The use of well-defined diketimine–ligated Co complexes as precatalysts for selective hydrogenation of PAHs and olefins is also demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acost effectiveness 3ahydrogenation 3aligands 3amagnesium1 aZhang, Miaomiao1 aJiao, Hongmei1 aMa, Haojie1 aWang, Jijiang1 aZhang, Yuqi0 tRSC advances.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 11, no. 63 p.39934-39939dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra07266h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245019700205300001600402520129800418592002801716650002301744650001501767650002401782650002201806650001201828650001101840650001501851650002901866650002101895651001601916653001301932653001501945653002401960653002301984700001802007700001702025700002602042700002302068700002302091773009702114856008502211852000902296655001202305IND60670371820221119012130.0191214e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067037182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLondo, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1476-000310aAlternatives for current net metering policy for solar PV in the Netherlands: A comparison of impacts on business case and purchasing behaviour of private homeowners, and on governmental costs  ap. 903-915.  aTo stimulate grid-connected solar PV systems on private dwellings, the Netherlands currently have a net metering policy, but questions have been raised on its continuation. In this study, several alternative policy options were assessed on the financial case for private homeowners investing in a PV system (simple payback time), on purchasing behaviour (using a technology adoption model), and on governmental costs. While continuation of net metering policy leads to ongoing improvement of the financial case up to levels that could be considered overstimulation, three policy alternatives can be set up so that they stabilise simple payback times of recent and future generations of PV systems. Under these alternative instruments, deployment of PV systems in this market segment is indicatively estimated to be 15–20% lower by the year 2030 than with continuation of net metering policy, while corresponding governmental cost reduction indications would be more than 50%. We conclude that from a cost effectiveness point of view there is reason to change to an alternative instrument. We did not find any decisive arguments pro or con either of the three alternative instruments, neither on the basis of the three main impacts analysed nor from other aspects reviewed more qualitatively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3ahomeowners 3ainnovation adoption 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3amodels 3apurchasing 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3aNetherlands 0aSolar PV 0aHouseholds 0aNet metering policy 0aConsumer behaviour1 aMatton, Robin1 aUsmani, Omar1 avan Klaveren, Marieke1 aTigchelaar, Casper1 aBrunsting, Suzanne0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Mar., v. 147 p.903-915dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.09.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02048naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245018500157300001600342520070200358592002801060650003701088650002201125650001201147650001101159650001401170650002301184650002301207650001101230650001301241650001801254650001301272650001601285700001701301700001901318700001601337700001201353700001801365700001801383773013001401856007401531852000901605655001201614IND60626909620221122003707.0190128e20190103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062690962DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc07130f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiuyun10aStrong metal–support interactions of Co-based catalysts facilitated by dopamine for highly efficient ammonia synthesis: in situ XPS and XAFS spectroscopy coupled with TPD studies  ap. 474-477.  aWe report a new strategy for strengthening metal–support interaction and stabilizing Co nanoparticles at high temperature.

A survey of the PubMed database, however, reveals that the great majority (>93%) of epigenetic papers have an intra-, rather than an inter-generational focus, primarily on mechanisms and disease. Approximately ~1% of epigenetic papers even mention the nexus of epigenetics, natural selection and evolution. Yet, when environments are dynamic (e.g., climate change effects), there may be an “epigenetic advantage” to phenotypic switching by epigenetic inheritance, rather than by gene mutation. An epigenetically-inherited trait can arise simultaneously in many individuals, as opposed to a single individual with a gene mutation. Moreover, a transient epigenetically-modified phenotype can be quickly “sunsetted”, with individuals reverting to the original phenotype. Thus, epigenetic phenotype switching is dynamic and temporary and can help bridge periods of environmental stress. Epigenetic inheritance likely contributes to evolution both directly and indirectly. While there is as yet incomplete evidence of direct permanent incorporation of a complex epigenetic phenotype into the genome, doubtlessly, the presence of epigenetic markers and the phenotypes they create (which may sort quite separately from the genotype within a population) will influence natural selection and, so, drive the collective genotype of a population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3adatabases 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3agenotype 3ainheritance (genetics) 3amutation 3anatural selection 3aphenotype 3asurveys0 tBiology.g2016 May 25, v. 5, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology50200243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147242015200168245015100320300001600471520146000487592002801947650001401975650001201989650001002001650001202011650001702023650001402040650001702054650001202071650001302083650001502096650001502111650001802126650000902144650001302153650001702166651001202183700001902195700001802214700003002232700002202262773009202284856004802376852000902424655001202433IND50059663120221120221508.0121102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND5005966312DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-012-0282-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNerlich, Kristin10aAuswirkungen von Weiden (Salix spp.) und Pappeln (Populus spp.) im Kurzumtrieb auf die biologische Vielfalt am Beispiel von Laufkäfern (Carabidae)10a Effects of Willow (Salix spp.) and Poplar (Populus spp.) in Short Rotation on the Biodiversity Based on the Example of Ground Beetles (Carabidae)  ap. 129-139.  aThe increasing cultivation of energy crops in the last few years may have an impact on changes in the environment, biodiversity and the landscape. Due to a longer rest of soil and reduced application of pesticides, perennial crops such as short rotation coppice (SRC) offer benefits that can have a positive effect on the biodiversity. However, to assess the overall impact of SRC on biodiversity, information on the quality of SRC as a habitat for animals and plants, depending on the woody species over several years and the management is required.In the years 2010 and 2011, the diversity of ground beetles of willow and poplar in SRC were examined using pitfall traps at three sites in southwestern Germany. It was distinguished between species, variety and age of the SRC. At all sites ground beetle diversity was significantly higher in the studied poplar stands than in those of the willows. In addition, significant differences between the varieties could be observed depending on the location and the year of examination. The older stands of the SRC showed in general a higher level of diversity. Due to the different variety preference of ground beetles it is recommended to plant a mixture of varieties. Furthermore, SRC of different ages should be established side by side, as with increasing tree age species of the open area decrease and forest species settle. Overall, SRC offer the potential to increase biodiversity in natural landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3aPopulus 3aSalix 3aanimals 3abiodiversity 3acoppicing 3aenergy crops 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3apesticides 3apitfall traps 3asoil 3atree age 3awoody plants 3aGermany1 aSeidl, Frieder1 aMastel, Klaus1 aGraeff-Hönninger, Simone1 aClaupein, Wilhelm0 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2012 Sept., v. 64, no. 3 p.129-139dSpringer-Verlagx0367-42237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-012-0282-1  aDNAL 7aarticle04376naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001100141245017000152300001200322520290800334592002803242650002203270650002003292650001903312650001503331650002203346650001203368650001003380650003003390650002403420650001803444650001203462650001403474650001503488650005203503650002503555650001003580650002903590650001103619700001203630700001303642700001403655700001203669773012903681856007503810852000903885655001203894IND60626381420221121050023.0181220s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062638142DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv31n1Ab442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUh, K.10a44 Misregulation of ten-eleven translocation 3 CXXC domain leads to abnormal formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and expression of pluripotency genes in pig embryos  ap. 148.  aTen-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenases are considered to play an important role in regulation of DNA methylation patterns by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). TET3 protein, a member of TET family, is enriched in mature oocytes and early stage embryos and contributes to DNA demethylation of the paternal genome in zygotes. N-terminal CXXC domain of TET3 is thought to be important in catalysing 5mC oxidation through its DNA binding potential. However, it is not clear whether specific DNA binding of CXXC domain is required for 5hmC conversion in mammalian embryos. Here, we investigated the role of TET3 CXXC domain in controlling 5hmC formation in fertilized pig embryos by injecting TET3 CXXC domain into mature pig oocytes as a dominant negative to inhibit the direct binding of TET3 to the genome through the CXXC domain. The CXXC domain of pig TET3 was identified through bioinformatics comparison of TET3 sequences among different species and cloned from mature pig oocyte-derived cDNA. To construct the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CXXC fusion protein, CXXC sequence was subcloned into N-terminal GFP fusion vector, and then mRNA was synthesised by in vitro transcription. The GFP-CXXC mRNA (100 ng/µL) was injected into oocytes matured in vitro for 36 to 37h. Then, the oocytes were fertilized at 42h post-maturation. Water-injected oocytes served as a control. At 17h post-fertilization, zygotes were collected to analyse 5hmC level by immunocytochemistry. The level of 5hmC was analysed using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Expression of pluripotency-related genes at Day 7 blastocysts was examined through quantitative RT-PCR; ΔΔCt method was used to analyse the quantitative RT-PCR data and Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis. All experiments were conducted at least three times and P-values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. The GFP-CXXC was exclusively localised in pronuclei, indicating that the CXXC domain may lead to nuclear localization of TET3. The level of 5hmC in zygotes was not altered by the overexpression of GFP-CXXC. Interestingly, in 2-cell stage embryos, the 5hmC level was reduced in GFP-CXXC injected embryos compared with the control group, suggesting that CXXC domain is important for 5hmC formation post-DNA replication. There was an increase in transcript abundance of NANOG and ESRRB in blastocysts developed from GFP-CXXC injected oocytes compared with control blastocysts (P<0.05). There was no difference in the expression of POU5F1 and SOX2. In this study, we found that CXXC domain of TET3 is critical in maintaining the level of 5hmC formation at 2-cell stage and proper level of pluripotency-related genes (NANOG and ESRRB) in blastocysts. Future studies will focus on elucidating mechanisms behind the changes after overexpression of GFP-CXXC in pig embryos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA demethylation 3aDNA methylation 3abioinformatics 3ablastocyst 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymes 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimmunocytochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3aoxidation 3apronucleus 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astatistical analysis 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 3azygote1 aRyu, J.1 aMiko, H.1 aCarey, K.1 aLee, K.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2019, v. 31, no. 1 p.148-148dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RDv31n1Ab443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245017400162520181800336592002802154650001102182650001702193650001902210650001902229650002102248650001902269650001602288650001102304650002002315650001102335650001102346650001802357650001602375651002202391700001602413773011902429856007302548852000902621655001202630IND60653478920221119044438.0190714e20181227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065347892DNAL7 a10.3390/w110100432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReiman, Jeremy  H.10aDiel Variability of <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> Outgassing from the Lower Mississippi River: Implications for Riverine CO<sub>2</sub> Outgassing Estimation  aCarbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) outgassing from river surface waters is an important component of the global carbon cycle currently not well constrained. To test the hypothesis that riverine partial pressure of CO<inf>2</inf> (pCO<inf>2</inf>) and CO<inf>2</inf> outgassing rates differ between daylight and darkness, we conducted in-situ pCO<inf>2</inf> and ambient water measurements over four 24-h periods in the spring and summer of 2018 in the Lower Mississippi River under varying flow regimes. We hypothesized that diel pCO<inf>2</inf> variation will correlate inversely with solar radiation due to light-induced photosynthesis. Despite differing ambient conditions between seasons, we found a consistent diel cycle of riverine pCO<inf>2</inf>, with highest values before sunset and lowest values during peak daylight. Recorded pCO<inf>2</inf> measurements varied by 206&ndash;607 &micro;atm in spring and 344&ndash;377 &micro;atm in summer, with significantly lower records during daylight in summer. CO<inf>2</inf> outgassing was significantly lower during daylight in both seasons, with diel variation ranging between 1.5&ndash;4.4 mmol m&minus;2 h&minus;1 in spring and 1.9&ndash;2.1 mmol m&minus;2 h&minus;1 in summer. Daily outgassing rates calculated incorporating diel variation resulted in significantly greater rates (26.2 &plusmn; std. 12.7 mmol m&minus;2 d&minus;1) than calculations using a single daily pCO<inf>2</inf> value. This study suggests a likely substantial underestimation of carbon outgassed from higher order rivers that make up a majority of the global river water surface. The findings highlight the need for high temporal resolution data and further research on diel CO<inf>2</inf> outgassing in different climate regions to constrain uncertainties in riverine flux estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimatic zones 3apartial pressure 3aphotosynthesis 3ariver water 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3aMississippi River1 aXu, Y.

The production of commercial pentaBDE (c-pentaBDE) and commercial octaBDE (c-octaBDE) ended in 2004 because they are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic to both humans and the environment, but decaBDE production and use continue. Furthermore, many congeners of PBDEs are still prevalent in consumer products and articles that they pose enormous threat to both the environment and human health. PBDEs have been detected in the casing of electrical and electronic equipment, textile materials, automotive interiors, polyurethane foam (PUF) in seat cushions, children’s toys, kitchenware, and other products. With increasing evidence about PBDE pollution and the adoption of international conventions, many developed countries have drawn more public attention to PBDEs and developed sound strategies for their management. This review summaries the utilization and management of PBDEs in a number of countries and reaches the conclusion that PBDEs are still prevalent in consumer articles, while specific regulations or policies for articles containing PBDEs are rare. Public awareness should be raised on the importance of sound management of articles containing PBDEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3adeveloped countries 3aelectronic equipment 3afabrics 3afoams 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3apentabromodiphenyl ether 3apollution 3apolyurethanes 3atoxicity 3atoys1 aYuan, Zhen,1 aWenjing, Xiao0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Feb., v. 24, no. 5 p.4312-4321dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-4515-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245005900168520174800227592002801975650001502003650001302018650001102031650001302042650001402055650002502069650002402094650001702118650001002135651001402145653002602159653003502185653001402220653001702234773010402251856008402355852000902439655001202448IND60683512020221121045621.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068351202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2020.1044292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWangen, Magnus12aA 3D model for chimney formation in sedimentary basins  aThis paper introduces a 3D model for chimney formations in tight rocks in sedimentary basins. This is an adaption of a model for hydraulic fracturing in an anisotropic stress field by fluid injection (fracking). The model assumes that a chimney formation is triggered and sourced by overpressure build-up in permeable units, such as reservoirs or aquifers. Cells in the numerical models fracture when the fluid pressure exceeds the least compressive stress and a random rock strength. Chimney growth is represented by chains of cells (branches) that emanate from the base of the cap rock. The branches have an enhanced permeability during ascension, because the fluid pressure in the fracture network is greater than the least compressive stress. When the branches reach the hydrostatic surface, the fluid pressure drops below the fracture pressure and the fracture network closes. The reservoir is drained by the branches in the closed fracture network that reaches the seafloor. The model produces pipe-like structures and chimneys as accumulations of branches that reach the surface. The degree of random rock strength controls how pipe-like the chimneys become. Chimney formation stops when the rate of fluid leakage through the chimneys surpasses the production of excess fluid by the overpressure-building process. A “low” permeability of the chimney branches produces wide chimneys with many branches, and a “high” permeability gives narrow chimneys made of just a few branches. The model is demonstrated in a setup that could be relevant for the chimneys observed in the cap rock over the Utsira aquifer in the North Sea. By using the proposed model, the permeability of such chimneys is estimated to be of the order of 10 μD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aaquifers 3abasins 3achimneys 3acomputers 3ahydraulic fracturing 3amathematical models 3apermeability 3arocks 3aNorth Sea 0aComputational methods 0aNumerical environmental models 0aHydrology 0aHydrogeology0 tComputers & geosciences.g2020 Apr., v. 137 p.104429-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2020.1044293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04069naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003700166245014400203300001600347520139100363592002801754650003001782650002201812650002601834650001101860650001501871650002001886650001101906650001001917650001401927650002001941650001001961650001201971650001301983650001901996650002202015650002202037650001302059650002902072650003802101650002402139650001802163650002402181650002602205650001702231650004302248650002602291650003002317650003902347650002402386650002802410650005802438650003402496650003302530650004502563650004302608650002702651653000902678653000702687653000702694653000802701653000802709653000702717653000702724653000802731653000802739653000802747653002602755653003402781653002602815653002202841653002902863653002002892700003402912700002802946700002202974773009302996856008103089852000903170655001203179IND60112634120221117043839.0161023e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011263412DNAL7 a241401492pmid7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2013.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgôlo Santos Carvalho, Heliana10aPolygalacturonases from Moniliophthora perniciosa are regulated by fermentable carbon sources and possible post-translational modifications  ap. 110-121.  aWe report the first molecular and in silico analysis of Monilophthora perniciosa polygalacturonases (PGs). Three MpPG genes (MpPG1, MpPG2 and MpPG3) were identified and analyzed at transcriptional level, by RT-qPCR, in dikaryotic M. perniciosa mycelium grown on solid-bran based medium and on liquid medium supplemented with different fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources. The MpPG genes presented different expression patterns suggesting different individual regulation. However, all are mainly regulated by fermentable carbon sources (galactose and mannose). The integrated analysis of PG gene expression and systems biology (using MpG1 and MpG2 orthologs in Neurospora crassa, named NCU06961 and NCU02369, respectively) allowed identifying some possible mechanism of protein regulation during the necrotrophic fungal phase. MpPG1-NCU06961 and MpPG2-NCU02369 directly or indirectly interacted with central and highly connected proteins involved in protein synthesis and protein regulation associated to post-translational modifications, in cell wall metabolism, and in cellular metabolism related to energy production. This analysis also allowed the identification of key proteins for further studies of M. perniciosa development and/or for disease management, such as MpPG2, a pectin methylesterase, an acetolactate synthase and the small ubiquitin-like modifier SMT3-like.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoniliophthora perniciosa 3aNeurospora crassa 3aacetolactate synthase 3acarbon 3acell walls 3adisease control 3aenergy 3afungi 3agalactose 3agene expression 3agenes 3amannose 3amycelium 3apectinesterase 3apolygalacturonase 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAgaricalesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCacaoxmicrobiology 2aDNA, Fungalxanalysis 2aFermentation 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGalactosexmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aMannosexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMyceliumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aNeurospora crassaxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolygalacturonasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aBCAA 0aGO 0aMM 0aMOX 0aORF 0aPG 0aPL 0aPME 0aPPI 0aPTM 0aPectin methylesterase 0aSmall ubiquitin-like modifier 0aAcetolactate synthase 0aEnergy metabolism 0aWitches’ broom disease 0aSystems biology1 ade Andrade Silva, Edson Mario1 aCarvalho Santos, Stenio1 aMicheli, Fabienne0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2013 Nov., v. 60 p.110-121dElsevier Inc.x1087-18457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2013.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245017700166520180300343592002802146650001302174650001502187650002102202650001402223650001002237650002102247650002702268650002402295650003002319650001702349650001702366651001002383653001802393653001802411653001502429653003202444653002502476700002502501700002102526700003002547700002202577700002202599700002302621700002102644700002002665700002802685700002502713700002502738700002002763700002002783700002102803700002502824700001902849700002002868700002002888700001902908773010402927856008403031852000903115655001203124IND60683512120221121045627.0200318e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068351212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2020.1044322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaitza, Luca10aIncreasing the maturity of measurements of essential climate variables (ECVs) at Italian atmospheric WMO/GAW observatories by implementing automated data elaboration chains  aIn the framework of the National Project of Interest NextData, we developed automatic procedures for the flagging and formatting of trace gases, atmospheric aerosols and meteorological data to be submitted to the World Data Centers (WDCs) of the Global Atmosphere Watch program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO/GAW). In particular, the atmospheric Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) covered in this work are observations of near-surface trace gas concentrations, aerosol properties and meteorological variables, which are under the umbrella of the World Data Center for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG), the World Data Center for Reactive Gases, and the World Data Center for Aerosol (WDCRG and WDCA). We developed an overarching processing chain to create a number of data products (data files and reports) starting from the raw data, finally contributing to increase the maturity of these measurements. To this aim, we implemented specific routines for data filtering, flagging, format harmonization, and creation of data products, useful for detecting instrumental problems, particular atmospheric events and quick data dissemination towards stakeholders or citizens. Currently, the automatic data processing is active for a subset of ECVs at 5 measurement sites in Italy. The system represents a valuable tool to facilitate data originators towards a more efficient data production. Our effort is expected to accelerate the process of data submission to WMO/GAW or to other reference data centers or repositories. Moreover, the adoption of automatic procedures for data flagging and data correction allows to keep track of the process that led to the final validated data, and makes data evaluation and revisions more efficient by improving the traceability of the data production process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aautomation 3aclimatic factors 3acomputers 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3ainformation processing 3ameteorological data 3ameteorological parameters 3astakeholders 3atraceability 3aItaly 0aData analysis 0aData flagging 0aAtmosphere 0aEssential climate variables 0aAutomatic processing1 aCristofanelli, Paolo1 aMarinoni, Angela1 aCalzolari, Francescopiero1 aRoccato, Fabrizio1 aBusetto, Maurizio1 aSferlazzo, Damiano1 aAruffo, Eleonora1 aDi Carlo, Piero1 aBencardino, Mariantonia1 aD’Amore, Francesco1 aSprovieri, Francesca1 aPirrone, Nicola1 aDallo, Federico1 aGabrieli, Jacopo1 aVardè, Massimiliano1 aResci, Giorgio1 aBarbante, Carlo1 aBonasoni, Paolo1 aPutero, Davide0 tComputers & geosciences.g2020 Apr., v. 137 p.104432-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2020.1044323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04213naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017200160300002000332520251400352592002802866650004402894650002202938650001402960650001202974650002802986650002703014650001803041650001703059650001703076650002103093650001903114650001703133650001803150650001503168650001503183650001903198650002303217650001303240650002003253650001603273650001303289650002303302700001703325700002203342700002403364700002103388700002403409700001703433773012503450856007503575852000903650655001203659IND60760928420221122031953.0211223e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076092842DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra07492j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Minh-Xuan10aFabrication and characterization of polyamide thin-film composite membrane via interfacial polycondensation for pervaporation separation of salt and arsenic from water  ap. 39657-39665.  aPervaporation, mainly utilized to separate azeotropic mixtures, has been paid much attention for desalination in recent years due to its numerous advantages. The membranes based on thin-film composite structure have gained great interest in pervaporation due to their thin thickness, controllable hydrophilicity, and crosslinking density which affects the permeation flux and selectivity of the membranes. In this study, a polyamide thin-film composite (PA-TFC) membrane was fabricated through interfacial polymerization between amine monomers and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) on a polysulfone porous substrate (PSf). Four different diamine monomers, including ethylenediamine (EDA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), m-phenylenediamine (MPD), and piperazine (PIP) were used to investigate the effect of the monomers on the pervaporation performance of the resulting membrane for separation of sodium chloride (NaCl) and arsenate (As(v)) aqueous solution. The physicochemical properties of the membrane were characterized using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and pure water contact angle measurement. Furthermore, the performance of the fabricated membranes was studied by pervaporation separation of 0.15 mg L⁻¹ As(v) and 5 g L⁻¹ NaCl aqueous solution at 40 °C, respectively. The results show that the rejections of the membrane are insignificantly affected by the chemical structures of the amines, and both the As(v) rejection and NaCl rejection are higher than 99.9%. However, the permeation flux decreases in the order of PIP-TMC membrane > TETA-TMC membrane ∼ EDA-TMC membrane > MPD-TMC membrane. Furthermore, the operating conditions are found to affect the separation performance of the PIP-TMC membrane significantly. In particular, the elevating operation temperature profoundly increases the permeation flux, while the increase in high salt concentration leads to a slight decrease in rejection but a significant decline in permeation flux. The derived membrane shows a reasonable permeation flux of 16.1 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ and ca. 99.9% rejection for 1.5 mg L⁻¹ As(v) removal, as well as 13 kg m⁻² h⁻¹ and 99.3% rejection for 30 g L⁻¹ NaCl separation at 60 °C. The sufficient permeation flux and good rejection of As(v) and NaCl of the membrane suggested the promising application of PA-TFC membrane for pervaporation removal of toxic arsenic from water and desalination of seawater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aatomic force microscopy 3acondensation reactions 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3adesalination 3aethylenediamines 3ahydrophilicity 3apermeability 3apervaporation 3apiperazine 3apolyamides 3apolymerization 3asalt concentration 3aseawater 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atoxicity 3atrimesoyl chloride1 aLe, Thu Minh1 aTran, Thien Trong1 aPhuong Ha, Huynh Ky1 aPhong, Mai Thanh1 aNguyễn, Văn Huy,1 aTran, Le-Hai0 tRSC advances.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 11, no. 63 p.39657-39665dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra07492j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245014400159300001600303520143300319592002801752650001901780650001701799650002501816650001001841650002301851650002301874650001701897650002101914650001901935650001401954650001601968650001001984700002501994700002702019700002402046700001902070700002302089773012802112856007302240852000902313655001202322IND60479685920221120171242.0160122e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047968592DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.71752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyraleou, Maria10aEffect of irrigation regime on anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Syrah grapes under semiarid conditions  ap. 988-996.  aBACKGROUND: Irrigation management is a powerful technique to control grape and wine colour. However, water deficit effects on anthocyanins are often contrasting, depending on the severity of water restriction. In addition, the effect of irrigation on the antiradical capacity of grapes has not been extensively studied. In this work the effect of water availability on anthocyanin profile and content as well as the antioxidant activity of Syrah grapes was investigated in an irrigation trial under semiarid climate conditions. RESULTS: Three irrigation treatments were applied in a 15‐year‐old Vitis vinifera cv. Syrah vineyard, starting at berry set through harvest of 2011 and 2012: full irrigation (FI) at 100% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), deficit irrigation (DI) at 50% of ETc and non‐irrigated (NI). NI grapes were characterized by increased individual anthocyanin content. However, differences among irrigation treatments were significant only around 18–24 days after veraison, when anthocyanin accumulation was maximum. The antioxidant activity of the skin extracts was not affected by irrigation. CONCLUSION: Irrigation proved to be an effective technique to control anthocyanin content in Syrah grapes under semiarid conditions. However, anthocyanin accumulation pattern should be considered by winemakers to appropriately select harvest time for improved wine colour. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3adeficit irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3aharvest date 3airrigation rates 3asemiarid zones 3avineyards 3awine grapes 3awines1 aKoundouras, Stefanos1 aKallithraka, Stamatina1 aTheodorou, Nikolaos1 aProxenia, Niki1 aKotseridis, Yorgos0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 Feb., v. 96, no. 3 p.988-996dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.71753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004800140245010000188300001800288520134700306592002801653650002001681650001601701650001801717650002501735650001601760650002201776650001501798650001501813650003101828650001101859650001101870650001601881650001801897700001901915700001701934700002101951773012901972856007402101852000902175655001202184IND60638689620221119150213.0190430e20160621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063868962DNAL7 a10.1039/c6bm00125d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStampAuthors contributed equally., M.

In our investigations, we directly irradiate cells with SAW on a SiO₂ covered piezoelectric LiNbO₃ substrate. Observing the temporal evolution of cell growth and migration and comparing non-irradiated to irradiated areas on the chip, we find that the SAW–treated cells exhibit a significantly increased migration as compared to the control samples. Apart from quantifying our experimental findings on the cell migration stimulation, we also demonstrate the full bio compatibility and bio functionality of our SAW technique by using LDH assays. We safely exclude parasitic side effects such as a SAW related increased substrate temperature or nutrient flow by thoroughly monitoring the temperature and the flow field using infrared microscopy and micro particle image velocimetry. Our results show that the SAW induced dynamic mechanical and electrical stimulation obviously directly promotes the cell growth. We conclude that this stimulation method offers a powerful platform for future medical treatment, e.g. being implemented as a implantable biochip with wireless extra-corporal power supply to treat deeper tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acell growth 3acell movement 3aelectrical treatment 3airradiation 3amedical treatment 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3aparticle image velocimetry 3asilica 3asounds 3atemperature 3atissue repair1 aBrugger, M.

Also, viscosity of oil samples varied between 69.85 mPa (crude oil) and 82.25 mPa (bleached oil). Oleic and linoleic acid contents of canola oils obtained from each refining step were determined between 60.64% (deodorized oil) and 64.04% (neutralized oil) to 19.93% (neutralized oil) and 24.58% (deodorized oil), respectively. The campesterol contents of canola oils taken during rafination were determined between 6.01% (deodorized oil) and 7.90% (bleached oil) while stigmasterol contents of canola oil samples vary between 33.31% (deodorized oil) and 34.81% (bleached oil). While the B and Sn content of the oils increased during refining, Si, P, Fe, N, and Pb contents decreased significantly depending on the refining stages. The refining treatments were used to remove undesirable ingredients and produce higher quality oils in crude canola oil. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Due to their high saturated fatty acids, vegetable oils are a rich phytochemical (fatty acids, tocopherol, and sterols) sources. In addition, seeds are recognized as a good source of natural oil. The refining treatments were used to remove undesirable ingredients and produce higher quality oils in crude canola oil. Refining processes provide removing the unwanted substances, the most of vitamins, antioxidants, and sterols. The refining steps have specific functions for removing certain minor constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acampesterol 3acanola 3acanola oil 3adeodorization 3alinoleic acid 3aneutralization 3apetroleum 3astigmasterol 3avegetables 3aviscosity1 aDuman, Erman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3405-95721 aDuman, Sabire0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.e15164-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.151643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008200165300001600247500001400263520150600277592002801783650001901811650001501830650002701845650003001872650002801902650001601930650002501946650002501971650002301996650001102019650001402030650001502044650002402059650001402083650001402097650001302111650001302124650002102137650000902158650001702167650001202184650002302196650002302219651001002242653001902252653001802271653002302289653001802312653002402330773011502354856008502469852000902554655001202563IND60698409020221118031241.0200819e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069840902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geosus.2020.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanxu14aThe willingness to pay for ecosystem services on the Tibetan Plateau of China  ap. 141-151.  aNAL-light  aEcosystem Services (ES) are common-pool resources that can be valued by people's willingness to pay (WTP). In contrast to place-based WTP research at the community-level, the stakeholders tend to be geographically diverse, and the benefits are not spatially apparent on the national level. Aiming to find the geographical diversity of the WTP for ES at the large scale, this study implemented an online survey of more than 25,000 samples to detect the WTP of Chinese people for water conservation, soil retention, carbon fixation, pollution decomposition, biodiversity conservation, and aesthetic existence of the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed the top limit of payments was 1,080.95 CNY/year/capita on average, and people would like to pay 172.40 CNY/year/capita for water conservation, which is the highest among the six ES. The percent of people “Aged 16–35”, “Government agency staff” and “Know WTP” influenced payments at provincial level. On an individual level, people's knowledge and attitudes directly drove the payment amounts, as well as their ecosystem management decisions. Consequently, geographical diversity of the payment for ES exists in China, and in contrast to the objective social structure and spatial accessibility of ES, people's knowledge and attitudes were the main driving forces of this geographical diversity. These findings suggest that a bottom-up adaptive governance approach is encouraged for managing common pool resources in developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aaesthetics 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiodiversity conservation 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3adegradation 3adeveloping countries 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aforces 3ageography 3agovernance 3agovernment agencies 3aknowledge 3apollution 3aresearch 3asampling 3asocial structure 3asoil 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3awater conservation 3awillingness to pay 3aChina 0aPayment for ES 0aOnline survey 0aSpatial difference 0aDriving force 0aStructural equation0 tGeography and sustainability.g2020 June, v. 1, no. 2 p.141-151dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27387x2666-68397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geosus.2020.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024004300134024002500177024004100202024002300243040001800266100006300284245021000347520193100557592002802488650001602516650002602532650002902558650001602587650002302603650000902626650002402635650002402659650002202683650001702705650001302722650002902735650001202764653002702776653002902803653001902832653002402851653001702875700002202892700002602914700001702940700002502957700003302982700002203015700001603037773009903053856009003152856011403242961001303356852000903369655001203378IND60790002720221214225904.0221004e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079000272DNAL7 a3945042aris7 a10113/79000272hdl7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7387362doi7 a4376582aris_accn_no7 a6010-32000-027-000D2aris_project_no7 a3945042seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoemaker, Craig A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5478-120X10aAdditive genetic variation in resistance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) to Francisella orientalis and its genetic (co)variation to both harvest weight and resistance to Streptococcus agalactiae Ib  aAn understanding of the genetic relationship between traits of economic importance for a widely cultured species such as Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is important, in particular the relationship between disease resistance and growth. Francisellosis results in economic losses for the industry, and we confirmed that Francisellosis resistance is under additive genetic control in our population. Analysing four generations, significant additive genetic variation was found for survival to F. orientalis challenge (P < 0.001; Log-likelihood-ratio test) with an estimated heritability of h² = 0.31 ± 0.05 across all generations. The random effect common to full-sibs was also significant, but of lower magnitude (c2 = 0.075 ± 0.02) (P < 0.001; Log-likelihood-ratio test). Results of assortative mating groups confirmed that genetic gain could be obtained for survival to F. orientalis challenge since offspring of fish selected with high estimated breeding values exhibited higher survival to F. orientalis challenge. The genetic correlation between harvest weight and survival to F. orientalis challenge was very low (rg = −0.02 ± 0.13) and not significantly different from zero (Log-likelihood-ratio test p > 0.05). The genetic correlation between survival to F. orientalis challenge and survival to S. agalactiae Ib challenge was positive but not significantly different from zero (rg = 0.14 ± 0.11; Log-likelihood-ratio test p > 0.05). The genetic correlation between harvest weight and survival to S. agalactiae challenge was negative but also not significantly different (rg = − 0.19 ± 0.10; Log-likelihood-ratio test p > 0.05). Lack of significant favourable genetic relationships between economically important traits favours multi-trait selection since selection for growth alone does not improve survival to F. orientalis challenge or survival to S. agalactiae challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrancisella 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aStreptococcus agalactiae 3aaquaculture 3adisease resistance 3afish 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aindustry 3amultiple trait selection 3aprogeny 0aFrancisella orientalis 0aStreptococcus agalactiae 0aHarvest weight 0aGenetic correlation 0aNile tilapia1 aLozano, Carlos A.1 aLaFrentz, Benjamin R.1 aMumma, Paige1 aVela-Avitúa, Sergio1 aOspina-Arango, Jose Fernando1 aYazdi, M.

In this study, polycaprolactone (PCL) with good mechanical property and natural source silk fibroin (SF) were electrospun into PCL/SF nanofibers to obtain the nanofibrous substrate. With the addition of SF, the mechanical property of PCL/SF nanofibrous mats was maintained to a certain extent. While, the hydrophilicity of PCL/SF nanofibrous mats was greatly improved which is more suitable for immersive layer-by-layer assembly (LBL). The oppositely charged heparin (Hep) and chitosan (CS) were alternatively deposited on the surface of PCL/SF nanofibers via LBL. After implanting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on the LBL-structured nanofibrous mats for 48 h, it was confirmed that the CS/Hep bilayers enhanced the biocompatibility of the nanofibers. Furthermore, the results of the antibacterial test showed that the antibacterial effects of the LBL-structured nanofibrous mats for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were both achieved 95% when the number of Hep/CS bilayer was 10. It can be demonstrated that the LBL-structured nanofibrous mats with improved biocompatibility and reduced infectivity had been prepared successfully, and can be potentially used in vascular grafts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3acardiovascular diseases 3achitosan 3afibroins 3aheparin 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahydrophilicity 3alactones 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3apathogenicity 0aNanofibers 0aLBL self-assembly 0aHeparin 0aChitosan 0aAnticoagulation bacteriostatic1 aWang, Xianguo1 aLi, Dan1 aQin, Jinfa1 aZhang, Ming1 aWang, Kaijie1 aZhao, Jinping1 aZhang, Li0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 01, v. 154 p.999-1006dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006800158300001600226520133100242592002801573650003001601650001301631650001801644650001701662650002201679650001901701700001701720700001701737700002901754700001901783700001801802700001801820773012601838856007401964852000902038655001202047IND60638690120221120130746.0190430e20160524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063869012DNAL7 a10.1039/c6bm00171h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinlong10aInfluence of cell size on cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles  ap. 970-978.  aNanoparticles (NPs) have shown great potential for biomedical applications because of their unique physical and structural properties. A critical aspect for their clinical applications is cellular uptake that depends on both particle properties and the cell mechanical state. Despite the numerous studies trying to disclose the influencing factors, the role of cell size on cellular uptake remains unclear. In this study, poly(vinyl alcohol) was micropatterned on tissue culture polystyrene surfaces using UV photolithography to control the cell size, and the influence of cell size on the cellular uptake of gold NPs was investigated. Cells with a large size had a high total cellular uptake, but showed a low average uptake per unit area of cells. Cells with a small size showed opposite behaviors. The results were related to both cell/NP contacting area and membrane tension. A large cell size was beneficial for a high total cellular uptake due to the large contact area with the NPs. On the other hand, the large cell size resulted in high membrane tension that required high wrapping energy for engulfing of NPs and thus reduced the uptake. The two oppositely working effects decided the cellular uptake of NPs. The results would shed light on the influence of the cellular microenvironment on cellular uptake behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellular microenvironment 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apolystyrenes 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3atissue culture1 aHu, Xiaohong1 aLi, Jingchao1 aRusse, Adriana C.

The microstructures and properties of NaDC/CₙmimBr (n = 2, 8, 12, 14) mixed systems were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), polarized optical microscopy (POM) observations, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and rheological measurements. The roles of the hydrophobic chain length, the chiral rigid steroid center, and the electrostatic interaction for the evolution of phase behavior are clearly described. The results indicated that the long-chain imidazolium-based surfactants ([Cₙmim]Br, n ≥ 8) weakened the gel of NaDC, while C₂mimBr strengthened the gel behavior of NaDC and even can form microcrystals. The super-hydrogels formed by these systems may act as promising adsorbents for the removal of heavy-metal ions from industrial sewage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3abromine 3abuffers 3adeoxycholic acid 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agels 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3alight microscopy 3amicrostructure 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asewage 3asodium phosphate 3asurfactants 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aXin, Xia1 aShen, Jinglin1 aZhang, Han1 aWang, Shubin1 aYang, Yanzhao0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 04, v. 6, no. 4 p.2966-2973dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21979e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100001600189245011000205300001600315500001900331506007600350520088800426592002801314506003701342650001801379650001401397650001701411650001501428650001401443650001201457700001601469700002801485700002001513700001901533700002101552773012801573856008301701852000901784655001201793IND60682746820221207083613.0200724e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068274682DNAL7 aPMC69928132pmcid7 a320641282pmid7 a10.1007/s10068-019-00657-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMun, Ji-Hye10aYield and quality characteristics of Korean red bean sprouts produced with different time of seed soaking  ap. 197-206.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study was conducted to investigate the yield and quality characteristics of red bean sprouts of three cultivars (Arari, Geomguseul, and Chungju) soaked in water for 0, 6, 12 or 24 h.

In this work, fungal β‐carotene was added to extra‐virgin oils from Picual olives in order to prevent their degradation and foster consumption of bioactive substances. The effect of β‐carotene was assessed by comparing various quality‐related physical and chemical properties of the oils in its presence and absence. The oils were also examined for their response to microwave heating and exposure to light. The fact that no substantial changes in free acidity were observed upon addition of the carotenoid suggests the absence of hydrolysis reactions in the oils. Except for free acidity, all physical and quality‐related parameters of extra virgin olive oil were altered by microwave heating and exposure to UV light. The changes, however, were less marked in βC‐enriched samples, which suggest that the carotenoid has a protective effect against degradation. Based on the results, natural antioxidants such as β‐carotene may provide an effective means for increasing the shelf‐life, nutritional value, and resistance to degradation of extra‐virgin olive oil. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Adding β‐carotene to olive oil increases its nutritional value and improves oil stability against microwave heating and light exposure. Using carotenoid‐enriched olive oils as new functional foods can be useful to increase the daily intake of essential bioactive molecules through human diet, enhance the healthy properties of oils and confer them valuable nutritional assets and additional stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aextra-virgin olive oil 3afungi 3ahuman nutrition 3ahydrolysis 3amicrowave treatment 3anutritive value 3aolives 3aoxidation 3aprotective effect 3ashelf life 3aultraviolet radiation1 aChova, Mariela1 aBermejo‐Román, Ruperto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8960-32320 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.e15186-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.151863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245012700204300001400331506007600345520111800421592002801539506003701567650003401604650002501638650001301663650001301676650001201689650001401701650001401715650001401729650001301743650001301756650001801769650001501787650001601802650003101818650001801849650001801867650002701885700001701912773012601929856008202055852000902137655001202146IND60630333320221207111122.0200110e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-018-0437-72doi7 aPMC63653372pmcid7 a308152962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xuelian10aEffects of green tea contents on the quality and antioxidant properties of textured vegetable protein by extrusion-cooking  ap. 67-74.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of green tea contents (0, 5, 10, and 15%) on texturization and antioxidant properties of textured vegetable protein (TVP) by using a twin-screw extruder. Extrusion conditions were fixed at 140 °C barrel temperature, 50% moisture content, 100 g/min feed rate, and 200 rpm screw speed. The integrity index, hardness, and cutting strength of TVP significantly (P < 0.05) increased with the increase in green tea levels, while cohesiveness, springiness, water holding capacity, and nitrogen solubility index (NSI) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. Increasing the amount of green tea resulted in better DPPH radical scavenging activity, higher total phenolic, total flavonoid, catechins, and caffeine contents. The (−)-epigallocatechin gallate, (−)-epicatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin, and (−)-epicatechin gallate contents of TVP significantly (P < 0.05) decreased, compared to that of raw materials. The incorporation of green tea in TVP can negatively affect expansion and NSI while positively affect texturization and antioxidant properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3acaffeine 3acohesion 3acutting 3aextrusion 3aflavanols 3agreen tea 3ahardness 3anitrogen 3araw materials 3asolubility 3atemperature 3atextured vegetable protein 3atexturization 3awater content 3awater holding capacity1 aRyu, Gihyung0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.67-74dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-018-0437-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245011600176300001600292500001900308520168200327592002802009650002702037650002402064650001902088650001802107650001602125650001302141650001602154650001102170650001802181650001402199650001802213650001102231650001502242650003702257650002002294650002102314651001002335700003402345700005002379700002702429700003102456700007002487700003302557773010402590856008202694852000902776655001202785IND60739387120221119045322.0210527e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073938712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-021-02410-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeethu, Kariyil Veettil10aToxicity of copper on marine diatoms, Chaetoceros calcitrans and Nitzchia closterium from Cochin estuary, India  ap. 783-793.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effects of copper (Cu) toxicity on the growth, pigments, protein, carbohydrate, lipid and antioxidant enzyme activities of two endemic microalgae, Chaetoceros calcitrans and Nitzchia closterium from Cochin estuary were studied and compared. The 96 h median inhibition concentration (IC₅₀) of Cu for C. calcitrans was 143.8 µg L⁻¹ and that for N. closterium was 204.5 µg L⁻¹. No observable effect concentration (NOEC), lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC) and chronic value of Cu on C. calcitrans were 17.93 µg L⁻¹, 31.91 µg L⁻¹and 24.92 µg L⁻¹ respectively, whereas that for N. closterium were 18.35 µg L⁻¹, 36.04 µg L⁻¹ and 27.2 µg L⁻¹ respectively. Chlorophyll a and c showed significant variation from the control at NOEC in both species. Carotenoid content showed significant increase at LOEC. The chlorophyll a/c ratio significantly decreased at NOEC and LOEC of N. closterium. In N. closterium catalase (CAT) activity showed significant increase at NOEC and LOEC, but in C. calcitrans it varied significantly above LOEC. Protein content showed a significant decrease at NOEC of C. calcitrans. No significant variation was observed for N. closterium. Carbohydrate showed significant variation between the species at NOEC. Lipid content varied significantly at NOEC of C. calcitrans. Chaetoceros calcitrans was observed to be more sensitive to copper toxicity than N. closterium. The metal stress tolerance mechanism of N. closterium and its bioremediation capacity can be established in further studies. This study also provides an insight on the biochemical changes that happened at NOEC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetoceros calcitrans 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abioremediation 3acarbohydrates 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acopper 3aecotoxicology 3aestuaries 3alipid content 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3ano observed adverse effect level 3aprotein content 3astress tolerance 3aIndia1 aSaranya, Kochukattithara Sasi1 aKrishna, Naduvilpurakkal Gopalakrishnan Athul1 aPraved, Punnakkal Hari1 aAneesh, Balakrishna Pillai1 aNandan, Sivasankaran Bijoy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2476-69351 aMarigoudar, Shambanagouda R.0 tEcotoxicology.g2021 July, v. 30, no. 5 p.783-793dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-021-02410-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100001900189245009500208300001600303500001900319506007600338520097400414592002801388596009501416506003701511650002001548650002101568650001801589650001901607650002101626650002401647650001401671650001701685650001101702650001901713650001601732700001901748700001801767773012801785856008301913852000901996655001202005IND60682746920221207111901.0200724e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068274692DNAL7 aPMC69928242pmcid7 a320641312pmid7 a10.1007/s10068-019-00660-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Seo Hyeon10aModeling respiration rates of Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) under hermetic storage system  ap. 227-234.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe sweet potato respiration rate versus gas composition was mathematically modeled, as required to design an effective modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) system. Storage tests of sweet potato were conducted at 15–30 °C. The O₂ and CO₂ concentrations were measured over time in a closed system. The respiration rate was estimated to be a derivative of the quadratic function of gas concentration over time and decreased with decreasing O₂ and increasing CO₂. The model of the uncompetitive inhibition enzyme reaction rate fitted well with the experimental results. The temperature dependency of the equation parameters (Vₘ, Kₘ, and Kᵢ) followed the Arrhenius relationships. The use of the proposed models to simulate the respiration rates as a function of temperature revealed less temperature dependence in low O₂ and high CO₂ concentrations. This gas composition, more desirable in practice, also agreed with the typical gas composition of MAP.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. S-2018-A0436-00004cMinistry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, Republic of Korea0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIpomoea batatas 3aairtight storage 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3acell respiration 3aenzymatic reactions 3aequations 3afood science 3amodels 3asweet potatoes 3atemperature1 aJang, Han Dong1 aLee, Seung Ju0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2020 Feb., v. 29, no. 2 p.227-234dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-019-00660-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245011100161500002200272520081500294592002801109650002601137650001601163650001601179650001901195650001001214650002101224650001001245650002101255653001201276653001501288653001001303653001101313653001701324653001401341653001601355653000901371653001901380653002201399700001401421700001601435700001201451700001601463700001801479773007601497856008201573852000901655655001201664IND60581035520221119055951.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058103552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2017.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yi10aApplication of aptamers in detection and chromatographic purification of antibiotics in different matrices  aPre-press version  aAntibiotic contamination and abuse are universal phenomena, accordingly antibiotic resistance has emerged as a serious issue globally in recent years. To detect antibiotics and their residues in the environment, foods, drugs and biological samples, numerous analytical techniques have been developed. Among them, aptamer-based methods are considered to be highly sensitive and selective and have been applied to the detection of various antibiotics in different samples. We present a systematical and critical review on the antibiotic-specific aptamers and their application in detection of antibiotics in different matrices, focusing on the recent advances in optical and electrochemical aptasensors, aptamer-affinity based sample purification, as well as the promising label-free and multiplex determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3aaptasensors 3achromatography 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3afoods 3aoligonucleotides 0aAptamer 0aAntibiotic 0aSELEX 0aSensor 0aPurification 0aDetection 0aEnvironment 0aFood 0aDrinking water 0aBiological sample1 aYin, Shuo1 aLi, Yongxin1 aLu, Dan1 aZhang, Jing1 aSun, Chengjun0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2017.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010800169300001600277520109200293592002801385650001401413650001001427650001301437650001401450650002301464650001201487650001401499650001801513653001901531653001301550653001601563653002201579700001301601700001401614700001401628700001801642700001701660700001301677773013501690856008701825852000901912655001201921IND60687326820221123043408.0200516e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068732682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Nihui10aModulating cationicity of chitosan hydrogel to prevent hypertrophic scar formation during wound healing  ap. 835-843.  aIt is of great clinical significance to design wound dressing materials with combined excellent wound healing properties and superior capability to suppress hypertrophic scar formation. This study aimed to examine if and how the cationicity of chitosan would affect the hypertrophic scar-related outcomes, through preparing carboxymethyl chitosan hydrogels with different genipin concentrations (2.5%, 5%, 10% and 15%, respectively). An optimum window of chitosan cationicity (5% in our case) demonstrated potential to mitigate hypertrophic scar in wound healing by suppressing the expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and promoting secretion of type I matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1). In vivo, the CMCS-5% hydrogel again showed smaller, thinner and smoother wound appearance. Moreover, the CMCS-5% sample with additional incorporation of 2% (V/V) Aloe vera gel exhibited further improved performance in scar inhibition. Overall, such findings might have important implications in chitosan-based wound dressing design for high-quality wound repair and effective scar inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aactin 3achitosan 3ahydrogels 3ametalloproteinases 3amuscles 3asecretion 3atissue repair 0aWound dressing 0aChitosan 0aCationicity 0aHypertrophic scar1 aGao, Tao1 aWang, Yao1 aLiu, Juan1 aZhang, Junwei1 aYao, Ruijuan1 aWu, Fang0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 01, v. 154 p.835-843dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008400161300001800245520162800263592002801891650001301919650002501932650001601957650002201973650001901995650002502014650000902039650003102048650002002079650002302099650001902122650001402141650003002155650003002185650001102215650001502226650001602241650001302257650001202270650000902282650001302291650001502304650001002319650001802329700001702347700001902364700002302383700002702406700001502433700001902448700001602467700002202483700002102505773012902526856007402655852000902729655001202738IND60638690320221120145806.0190430e20160816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063869032DNAL7 a10.1039/c6bm00179c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTansik, Gulistan12aA glycosaminoglycan mimetic peptide nanofiber gel as an osteoinductive scaffold  ap. 1328-1339.  aBiomineralization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in bone formation. Functional and structural biomimetic native bone ECM components can therefore be used to change the fate of stem cells and induce bone regeneration and mineralization. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetic peptide nanofibers can interact with several growth factors. These nanostructures are capable of enhancing the osteogenic activity and mineral deposition of osteoblastic cells, which is indicative of their potential application in bone tissue regeneration. In this study, we investigated the potential of GAG-mimetic peptide nanofibers to promote the osteogenic differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) in vitro and enhance the bone regeneration and biomineralization process in vivo in a rabbit tibial bone defect model. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Alizarin red staining results suggested that osteogenic differentiation is enhanced when rMSCs are cultured on GAG-mimetic peptide nanofibers. Moreover, osteogenic marker genes were shown to be upregulated in the presence of the peptide nanofiber system. Histological and micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) observations of regenerated bone defects in rabbit tibia bone also suggested that the injection of a GAG-mimetic nanofiber gel supports cortical bone deposition by enhancing the secretion of an inorganic mineral matrix. The volume of the repaired cortical bone was higher in GAG-PA gel injected animals. The overall results indicate that GAG-mimetic peptide nanofibers can be utilized effectively as a new bioactive platform for bone regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiomimetics 3abiomineralization 3abone formation 3aextracellular matrix 3agels 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic markers 3aglycosaminoglycans 3agrowth factors 3ahistology 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3ananofibers 3aosteoblasts 3apeptides 3arabbits 3arats 3astaining 3astem cells 3atibia 3atissue repair1 aKilic, Erden1 aBeter, Mustafa1 aDemiralp, Bahtiyar1 aKiziltas Sendur, Gullu1 aCan, Nuray1 aOzkan, Huseyin1 aErgul, Elif1 aGuler, Mustafa O.1 aTekinay, Ayse B.0 tBiomaterials science.g2016 Aug. 16, v. 4, no. 9 p.1328-1339dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6bm00179c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011300170300001600283520122900299592002801528650004401556650002201600650002401622650001101646650001401657650001601671650002601687650001001713650001801723650001501741650002101756650001801777650002401795650000701819650000901826650001501835650002101850650003701871653001501908653001001923653001301933653001801946653002101964700002101985700001602006773013502022856008702157852000902244655001202253IND60687327020221122165757.0200516e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068732702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Deepa10aPreparation and evaluation of alginate nanoparticles prepared by green method for drug delivery applications  ap. 888-895.  aNanosized natural polymers have attained considerable attention in drug delivery applications due to their high encapsulation efficiency, non-toxic nature, sustained and targeted drug delivery. Here we have synthesized Rifampicin loaded alginate nanoparticles by green method. Physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles was assessed using Transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Dynamic light scattering and X-ray diffraction technique. The swelling and in vitro drug release showed that the framework experiences pH-dependent swelling and release of Rifampicin. Rifampicin has lower release in acid medium and higher release in intestinal condition. Moreover, in view of the drug release results, the release kinetics and transport mechanisms were investigated and discussed. In vitro cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the nanoparticles were non-toxic in nature. The acute oral toxicity study of the synthesized nanoparticles was done in Wistar albino rats. No systemic toxicity was observed after oral administration of nanoparticles.

The introduction of the adhesive layer was performed based on a peel–assembly–transfer procedure, and the adhesive polyelectrolyte greatly improved the mechanical stability of the AgNW transparent conductive films (TCFs) without obviously attenuating the morphology and optoelectrical properties of the AgNW networks. The as-prepared AgNW TCFs simultaneously possess high optical transparency, good conductivity, excellent flexibility, and remarkable mechanical stability. It is believed that the proposed strategy would pave a new way for preparing flexible transparent electrodes with a long-term stability, which is significant in the development and practical applications of flexible transparent electronic devices operated in severe environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronic equipment 3ananowires 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3asilver1 aLuo, Chengsheng1 aLiu, Fuchun,1 aLi, Linlin1 aZhang, Xuemin1 aLi, Yunong1 aHan, Enhou1 aFu, Yu1 aJiao, Yonghua0 tLangmuir.g2017 May 16, v. 33, no. 19 p.4702-4708dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b011643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245014200171520128900313592002801602650002001630650001001650650002101660650003401681650001501715650003001730650001001760650001901770650001201789650002401801653003001825653000901855653000801864653002201872700001401894700001501908700001701923773009901940856009002039852000902129655001202138IND60790003220221116151351.0221004e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079000322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7387432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ziman12aA genome-wide association study identifies SNPs and candidate genes associated with nacre color of pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii  aMolluscan shell color polymorphism as a major economic factor in aquaculture has been of increasing interest to scientists. In pearl oyster, the trait of shell nacre color is abundant and play a major role in color during the pearl production process. To understand the genetic effect and potential underlying genes of nacre color trait, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 830 individuals based our previous resequencing data. After GWAS, a total of 464 significantly associated SNP loci were identified and were mapped primarily onto chromosomes 14. In the 100-kb regions of the peak SNPs, some candidate genes may involve in the formation of shell golden nacre color were annotation, including LDR2, RDH12, BCOL, FN3–2 and CHI3L1, which have been reported to be involved in coloration. In addition, 11 haplotypes related nacre color were constructed. Successfully, one haplotype was verified in another population. In the block 6 of quantitative trait, the b* value (yellowness) of the haplotype ACA was significantly higher than that of the haplotype TGG in the validation population 1. The results should contribute to understanding of the molecular mechanisms of nacre coloration and useful for SNP-based genomic selection breeding in pearl oyster culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinctada fucata 3acolor 3aeconomic factors 3agenome-wide association study 3ahaplotypes 3amarker-assisted selection 3anacre 3aoyster culture 3aoysters 3aquantitative traits 0aPinctada fucata martensii 0aGWAS 0aSNP 0aShell nacre color1 aLiu, Yong1 aZheng, Zhe1 aDeng, Yuewen0 tAquaculture.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 561 p.738743-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7387433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011900166520131600285592002801601650002201629650001501651650002401666650001901690650001801709650000901727650001501736650003201751650003401783650001701817650001301834650002401847650001401871650001301885653000901898653002301907653002401930653002001954653002401974700001401998700001602012700001502028773009002043856008502133852000902218655001202227IND60731448920221120122550.0220103e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073144892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1202432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKou, Kaikai10aMechanism investigation of carboxyl functional groups catalytic oxidation in coal assisted water electrolysis cell  aThe electric energy consumption for H₂ production can be significantly reduced by integrating chemical energy of coal in the coal assisted water electrolysis (CAWE) process. While the oxidation mechanism of coal has not been comprehensively demonstrated. In this work, the oxidation mechanism of carboxyl group, a typical oxygen-functional group of coal, was systematically investigated by preparing a model compound of carboxylated graphene. For direct oxidation of carboxylated graphene (GCM), the onset potential was close to 1.2 V at ambient temperature. The apparent activation energy for hydrogen production was dramatically diminished by electrolysis of GCM slurry. The products analysis indicated that carboxyl groups can be oxidized to CO and CO₂ at 90 °C around 1.6 V Fe³⁺ was sufficient to oxidize carboxyl groups to generate Fe²⁺ at 90 °C. The chemical oxidation of carboxyl groups was a first-order reaction accompanied by adsorption, oxidization and desorption stages. In the presence of Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺, electrolysis initiated at about 0.5 V. A gentle slope of voltage from 0.6 V to 1.2 V was observed in the continuous electrolysis and the regeneration of Fe²⁺ became the limiting step for a long period of time. The results are essential to guide the application of CAWE.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3acoal 3adesorption 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolysis 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3aoxidation 3aslurries 0aCoal 0aWater electrolysis 0aHydrogen production 0aCarboxyl groups 0aOxidation mechanism1 aZhou, Wei1 aChen, Shuai1 aGao, Jihui0 tEnergy.g2021 July 01, v. 226 p.120243-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1202433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011000156300001800266520135400284592002801638650001401666650001401680650001401694650001801708650001601726650001901742650002101761650003001782650001401812650001901826700001501845700001501860700001301875700001701888700001701905773013101922856007402053852000902127655001202136IND60638690620221120140946.0190430e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063869062DNAL7 a10.1039/c6bm00191b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xiuwei10aEncapsulated feeder cells within alginate beads for ex vivo expansion of cord blood-derived CD34⁺ cells  ap. 1441-1453.  aA co-culture system based on encapsulated feeder cells within alginate beads was developed through optimizing the detailed aspects of the cell culture system to expand CD34-positive (CD34⁺) cells ex vivo. Mesenchymal stem cells isolated from different sources (human amniotic (hAMSCs) and umbilical cord (UCMSCs)), and human fibroblast cells (HFs) have been respectively chosen as feeder cells and the results showed that the hAMSCs were superior to UCMSCs and HFs in conventional two-dimensional (2D) co-cultures regarding the promotion of total nucleated cell (TNCs) expansion and the maintenance of the CD34⁺ phenotype. Alginate beads were employed to limit the growth of hAMSCs, which could effectively restrict the proliferation of the encapsulated hAMSCs, while the cell viability of hAMSCs was still highly maintained. Intriguingly, only a few hAMSCs migrated out of the alginate beads, whereas secreted growth factors and cytokines could be easily released. Furthermore, the alginate beads supported CD34⁺ cells/hAMSCs 2D indirect co-culture exhibited increased TNCs expansion, higher percentages of CD34⁺ and CD34⁺CD38⁻ cells, and better cell vitality when compared to the 2D co-culture. Therefore, the co-culture system based on encapsulated hAMSCs within alginate beads can effectively promote CD34⁺ cells to expand ex vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3acoculture 3acytokines 3aencapsulation 3afibroblasts 3agrowth factors 3ahuman cell lines 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3aphenotype 3aumbilical cord1 aSun, Qiong1 aCai, Haibo1 aGao, Yun1 aTan, Wensong1 aZhang, Weian0 tBiomaterials science.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 4, no. 10 p.1441-1453dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6bm00191b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013600163300001600299520195600315592002802271650001502299650001502314650001302329650001902342650001502361650006602376650003402442700001602476700002202492700002202514773009602536856008602632852000902718655001202727IND60577655220221122230622.0170810e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057765522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b032522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jian10aTracking Invisible Transformations of Physisorbed Monolayers: LDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry as Complements to STM Imaging  ap. 459-467.  aTriphenyleneethynylene (TPEE) derivatives bearing one long aliphatic chain on each terminal aryl ring and two short aliphatic chains on the central aryl ring (core chains) self-assemble single component and 1-D patterned, two-component, crystalline monolayers at the solution–graphite interface. The monolayer morphology directs the core chains off the graphite, making them accessible for chemical reactions but invisible to imaging by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). This precludes using STM to monitor transformations of the core chains, either by reaction or solution–monolayer exchange of TPEE molecules. Laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF MS) successfully identifies TPEE compounds within physisorbed monolayers. The LDI-TOF spectra of TPEE monolayer–graphite samples exhibit strong molecular ion peaks and minimal fragmentation or background. LDI-TOF and STM techniques are combined to evaluate monolayer composition and morphology, track solution–monolayer exchange, to identify reaction products and to measure kinetics of chemical reactions at the solution–monolayer interface. LDI-TOF MS provides rapid qualitative evaluation of monolayer composition across a graphite substrate. Challenges to quantitative composition evaluation by LDI-TOF include compound-specific light absorption, surface desorption/ionization and fragmentation characteristics. For some, but not all, compounds, applying matrix onto a self-assembled monolayer increases molecular ion intensities and affords more accurate assessment of monolayer composition via matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS. Matrix addition precludes subsequent chemical or STM studies of the monolayer, whereas reactions and STM may be performed at nonirradiated regions following LDI-TOF measurements. LDI- and MALDI-TOF MS are useful complements to STM and are easily implemented tools for study of physisorbed monolayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adesorption 3agraphene 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3ascanning tunneling microscopy1 aFang, Zhen,1 aShelp, Russell A.1 aZimmt, Matthew B.0 tLangmuir.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 33, no. 2 p.459-467dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.6b032523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245012400206300001600330506007600346520105900422592002801481596005701509506003701566650001801603650001001621650002101631650001301652650001201665650001601677650001601693650002101709650001001730650000901740650003701749650001401786650002401800650001201824650002901836650003601865650002101901700001601922700001701938700001801955773012801973856008202101852000902183655001202192IND60630333920221207105447.0200110e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-018-0451-92doi7 aPMC63653232pmcid7 a308153162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Ki Moon10aOrally administration of Neolentinus lepideus extracts attenuated ethanol induced accumulation of hepatic lipid in mice  ap. 243-251.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, we examined the effects of the water extract of Neolentinus lepideus (WENL), an edible mushroom, on ethanol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Ethanol-induced oil red O-positive spots on AML-12 hepatocytes were attenuated by WENL treatment. Furthermore, the oral administration of WENL in acute and chronic ethanol-fed mouse models resulted in the decrease in blood triglyceride and the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. Interestingly, the transcriptional expression related to lipid metabolisms, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and cytochrome P450 2E1, was decreased by WENL treatment in both ethanol-induced AML-12 hepatocytes and our chronic ethanol-fed mouse models. In addition, WENL effectively attenuated the ethanol induced activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB in AML-12 hepatocytes. Taken together, our results suggested that WENL can be effective in alleviating alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation and may be used as potential candidate for the prevention of alcoholic fatty liver disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aPJ01022310cNational Academy of Agricultural Science0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3ablood 3acytochrome P-450 3adroplets 3aethanol 3afatty liver 3ahepatocytes 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amushrooms 3aoral administration 3asterols 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atriacylglycerols1 aPark, Ye Na1 aKwon, Oh Yun1 aLee, Seung Ho0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.243-251dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-018-0451-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014400171300001800315520150500333592002801838650001101866650002101877650001201898650002201910650001801932650002101950650001301971650002001984650001902004650001302023650001102036650001102047700001602058700002202074773012702096856008302223852000902306655001202315IND60756325620221123023658.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075632562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-021-01465-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPigłowska, Marita10aApplication of Carbonized Starches as Carbon Electrode Active Material Compared to Graphene Nanoplatelets-Based Anode in a Lithium-Ion Cell  ap. 6403-6422.  aThe main aim of this research is the examination of the physicochemical properties and their impact on the electrochemical activity of carbon materials obtained from the starch of different botanical origin (SCs). The obtained materials are compared to graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) of different particle sizes (5 and 25 µm) applied as an anode active material for high-performance lithium-ion cells. SCs were obtained via thermal carbonization and this process enables an obtainment of better sorption properties compared to GNPs. The excellent electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the good DLᵢ₊ (3.03 × 10⁻¹³–7.64 × 10⁻¹¹ cm² s⁻¹ for SCs and 7.60 × 10⁻¹³–5.42 × 10⁻¹² cm² s⁻¹ for GNPs) and relatively small resistances (EIS). However, the primary focus is on the specific capacity and cyclability. The capacity retentions of CSC cycled at 1 mA g⁻¹, 10 mA g⁻¹, 50 mA g⁻¹, 1 mA g⁻¹ for 50 cycles are 98%, 99%, 96%, 94% with specific capacities equal to 820, 800, 790, 1000 mAh g⁻¹, respectively. The 5GNPs and 25GNPs may present a much smaller reversible capacity of 650, 600 mAh g⁻¹ at 10 mA g⁻¹. The thermal modification process of starches is simple, safe and widely applied, providing new paths for rational engineering of anode materials for LIBs. Moreover, the applied materials are easily available worldwide and are promising in the well-known Green Chemistry aspect making the cells more biodegradable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiodegradability 3abiomass 3acarbon electrodes 3acarbonization 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 3ananocomposites 3asorption 3astarch 3awastes1 aKurc, Beata1 aRymaniak, Łukasz0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2021 Dec., v. 12, no. 12 p.6403-6422dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-021-01465-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245008900212300001400301506007600315520101600391592002801407596004201435506003701477650002001514650001201534650002001546650002301566650001601589650000901605650001501614650002301629700001601652700006001668773012601728856008201854852000901936655001201945IND60630334020221207111846.0200110e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063033402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-018-0452-82doi7 aPMC63653312pmcid7 a308152912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraithong, Supaluck10aEffect of red Jasmine rice replacement on rice flour properties and noodle qualities  ap. 25-34.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to assess flour and noodle qualities after substituting Phitsanulok rice flour (PH) with red Jasmine rice flour (RJ). Blended rice flours were prepared by replacing PH with RJ at various ratios [100:00 (0RJ), 75:25 (25RJ), 50:50 (50RJ), 25:75 (75RJ), and 00:100 (100RJ)]. Some quality improvements were observed in the blended rice flour in terms of chemical and pasting properties at the replacement ratio of 75:25 (p < 0.05). At the same ratio, total phenolic contents, antioxidance activites, and some textural and sensory properties of noodle were developed (p < 0.05). However, increasing values of some undesirable properties including cooking loss and rehydration were also observed (p < 0.05). The noodle made from 100RJ showed the highest level of acceptability but not significantly different compared with others (p > 0.05). Thus, RJ could be used to improve the nutritional value of rice flour, and it could be used for development of health benefits in rice noodle.  aPublisher supplied data  aPHD/0087/2558cThailand Research Fund0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acooking quality 3anoodles 3anutritive value 3apasting properties 3arehydration 3arice 3arice flour 3asensory properties1 aLee, Suyong1 aRawdkuen, Saroat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6664-30310 tFood science and biotechnology.g2019 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.25-34dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-018-0452-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006400137245013600201300001400337500001900351520116500370592002801535650001501563650002601578650001801604650002301622650001001645650001701655650000901672650001001681650001101691650001201702650002301714650001101737650001501748651001501763700002701778700002101805700002201826773011601848856007201964852000902036655001202045IND60698410020221118031615.0200612s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069841002DNAL7 a10.1071/ZO190592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Connor, Julie M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8846-598510aFrom carrion to Christmas beetles: the broad dietary niche of the red fox in a hybrid coastal ecosystem in south-eastern Queensland  ap. 82-93.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe diet of the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was investigated through analysis of 1185 scats collected between 2010 and 2014 from coastal south-east Queensland, Australia. By both frequency of occurrence and volume, its diet was dominated by terrestrial arthropods, marine arthropods, vegetation and birds, although the remains of the short-tailed shearwater (Ardenna tenuirostris) consumed as carrion dominated the latter. Terrestrial arthropods, primarily insects of the order Coleoptera, were eaten all year (61% frequency of occurrence, FO) but varied seasonally (35–67%FO), mostly due to the consumption of large numbers of Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus spp.) in the summer months. Marine arthropods consisted almost entirely of ghost crabs (Ocypode spp.) and seasonal variation in consumption was evident (33–72%FO) and likely correlated with ghost crab abundance. Fruit and berries were an important food item for foxes all year but also varied seasonally (30–65%FO). The opportunistic diet of this fox population is discussed in the context of dietary differences, but common opportunism, reported in other Australian and overseas studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aPuffinus tenuirostris 3aVulpes vulpes 3acoastal ecosystems 3acrabs 3adead animals 3adiet 3afoxes 3afruits 3ahybrids 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3avegetation 3aQueensland1 aSrivastava, Sanjeev K.1 aTindale, Neil W.1 aBurnett, Scott E.0 tAustralian journal of zoology.g2019, v. 67, no. 2 p.82-93dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl46151x0004-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ZO190593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245020800207300001200415520170600427592002802133650001802161650002002179650002102199650001102220650001502231650001102246650002802257650001802285651001002303651001802313700001602331700001702347700001502364773015102379856008302530852000902613655001202622IND60739387720221119045249.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073938772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-021-09127-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Chenguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9650-880X12aA water quality prediction model based on variational mode decomposition and the least squares support vector machine optimized by the sparrow search algorithm (VMD-SSA-LSSVM) of the Yangtze River, China  ap. 363.  aAccurate and reliable water quality forecasting is of great significance for water resource optimization and management. This study focuses on the prediction of water quality parameters such as the dissolved oxygen (DO) in a river system. The accuracy of traditional water quality prediction methods is generally low, and the prediction results have serious autocorrelation. To overcome nonstationarity, randomness, and nonlinearity of the water quality parameter data, an improved least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model was proposed to improve the model’s performance at two gaging stations, namely Panzhihua and Jiujiang, in the Yangtze River, China. In addition, a hybrid model that recruits variational mode decomposition (VMD) to denoise the input data was adopted. A novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) was also implemented to compute the optimal parameter values for the LSSVM model. To validate the proposed hybrid model, standalone LSSVM, SSA-LSSVM, VMD-LSSVM, support vector regression (SVR), as well as back propagation neural network (BPNN) were considered as the benchmark models. The results indicated that the VMD-SSA-LSSVM model exhibited the best forecasting performance among all the peer models at Panzhihua station. Furthermore, the model forecasting results applied at Jiujiang were consistent with those at Panzhihua station. This result further verified the accuracy and stability of the VMD-SSA-LSSVM model. Thus, the proposed hybrid model was effective method for forecasting nonstationary and nonlinear water quality parameter series and can be recommended as a promising model for water quality parameter forecasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3aautocorrelation 3adissolved oxygen 3amodels 3aprediction 3arivers 3asupport vector machines 3awater quality 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aYao, Leihua1 aHua, Chengya1 aNi, Qihang0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 June, v. 193, no. 6 p.363-363dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09127-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245014100168300001800309500002000327520155000347592002801897650003101925650000901956650002001965650001001985651001101995651001202006651001802018651001202036700002102048700001802069700001702087773014602104856007402250852000902324655001202333IND60749891220221116234648.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074989122DNAL7 a10.1111/ajae.122162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez Cillero, Maria10aAnalyzing the Impact of Subsidies on Beef Production Efficiency in Selected European Union Countries.

As a result, there are significant differences in agricultural subsidies granted in each member state of the European Union. However, there is limited cross‐country comparative empirical evidence regarding the effects of the implementation of different levels and types of subsidies on farm efficiency. Using farm level data for beef farms in Ireland, France, Great Britain, and Germany between 2005 and 2012, we implement the stochastic metafrontier proposed by Huang et al. (2014) and attempt to correct for endogeneity applying the method in Shee and Stefanou (2015). Using these approaches, we contribute to the literature by consistently comparing cross‐country farm performance, as well as exploring the disaggregated effects of different types of subsidies on farm level technical efficiency and on the technology gaps. Our estimates show that although beef farms included operate on average close to the global frontier, there is scope to improve farm level managerial performance. However, they do operate close to the global frontier, although not on it. We also find evidence that implementing full decoupling benefited efficiency, whereas implementing partial decoupling might have hindered technical efficiency improvements for beef farms, as well as technology catch up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3abeef 3abeef production 3afarms 3aFrance 3aGermany 3aGreat Britain 3aIreland1 aWallace, Michael1 aThorne, Fiona1 aBreen, James0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2021 Oct., v. 103, no. 5 p.1903-1923dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajae.122163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009700166300001600263520161800279592002801897650002201925650001201947650002101959650002301980650001902003650001302022650001202035650001702047650002602064650001002090650002402100650001302124650001902137650001902156650001102175650001502186650000702201650003302208650003802241650003702279653001302316653002202329653003002351653002502381653002202406700001602428700001302444700001602457700001502473700001502488773013502503856008702638852000902725655001202734IND60687327520221122200641.0200523e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068732752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Chao10aChitosan/calcium phosphate flower-like microparticles as carriers for drug delivery platform  ap. 174-183.  aA special flower-like chitosan (CS)/calcium phosphate (CaP) microparticle was fabricated as a novel pH-sensitive carrier for sustained release drug system via a rapid one-pot approach. The CS-tripolyphosphate (TPP) nanocomplexes were firstly prepared through ionotropic gelation. Then, the CS nanocomplexes network acted as the template and inducer for adsorbing the mineralized CaP nanosheets and directing its assembly into the flower-like microparticles. The preparation condition optimized by Box-Behnken design-response surface methodology was achieved with 3.16 mg/ml of CS, 127.22 mg/ml of TPP, and 89.50 mM of CaCl₂. The morphologies of the system were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), and it showed that the flower-like microparticles with a diameter of 5–7 μm are composed of sheet-like petals with about 40 nm in thickness. And the TEM results showed that the petals consist by nanosheets with the thickness of 2–5 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results showed that the P/Ca ratio of CS/CaP microparticles is 1.29/1. The in vitro release studies demonstrated well sustained-release properties and pH-sensitive releasing characteristic of CS/CaP microparticles. The drug release mechanism was fitted by Korsmeyer-Peppas model at a pH of 5.8 and 7.4, respectively. The in vitro cell viability research demonstrated the microparticles have no obvious cytotoxicity at the dosages below 500 μg/ml. This work supplied a versatile platform as a novel drug delivery system with excellent pH-sensitive and sustained release performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acalcium phosphates 3acell viability 3achitosan 3acorolla 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aexperimental design 3agelation 3amicroparticles 3amineralization 3amodels 3ananosheets 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopes 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aChitosan 0aCalcium phosphate 0aFlower-like microparticle 0aDrug delivery system 0aSustained release1 aWu, Shizhao1 aLi, Jiao1 aLi, Xiaoqin1 aYang, Peng1 aLi, Guohua0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 15, v. 155 p.174-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245018000161300002000341500001900361520196200380592002802342650001502370650001702385650002602402650002302428650001102451650002002462650002102482650001702503650002202520650001502542650001402557650000702571650001502578700001602593700002202609700002402631700002102655700002002676700001702696773012402713856007402837852000902911655001202920IND60695998220221122060427.0200521e20200518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069599822DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra01204a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhéczy, Nicolas12aA two-enzyme cascade reaction consisting of two reaction pathways. Studies in bulk solution for understanding the performance of a flow-through device with immobilised enzymes  ap. 18655-18676.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnzyme-catalysed cascade reactions in flow-through systems with immobilised enzymes currently are of great interest for exploring their potential for biosynthetic and bioanalytical applications. Basic studies in this field often aim at understanding the stability of the immobilised enzymes and their catalytic performance, for example, in terms of yield of a desired reaction product, analyte detection limit, enzyme stability or reaction reproducibility. In the work presented, a cascade reaction involving the two enzymes bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) – with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as HRP “activator” – was first investigated in great detail in bulk solution at pH = 7.2. The reaction studied is the hydrolysis and oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH₂-DA) to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), which was found to proceed along two reaction pathways. This two-enzyme cascade reaction was then applied for analysing the performance of BCA and HRP immobilised in glass fiber filters which were placed inside a filter holder device through which a DCFH₂-DA/H₂O₂ substrate solution was pumped. Comparison was made between (i) co-immobilised and (ii) sequentially immobilised enzymes (BCA first, HRP second). Significant differences for the two arrangements in terms of measured product yield (DCF) could be explained based on quantitative UV/vis absorption measurements carried out in bulk solution. We found that the lower DCF yield observed for sequentially immobilised enzymes originates from a change in one of the two possible reaction pathways due to enzyme separation, which was not the case for enzymes that were co-immobilised (or simultaneously present in the bulk solution experiments). The higher DCF yield observed for co-immobilised enzymes did not originate from a molecular proximity effect (no increased oxidation compared to sequential immobilisation).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiosynthesis 3acarbonate dehydratase 3acatalytic activity 3acattle 3adetection limit 3aenzyme stability 3aglass fibers 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrolysis 3aoxidation 3apH 3aperoxidase1 aSasaki, Kai1 aYoshimoto, Makoto1 aPour-Esmaeil, Sajad1 aKröger, Martin,1 aStano, Pasquale1 aWalde, Peter0 tRSC advances.g2020 May 18, v. 10, no. 32 p.18655-18676dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra01204a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03544naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245013600211300001600347506011700363506007600480520162500556592002802181506003702209650002102246650001302267650002302280650001702303650001502320650001402335650001202349650002202361650002002383650002502403651001002428653002702438653002702465653001802492653001702510653001502527700002602542700002102568700006502589700002202654700006002676700002302736700002302759773013802782856008502920852000903005655001203014IND60758453420221207092820.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075845342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2021.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrelli, Alessio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7533-726010aEducation inequalities in cardiovascular and coronary heart disease in Italy and the role of behavioral and biological risk factors  ap. 918-928.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBehavioral and biological risk factors (BBRF) explain part of the variability in socioeconomic differences in health. The present study aimed at evaluating education differences in incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in Italy and the role of BBRF. All subjects aged 30–74 years (n = 132,686) who participated to the National Health Interview Surveys 2000 and 2005 were included and followed-up for ten years. Exposure to smoking, physical activity, overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension at baseline was considered. Education level was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The outcomes were incident cases of CVD and CHD. Hazard ratios by education level were estimated, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates and stratifying by sex and geographic area. The contribution of BBRF to education inequalities was estimated by counterfactual mediation analysis, in addition to the assessment of the risk attenuation by comparing the models including BBRF or not. 22,214 participants had a CVD event and 6173 a CHD event. After controlling for sociodemographic factors, the least educated men showed a 21% higher risk of CVD and a 17% higher risk of CHD compared to the most educated (41% and 61% among women). The mediating effect (natural indirect effect) of BBRF between extreme education levels was 52% for CVD and 84% for CHD among men (16% among women for CVD). More effective strategies aiming at reducing socioeconomic disparities in CVD and CHD are needed, through programs targeting less educated people in combination with community-wide initiatives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acoronary disease 3adiabetes 3aeducational status 3ahypertension 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3arisk assessment 3asocioeconomic status 3aItaly 0aCardiovascular disease 0aCoronary heart disease 0aSocioeconomic 0aInequalities 0aPrevention1 aSebastiani, Gabriella1 aDi Napoli, Anteo1 aMacciotta, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0287-79791 aDi Filippo, Paola1 aStrippoli, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7120-92051 aMirisola, Concetta1 ad’Errico, Angelo0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.918-928dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245010600205300001600311520187200327592002802199650001502227650001102242650001902253650001602272650002202288650002402310650003902334650003002373650001602403650003702419650004802456650002002504650001702524650002202541650002102563653001602584653001502600653002302615653003002638653002402668653002602692653003502718653001802753653003902771653002402810653003202834653004702866700001602913700001802929700002002947773014602967856008303113852000903196655001203205IND60591571220221122060947.0201125e20180325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059157122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarada, Naoki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3846-388X10aStereoselective effects of lactate enantiomers on the enhancement of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation  ap. 105-110.  aLactate contains a chiral carbon and thus has two optical isomers—d-lactate and l-lactate. l-Lactate is the predominant form that is produced by the body and can be delivered to the organs. On the other hand, gut microbiota produce both isomers, which can then flow into the body. Although both d-lactate and l-lactate can contribute to energy metabolism, their potential roles in adipocyte differentiation remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of l-lactate and d-lactate on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Both lactate enantiomers were demonstrated to enhance triglyceride accumulation by stimulating the early phase of adipocyte differentiation. Notably, d-lactate was more potent than l-lactate in inducing triglyceride accumulation. The degree of triglyceride accumulation induced by l-lactate was similar to that induced by pyruvate. d-Lactate was more potent than l-lactate in increasing the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Both lactate enantiomers did not affect cell viability. Moreover, both enantiomers upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, and fatty acid synthase, with d-lactate exerting stronger effects than l-lactate. By contrast, lactate did not influence the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. d-Lactate significantly increased and l-lactate tended to increase p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 inhibited the stimulation of adipocyte differentiation by d-lactate and l-lactate. These findings showed that both lactate enantiomers stimulate preadipocyte differentiation, with d-lactate showing more potent effects than l-lactate. In addition, our study demonstrated that d-lactate and l-lactate exert different effects on physiological events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3acarbon 3acell viability 3aenantiomers 3aenergy metabolism 3afatty-acid synthase 3aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactic acid 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3aphosphorylation 3apyruvic acid 3astereoselectivity 3atriacylglycerols 0aLactic acid 0aEnantiomer 0aEnantioselectivity 0aAdipocyte differentiation 0a3T3-L1 preadipocyte 0acAMP-response element 0aCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein 0adexamethasone 0aglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 0afatty acid synthase 0a3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine 0aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor1 aHirano, Ito1 aInui, Hiroshi1 aYamaji, Ryoichi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Mar. 25, v. 498, no. 1 p.105-110dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245008100176300001800257520161100275536007501886592002801961650001401989650001102003650002402014650001602038650002502054653002602079653003202105653003202137653004102169653002302210700002002233700002502253773014502278856008502423852000902508655001202517IND60615290920221122111834.0181009e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061529092DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2017.13202872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerrendero, José R.10aOn the Use of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces in Functional Classification  ap. 1210-1218.  aThe Hájek–Feldman dichotomy establishes that two Gaussian measures are either mutually absolutely continuous with respect to each other (and hence there is a Radon–Nikodym density for each measure with respect to the other one) or mutually singular. Unlike the case of finite-dimensional Gaussian measures, there are nontrivial examples of both situations when dealing with Gaussian stochastic processes. This article provides: (a) Explicit expressions for the optimal (Bayes) rule and the minimal classification error probability in several relevant problems of supervised binary classification of mutually absolutely continuous Gaussian processes. The approach relies on some classical results in the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). (b) An interpretation, in terms of mutual singularity, for the so-called “near perfect classification” phenomenon. We show that the asymptotically optimal rule proposed by these authors can be identified with the sequence of optimal rules for an approximating sequence of classification problems in the absolutely continuous case. (c) As an application, we discuss a natural variable selection method, which essentially consists of taking the original functional data X(t), t ∈ [0, 1] to a d-dimensional marginal (X(t₁), …, X(td)), which is chosen to minimize the classification error of the corresponding Fisher’s linear rule. We give precise conditions under which this discrimination method achieves the minimal classification error of the original functional problem.

Though the negative environmental impacts of this tree plantation in arid and semiarid regions have been identified by some studies, there has been little sign of policy change. In order to understand why, we must be aware of the political processes that have sustained China’s tree-centered conservation approach for the past decades, but these processes have been largely left unexamined in existing scholarly literature. This study examines these processes by identifying the interest groups involved in environmental conservation, and the ways they leverage scientific knowledge for specific political objectives. This study argues that improved scientific understanding of natural systems will be insufficient to bring about positive environmental changes unless institutional balance is adjusted correspondingly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aissues and policy 3aplantations 3apolitics 3asemiarid zones 3aChina0 tRegional environmental change.g2016 June, v. 16, no. 5 p.1535-1539dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-37987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-016-0954-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011700170300001600287520071500303592002801018650000801046650001101054650001501065650001301080650001001093650001201103650001001115650001001125650001301135650003101148650003001179650001801209650002401227650001001251651001001261700002401271700002401295700002401319700002701343700002001370773010301390856008401493852000901577655001201586IND60087121820221121044020.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008712182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalomar, Ana M.10aGenetic characterization of Candidatus Rickettsia vini, a new rickettsia amplified in ticks from La Rioja, Spain  ap. 319-321.  aA total of 222 ticks removed from birds in La Rioja (Spain) were screened for spotted fever group rickettsia species using ompA PCR assays.

METHODS: Blood, urine and pleural fluid were prospectively collected from cats presenting with pleural effusion categorised as cardiac or non‐cardiac in origin. NT‐ProBNP concentrations were measured using a feline‐specific enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. Groups were statistically compared and receiver operating characteristic curves constructed to determine cut‐offs to distinguish cardiac from non‐cardiac pleural effusion in plasma, pleural fluid and urine. RESULTS: Forty cats with pleural effusion (22 cardiac and 18 non‐cardiac) were studied. NT‐proBNP concentrations in plasma and pleural fluid were strongly correlated. Plasma (P<0·001) and pleural fluid (P<0·001) NT‐proBNP concentrations and urinary NT‐proBNT/creatinine ratios (P=0·035) were significantly higher in the cardiac group. After receiver operating characteristic curve analysis a plasma NT‐proBNP cut‐off of 214·3 pmol/mL was suggested [sensitivity=86·4% (95% CI: 66·7 to 95·3%), specificity=88·9% (95% CI: 67·2 to 96·9%)] and a pleural fluid NT‐proBNP cut‐off of 322·3 pmol/mL was suggested [sensitivity=100% (95% CI: 85·1 to 100%), specificity=94·4% (95% CI: 74·2 to 99·0%)]. No cut‐off with adequate sensitivity and specificity for urinary NT‐proBNP/creatinine ratios was suggested. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Measurement of NT‐proBNP in pleural fluid distinguishes cardiac from non‐cardiac causes of pleural effusion in cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3acats 3acreatinine 3anatriuretic peptides 3athoracoscopy 3aurinalysis 3aurine 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxbloodxdiagnosisxurine. 2aCats 2aCreatininexurine 2aExudates and Transudatesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHeart Diseasesxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aMale 2aNatriuretic Peptide, Brainxanalysisxbloodxurine. 2aPeptide Fragmentsxanalysisxbloodxurine. 2aPleural Effusionxbloodxdiagnosisxetiologyxurinexveterinary.1 aHezzell, M.1 aSargent, J.1 aConnolly, D.

In a typical case, a high purity iron wire is immersed into a sodium alginate (SA) saturated 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) monomer solution to perform Surface Catalytically Initiated Radical Polymerization (SCIRP), followed by Ca²⁺ post-crosslinking. Subsequently, the successful removal of the iron wire template enables the formation of a hollow PHEMA/SA–Ca²⁺ layered hydrogel tube. The layered hydrogel tubes can be prepared with tunable sizes, good tensile strength, perfusable 3D complex structure and minimal cytotoxicity. Multi-layered hydrogel tubes can be obtained as well on the basis of monomers diffusion and re-initiation mechanism, which may address the demands for tissue manufacturing. Finally, the bioactivity of the PHEMA/SA–Ca²⁺ layered hydrogel tube is proved by the surface adhesion and proliferation of two types of cells-NIH3T3 and PAECs on the inner side of the layered hydrogel tubes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acalcium 3acytotoxicity 3ahydrogels 3airon 3amanufacturing 3apolymerization 3aseparation 3asodium alginate 3atensile strength1 aMa, Shuanhong1 aLin, Peng1 aCai, Meirong1 aZheng, Zijian1 aZhou, Feng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 June 5, v. 7, no. 22 p.3505-3511dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb00185a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245014400161300001400305520131300319592002801632650002501660650001801685650002501703650001701728650001201745650001201757650001101769650001301780650001901793650001401812650001001826651001001836653000801846653000801854653000801862653002701870653002001897653003201917653003301949700001601982700001901998773020202017856008202219852000902301655001202310IND60543550220221121182114.0190411e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054355022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfe.2013.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jinna10aDesigning afforestation subsidies that account for the benefits of carbon sequestration: A case study using data from China's Loess Plateau  ap. 65-76.  aThis paper presents a method for determining the subsidy required to motivate farmers to participate in timber afforestation programs designed to maximize social well-being. The method incorporates a carbon sequestration benefit function into the land expected value model in order to quantify the social benefit arising from carbon sequestration by the planted trees. This is used to calculate the optimal rotation age for newly planted forests that maximizes social utility. The minimum subsidy required to motivate farmers to participate in the afforestation program was calculated using a modified decision model that accounts for the subsidy's impact. The maximum subsidy offered by the government was taken to be the NPV of the carbon sequestration achieved by afforestation. Data on Robinia pseudoacacia L. trees planted on the Loess Plateau were used in an empirical test of the model, which in this case predicts an optimal subsidy of 254.38yuan/ha over 40 years. This would guarantee the maintenance of forest on land designated for afforestation until they reached the socially optimal rotation age. The method presented herein offers a new framework for designing afforestation subsidy programs that account for the environmental service (specially, the carbon sequestration) provided by forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aafforestation 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3afarmers 3aforests 3amodels 3aplanting 3asocial benefit 3asubsidies 3atrees 3aChina 0aQ23 0aQ28 0aQ58 0aPlanting timber forest 0aOptimal subsidy 0aOptimal compensation period 0aCarbon sequestration benefit1 aYao, Shunbo1 aZhang, Bisheng0 tJournal of forest economics.g2014 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.65-76dElsevier GmbHaDepartment of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, UmeåwJournal:jnl3660850x1104-68997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfe.2013.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01329naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002400161245009700185300001800282500000900300520039100309592002800700650001100728650001500739650002500754650001600779773015100795856009600946852000901042655001201051IND60668768220221119175719.0191125e197909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066876822DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1979.03615995004300050049x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSophocleous, Marios12aA Thermal Conductivity Probe Designed for Easy Installation and Recovery from Shallow Depths  ap. 1056-1058.  aepub  aExisting designs of thermal conductivity probes were modified in order to build a probe suitable for easy installation and recovery from shallow depths above or below the water table in unconsolidated deposits.

Since silicon (Si) fertilization is effective in alleviating As-induced stresses in plants, and plant-microbe interactions are tightly coupled, we hypothesized that Si-fertilization would improve soil microbial functional potentials to environmental stress tolerance, which was not yet studied. With the help of high throughput metagenome, microarray and analyzing plant impacts on soil microbiome and the environment, we tested the hypothesis in two geographically different rice (i.e., Japonica and Indica) grown on As-enriched soils. Silicate fertilization in rice grown on As-enriched soils altered rhizosphere bacterial communities and increased several commensal microorganisms and their genetic potential to tolerate oxidative stress, osmotic stress, oxygen limitation, nitrogen and phosphate limitation, heat and cold shock, and radiation stress. The stress resistant microbial communities shifted with the changes in rhizosphere nutrient flows and cumulative plant impacts on the soil environment. The study highlights a thus-far unexplored behavior of Si-fertilization to improve microbial stress resilience under As-laden cropping systems and opens up a promising avenue to further study how commonalities in plant-microbe signaling in response to Si-fertilization alleviates As-induced stresses in agro-systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acold stress 3aedaphic factors 3agenetic traits 3aheat 3ahost plants 3ametagenomics 3amicroarray technology 3amicrobiome 3anitrogen 3aosmotic stress 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3arhizosphere 3arice 3asilicates 3asilicon 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3astress tolerance 0aSilicon fertilization 0aStress resistant gene 0aRhizosphere microbiome 0aPlant traits1 aKim, Gil Won1 aLee, Jeong Gu1 aBhuiyan, Mohammad Saiful Islam1 aKim, Pil Joo0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.125953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1259533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006300170300001600233520128700249592002801536650000801564650001401572650001201586650001701598653001701615653002201632653001301654653001901667653001801686700001201704700002201716700001701738773012901755856008501884852000901969655001201978IND60563548020221118071356.0170224e20170504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056354802DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2016.11917202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPradhan, A.

This approach was extended to bi-constituent nonwovens consisting of fibers with bi-modal diameter distribution and mono-constituent nonwovens composed of fibers with mono-modal diameter distribution. The multi-constituent nonwovens exhibited highest air permeability, followed by the bi- and mono-constituent nonwovens for the same mean fiber diameter. This was explained in terms of the mean pore diameter of the multi-, bi-, and mono-constituent nonwoven structures. An analytical expression of mean fiber diameter of multi-constituent nonwoven structures was derived. The square of the mean fiber diameter in the multi-constituent nonwovens was found to be the harmonic mean of the volume-weighted square of the mean fiber diameter of the individual constituents. The mean fiber diameter coupled with Kozeny–Carman equation was found to predict the air permeability of the multi-, bi-, and mono-constituent nonwovens very well. It was observed that the mono-constituent nonwoven displayed the highest value of Kozeny–Carman coefficient, followed by the bi- and multi-constituent nonwovens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aequations 3afabrics 3apermeability 0aPermeability 0amulti-constituent 0anonwoven 0afiber diameter 0apore diameter1 aDas, D.1 aChattopadhyay, R.1 aSingh, S.

A Fe model for the Southern Ocean (SOFe) is developed to understand the role of bacteria and organic ligands in controlling Fe cycling and productivity. The model resolves the classical food web and microbial loop, including three types of nutrients (N, Si, Fe) and two types of Fe ligands. Simulations of the zero-dimensional (0-D) model are calibrated with detailed results of shipboard grow-out incubation experiments conducted with Antarctic Peninsula phytoplankton communities during winter 2006 to provide the best estimate of key biological parameters. Then a one-dimensional (1-D) model is developed by coupling the biological model with the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) for a site on the Antarctic Peninsula shelf, and the model parameters are further calibrated with data collected from two surveys (summer 2004 and winter 2006) in the area. The results of the numerical simulations agree reasonably well with observations. An analysis of the 1-D model results suggests that bacteria and organic ligands may play an important role in Fe cycling, which can be categorized into a relatively fast mode within the euphotic zone dominated by photo-reactions (summer d Fe residence time about 600 days) and complexation and a slow mode below with most of the dFe biologically complexed (summer dFe residence time >10 years). The dFe removal from the euphotic zone is dominated by colloidal formation and further aggregations with additional contribution from biological uptake, and an increase of organic ligands would reduce Fe export. The decrease of Fe removal rate over depth is due to the continuous dissolution and remineralization of particulate Fe. A number of sensitivity experiments are carried out for both 0-D and 1-D models to understand the importance of photo-reactive processes in primary productivity, bacterial activity, Fe speciation, and dFe residence time within the euphotic zone. The bio-availability of ligand-bound Fe (FeL) is critical to modeled high primary productivity, which is consistent with both shipboard measurements and field observations. In addition, model productivity is sensitive to photoreaction rates if FeL is not directly available for phytoplankton uptake.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acolloids 3aeuphotic zone 3afood webs 3airon 3amathematical models 3anutrients 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3asilicon 3asummer 3asurveys 3aAntarctic region1 aBarbeau, Katherine A.1 aSelph, Karen E.1 aMeasures, Christopher I.1 aBuck, Kristen N.1 aAzam, Farooq1 aGreg Mitchell, B.1 aZhou, Meng0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 June, v. 90 p.112-133dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.01.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011500171300001400286520105400300592002801354650002801382650001101410650002001421650001401441650002001455650003501475650001001510650001501520650001201535650003301547700002301580700001901603700003001622700002501652700002501677773009001702856008301792852000901875655001201884IND60616819720221116160640.0191114e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcsw.2018.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Jessica10aLack of chitin synthase genes impacts capsular architecture and cellular physiology in Cryptococcus neoformans  ap. 14-23.  aCryptococcus neoformans mutants lacking each of the eight putative chitin synthase genes (CHS) have been previously generated. However, it is still unclear how deletion of chitin synthase genes affects the cryptococcal capsule. Since the connections between chitin metabolism and capsular polysaccharides in C. neoformans are numerous, we analyzed the effects of deletion of CHS genes on capsular and capsule-related structures of C. neoformans. CHS deletion affected capsular morphology in multiple ways, as determined by scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis. Molecular diameter, serological reactivity and export of capsular polysaccharide were also affected in most of the chsΔ mutants, but the most prominent alterations were observed in the chs3Δ strain. C. neoformans cells lacking CHS genes also had altered formation of extracellular vesicles and variable chitinase activity under stress conditions. These results reveal previously unknown functions of CHS genes that greatly impact the physiology of C. neoformans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3achitin 3achitin synthase 3achitinase 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amutants 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aRamos, Caroline L.1 aFrases, Susana1 aGodinho, Rodrigo M. da C.1 aFonseca, Fernanda L.1 aRodrigues, Marcio L.0 tCell surface.g2018 June, v. 2 p.14-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26762x2468-23307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcsw.2018.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245011700160300001800277520097900295592002801274650002601302650001001328650001601338650001301354650001601367650002601383650001701409650001201426650001401438700001701452700002101469700001901490773014101509856007401650852000901724655001201733IND60646321020221117215801.0190606e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064632102DNAL7 a10.1039/c9tb00557a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Hyeon-Ho10aRecent advances in gold nanoparticles for biomedical applications: from hybrid structures to multi-functionality  ap. 3480-3496.  aGold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are arguably the most versatile nanomaterials reported to date. Recent advances in nanofabrication and chemical synthesis have expanded the scope of Au NPs from classical homogeneous nanospheres to a wide range of hybrid nanostructures with programmable size, shape and composition. Novel physiochemical properties can be achieved via design and engineering of the hybrid nanostructures. In this review we discuss the recent progress in the development of complex hybrid Au NPs and propose a classification framework based on three fundamental structural dimensions (length scale, complexity and symmetry) to aid categorising, comparing and designing various types of Au NPs. Their novel functions and potential for biomedical applications will also be discussed, featuring point-of-care diagnostics by advanced optical spectroscopy and assays, as well as minimally invasive surgeries and targeted drug delivery using multifunctional nano-robots.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3adrugs 3aengineering 3ananogold 3ananospheres 3apoint-of-care systems 3aspectroscopy 3asurgery 3asynthesis1 aChoi, Eunjin1 aEllis, Elizabeth1 aLee, Tung-Chun0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2019 June 5, v. 7, no. 22 p.3480-3496dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9tb00557a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012400159300001600283520130700299592002801606650001201634650002001646650001201666650002201678650001201700650001501712650001101727650001001738650001001748650001301758651001001771653000801781653000801789653002301797653002201820653002201842653001801864653002401882700001801906700001401924700001401938773020401952856008202156852000902238655001202247IND60543550620221120121956.0190411e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054355062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfe.2014.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yi14aThe effect of collective forestland tenure reform in China: Does land parcelization reduce forest management intensity?  ap. 126-140.  aChina implemented a new round of collective forestland tenure reform during 2003–2013. In this reform, forestland owned by villages or township collective organizations were divided into a great number of small plots and allocated to member households of the collectives. A widespread concern about the reform is that parcelization of forestland might limit farmers’ incentives to invest in forest management. This paper examines the factors affecting farmers’ investment in forest management using household data collected in four provinces in 2010. The results show that the intensity of a household's investment in forest management is negatively affected by its nonfarm income and the average size of forest plots, but positively affected by the easiness in obtaining loan and the technical assistance the household receives. We argue that the counterintuitive effect of nonfarm income on investment intensity is due to the increasing marginal cost of own labor input. The effects of forest plot size and easiness in obtaining loan suggest that households have limited amount of capital to invest in forest management. Because of this constraint, parcelization of forestland resulted from the recent reform has not yet caused any reduction of the intensity of investment in forest management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3adata collection 3afarmers 3aforest management 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alabor 3aloans 3avillages 3aChina 0aQ23 0aN50 0aLand tenure reform 0aCollective forest 0aForest management 0aForest policy 0aDouble hurdle model1 aGong, Peichen1 aHan, Xiao1 aWen, Yali0 tJournal of forest economics.g2014 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.126-140dElsevier GmbHaDepartment of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, UmeåwJournal:jnl3660850x1104-68997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfe.2014.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007600150245012600226520196000352592002802312650002602340650002802366650000902394650001202403650001402415650001502429650004102444650002702485650003002512650001302542650001302555650001102568650003102579653002502610653001502635653002302650653002402673700002602697700002602723700002902749700006802778700004002846700003602886700003102922773010602953856008503059852000903144655001203153IND60758454120221120183015.0211219e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075845412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2021.1269252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, Paulo Victor Magalhães1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9142-956310aAttraction and toxicity: Ways volatile organic compounds released by Pochonia chlamydosporia affect Meloidogyne incognita  aThe production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) acting against plant-parasitic nematodes has been characterized in different fungi; however, the role of VOCs emitted by Pochonia chlamydosporia in its trophic interaction with Meloidogyne incognita is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of VOCs emitted by P. chlamydosporia strain Pc-10 on different stages (eggs, juveniles and female) of the M. incognita life cycle. Exposure of M. incognita eggs to VOCs released by Pc-10 resulted in a reduction up to 88 % in the nematode egg hatching, when compared to the control treatments. The VOCs emitted by Pc-10 also attracted M. incognita second-stage juveniles (J2). Through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), three molecules were identified from the volatiles of the strain Pc-10, with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene being the major compound. In tests performed in vitro, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene at a concentration of 1050 μg mL⁻¹ inhibited M. incognita egg hatching by up to 78.7 % compared to the control (0 μg mL⁻¹) and attracted M. incognita J2 in all concentrations evaluated (1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 μg mL⁻¹). The 1,4-dimethoxybenzene also showed fumigant and non-fumigant nematicidal activity against M. incognita. This compound presented lethal concentration for 50 % (LC₅₀) of M. incognita J2 ranged from 132 to 136 μg mL⁻¹. Fumigation with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (100 mg) reduced egg hatching by up to 89 % and killed up to 86 % of M. incognita J2 compared to the control (0 μg mL⁻¹). In vivo, the VOCs produced by Pc-10, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, and the combination of both (Pc-10 + 1,4-dimethoxybenzene) attracted the M. incognita J2, compared to the respective controls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the attraction of M. incognita J2 and the toxicity to eggs and J2 by VOCs from P. chlamydosporia in which 1,4-dimethoxybenzene is the main toxin and attractant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aPochonia chlamydosporia 3aeggs 3afemales 3afumigants 3afumigation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3anematicidal properties 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3avolatile organic compounds 0a1,4-Dimethoxybenzene 0aAttraction 0aBiological control 0aNematophagous fungi1 aCampos, Vicente Paulo1 aTerra, Willian César1 aPedroso, Marcio Pozzobon1 ade Paula, Letícia Lopes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9735-00361 ada Silva, Maysa Siqueira Gonçalves1 aMonteiro, Thalita Suelen Avelar1 ade Freitas, Leandro Grassi0 tMicrobiological research.g2022 Feb., v. 255 p.126925-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2021.1269253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245013000173300001600303520133800319592002801657650001501685650001201700650001101712650001201723650001201735650001301747650001101760650001101771650001301782650000901795650002601804650002001830650001401850650001501864650001101879650002401890650001501914650001101929650001401940650001301954650001801967650000801985650001501993650001502008650000902023651001402032700002002046700002002066700001602086700001702102700002202119700002302141700002402164773011702188856008102305852000902386655001202395IND60520157020221119092314.0160514e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052015702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-015-9749-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiyabalanage, Saranga10aHas irrigated water from Mahaweli River contributed to the kidney disease of uncertain etiology in the dry zone of Sri Lanka?  ap. 679-690.  aThe Mahaweli is the largest river basin in Sri Lanka that provides water to the dry zone region through multipurpose irrigation schemes . Selenium, arsenic, cadmium, and other bioimportant trace elements in surface waters of the upper Mahaweli River were measured using ICP-MS. Trace element levels were then compared with water from two other rivers (Maha Oya, Kalu Ganga) and from six dry zone irrigation reservoirs. Results showed that the trace metal concentrations in the Mahaweli upper catchment were detected in the order of Fe > Cu > Zn > Se > Cr > Mn > As > Ni > Co > Mo. Remarkably high levels of Ca, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, As, and Se were observed in the Mahaweli Basin compared to other study rivers. Considerably high levels of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, and Se were found in upstream tributaries of the Mahaweli River. Such metals possibly originated from phosphate and organic fertilizers that are heavily applied for tea and vegetable cultivations within the drainage basin. Cadmium that is often attributed to the etiology of unknown chronic kidney diseases in certain parts of the dry zone is much lower than previously reported levels. Decrease in these metals in the lower part of the Mahaweli River could be due to adsorption of trace metals onto sediment and consequent deposition in reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abasins 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aetiology 3airon 3airrigation management 3akidney diseases 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3aorganic fertilizers 3aphosphates 3arivers 3asediments 3aselenium 3asurface water 3atea 3avegetables 3awatersheds 3azinc 3aSri Lanka1 aAbekoon, Sumith1 aWatanabe, Izumi1 aWatai, Chie1 aŌno, Yūko,1 aWijesekara, Saman1 aGuruge, Keerthi S.1 aChandrajith, Rohana0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2016 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.679-690dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-015-9749-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100003600189245011200225300001300337506007600350520136900426592002801795506003701823650002101860650002601881650001301907650001501920650001901935650001501954650002001969650001001989650002501999650001102024650001902035650001902054650001302073650002102086653001802107653003102125653002702156653000902183653000902192653001002201700002402211700001902235700002502254700009802279700002702377700002202404773008902426856008302515852000902598655001202607IND60616819920221207053235.0191114e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcsw.2018.04.0022doi7 aPMC60535972pmcid7 a300466642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Rocamora, Víctor M.10aCoupling of polymerase and carrier lipid phosphatase prevents product inhibition in peptidoglycan synthesis  ap. 1-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall that maintains the shape and integrity of the cell. The PG precursor lipid II is assembled at the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane, translocated to the periplasmic side, and polymerized to glycan chains by membrane anchored PG synthases, such as the class A Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Polymerization of PG releases the diphosphate form of the carrier lipid, undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (C55-PP), which is converted to the monophosphate form by membrane-embedded pyrophosphatases, generating C55-P for a new round of PG precursor synthesis. Here we report that deletion of the C55-PP pyrophosphatase gene pgpB in E. coli increases the susceptibility to cefsulodin, a β-lactam specific for PBP1A, indicating that the cellular function of PBP1B is impaired in the absence of PgpB. Purified PBP1B interacted with PgpB and another C55-PP pyrophosphatase, BacA and both, PgpB and BacA stimulated the glycosyltransferase activity of PBP1B. C55-PP was found to be a potent inhibitor of PBP1B. Our data suggest that the stimulation of PBP1B by PgpB is due to the faster removal and processing of C55-PP, and that PBP1B interacts with C55-PP phosphatases during PG synthesis to couple PG polymerization with the recycling of the carrier lipid and prevent product inhibition by C55-PP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3acefsulodin 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aglycosyltransferases 3alipids 3apeptidoglycans 3apolymerization 3aproteins 3apyrophosphatases 0aPeptidoglycan 0aPenicillin-binding protein 0aUndecaprenyl phosphate 0aBacA 0aPgpB 0aPBP1B1 aOtten, Christian F.1 aRadkov, Atanas1 aSimorre, Jean-Pierre1 aBreukink, Eefjan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7311-0660 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7311-06601 aVanNieuwenhze, Michael1 aVollmer, Waldemar0 tCell surface.g2018 June, v. 2 p.1-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26762x2468-23307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcsw.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245009100209300001800300520111800318592002801436650001801464650001401482650000901496650002201505650002201527650001001549650001001559650001401569653001301583653001401596653000901610653000801619653000901627653001201636653001001648700002001658700002301678700002001701700002801721773014801749856008001897852000901977655001201986IND60604264020221122012125.0180716e20180325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060426402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b002082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrogh Madsen, Claus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8921-392010aSuperior Growth Rates in Broilers Fed Wheat with Low In Vitro Feed-Xylanase Inhibition  ap. 4044-4050.  aGrain-batch variation in xylanase-inhibitor levels may account for variations in the efficacy of feed xylanase supplementation. This would make inhibition an important quality parameter in the routine analysis of feedstuffs. Two analytical procedures for testing feedstuffs against specific xylanases were researched: the high-throughput viscosity-pressure assay (ViPr) and the extraction-free remazol-brilliant-blue–beechwood-xylan (RBBX) assay. Thirty-two wheat cultivars were analyzed for inhibition of a commercial xylanase, Ronozyme WX. Four cultivars were selected for a feeding experiment in which the growth of 1440 broilers from ages 7–33 days was monitored. The treatments resulted up to 7 % difference (day 14) in broiler weight . The cultivar choice had an effect throughout the experiment (p < 0.05). The performance ranking of the treatments corresponded better to xylanase inhibition than to crude-protein content or nonstarch-polysaccharide content. Wheat-grain xylanase-inhibitor content is therefore a highly relevant quality parameter when broiler diets are supplemented with feed xylanase.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3adiet 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afeeds 3awheat 3axylanases 0axylanase 0ainhibitor 0aTAXI 0aXIP 0aTLXI 0abroiler 0awheat1 aPettersson, Dan1 aHjortshøj, Rasmus1 aKatholm, Anders1 aBrinch-Pedersen, Henrik0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Mar. 25, v. 66, no. 16 p.4044-4050dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b002083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011200161300001600273520109600289592002801385650001801413650002701431650001201458650001301470650001301483650001101496650001101507650001701518650000901535650001901544650001401563650001101577650001701588650001501605650001801620650000901638650002001647650002101667650001901688650000901707651001001716700001501726700001901741773011701760856008101877852000901958655001201967IND60520157120221119092003.0160514e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052015712DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-015-9765-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kexin10aRisk assessment of atmospheric heavy metals exposure in Baotou, a typical industrial city in northern China  ap. 843-853.  aIndustrial activities have led to serious air pollution and the potentially toxic elements in atmospheric particles can cause various health problems to humans. In this study, inhalable particulate matter (PM₁₀) and fine particles (PM₂.₅) were collected from four typical sites in Baotou, an industrial city in northern China. We investigated both the mass concentrations of particulate matter and the concentrations of heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cu, Mn, Co, and Zn) in the collected samples. We assessed the public health risks associated with atmospheric heavy metal exposure. The results showed that the mass concentrations of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ as well as these heavy metal concentrations varied notably influenced by the prevailing wind directions. Among the studied metals, Zn, Mn, Pb, and Cr were the main metal pollutants in both PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅. The results of the health assessment showed that the eight heavy metals studied pose significant non-carcinogenic risks and Cr, Cd, and Co pose lifetime lung cancer risks to local residents, especially to children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric deposition 3acadmium 3achildren 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3alung neoplasms 3amanganese 3anickel 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atoxic substances 3awind direction 3azinc 3aChina1 aLiang, Tao1 aWang, Lingqing0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2016 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.843-853dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-015-9765-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010000165300001600265520132700281592002801608650001001636650001501646650002501661650001801686650001501704650002401719650001201743650002301755651001201778653000801790653000801798653000801806653003601814653001501850653002301865653003601888653002501924653002801949700002001977700001601997700002102013773020402034856008202238852000902320655001202329IND60543550720221121213839.0190411e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054355072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfe.2014.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLankia, Tuija10aWillingness to contribute to the management of recreational quality on private lands in Finland  ap. 141-160.  aIn Finland, privately owned nature areas are widely used for recreation due to open public access. However, since landowners are not obligated to take everyman's rights into consideration when making management decisions, the recreational quality of nature areas is not guaranteed for users. We examined whether individual recreationists on private lands would be willing purchase management actions from landowners that influence recreational quality. In addition to willingness to pay, we assessed willingness to contribute labor to such actions. The results demonstrated that about half of the recreationists who participated in our survey were willing to contribute labor and about 10% were willing to pay to direct the management of their typical recreation site on private lands. The mean willingness to pay was 92 euros per year and the mean willingness to contribute labor 3.5 days per year. A latent class regression model revealed that recreationists were not, however, completely homogeneous in their preferences for the actions or in their preferred contribution forms. On the basis of the results, there is moderate demand from recreationists for management to improve recreational quality and the potential for local landscape management arrangements that allow individual recreationists to contribute labor.  aPublisher supplied data 3alabor 3alandowners 3alandscape management 3aprivate lands 3arecreation 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3aFinland 0aQ26 0aQ23 0aQ51 0aPayments for ecosystem services 0aRecreation 0aWillingness to pay 0aWillingness to contribute labor 0aContingent valuation 0aLatent class regression1 aNeuvonen, Marjo1 aPouta, Eija1 aSievänen, Tuija0 tJournal of forest economics.g2014 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.141-160dElsevier GmbHaDepartment of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, UmeåwJournal:jnl3660850x1104-68997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfe.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002700190245007500217300001600292506007600308520152600384592002801910506003701938650001301975650001101988650001001999650001202009650001702021650001202038650001502050650001902065653002102084653001702105653002102122653001702143653001802160700002402178700002602202700002102228700006502249773009502314856008402409852000902493655001202502IND60581999220221207141241.0190401e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058199922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2017.07.0242doi7 aPMC55904872pmcid7 a287800642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOldham-Cooper, Rose E.10aPresenting a food in multiple smaller units increases expected satiety  ap. 106-112.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPresentation of the same amount of a food in multiple smaller units (‘segmentation’) has been shown to reduce food intake and increase estimates of the amount of food consumed. However, this effect has been demonstrated for ad libitum food intake only. In the majority of cases, meals are not consumed ad libitum, but are pre-selected and consumed in their entirety, Expected satiety (ES; the anticipated capacity of a portion of food to relieve hunger between meals) is an excellent predictor of portion size selection. This study tested the hypothesis that segmentation increases ES. It was also hypothesised that perceived volume (PV) may account for the relationship between segmentation and ES. Sixty-eight participants made computer-based ES and PV judgments for equicaloric portions of three test foods (salted peanuts, spaghetti Bolognese, and chicken tikka masala), which were presented in either a single unit or as multiple smaller units (three or six units). Results revealed a consistent effect of segmentation on ES - foods presented in multiple smaller units were expected to deliver significantly greater satiety than when presented in a single unit (p < 0.005). Furthermore, results indicated that the effect of segmentation on ES was attributable to an increase in PV. ES plays an important role in determining the portion sizes that people select. Therefore, awareness of the effect of segmentation on ES may help to inform the design of foods that confer benefits for healthy weight maintenance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achickens 3ahunger 3apasta 3apeanuts 3aportion size 3asatiety 3atest meals 3aweight control 0aExpected satiety 0aSegmentation 0aPerceived volume 0aPortion size 0aEnergy intake1 aWilkinson, Laura L.1 aHardman, Charlotte A.1 aRogers, Peter J.1 aBrunstrom, Jeffrey M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4657-77990 tAppetite.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 118 p.106-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007400171300001600245520101200261592002801273650001201301650001601313650002101329650001701350650001001367651001401377653000801391653000801399653000801407653001901415653002101434653001301455653001101468773020401479856008201683852000901765655001201774IND60543550820221120112443.0190411e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054355082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfe.2014.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilgore, Michael A.10aDo high property taxes influence family forest land Tenure decisions?  ap. 161-173.  aStudies have repeatedly documented high property taxes as being a major determinant of a landowner's decision to divest of its forest land. To empirically investigate the relationship between property tax burden and forest land sale activity, property tax data and over 5300 Minnesota forest land sale records from 2000 to 2008 were assembled. Analyses were carried out to identify statistically significant relationships between several measures of private forest land sale activity and forest land property tax burden. The analyses failed to find a statistically positive relationship between the two. Statistically significant negative associations were found between some measures of forest property tax burden and forest land sale frequency, indicating forest land sales activity actually decreased with increasing property tax burden. While high property taxes, no doubt, influence forest land sale decisions, the findings from this study suggest its influence may not be as pervasive as once thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3aland tenure 3aprivate forestry 3aproperty tax 3asales 3aMinnesota 0aQ23 0aQ24 0aH20 0aProperty taxes 0aForest land sale 0aTurnover 0aTenure0 tJournal of forest economics.g2014 Apr., v. 20, no. 2 p.161-173dElsevier GmbHaDepartment of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, UmeåwJournal:jnl3660850x1104-68997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfe.2014.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245011400199300001800313520141200331592002801743650002101771650002901792650001501821650003201836650002501868650002801893650001901921650001701940650002701957650001001984650001201994650001702006650001302023650001502036650001502051650001702066650002002083650001902103650001002122650001402132650001102146650002102157650001302178653002902191653002702220653002102247653002802268653002002296700001402316700001302330700001502343700001702358700001602375700003202391700001802423773014802441856008002589852000902669655001202678IND60604264120221122012033.0180716e20180422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060426412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Zhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8562-121710aTranscriptomic Analysis of Xylan Oligosaccharide Utilization Systems in Pediococcus acidilactici Strain BCC-1  ap. 4725-4733.  aXylan oligosaccharides (XOS) are the hydrolysates of xylan. To compare the proliferation effect of XOS, glucose, fructo oligosaccharides (FOS), xylose, XOS, and a media without carbohydrate source (control) on Pediococcus acidilactici strain BCC-1, the de novo sequencing of Pediococcus acidilactici strain BCC-1 was conducted, and the underlying mechanism of prebiotic xylo oligosaccharide between xylose and XOS was revealed through transcriptomic analysis. Compared to FOS, glucose, and xylose, XOS exhibits a good performance in promoting the fermentation of Pediococcus acidilactici BCC-1. The genome of Pediococcus acidilactici BCC-1 revealed genes encoding XOS transportation and utilized related enzymes, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, arabinofuranosidase, xylanase, xylosidase, xylose isomerase, and xylulose kinase. Transcriptome analysis showed that XOS treatment enhanced genes involving carbohydrate metabolism, an ABC transporter sugar system, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, pyruvate metabolism, and the TCA process when compared to xylose treatment. It suggested XOS treatment enhanced sugar absorption and utilization. These results are useful in the understanding of the metabolic pathway of XOS in Pediococcus acidilactici BBC-1 and may contribute to the optimization of the probiotic effect of Pediococcus acidilactici BCC-1 as novel complex feed additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aabsorption 3aalpha-N-arabinofuranosidase 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afeed additives 3afermentation 3afructooligosaccharides 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3apentoses 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3apyruvic acid 3atranscriptomics 3atransportation 3axylan 3axylanases 3axylose 3axylose isomerase 3axylulose 0aPediococcus acidilactici 0axylan oligosaccharides 0aprebiotic effect 0awhole genome properties 0atranscriptomics1 aWu, Yuqin1 aNie, Wei1 aYin, Dafei1 aYin, Xiaonan1 aGuo, Yuming1 aAggrey, S.

Until recently, Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) caused by Rickettsia conorii was considered the only tick-borne rickettsiosis in Europe. However, ‘new’ TBR have been described in Europe during last years. For instance, other subspecies such as R. conorii caspia and R. conorii israelensis have been involved in MSF. Dermacentor-borne necrosis erythema and lymphadenopathy/tick-borne lymphadenopathy (DEBONEL/TIBOLA) cases caused by Rickettsia slovaca, Rickettsia raoultii, and Rickettsia rioja been described in several countries where Dermacentor marginatus ticks (the mainly implicated vector) are present. Rickettsia helvetica has also been involved as a human pathogen in cases of fever with and without rash and in patients with meningitis and carditis. Other TBR such as lymphangitis-associated rickettsioses (LAR), caused by Rickettsia sibirica mongolitimonae, have been diagnosed in different European countries (France, Spain, Portugal and Greece). Rickettsia massiliae is considered an etiological agent of MSF-like illness in the Mediterranean basin. Furthermore, Rickettsia monacensis that is distributed all along Europe has been isolated from patients with MSF-like illness in Spain. Although Rickettsia aeschlimannii has been associated with MSF-like in Africa and is distributed in the Mediterranean area, no autochthonous human cases have been reported for Europe. Other Rickettsia species detected in ticks and unrelated to human disease (Candidatus Rickettsia kotlanii, Candidatus Rickettsia barbariae, Candidatus Rickettsia vini) could be potentially involved in the next years. Climate changes, among other factors, may contribute to the emergence of other rickettsioses or change their distribution. Lastly, African tick-bite fever (ATBF), caused by Rickettsia africae, is frequently diagnosed in Europe in patients returning from endemic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermacentor marginatus 3aRickettsia aeschlimannii 3aRickettsia africae 3aRickettsia conorii 3aRickettsia helvetica 3aRickettsia massiliae 3aRickettsia sibirica 3aRickettsia slovaca 3abacteria 3aclimate change 3aerythema 3afever 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3alymphatic diseases 3ameningitis 3amyocarditis 3anecrosis 3apathogens 3apatients 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aAfrica 3aFrance 3aGreece 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal 3aSpain1 aPortillo, Aránzazu0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2012 Dec., v. 3, no. 5-6 p.271-278dElsevier GmbHx1877-959X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245006000169300001800229520126500247592002801512650001801540650001901558650001401577650001001591650001301601650001501614650001401629650000901643650001301652650002201665650001101687650001301698650001501711650001501726650001301741650001301754650001801767653001301785653002101798653001301819653001801832700002801850700002201878700006201900773014801962856008002110852000902190655001202199IND60604264220221122012151.0180716e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060426422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b002112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVebrosky, Emily N.10aPhotodegradation of Dicloran in Freshwater and Seawater  ap. 2654-2659.  aDicloran appears to be a model pesticide for investigating photodegradation processes in surface waters. Photodegradation processes are particularly relevant to this compound as it is applied to crops grown in proximity to freshwater and marine ecosystems. The photodegradation of dicloran under simulated sunlight was measured in distilled water, artificial seawater, phosphate buffer, and filter-sterilized estuarine water to determine its half-life, degradation rate, and photodegradation products. The half-life was approximately 7.5 h in all media. There was no significant difference in the rate of degradation between distilled water and artificial seawater for dicloran. For the intermediate products, a higher concentration of 2-chloro-1,4-benzoquinone was measured in artificial seawater versus distilled water, while a slightly higher concentration of 1,4-benzoquinone was measured in distilled water versus artificial seawater. The detection of chloride and nitrate ions after 2 h of light exposure suggests photonucleophilic substitution contributes to the degradation process. Differences in product distributions between water types suggest that salinity impacts on chemical degradation may need to be addressed in chemical exposure assessments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoquinones 3abrackish water 3achlorides 3acrops 3adicloran 3afreshwater 3ahalf life 3aions 3alighting 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3anitrates 3aphosphates 3aphotolysis 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asurface water 0adicloran 0aphotodegradation 0asalinity 0asurface water1 aSaranjampour, Parichehr1 aCrosby, Donald G.1 aArmbrust, Kevin L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5894-36750 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Feb. 23, v. 66, no. 11 p.2654-2659dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b002113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002200192245008200214300001800296506007600314520141700390592002801807506003701835650002001872650001501892650002801907650001401935650001101949650001301960650002401973650001701997653003602014653002302050653003902073653001902112653002302131700001502154700002002169773014502189856008502334852000902419655001202428IND60615291620221207105952.0181009e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061529162DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2017.13408872doi7 aPMC63666502pmcid7 a307399652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, Thomas A.12aA Bayesian Machine Learning Approach for Optimizing Dynamic Treatment Regimes  ap. 1255-1267.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMedical therapy often consists of multiple stages, with a treatment chosen by the physician at each stage based on the patient’s history of treatments and clinical outcomes. These decisions can be formalized as a dynamic treatment regime. This article describes a new approach for optimizing dynamic treatment regimes, which bridges the gap between Bayesian inference and existing approaches, like Q-learning. The proposed approach fits a series of Bayesian regression models, one for each stage, in reverse sequential order. Each model uses as a response variable the remaining payoff assuming optimal actions are taken at subsequent stages, and as covariates the current history and relevant actions at that stage. The key difficulty is that the optimal decision rules at subsequent stages are unknown, and even if these decision rules were known the relevant response variables may be counterfactual. However, posterior distributions can be derived from the previously fitted regression models for the optimal decision rules and the counterfactual response variables under a particular set of rules. The proposed approach averages over these posterior distributions when fitting each regression model. An efficient sampling algorithm for estimation is presented, along with simulation studies that compare the proposed approach with Q-learning.

In this work, NiMoO₄ nanospheres and nanorods were synthesized by facile hydrothermal methods. The hierarchical NiMoO₄ nanospheres were about 2.5 μm in diameter and assembled from thin mesoporous nanosheets with a thickness of about 10–20 nm. The NiMoO₄ nanorods were about 80 nm in diameter and about 300 nm to 1 μm in length. Their electrochemical properties were investigated for use as electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). The NiMoO₄ nanospheres exhibited a higher specific capacitance and better cycling stability and rate capability, which were attributed to their large surface area and high electrical conductivity. The specific capacitances were 974.4, 920.8, 875.5, 859.1, and 821.4 F/g at current densities of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 A/g, respectively. Remarkably, the energy density was able to reach 20.1 Wh/kg at a power density of 2100 W/kg. After 2000 cycles, the NiMoO₄ nanospheres still displayed a high specific capacitance of about 631.8 F/g at a current density of 5 A/g. These results implied that the hierarchical NiMoO₄ nanospheres could be a promising candidate for use as high-performance SCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3ananorods 3ananosheets 3ananospheres 3aporous media 3asurface area 0anickel molybdate 0ahydrothermal method 0amesoporous 0aelectrode material 0asupercapacitors1 aWang, Dandan1 aLiu, Bin1 aWang, Yanrong1 aLiu, Yuan1 aWang, Lingling1 aLi, Han1 aHuang, Hui1 aLi, Qiuhong1 aWang, Taihong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Dec. 26, v. 5, no. 24 p.12905-12910dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam403444v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013500168300001600303520164600319592002801965650001501993650003202008650001602040650001102056650001702067650001402084650001502098650003302113650001702146651001402163651001002177653001702187653002102204653001602225653002502241700006102266773009502327856008402422852000902506655001202515IND60581999420221118130743.0190401e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058199942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2017.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, Wakako10aSpatial, temporal, and health associations of eating alone: A cross-cultural analysis of young adults in urban Australia and Japan  ap. 149-160.  aEating alone is driven by social and cultural factors, not solely by individual preferences. In academic research, eating alone is often simply treated as an alternative to social, commensal eating, and little is known about the practice of eating alone itself. This study employs a cross-cultural analysis to explore social and cultural associations of eating alone. The analysis is based on 1) cultural domain data, derived from principal component analysis of freelist responses, a set of words or phrases related to the topic of eating alone; and 2) in-depth interviews with 72 young adults aged 20–40 in urban Australia and Japan. Many Australian and Japanese young adult participants associated eating alone with both pleasure and stress of being isolated from others. However, the comparison of principal components between Australian and Japanese groups and gender subgroups showed cross-cultural variations and complexity in the context of eating alone including: locations and timings of eating alone, and associations with healthy/unhealthy eating. Analyses of interviews are included to deepen understandings of cultural domains. These key associations are influenced by a range of social and cultural environments such as fast food cultures, work and life environments, and the scope of public health nutrition programs. The association between eating alone and healthy eating among young adults indicates that individualistic understandings of food intake in current public health nutrition programs are more favorable to eating alone and foster a gap between ideas of healthy eating and commensal eating as a cultural ideal.  aPublisher supplied data 3afast foods 3afood and nutrition programs 3afood intake 3agender 3ahealthy diet 3aingestion 3ainterviews 3aprincipal component analysis 3ayoung adults 3aAustralia 3aJapan 0aEating alone 0aCultural domains 0aFreelisting 0aCross-cultural study1 aMelby, Melissa K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1766-54660 tAppetite.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 118 p.149-160dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01444naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010300169300001600272520037300288592002800661650001500689650002000704650001600724650001900740651001000759653001500769653001700784653002100801653001300822653001600835700001800851700001700869773010300886856008400989852000901073655001201082IND60123065720221120050640.0150325e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012306572DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2012.7381402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Zhe-Min10aMegaulacobothrus Caudell from China (Orthoptera: Arcypteridae) with description of two new species  ap. 229-242.  aTwenty-nine species of the orthopteran genus Megaulacobothrus Caudell (1921) have been reviewed, including two new species, namely, Megaulacobothrus ewenkensis sp. nov. and Megaulacobothrus barbipes sp. nov.

R.10aAdsorption at the Air–Water Interface in Biosurfactant–Surfactant Mixtures: Quantitative Analysis of Adsorption in a Five-Component Mixture  ap. 13027-13039.  aThe composition of the air–water adsorbed layer of a quinary mixture consisting of three conventional surfactants, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C₁₂E₈), dodecane-6-p-sodium benzene sulfonate (LAS6), and diethylene glycol monododecyl ether sodium sulfate (SLE₂S), mixed with two biosurfactants, the rhamnolipids l-rhamnosyl-l-rhamnosyl-β-hydroxydecanoyl-β-hydroxydecanoyl, R2, and l-rhamnosyl-β-hydroxydecanoyl-β-hydroxydecanoyl, R1, has been measured over a range of compositions above the mixed critical micelle concentration. Additional measurements on some of the subsets of ternary and binary mixtures have also been measured by NR. The results have been analyzed using the pseudophase approximation (PPA) in conjunction with an excess free energy, GE, that depends on the quadratic and cubic terms in the composition. The compositions of the binary, ternary, and quinary mixtures could all be fitted to two sets of interaction parameters between the pairs of surfactants, one for micelles and one for adsorption. No ternary interactions or ternary corrections were required. Because the system contains two strongly anionic surfactants, the PPA can be extended, in practice, to ionic surfactants, contrary to the prevailing view. The values of the interaction parameters show that the quinary mixture, SLE₂S–LAS6–C₁₂E₈–R1–R2, which is known to be a highly effective surfactant system, is characterized by a sequence of strong surface but weak micellar interactions. About half of the minima in GE for the strong surface interactions occur well away from the regular solution value of 0.5.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aanionic surfactants 3abenzene 3abiosurfactants 3adiethylene glycol 3amicelles 3aquantitative analysis 3arhamnolipids 3asodium sulfate 3asurface interactions1 aThomas, Robert K.1 aPenfold, Jeffrey1 aTucker, Ian M.1 aPetkov, Jordan T.1 aStevenson, Paul S.1 aBanat, Ibrahim M.1 aMarchant, Roger1 aRudden, M.1 aWebster, John R.

Successful disease management largely depends on timely and accurate detection of plant pathogens causing epidemics. Thus, biosurveillance of epidemic plant pathogens such as Pseudoperonospora cubensis , the causal agent of cucurbit downy mildew, is becoming a priority to prevent disease outbreaks and deploy successful control efforts. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) facilitates rapid development of genomics resources needed to generate molecular diagnostics assays for P. cubensis . Having information regarding the presence or absence of the pathogen, amount of inoculum, crop risk, time to initiate fungicide applications, and effective fungicides to apply would significantly contribute to reducing losses to cucurbit downy mildew. In this article, we discuss approaches to identify unique loci for rapid molecular diagnostics using genomic data, to develop molecular diagnostic tools that discriminate economically important pathogen alleles (i.e. mating type and fungicide resistance), and how to use molecular diagnostics with current and future spore trap strategies for biosurveillance purposes of important downy mildew pathogens. The combined use of these technologies within the already existent disease management framework has the potential to improve disease control.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100007917  cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009168  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aCucurbitaceae 3aPseudoperonospora cubensis 3aalleles 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease control 3adisease outbreaks 3adowny mildew 3afood security 3afungicide resistance 3afungicides 3agenomics 3aglobalization 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainoculum 3aloci 3apesticide application 3aplant pathogens 3arisk 3aspore traps 0abiosurveillance 0adiagnostics 0adowny mildew 0agenomics 0anext generation sequencing 0aoomycetes1 aMiles, Timothy D.1 aMartin, Frank N.1 aQuesada-Ocampo, Lina M.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2017 July 3, v. 39, no. 3 p.282-296dTaylor & Francisx1715-29927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2017.13576613Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010400166300001400270520170200284592002801986650001602014650001102030650001102041650001602052650002002068650000902088650001102097651002102108700001702129700001602146773008802162856008202250990002302332852000902355655001202364IND60094506120221117231651.0141104e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009450612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsina, Otmar13aAn estimate of the climatology and variability of Eighteen Degree Water potential vorticity forcing  ap. 84-95.  aThe input of potential vorticity (PV) over the oceans is estimated from observations to produce climatological maps and study interannual forcing variability. The estimate is obtained using a potential vorticity like variable employing potential temperature in place of potential density, and thus we refer to it as pseudo-potential vorticity (PPV). This choice allows us to examine the effects of storms and high frequency events as sources of PPV. We postulate the characteristics of the PPV fluxes reflect the properties of PV flux. Particular attention is paid to the North Atlantic subtropical mode water potential temperature range from 17 to 19°C. The sea surface PPV flux is estimated through buoyancy and wind stress contributions and using a climatological mixed layer depth product. Wind forcing of PPV is strong in frontal regions and in the Antarctic Circumpolar current. When averaged following outcrops, however, buoyant forcing emerges as dominant. A major observational subtropical mode water program named CLIMODE was conducted during the winters from 2004/5 to 2006/7. Summer months during these years are very much in agreement with climatology; the winter months are slightly more variable. Attempts are made to relate PPV forcing variability to the NAO, a major mode of North Atlantic atmospheric variability. Correlation between the flux and the NAO is significant, and increases in amplitude if analysis is restricted to the winter time frame. There is also a weaker correlation between the NAO and the net EDW flux the following year. Considerable variability of the flux is unaccounted for, however, and we speculate that this is a signal of intrinsic ocean variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatology 3aoceans 3astorms 3atemperature 3awater potential 3awind 3awinter 3aAntarctic region1 aWienders, N.1 aDewar, W.K.0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 July, v. 91 p.84-95dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.02.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010100167300001600268520116000284592002801444650001601472650001001488650002001498650001401518650001201532650002801544650001001572653002901582653001901611653001801630653000901648700001601657773010301673856008401776852000901860655001201869IND60123065920221120050549.0150325e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012306592DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2012.7381422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe-Qing, Zhu10aAutomatic insect classification based on local mean colour feature and Supported Vector Machines  ap. 260-269.  aA method to automatically identify and classify insects based on local mean colour feature and Supported Vector Machines (SVMs) is proposed in this article. The captured insect images are first segmented to separate the foreground from the complicated background. Then two wings are cut out from the insect and their positions are calibrated. The features are then extracted from the right and left wing of each specimen. The wing image is split into three channels, namely red, green and blue. In each channel, the wing region is divided into 40 blocks, and the mean value and standard deviation of these are computed as feature data of each block. Finally, a 480-dimensional feature vector from three channels of two wings is obtained. SVMs are trained using the vectors from training dataset and thus used for classification. A collection consisting of 579 images of lepidopteran specimens, each belonging to one of the 10 species, was then analysed to determine the efficiency of the method. It was observed that the recognition rate is over 90% on average, and ideal time performance is also achieved, thus testifying to the efficiency of the method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3acolor 3adata collection 3aequipment 3ainsects 3asupport vector machines 3awings 0aautomated identification 0aclassification 0aimage process 0aSVMs1 aZhen, Zhang0 tOriental insects.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 46, no. 3-4 p.260-269dTaylor & Francis Groupx2157-87457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00305316.2012.7381423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011200164300001600276520066400292592002800956650002500984650001501009650001701024651001001041653001501051653003101066653002901097653002101126653001401147653002301161700002901184700002201213700001601235700001901251773020401270856008201474852000901556655001201565IND60543551120221120112444.0190411e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054355112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfe.2014.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarela, Elsa10aTesting the single opt-out reminder in choice experiments: An application to fuel break management in Spain  ap. 212-222.  aCheap talk (CT) scripts have been broadly tested in contingent valuation studies to mitigate the effects of hypothetical bias.

Results show that the inclusion of a SOOR does not contribute sufficiently to improve the CT effect on the DCE data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontingent valuation 3afire break 3aforest fires 3aSpain 0aCheap talk 0aDiscrete choice experiment 0aRandom parameters models 0aScale parameters 0aWildfires 0aWillingness to pay1 aMahieu, Pierre-Alexandre1 aGiergiczny, Marek1 aRiera, Pere1 aSoliño, Mario0 tJournal of forest economics.g2014 Aug., v. 20, no. 3 p.212-222dElsevier GmbHaDepartment of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, UmeåwJournal:jnl3660850x1104-68997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfe.2014.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010200166300001600268500000900284520212700293592002802420650001702448650001202465650001202477650000902489650001502498650001002513650002002523650001902543650001402562650001502576650003102591650002102622650001902643650001302662650002502675650000902700650002402709650002002733650000902753650001902762651000902781700001602790700001702806700001702823773013702840856008202977852000903059655001203068IND60668769220221119175726.0191228e200001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066876922DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2000.641235x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBronson, K. F.10aUse of 15N-Labeled Soil in Measuring Nitrogen Fertilizer Recovery Efficiency in Transplanted Rice  ap. 235-239.  aepub  aIn transplanted flooded rice (Oryza sativa L.) culture in Asia, N fertilizer recovery efficiency (RE) estimates are usually greater with the difference method than with the ¹⁵N method. These reported differences are greater and more common for transplanted irrigated rice than for upland crops and might be associated with basal N applications when plant demand is low. Added N interactions (ANI), or greater soil N accumulation in fertilized plants than in unfertilized plants, are often cited as the reason for these differences. The causes of ANI can be stimulation of mineralization of soil organic matter by fertilizer or greater root exploration in fertilized plants. The objectives of this pot study were (i) to compare the ¹⁵N dilution method using enriched ¹⁵N-urea (5.0 atom %), and ¹⁴N-urea (0.366 atom %) plus ¹⁵N-labeled (0.447 atom %, Maahas clay [isohyperthermic Andaqueptic Haplaquoll]) soil, with the difference method of measuring RE of N, as affected by timing of application, and (ii) to use ¹⁵N-labeled (0.447 atom %) soil to directly measure ANI as ¹⁵N accumulation in ¹⁴N fertilized pots minus ¹⁵N accumulation in unfertilized pots. Recovery efficiency measures at physiological maturity were higher with the difference method (54%) than with the two isotope dilution methods (44%), which were in turn similar. The real ANI measured was negligible, as the root biomass in this clay soil was not greatly affected by fertilization. Therefore, the ANI was apparent and due to isotope substitution. The RE estimate by difference (54.4%) was therefore more accurate than the RE measure by ¹⁵N methods (44.4%). The 33.2% of added ¹⁵N not accounted for in the plant–soil system was a measure of N fertilizer losses (NH₃ volatilization from floodwater, denitrification, NH₃ loss through the plant during grain fill) that were not affected by isotope substitution. Recovery efficiency estimated with ¹⁵N-enriched soil plus ordinary urea was identical to the RE estimate using enriched ¹⁵N-urea, although both were underestimations because of isotope substitution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aammonia 3abiomass 3aclay 3aclay soils 3acrops 3adenitrification 3afilling period 3ahighlands 3airrigation 3aisotope dilution technique 3aisotope labeling 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arice 3asoil organic matter 3astable isotopes 3aurea 3avolatilization 3aAsia1 aHussain, F.1 aPasuquin, E.1 aLadha, J.

Both moorings were deployed south of the Gulf Stream in the EDW outcrop region, the northwestern part of the subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic. The two moorings captured the seasonal evolution of EDW characterized by gradual mixed layer deepening and wintertime outcrop, rapid restratification from May to June and slower dissipation during the rest of the year. Superimposed on this seasonal cycle, the moored records are characterized by high frequency passing of eddies with a characteristic time scale of ∼10 days, i.e. it took about 10 days for eddies to pass the mooring sites. The net impact of these eddy fluxes is evaluated by analyzing one-dimensional heat and salt budgets of the upper ocean at the moorings and comparing them to the local air–sea fluxes. It is shown that oceanic lateral fluxes converge heat and salt into the formation region during winter thus offsetting the heat loss to the atmosphere and influencing the formation of EDW. A comparison with results from a one-dimensional model shows that without the lateral fluxes EDW would outcrop earlier and it would be colder and fresher. The warm, salty waters transported into the region originate from the Gulf Stream and this suggests that frontal processes likely play a fundamental role in EDW formation and its evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGulf Stream 3aeddy covariance 3aheat 3aseasonal variation 3awinter 3aSargasso Sea1 aStraneo, Fiammetta1 aKwon, Young-Oh1 aKelly, Kathryn A.1 aToole, John M.0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 July, v. 91 p.11-24dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.02.0243Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010300168300001600271520169200287592002801979650001502007650001502022650001102037650001202048650001202060650001502072650001902087650001902106650002502125650001902150650001702169650001302186650001902199650000902218650002602227650001002253651001502263700001802278700001702296700002002313700002202333773011702355856008102472852000902553655001202562IND60520157920221119091944.0160514e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052015792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-015-9770-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYager, Janice W.10aArsenic and ultraviolet radiation exposure: melanoma in a New Mexico non-Hispanic white population  ap. 897-910.  aCases of cutaneous melanoma and controls were enrolled in a New Mexico population-based study; subjects were administered questionnaires concerning ultraviolet (UV) and inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure. Historical iAs exposure was estimated. UV exposure estimates were also derived using geospatial methods. Drinking water samples were collected for iAs analysis. Blood samples were collected for DNA repair (Comet) and DNA repair gene polymorphism assays. Arsenic concentrations were determined in urine and toenail samples. UV exposures during the previous 90 days did not vary significantly between cases and controls. Mean (±SD) current home iAs drinking water was not significantly different for cases and controls [3.98 μg/L (±3.67) vs. 3.47 μg/L (±2.40)]. iAs exposure showed no effect on DNA repair or association with melanoma. Results did not corroborate a previously reported association between toenail As and melanoma risk. Arsenic biomarkers in urine and toenail were highly significantly correlated with iAs in drinking water. A UV–DNA repair interaction for UV exposure over the previous 7–90 days was shown; cases had higher DNA damage than controls at low UV values. This novel finding suggests that melanoma cases may be more sensitive to low-level UV exposure than are controls. A UV–APEX1 interaction was shown. Subjects with the homozygous rare APEX1 DNA repair gene allele had a higher risk of early melanoma diagnosis at low UV exposure compared with those with the homozygous wild type or the heterozygote. Notably, a UV–arsenic interaction on inhibition of DNA repair was not observed at iAs drinking water concentrations below 10 ppb (μg/L).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aWhites 3aalleles 3aarsenic 3abiomarkers 3ablood sampling 3adrinking water 3agenetic polymorphism 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amelanoma 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3aultraviolet radiation 3aurine 3aNew Mexico1 aErdei, Esther1 aMyers, Orrin1 aSiegel, Malcolm1 aBerwick, Marianne0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2016 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.897-910dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-015-9770-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010700169300001600276520086300292592002801155650000801183650002401191650002901215650001101244650001001255650001001265650002801275650004301303650002401346650001001370651001201380700001801392700002301410700002601433700002001459700002101479700001901500700001601519773010301535856008401638852000901722655001201731IND60087123120221121032039.0141102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008712312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjerbouh, Amel14aThe first molecular detection of Rickettsia aeschlimannii in the ticks of camels from southern Algeria  ap. 374-376.  aWe collected ticks from camels in 4 regions of southern Algeria (El Oued, Bechar, Ghardia, and Adrar) from February to October in 2008 and in April of 2011. A total of 307 ticks representing multiple species (including Hyalomma dromedarii, H. marginatum rufipes, H. impeltatum, and H. impressum), was tested for the presence of spotted fever group rickettsia DNA using gltA real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The presence of Rickettsia aeschlimannii was confirmed with a new qPCR using species-specific primers and Taqman probes based on the sca2 genes. The R. aeschlimannii sequence was further confirmed by detecting the gltA and outer membrane protein (ompA) genes in H. m. rufipes, H. impeltatum, and H. dromedarii ticks.

The economic factor of timber production is considered and also aspects related to environmental protection. We also incorporate adjacency constraints to limit the maximum contiguous area where clear-cutting can be applied. The model proposed is applied to a timber production plantation in Cuba located in the region of Pinar del Río. One factor to be taken into account in Cuban plantations is that the forest has a highly unbalanced age distribution. Therefore, in addition to the classical objectives of forest planning, we have the objective of rebalancing age distribution by the end of the planning horizon. Explicitly, the four objectives considered in the model are: (a) obtaining a balance-aged forest; (b) minimizing the area with trees older than the rotation age; (c) maximizing the NPV of the forest over the planning horizon; and (d) maximizing total carbon sequestration over the whole planning horizon. The solution to the proposed model provides a set of efficient management plans that are of assistance in analysing the tradeoffs between the economic and ecological objectives. The model is also applied to randomly generated simulated forests to compare its performance in other contexts. As the problem is a multiobjective binary nonlinear model, a metaheuristic procedure is used in order to solve it.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3aclearcutting 3aeconomic factors 3aenvironmental protection 3aforests 3anonlinear models 3aplanning 3aplantations 3atimber production 3atrees 3aCuba 0aC02.

The ability of EDW to store and discharge large quantities of heat over periods of several years contributes to the memory of the climate system. To complement the 2-year field and modeling program of the CLIvar MOde Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE) with a perspective of interannual-to-decadal variability (1985–2007), we used a simple box model to hindcast observed EDW volume anomalies in two regions: one in which EDW is formed and an adjacent region of subducted EDW. Estimates of the relative contributions of heat flux anomalies, vertical mixing from Ekman advection, mixing, and circulation are examined using proxy variables derived from winds, sea surface temperature, hydrographic data and altimetric sea level. The importance of each process is evaluated by its contribution to observed EDW volume anomalies in two regions. The study produced some robust conclusions: (1) anomalies of formation by surface heat fluxes are clearly reflected in EDW volume anomalies with some contributions by Ekman advection; (2) of the newly formed EDW about 65% is lost by mixing and about 35% is transferred to the subducted region; (3) mixing losses are well parameterized by the meandering of the nearby GS and (4) transfer and losses from the subducted region can be parameterized by the geostrophic surface flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGulf Stream 3aclimate 3aheat transfer 3amixing 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3asea level 3asurface water temperature 3awind 3awinter 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aDong, Shenfu0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 July, v. 91 p.111-127dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.02.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010900174300002000283520153700303592002801840650001301868650001801881650001901899650001101918650002301929650001801952650001401970650001101984650001901995700001302014700002602027773010102053856008602154852000902240655001202249IND60585990120221119014020.0171114e20171114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058599012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b035822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVishnyakov, Aleksey10aAdhesion of Phospholipid Bilayers to Hydroxylated Silica: Existence of Nanometer-Thick Water Interlayers  ap. 13148-13156.  aLipid bilayers attached to solid surfaces play an important role in bioinspired materials and devices and serve as model systems for studies of interactions of cell membranes with particles and biomolecules.

In this work, we explore, using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, the equilibrium and stability of a phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membrane supported on hydroxylated amorphous silica. We reveal two distinct types of thermodynamically stable states, characterized by different widths of the water layer between the membrane and the substrate. In α-states, the membrane is closely attached with the lipid head groups interacting directly with surface hydroxyls; however, because of the molecular level roughness of the amorphous silica surface, there exists an inhomogeneous water layer trapped between the substrate and the membrane. In β-states, the membrane is separated from the silica surface by a water film of ∼2.5 nm in thickness. The thermodynamic equilibrium is quantified in terms of the disjoining pressure isotherm as a function of membrane–substrate separation, which has a double sigmoidal shape with two minima and one maximum, which correspond to the limits of stability of α- and β-states. The thermodynamic properties and bilayer structure are compared with experimental findings and simulation results for relevant systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3ahydroxylation 3alipid bilayers 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aphospholipids 3aroughness 3asilica 3athermodynamics1 aLi, Ting1 aNeimark, Alexander V.0 tLangmuir.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 33, no. 45 p.13148-13156dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b035823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009800167300001800265520115300283592002801436650002301464650001401487650001601501650001901517650001001536650001601546650002301562650002101585650001701606650001601623653002901639653002001668653002401688653001301712653001801725700001601743700001801759700001701777700001801794700001501812700001701827700001301844700001801857773011001875856008501985852000902070655001202079IND60580261220221119150308.0170914e20170902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058026122DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2017.13314702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Huimei10aMigration kinetics of four photo-initiators from paper food packaging to solid food simulants  ap. 1632-1642.  aThe migration behaviour of four photo-initiators (BP, EHA, MBP and Irgacure 907) was studied by ‘printing’ onto four different food-packaging materials (Kraft paper, white cardboard, Polyethylene (PE)-coated paper and composite paper) and tracking movement into the food simulant: Tenax-TA (porous polymer 2,6-diphenyl furan resin). The results indicated that the migration of the photo-initiators was related to the molecular weight and log K ₒ/w of each photo-initiator. At different temperatures, the migration rates of the photo-initiators were different in papers with different thicknesses. The amount of each photo-initiator found in the food was closely related to the food matrix. The Weibull model was used to predict the migration load into the food simulants by calculating the parameters τ and β and determining the relationship of the two parameters with temperature and paper thickness. The established Weibull model was then used to predict the migration of each photo-initiator with respect to different foods. A two-parameter Weibull model fitted the actual situation, with some deviation from the actual migration amount.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWeibull statistics 3acardboard 3afood matrix 3afood packaging 3afoods 3akraft paper 3amigratory behavior 3amolecular weight 3apolyethylene 3atemperature 0aPaper packaging material 0aphoto-initiator 0amigration behaviour 0aLC-MS/MS 0aWeibull model1 aJi, Shuilin1 aZhang, Juzhou1 aTao, Gushuai1 aPeng, Chuanyi1 aHou, Ruyan1 aZhang, Liang1 aSun, Yue1 aWan, Xiaochun0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2017 Sept. 2, v. 34, no. 9 p.1632-1642dTaylor & Francisx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2017.13314703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245015300168300001600321520141700337592002801754650002801782650002301810650002101833650001301854650001901867650001001886650002201896650001901918650001201937650003101949650001401980650001301994650001802007650001202025651001202037653004702049653001802096653003802114653003502152653001402187700003002201700002002231700006002251700006302311700002602374700002202400773012502422856008302547852000902630655001202639IND60636199120221121030434.0190405e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063619912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2018.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefan, Andrei10aGenetic diversity and structure of Rhizobium leguminosarum populations associated with clover plants are influenced by local environmental variables  ap. 251-259.  aThe identification and conservation of indigenous rhizobia associated with legume plants and their application as biofertilizers is becoming an agricultural worldwide priority. However, little is known about the genetic diversity and phylogeny of rhizobia in Romania. In the present study, the genetic diversity and population composition of Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii isolates from 12 clover plants populations located across two regions in Romania were analyzed. Red clover isolates were phenotypically evaluated and genotyped by sequencing 16S rRNA gene, 16S-23S intergenic spacer, three chromosomal genes (atpD, glnII and recA) and two plasmid genes (nifH and nodA). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that red clover plants are nodulated by a wide genetic diversity of R. leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii sequence types (STs), highly similar to the ones previously found in white clover. Rhizobial genetic variation was found mainly within the two clover populations for both chromosomal and plasmid types. Many STs appear to be unique for this region and the genetic composition of rhizobia differs significantly among the clover populations. Furthermore, our results showed that both soil pH and altitude contributed to plasmid sequence type composition while differences in chromosomal composition were affected by the altitude and were strongly correlated with distance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3aaltitude 3abiofertilizers 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aintergenic DNA 3alegumes 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aphylogeny 3aplasmids 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil pH 3aRomania 0aRhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii 0aTrifolium sp. 0aMultilocus sequence typing (MLST) 0aPopulation genetic composition 0aDiversity1 aVan Cauwenberghe, Jannick1 aRosu, Craita M.1 aStedel, Catalina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4384-88671 aLabrou, Nikolaos E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1925-98671 aFlemetakis, Emmanouil1 aEfrose, Rodica C.0 tSystematic and applied microbiology.g2018 May, v. 41, no. 3 p.251-259dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl34624x0723-20207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.syapm.2018.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03861naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245011400193300001600307520169100323592002802014650002402042650003102066650002002097650001402117650001302131650001102144650001202155650001002167650001002177650000902187650001702196650003202213650001102245650001602256650000902272650001402281650001402295650001702309650001102326650001202337650001702349650001902366650000802385650003202393650002602425650001202451650002102463650001802484650001202502650000902514650001702523650003202540650002802572650000902600650002602609650005602635650007102691700002702762700001802789700002002807700002802827700001802855700001702873700001902890773010402909856008103013852000903094655001203103IND50072520620221121203957.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007252062DNAL7 a236532852pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-013-0531-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunawardena, Dhanushka10aDetermination of anti-inflammatory activities of standardised preparations of plant- and mushroom-based foods  ap. 335-343.  aPURPOSE: Chronic inflammatory processes contribute to the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases. In search of anti-inflammatory foods, we have systematically screened a variety of common dietary plants and mushrooms for their anti-inflammatory activity. METHODS: A selection of 115 samples was prepared by a generic food-compatible processing method involving heating. These products were tested for their anti-inflammatory activity in murine N11 microglia and RAW 264.7 macrophages, using nitric oxide (NO) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as pro-inflammatory readouts. RESULTS: Ten food samples including lime zest, English breakfast tea, honey-brown mushroom, button mushroom, oyster mushroom, cinnamon and cloves inhibited NO production in N11 microglia, with IC₅₀values below 0.5 mg/ml. The most active samples were onion, oregano and red sweet potato, exhibiting IC₅₀values below 0.1 mg/ml. When these ten food preparations were retested in RAW 264.7 macrophages, they all inhibited NO production similar to the results obtained in N11 microglia. In addition, English breakfast tea leaves, oyster mushroom, onion, cinnamon and button mushroom preparations suppressed TNF-α production, exhibiting IC₅₀values below 0.5 mg/ml in RAW 264.7 macrophages. CONCLUSION: In summary, anti-inflammatory activity in these food samples survived ‘cooking’. Provided that individual bioavailability allows active compounds to reach therapeutic levels in target tissues, these foods may be useful in limiting inflammation in a variety of age-related inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, these foods could be a source for the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abioavailability 3abreakfast 3acinnamon 3acloves 3acooking 3adrugs 3afoods 3aheat 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaves 3amacrophages 3amice 3amushrooms 3aneuroglia 3anitric oxide 3aonions 3aoregano 3apathogenesis 3asweet potatoes 3atea 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAgaricalesxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survival 2aCooking 2aFood 2aInflammation 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aMacrophagesxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMicrogliaxmetabolism 2aNitric Oxidexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism.1 aShanmugam, Kirubakaran1 aLow, Mitchell1 aBennett, Louise1 aGovindaraghavan, Suresh1 aHead, Richard1 aOoi, Lezanne1 aMünch, Gerald0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2014 Feb., v. 53, no. 1 p.335-343dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-013-0531-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007100148245009200219300001700311520186600328592002802194650002302222650005202245650001202297650002802309650002202337650002102359650001802380650001602398650001802414650001702432650001202449650001502461650001202476650001502488700004202503700004202545700006902587700003602656700004102692700002902733700002802762700002502790773012002815856008302935852000903018655001203027IND60750620720221118011926.0211219e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075062072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2021.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira Rodrigues, Jessica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0113-489810aEffect of the COVID-19 pandemic on food habits and perceptions: A study with Brazilians  ap. 992-1001.  aFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) at the beginning of 2020, containment measures have been taken by different countries around the globe. Citizens were forced to stay in quarantine, affecting their food consumption habits and food sector. These impacts have not yet been properly understood. Thus, it is important to describe the consequences of COVID-19 on food consumption habits globally, especially in the context of developing countries, such as Brazil.In this study, the Brazilian's food consumption habits and perceptions during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed, highlighting the food consumption changes and selection of food products. Consumer perceptions about issues related to food safety and food marketing were also assessed. An online survey was performed and data were analyzed by descriptive analysis; independence and per cell chi-square test; and factor analysis.Brazilians perceptions indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic context (assessed in May 2020) changed their food consumption and purchase. Respondents stated that they are eating and buying a greater amount of food, indicating a perception of a less healthy diet, mainly by women. On other hand, they are prioritizing homemade preparations and fresh food. Moreover, they reduced their shopping trips to markets and are starting to use delivery services and shopping platforms. Basic products of animal, vegetable, and bakery origin are being preferred during this period, in addition to economical packaging and products. Brazilians also indicated that they are more concerned with food safety and hygienic practices. However, at a time when global health is threatened, government agencies must create measures that ensure the food supply and consumer's awareness, in order to guarantee the country's food security during the current crisis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aanimals 3achi-square distribution 3afood availability 3afood consumption 3afood industry 3afood safety 3afood security 3ahealthy diet 3ahygiene 3aquarantine 3asurveys 3avegetables1 aCunha dos Santos Filho, Marcus Túlio1 aAparecida de Oliveira, Lorena Eduarda1 aBrandemburg Siman, Ingrid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9759-69921 aBarcelos, Alessandra de Fátima1 ade Paiva Anciens Ramos, Gustavo Luis1 aEsmerino, Erick Almeida,1 aCruz, Adriano Gomes da,1 aArriel, Rhaí André0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Oct., v. 116 p.992-1001dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245007200167300001600239520132100255592002801576650001901604650002401623650001601647650002401663650002201687650001401709650002001723650000901743650002101752650002201773650002401795650001101819653003801830653001301868653002401881700001801905700001401923700005701937773011201994856008702106852000902193655001202202IND60570293020221120055800.0180912e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057029302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Rong10aDynamic performance analysis of a cascaded thermoelectric generator  ap. 808-815.  aDue to its advantages of small size, wide adaptability and high reliability, thermoelectric power generation (TEG) technology is attracting more and more attention in the application prospects of distributed energy, waste heat recovering and clean electricity supply. However, the promotion of the TEG is hindered by its low energy conversion efficiency which has become the most urgent problem in the TEG system. In order to achieve higher efficiency, a novel cascaded thermoelectric generator system (CTEG) with three-stage thermoelectric generators and its dynamic models based on the energy conservation equation, unsteady heat conduction theory and fluid dynamics were proposed and built. Through experimental data and numerical results, the system dynamic performance and the key parameters which affect the characteristics of the TEG system were analyzed. The results show that the efficiency of the new cascaded TEG system is greatly improved by 21.56% compared with the system with single-stage TEG. Furthermore, this study puts forward guidance for system improvement, and it is encouraging that a more appropriate system configuration could be an important means to further increase the system efficiency. Moreover, this dynamic simulation model can be used in the system design and operating improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3aelectric generators 3aelectricity 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy conversion 3aequations 3afluid mechanics 3aheat 3apower generation 3asimulation models 3asystems engineering 3awastes 0aCascaded thermoelectric generator 0aModeling 0aDynamic performance1 aGou, Xiaolong1 aXu, Haoyu1 aQiu, Kuanrong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9559-31810 tApplied energy.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 203 p.808-815dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03419naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245012900209520183800338592002802176650001502204650001002219650001202229650001502241650002202256650001702278650000902295650001602304650001502320650001102335650001402346650001802360650002102378653002302399653001902422653002602441653002402467653004402491700001602535700005802551700001602609700001902625700001702644700001902661700001702680773011902697856008802816852000902904655001202913IND60683490320221120194456.0200907e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068349032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1369642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Chaonan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5995-119110aGeochemistry of phosphorus release along transect of sediments from a tributary backwater zone in the Three Gorges Reservoir  aAs an important phosphorus (P) source in water, sediment P release can influence water quality in the tributary backwater zone of “river-type” reservoir. Chemical sequential extraction and diffusive gradients in thin films technique (DGT) were applied to study sediment P mobility in the Daning River backwater zone (DNB) in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). Influenced by the TGR backwater intrusion, both of water P forms and sediment P forms in the DNB zone exhibited increased spatial distributions from upper reach to lower reach. Sediment particles in the upper, middle, lower reaches were mainly derived from the settled particles (with high Ca contents) carried by the Daning River outflow, the former and sedimentary dead algal, the settled particles carried by the TGR backwater, respectively. According to P adsorption/desorption experiment results and concentration gradients of DGT-labile P at the sediment-overlying interface (SWI), sediments in the DNB zone acted as P source for overlying water during the sampling period. In the lower reach of the DNB zone and the adjacent TGR mainstream, iron oxides reduction in the anoxic or anaerobic sediments drove the synchronous release of labile P and Fe(II). Whereas, algal decomposition directly produced labile P and S(-II) in the top 0 to −10 mm sediment layer in the middle reach, and then the downward increases of labile P and Fe(II) in the depth of −30 to −80 mm were caused by iron oxides reduction. In the upper reach, the released labile P in sediments might be re-trapped by precipitating with Ca(II) or being adsorbed onto the newly formed iron oxides near the SWI. Sediment P release in DNB zone had a limited influence on water quality, but the influence would be significant in the future time after the external P source is reduced efficiently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalgae 3acalcium 3adesorption 3afilms (materials) 3ageochemistry 3airon 3airon oxides 3aphosphorus 3arivers 3asediments 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 0aPhosphorus release 0aSediment cores 0aIron oxides reduction 0aAlgal decomposition 0aDiffusive gradients in thin films (DGT)1 aQin, Yanwen1 aZheng, Binghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3169-15211 aMa, Yingqun1 aYang, Chenchen1 aLiu, Zhichao1 aZhuang, Daokuo1 aZhao, Yanmin0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 20, v. 722 p.136964-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1369643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011400162300001800276520157100294592002801865650001101893650001501904650002601919650001401945650001301959650002601972650002701998650001602025650001302041650001502054650001902069650000902088650001302097650002502110650002902135651001002164700002002174700001802194700001302212773011502225856008202340852000902422655001202431IND60592523720221122142337.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059252372DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-017-1065-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Xueqi10aSimultaneous Determination of Pyraclostrobin, Prochloraz, and its Metabolite in Apple and Soil Via RRLC-MS/MS  ap. 1312-1320.  aA sensitive and high-efficiency method for simultaneous detection of pyraclostrobin, prochloraz, and its metabolite in apple and soil based on QuEChERS pretreatment combined with rapid resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was established and validated. The limits of quantification of three compounds in two matrixes were 0.005 mg kg⁻¹. The average recoveries of pyraclostrobin, prochloraz, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in soil matrix were in the ranges of 87–105%, 86–95%, and 90–96%, respectively, with all the relative standard deviations (RSDs) of < 9.6%, while recoveries were 89–93%, 83–97%, and 89–101% in apple with the RSDs of < 6.5% at three spiking levels. For verify the applicability of this method, the real samples from three representative locations were detected. The degradation behaviors and residue distributions of pyraclostrobin and prochloraz and its metabolite in apple ecosystem were investigated. The field experiment data showed that the dissipation of pyraclostrobin and prochloraz in apple and soil followed pseudo-first-order kinetic models. The half-lives of pyraclostrobin in soil and apple were 8.6–19.8 and 7.9–15.1 days, while prochloraz were 8.9–21 and 5.8–12.4 days. The highest terminal residue of total prochloraz and pyraclostrobin in apple, after spraying three to four times with the interval of 28 days, was far below the maximum residue limits recommended by China. This research could provide guidance on a reasonable usage of prochloraz and pyraclostrobin in apple orchard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3ahalf life 3akinetics 3aliquid chromatography 3amaximum residue limits 3ametabolites 3aorchards 3aprochloraz 3apyraclostrobin 3asoil 3aspraying 3astatistical analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aChina1 aZhao, Shengming1 aChen, Xiaoxin1 aHu, Jiye0 tFood analytical methods.g2018 May, v. 11, no. 5 p.1312-1320dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4237774x1936-97517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-017-1065-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002100162245006700183300001600250500001900266500000900285520080400294592002801098650001301126650001501139650001601154650002501170650000901195650001901204650002101223700001801244773012301262856009701385852000901482655001201491IND60663512520221122201141.0191122e196609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066351252DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1966.00021962005800050025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelstad, O.

P and K are rather immobile nutrients and crop recovery is lower than for N. Consequently, P and K tend to accumulate in most soils as a result of fertilizer applications. In contrast, N acts as a relatively mobile nutrient and crop requirement and removal tend to be high. Since N is also lost from soils by leaching and volatilization, little accumulation occurs in humid areas and applications need to be made largely on the basis of current crop needs. Results of this study have important implications for soil testing, the need for high P water solubility, and the present number of fertilizer grades and ratios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acrop yield 3ahumid zones 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil 3avolatilization 3awater solubility1 aTerman, G.

More importantly, active species (such as Fe single atoms, Fe-SA-NCs and Fe NPs) in the 3D N, S co-doped carbon materials can be controlled by judiciously adjusting the Fe-to-TA molar ratios. High density Fe-SA-NCs as active species (up to 5.6 wt%) in the N, S co-doped carbon are realized by controlling the Fe-to-TA molar ratio at 10. In addition, these Fe-SA-NCs are composed of isolated Fe-SAs, which are separated by the coordination with four N atoms and two O atoms. The resulting N, S co-doped CPANI–TA–Fₑ Fe-SA-NC catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) exhibit a higher half-wave potential (0.923 V vs. 0.88 V of Pt/C), a higher onset potential (1.09 V vs. 0.99 V of Pt/C), a higher kinetic-limiting current density (12 mA cm⁻² at 0.9 V) and better long-term stability in alkaline media. Their ORR activity in acidic media is comparable to those recently reported in the literature. Additionally, the suitability and durability of N, S co-doped CPANI–TA–Fₑ Fe-SA-NC catalysts as the air electrode of a zinc–air battery were investigated. The fabricated Zn–air batteries exhibited a higher power density of 136.4 mW cm⁻² and a higher specific capacity of 795.1 mA h g⁻¹, which are better than those of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare other metal nanocluster-based porous carbon materials as electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy devices, as TA can be chelated with diverse metal ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achelation 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3afreeze drying 3ahydrogels 3airon 3ametal ions 3aplatinum 3apolyaniline 3apyrolysis 3atannins1 aDu, Kai1 aXiang, Chensheng1 aAn, Pengfei1 aShu, Xinxin1 aDang, Yaru1 aWu, Chenshuo1 aWang, Jin1 aDu, Wei1 aZhang, Jintao1 aLi, Shenggang1 aTian, He1 aWang, Shuangyin1 aXia, Haibing0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 8, no. 33 p.17136-17149dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta04210b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245014400164300001600308500001900324520122300343592002801566650001401594650001601608650003001624650001601654650001401670650001301684653001501697653001401712653000901726653001201735653002001747700001801767700003201785773013301817856007601950852000902026655001202035IND60728817420221117172533.0210224e20210223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072881742DNAL7 a10.1636/JoA-S-20-0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiřman, Matyáš10aUnexpectedly high number of 18S rRNA gene clusters in Miopsalis dillyi (Opiliones: Cyphophthalmi: Stylocellidae) from Mindanao, Philippines  ap. 322-328.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe suborder Cyphophthalmi (Arachnida: Opiliones) is the sister group to all remaining harvestmen. The group typically shows limited dispersal abilities, cryptic diversity and long-isolated populations. These facts make the group interesting for biogeographic, phylogenetic and cytogenetic studies. The suborder is divided into six families, all of them with a specific and long evolutionary history. However, many species are still undescribed, and their cytogenetic data are only fragmentary. This fact complicates the reconstruction of the main mechanisms of karyotype evolution in this harvestmen suborder, and utilization of the cytogenetic markers in the taxonomy of this morphologically uniform group of arachnids. Here, we present a cytogenetic study of one species of Miopsalis Thorell, 1890, of the family Stylocellidae from Mindanao (Philippines). Its karyotype consisted of mainly biarmed chromosomes (2n = 28). Interestingly, we found a multiplication of 18S rRNA gene clusters in up to seven pairs, which is one of the highest numbers in known harvestmen. These results support the likely presence of distinctive karyotype variability in an additional cyphophthalmid family, Stylocellidae (2n = 28–30).  aPublisher supplied data 3aOpiliones 3aPhilippines 3ageographical distribution 3akaryotyping 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomy 0aChromosome 0akaryotype 0aFISH 0ameiosis 0amite harvestmen1 aMohagan, Alma1 aŠtááhlavský, František0 tJournal of arachnology.g2021 Feb. 23, v. 48, no. 3 p.322-328dAmerican Arachnological SocietywJournal:jnl7320x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636/JoA-S-20-0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03924naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014900163300001800312520198000330592002802310650001802338650001702356650002102373650001502394650001102409650002402420650001602444650001502460650001402475650001102489650001302500650001502513650001102528653002202539653002102561653002602582653002302608653002802631700006302659700005502722700006302777700005602840700005402896700006002950700001303010700005603023700002203079700005603101773012103157856008303278852000903361655001203370IND60750620920221118011921.0211219e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075062092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2021.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtero, Paz10aApplications of by-products from the olive oil processing: Revalorization strategies based on target molecules and green extraction technologies  ap. 1084-1104.  aDuring the last decades, olive oil consumption has experienced a continuous increase due to its unique organoleptic properties and its related beneficial properties. Consequently, waste and by-products derived from the olive production have also increased causing environmental problems and economic losses. However, the low-cost and huge availability of these by-products is an opportunity for their valorization and the obtaining of high added-value compounds such as tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol (HT), oleocanthal, oleuropein (OLE), ligstroside, squalene, fatty acids, etc. The development of innovative extraction and characterization technologies is a key factor for the olive sector. In addition, a deeper knowledge about the biological properties of the compounds present in the recovered products and their mechanism of action is crucial to allow their reintegration in the food chain and their potential uses in the food and pharmaceutical industries.This review encompasses all these aspects showing the advances achieved to date in the olive oil by-products valorization focusing on their biological properties, including cardioprotective, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic effects.The by-products derived from the Olea europaea L. processing industry are secondary but valuable products, from which different biologically active molecules can be recovered by green extraction technologies (PLE, SFE, etc.) and reused for food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes following the circular economy policies. One of the main advantages on recovering valuable molecules from olive by-products is their incorporation to functional foods. A direct effect was proved between the use of olive by-products in human consumption and the heath claims. In this context, different food industries have used the phenolic fraction of olive by-products, holding mostly HT and OLE, as food additives and as preserving agents due to their antioxidant properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aantioxidants 3acircular economy 3afood chain 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3aoleocanthal 3aoleuropein 3aolive oil 3aolives 3asqualene 3atechnology 3awastes 0aOlive by-products 0aTarget molecules 0aBiological properties 0aPhenolic compounds 0aInnovative applications1 aGarcia-Oliveira, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4058-37091 aCarpena, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4819-78561 aBarral-Martinez, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2000-280X1 aChamorro, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2930-25311 aEchave, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1994-04361 aGarcia-Perez, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1798-62351 aCao, Hui1 aXiao, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3311-770X1 aSimal-Gandara, J.1 aPrieto, M.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3513-00540 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Oct., v. 116 p.1084-1104dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245009700172300001400269520171700283592002802000650001602028650002502044650001902069650001902088650001402107650001502121650001102136650001102147650001402158650000702172650001902179650001502198650001402213650001202227653002102239653002602260653001702286653001302303653001102316653002402327653002502351653001402376653002502390700006202415700002002477700002102497700002502518773009602543856008802639852000902727655001202736IND60540265920221117202604.0190318e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054026592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVihakas, Matti10aRapid estimation of the oxidative activities of individual phenolics in crude plant extracts  ap. 76-84.  aPrevious studies of purified phenolic compounds have revealed that some phenolics, especially ellagitannins, can autoxidise under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the midgut of lepidopteran larvae. To facilitate screening for the pro-oxidant activities of all types of phenolic compounds from crude plant extracts, we developed a method that combined our recent spectrophotometric bioactivity method with an additional chromatographic step via UPLC–DAD–MS. This method allowed us to estimate the total pro-oxidant capacities of crude extracts from 12 plant species and to identify the individual phenolic compounds that were responsible for the detected activities. It was found that the pro-oxidant capacities of the plant species (i.e., the concentrations of the easily-oxidised phenolics) varied from 0 to 57mg/g dry wt, representing from 0% to 46% of the total phenolics from different species. UPLC–DAD–MS analysis revealed that most flavonol and flavone glycosides were only slightly affected by alkaline conditions, thus indicating their low pro-oxidant activity. Interestingly, myricetin-type compounds differed from the other flavonoids, as their concentrations decreased strongly due to alkaline incubation. The same effect was detected for hydrolysable tannins and prodelphinidins, suggesting that a pyrogallol sub-structure could be a key structural component that partially explains their easy oxidation at high pH. Other types of phenolic compounds, such as hydroxycinnamic acids, were relatively active, as well. These findings demonstrate that this method displays the potential to identify most of the active and inactive pro-oxidant phenolic compounds in various plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLepidoptera 3abioactive properties 3achromatography 3acoumaric acids 3aflavonols 3aglycosides 3alarvae 3amidgut 3aoxidation 3apH 3aplant extracts 3apyrogallol 3ascreening 3atannins 0aOxidative stress 0aPro-oxidative defence 0aAutoxidation 0aFolivory 0aMidgut 0aLepidopteran larvae 0aHydrolysable tannins 0aMyricetin 0aFlavonoid glycosides1 aPälijärvi, Maija1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8801-46981 aKaronen, Maarit1 aRoininen, Heikki1 aSalminen, Juha-Pekka0 tPhytochemistry.g2014 July, v. 103 p.76-84dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011800169300001400287520182100301592002802122650001602150650001602166650001902182650003102201650002002232650002002252650001002272650001402282650001002296650002202306650001002328653001802338653003702356653002802393653002302421653003002444653002402474700002202498700001802520700002102538700002002559773009602579856008702675852000902762655001202771IND60570293320221120055834.0180830e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057029332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapra, Harsh10aExperimental and simulation-based investigations of marine diesel engine performance against static back pressure  ap. 78-92.  aAfter-treatment technologies are adopted in automobiles and ships to meet strict emission regulations, which increase exhaust back pressure. Furthermore, underwater exhaust systems are employed on board ships to save space, and reduce noise and pollution on working decks. However, water at exhaust outlet creates a flow resistance for the exhaust gases, which adds to the back pressure. High back pressure reduces the operating limits of an engine, increases fuel consumption, and can lead to exhaust smoke. While the effects of back pressure were recognized earlier, there is a lack of experimentally validated research on the performance limits of a turbocharged, marine diesel engine against high back pressure for the entire operating window. The focus of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of back pressure effects on marine diesel engine performance, and to identify limits of acceptable back pressure along with methods to tackle high back pressure.In this work, a pulse turbocharged, medium speed, diesel engine was tested at different loads and engine speeds; against different values of static back pressure. Additionally, mean value model simulations could be validated and were used to compare the performance of a pulse and constant pressure turbocharged engine against high back pressures of 1meter water-column (mWC), and for two different values of valve overlap.Using the validated simulation model, the conceptual basis for the engine smoke limit as well as for thermal overloading is investigated. A methodology applying the conceptual basis to define boundaries of acceptable back pressures has been presented in this paper. A combination of pulse turbocharger systems and small valve overlap showed to significantly improve back pressure handling capabilities of engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3acompressors 3adiesel engines 3aenergy use and consumption 3aexhaust systems 3aflow resistance 3agases 3apollution 3aships 3asimulation models 3asmoke 0aBack pressure 0aMarine diesel engine performance 0aMean value engine model 0aEngine experiments 0aUnderwater exhaust system 0aThermal overloading1 aGodjevac, Milinko1 aVisser, Klaas1 aStapersma, Douwe1 aDijkstra, Chris0 tApplied energy.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 204 p.78-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.06.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002700169245010600196300001800302520084600320592002801166650001401194650001701208650002101225650001301246650001401259650002601273650002401299650002901323650002501352700001801377700002001395773009701415856008601512852000901598655001201607IND4457045620221119020022.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445704562DNAL7 a213765702pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEterigho, Elizabeth J.10aTriglyceride cracking for biofuel production using a directly synthesised sulphated zirconia catalyst  ap. 6313-6316.  aIn this study, sulphated zirconia was directly synthesised and compared to the conventional wet method of preparation.

Here, we report the synthesis of novel “smart” hydroxyapatite (HaP) magnetic nanoparticles and their corresponding stimuli-responsive Pickering emulsions and explore their movement under confined spaces using a microfluidic platform. Pickering emulsions prepared with our magnetic stearic acid-functionalized Fe₂O₃@HaP nanoparticles exhibited pronounced pH-responsive behavior. We observed that the diameter of emulsion droplets decreases with an increase in pH. Swift demulsification was achieved by lowering the pH, whereas the reformation of emulsions was achieved by increasing the pH; this emulsification-demulsification cycling was successful for at least ten cycles. We used a microfluidic platform to test the stability of the emulsions under flowing conditions and their response to a magnetic field. We observed that the emulsion stability was diminished and droplet coalescence was enhanced by the application of the magnetic field. The smart nanoparticles we developed and their HaP-based emulsions present promising materials for pharmaceutical and petroleum industries, where responsive emulsions with controlled stabilities are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3ahydroxyapatite 3amagnetic fields 3apH 3apetroleum1 aAli, Ahmed Atef Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0375-65111 aHejazi, Seyed Hossein1 aGates, Ian0 tLangmuir.g2021 Jan. 22, v. 37, no. 4 p.1353-1364dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c024083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01794naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009800158300001800256520065100274592002800925650001700953650002200970650001400992650002301006650001101029650002101040650001101061650001301072650001401085650000701099650001501106700001701121700001601138700001201154700001401166773013301180856007401313852000901387655001201396IND60645338120221120233520.0190528e20190523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064533812DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc01865d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lu-Hua10aBase-enhanced electrochemical water oxidation by a nickel complex in neutral aqueous solution  ap. 6122-6125.  aA nickel complex, [Ni(TMC)(CH₃CN)](NO₃)₂ (TMC = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane, 1), was found to be an efficient water oxidation catalyst in pH 7 phosphate buffer.

The magnitude of WTP toward satisfying MyPlate recommendations is substantially below the cost; therefore, it is not surprising that current consumption levels are well below the recommendation.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is making increasing implications for GIS-based spatial analysis in combination with multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) methods. It is considered to be an effective tool to understand natural disasters related to mass movements and carry out an appropriate risk assessment. This study is based on an integrated approach of GIS and statistical modelling including fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), weighted linear combination and MCE models. In the modelling process, eleven causative factors include slope aspect, slope, rainfall, geology, geomorphology, distance from lineament, distance from drainage networks, distance from the road, land use/land cover, soil erodibility and vegetation proportion were identified for landslide susceptibility mapping. These factors were identified based on the (1) literature review, (2) the expert knowledge, (3) field observation, (4) geophysical investigation, and (5) multivariate techniques. Initially, analytical hierarchy process linked with the fuzzy set theory is used in pairwise comparisons of LSM criteria for ranking purposes. Thereafter, fuzzy membership functions were carried out to determine the criteria weights used in the development of a landslide susceptibility map. These selected thematic maps were integrated using a weighted linear combination method to create the final landslide susceptibility map. Finally, a validation of the results was carried out using a sensitivity analysis based on receiver operator curves and an overlay method using the landslide inventory map. The study results show that the weighted overlay analysis method using the FAHP and eigenvector method is a reliable technique to map landslide susceptibility areas. The landslide susceptibility areas were classified into five categories, viz. very low susceptibility, low susceptibility, moderate susceptibility, high susceptibility, and very high susceptibility. The very high and high susceptibility zones account for 15.11% area coverage. The results are useful to get an impression of the sustainability of the watershed in terms of landsliding and therefore may help decision makers in future planning and mitigation of landslide impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisasters 3adrainage 3aerodibility 3aexpert opinion 3ageographic information systems 3ageomorphology 3ageophysics 3ainventories 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandslides 3amathematical theory 3amulti-criteria decision making 3amultivariate analysis 3aplanning 3arain 3arisk assessment 3astatistical models 3athematic maps 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aSaudi Arabia1 aSingh, RamKaran1 aAlAwadh, MohammedA.1 aIslam, Saiful1 aKhan, RoohulAbad1 aQureshi, MohamedNoor0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Apr., v. 77, no. 7 p.276-276dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7451-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245007400153300002000227520121800247592002801465650002201493650001501515650002601530650001801556650002301574650001601597650002101613650002201634650001001656650003101666650001901697650004301716650001601759650001801775650001401793650003001807650002301837700001801860700001601878700001801894700001801912773012501930856007402055852000902129655001202138IND60642033020221118025834.0190506e20170907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064203302DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra05873j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aScreening of inhibitors of Taenia solium glycogen synthase Kinase-3β  ap. 43319-43326.  aGlycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) has been found to be a potential target for the effective treatment of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. GSK-3β has also been suggested as a target for the treatment of protozoan parasitic infections such as those caused by Leishmania spp., Plasmodium falciparum, and Trypanosoma brucei. In this study, we determined the sequence of GSK-3β from T. solium (TsGSK-3β), which encodes 434 amino acid residues, as it could be a potential drug target. We modeled the TsGSK-3β tertiary structure by applying the crystal structure of the HsGSK-3β protein (PDB ID: 1UV5) as the template. Fourteen inhibitors of TsGSK-3β were screened by structure-based molecule docking. Recombinant TsGSK-3β protein was expressed and purified. We obtained 14 pharmaceutical compounds and performed surface plasmon resonance imaging to determine their binding affinities to TsGSK-3β and HsGSK-3β. Three compounds were identified to be potential novel inhibitors, as they showed significant interaction with TsGSK-3β but no binding to HsGSK-3β. Our study provides useful information for finding innovative drugs for treatment of T. solium infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aLeishmania 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aTaenia solium 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aamino acids 3abinding capacity 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aglycogen (starch) synthase 3aimage analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aparasitoses 3aschizophrenia 3ascreening 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atau-protein kinase1 aCheng, Jiagao1 aWang, Shuai1 aZhang, Xichen1 aCai,, Xuepeng0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 07, v. 7, no. 68 p.43319-43326dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra05873j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245015600166300001600322520176900338592002802107650002402135650001802159650001002177650001902187650001602206650001602222650001802238650002002256650001502276650002202291650002802313650001602341650002602357650001802383650001802401650002602419650002202445650001402467650000902481650001302490650001502503650001102518650002202529650002202551650002302573650001102596653002602607653002802633653001702661653001602678700001302694700001602707700001302723700001302736700001402749700001502763773010602778856008702884852000902971655001202980IND60570293920221120205426.0190401e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057029392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, W.J.10aEffect of feeding Rumen-protected capsule containing niacin, K2SO4, vitamin C, and gamma-aminobutyric acid on heat stress and performance of dairy cows  ap. 249-253.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplemental rumen-protected capsule (RPC) on animal performance, serological indicators, and serum heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) of lactating Holstein cows under heat stress (HS). During summer months, 30 healthy multiparous lactating Holstein cows with a parity number of 3.1 ± 0.44, 70 ± 15 d in milk, an average body weight of 622 ± 62kg, and an average milk yield of 32.28 ± 0.96kg/d, were used. The cows were randomly allocated to two groups: a control group and an RPC-supplemented group (0.13373kg K2SO4, 0.02488kg vitamin C, 0.021148kg niacin, and 0.044784kggamma-aminobutyric acid per cow). During the 42-d experiment, ambient air temperature and relative humidity inside and outside the barn were recorded hourly every day for the determination of temperature-humidity index (THI). Milk and blood samples were collected every week, and body weight and body condition scoring were measured on day 0. Based on the THI values, the animals had moderate HS. On day 42, the RPC group had lower HSP70, adrenocorticotropic hormone (P = 0.0001), lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.0338), and IL-6 (P = 0.0724) levels than the control group, with no significant differences in creatine kinase, glucocorticoid, or IL-2 levels. Milk yield, energy-corrected milk, and dry matter intake were higher in RPC than in the control group (P = 0.0196). There were no significant differences in milk fat or daily protein levels between the two groups; however, daily protein and milk fat levels were higher in the RPC group than in the control group (P = 0.0114 and P = 0.0665, respectively). Somatic cell counts were no different between the two groups. In conclusion, RPC may alleviate HS and improve dairy cow performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aascorbic acid 3abarns 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acorticotropin 3acreatine kinase 3adairy cows 3adry matter intake 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aheat stress 3aheat-shock protein 70 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alactating females 3alactation 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk yield 3aniacin 3apotassium sulfate 3arelative humidity 3asomatic cell count 3asummer 0aSerological indicator 0aRumen-protected capsule 0aHolstein cow 0aHeat stress1 aZhen, L.1 aZhang, J.X.1 aLian, S.1 aSi, H.F.1 aGuo, J.R.1 aYang, H.M.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2017 Oct., v. 69 p.249-253dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01809naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010600165300001800271500001900289520060900308592002800917650001500945650001400960650003000974650002101004650001101025650001301036700006701049700005601116700002001172700006101192773011301253856008401366852000901450655001201459IND60726167720210903000000.0210202e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072616772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c028252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Boshen10aDynamical Density Functional Theory for the Drying and Stratification of Binary Colloidal Dispersions  ap. 1399-1409.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe develop a dynamical density functional theory based model for the drying of colloidal films on planar surfaces.

Enzymatic hydrolysis is the most efficient method of converting hemicellulose into sugars, where efficient thermotolerant fungal xylanases hydrolyze the xylan fractions present in the hemicellulose into xylose and xylooligomers. Xylanases are potential candidates for improved enzyme cocktails that increase saccharification yields in synergy with other cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes complexes. In this context, endo-xylanase from the thermophilic fungus Humicola brevis var. thermoidea (XylHb) was purified, biochemically and biophysically characterized, and its biotechnological potential was evaluated. XylHb exhibited a molecular weight of 26 kDa and biophysical analyzes revealed that XylHb is mainly formed by β sheets, and exhibits maximum exposure of its tryptophan residues at high temperatures. The characterization of the biochemical properties of XylHb indicated greater tolerance to wide pH (5.0–10.0), temperatures (50–70 °C), and NaCl concentrations (0.1–2.0 mol L⁻¹), as well as better kinetic efficiency than the Cellic®HTec2 cocktail for birchwood xylan hydrolysis. Additionally, saccharification tests of pre-hydrothermally treated sugarcane bagasse after 72 h showed that the complementation of Cellic®CTec2 with XylHb (1:1; w/w) caused a significant increase in glucose released (7.52 ± 0.01%) and total reducing sugars (14.07 ± 0.02%) about commercial enzymatic control. Thus, the addition of XylHb to commercial cellulase suggests a potential for diverse industrial applications improving the saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHumicola 3aagricultural biotechnology 3abiocatalysis 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aeconomic valuation 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aglucose 3aheat tolerance 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apentoses 3aprebiotics 3asaccharification 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3athermophilic fungi 3atryptophan 3axylan 3axylose 0aLignocellulosic biomass 0aHemicellulose valorization 0aEndo-xylanase 0aHumicola brevis 0aSugarcane bagasse hydrolysis1 aVargas, Isabela Pavão1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0901-57221 aMarciano, Camila Langer1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1911-95761 aZanoelo, Fabiana Fonseca1 aGiannesi, Giovana Cristina1 aMoraes Polizeli, Maria de Lourdes Teixeira de1 aJorge, João Atílio,1 aFurriel, Rosa dos Prazeres Melo1 aRuller, Roberto1 aMasui, Douglas Chodi0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2022 Sept., v. 44 p.102424-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2022.1024243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01301naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010600164300001800270520040400288592002800692650001000720650002300730650001800753650001100771700002500782773013300807856007400940852000901014655001201023IND60645338520221120233805.0190528e20190523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064533852DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc01974j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitto-Barry, Anaïs10aInfluence of boron doping on the dynamics of formation of Os metal nanoclusters on graphitic surfaces  ap. 6038-6041.  aThe fabrication of osmium nanoclusters from single atoms has been studied in real-time on B-doped and B-free graphitic surfaces.

Reliable identification is important for disease management on herd level and for antimicrobial treatment of infected animals. Our objective was to evaluate the test characteristics of PathoProof ™ Mastitis PCR Assay and bacteriological culture (BC) in diagnosing bovine intramammary infections caused by S. aureus at dry off at different PCR cycle threshold (Ct)-value cut-offs. METHODS: Sterile quarter samples and non-sterile composite samples from 140 animals in seven herds were collected in connection with the dairy herd improvement (DHI) milk recording. All quarter samples were analyzed using BC whereas all composite samples were analyzed with PathoProof ™ Mastitis PCR Assay. Latent class analysis was used to estimate test properties for PCR and BC in the absence of a perfect reference test. The population was divided into two geographically divided subpopulations and the Hui-Walter 2-test 2-populations model applied to estimate Se, Sp for the two tests, and prevalence for the two subpopulations. RESULTS: The Se for PCR increased with increasing Ct-value cut-off, accompanied by a small decrease in Sp. For BC the Se decreased and Sp increased with increasing Ct-value cut-off. Most optimal test estimates for the real-time PCR assay were at a Ct-value cut-off of 37; 0.93 [95% posterior probability interval (PPI) 0.60-0.99] for Se and 0.95 [95% PPI 0.95-0.99] for Sp. At the same Ct-value cut-off, Se and Sp for BC were 0.83 [95% PPI 0.66-0.99] and 0.97 [95% PPI 0.91-0.99] respectively. Depending on the chosen PCR Ct-value cut-off, the prevalence in the subpopulations varied; the prevalence increased with increasing PCR Ct-value cut-offs. CONCLUSION: Neither BC nor real-time PCR is a perfect test in detecting IMI in dairy cows at dry off. The changes in sensitivity and prevalence at different Ct-value cut-offs for both PCR and BC may indicate a change in the underlying disease definition. At low PCR Ct-value cut-offs the underlying disease definition may be a truly/heavily infected cow, whereas at higher PCR Ct-value cut-offs the disease definition may be a S. aureus positive cow.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3adairy cows 3adairy herds 3adisease control 3aherd improvement 3amastitis 3amilk 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprobability 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aColony Count, Microbialxmethodsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMastitis, Bovinexdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aMilkxmicrobiology 2aModels, Biological 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcus aureusxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism.1 aToft, Nils1 aAalbaek, Bent1 aKlaas, Ilka Christine0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2012 Dec., v. 54, no. 1 p.824-824dSpringer-Verlagx1751-01477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1751-0147-54-65  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011900155300002000274520118300294592002801477650004401505650002201549650001501571650001501586650002801601650001501629650000901644650001501653650002501668650001501693650002201708650001901730650001301749650001401762650001501776650001601791650002501807700001801832700001601850700001601866700001901882700001501901773014301916856007402059852000902133655001202142IND60670950820221121065751.0191002e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095082DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta07150f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Lili,10aTemplate-synthesized ultra-thin molecularly imprinted polymers membrane for the selective preconcentration of dyes  ap. 10959-10968.  aThe selective and efficient removal of pollutants is essential for wastewater treatment and resource recycling. In this study, an ultra-thin molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) membrane with a thickness of 1 nm was synthesized by a facile atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method using layered double hydroxides (LDH) as the template substrate. The as-prepared MIPs membrane was characterized by XRD, TEM, AFM, FTIR and BET measurements. This material was then applied for the selective preconcentration of Rhodamine B (RhB) in water. Benefiting from the surface-imprinting technique, a high adsorption capacity of 100.1 mg g⁻¹ was obtained with an enrichment multiple of 27.3 times. It was interesting that the MIPs adsorption was temperature-sensitive, which was employed as a simple and environmentally friendly desorption strategy by changing the operating temperature. The applicability of the material was demonstrated by recovering RhB from real water samples.

Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a recently described cytokine signaling through the ST2 receptor, has emerged as a potent inducer to bile duct proliferation and fibrosis; however, little is known of this signaling in the pathogen-caused periductal inflammation and fibrosis. In the present study, using immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and flow cytometry, we studied the expression of IL-33/ST2 during C. sinensis infection, as well as their potential roles in C. sinensis-induced host immune responses. The results showed that a higher level of IL-33 was detected in the sera of patients of clonorchiasis (n = 45), compared with in those of healthy donors (n = 16). Similarly, in FVB mice experimentally infected with C. sinensis, a higher level of IL-33 was detected at latent stage both in the serum and in the liver, as well as the up-regulated expression of ST2 receptor on the inflammatory cells, especially on CD4⁺ T cells in the liver of infected mice. Our results, for the first time, indicated that the increased IL-33/ST2 may be involved in the regulation of immunopathology induced by C. sinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aClonorchis sinensis 3abile ducts 3ablood serum 3aclonorchiasis 3acytokines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afibrosis 3aflow cytometry 3ahepatocytes 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aimmunopathology 3ainflammation 3aliver 3amice 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aLi, Xiangyang,1 aCheng, Xiao-Dan1 aShen, Li-Ping1 aFang, Fan1 aZhang, Bo1 aHua, Hui1 aYan, Chao1 aTang, Ren-Xian1 aZheng, Kui-Yang0 tParasitology research.g2016 June, v. 115, no. 6 p.2299-2305dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-016-4974-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011000156300002000266520140900286592002801695650002901723650002201752650003701774650001501811650002001826650001401846650001101860650001701871650001301888650001301901650001201914650001901926650001301945650001801958650002301976650001601999650003702015700001702052700001702069700001802086700001802104773012402122856007402246852000902320655001202329IND60642033320221118025754.0190506e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064203332DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra05887j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jian10aHighly selective production of heavy hydrocarbons over cobalt–graphene–silica nanocomposite catalysts  ap. 33441-33449.  aHerein, cobalt–graphene–silica nanocomposites were prepared by a sol–gel method to produce heavy hydrocarbons for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. The catalysts were characterized by N₂ physisorption, XRD, TEM, TPR, TPD, XPS, and DRIFTS techniques. The activity of catalysts and the selectivity of products were examined in a tubular fixed-bed reactor. It can be concluded that the introduction of graphene into cobalt–silica nanocomposites significantly enhanced the amount and stability of adsorbed CO at low temperatures, resulting in higher concentrations of CO species on the catalyst surface. Moreover, graphene can weaken the cobalt–silica interaction, leading to higher degree of reduction of cobalt oxides and higher adsorption amounts of H₂. In addition, the introduction of graphene led to the formation of cobalt with smaller particle sizes, which contributed to great enhancement of CO conversion. The selectivity to methane distinctly decreased to 4.2% from 8.1%, whereas the selectivity to C₅⁺ products increased from 84.5% to 92.4%. The α value increased from 0.89 for the Co–Si catalyst to 0.94 for the Co–0.1GSi catalyst. In addition, with the increase in the graphene content, the fraction of heavy hydrocarbons (C₁₉–₂₉) for catalysts evidently increased to 36.0% from 28.3%, but the fraction of naphtha (C₅–₁₂) clearly reduced to 17.7% from 27.7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3ananocomposites 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3asol-gel processing 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aQian, Weixin1 aMa, Hongfang1 aZhang, Haitao1 aYing, Weiyong0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 03, v. 7, no. 53 p.33441-33449dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra05887j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245007500211300001600286500001900302520073100321592002801052596009801080650003101178650002401209650001001233650002201243650001801265650001101283650001401294650001801308650001001326651001101336653000801347653002001355653002801375700003101403700001901434700002501453700001401478700002701492700002501519700002201544700001701566700006001583773013001643856008201773852000901855655001201864IND60728818220221117172555.0210224e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072881822DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-02-20-0318-SC2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuzdraliński, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2383-195010aNovel Primer Sets for Rapid Detection of Zymoseptoria tritici in Wheat  ap. 251-254.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aZymoseptoria tritici is a fungal pathogen causing losses in wheat yields.

In particular, the utilization of waste or side-stream lignocellulosic materials for fuel production is highly recommended. Moreover, future crises forcing a reliance on locally available sources for fuels and energy may become increasingly common. Barley straw, a common agricultural residue in northern Europe, is a potential raw material for bioalcohol production via fermentation. In this study, the technoeconomic and environmental sustainability of bioethanol and biobutanol production from barley straw were evaluated. When compared with fossil gasoline production and use, the greenhouse gas emissions reduction 77.6% and 72.1% were achieved for ethanol and butanol production, respectively. Thus, the emission reduction of 65% for biofuels demanded by the European Union renewable energy directive was achieved in both biofuel production processes evaluated. However, our results indicated that ethanol production from barley straw, a well-known and mature technology, was an economically feasible process (NPV positive, IRR 20%) but that butanol production with Clostridium species through acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation has still technoeconomic challenges to overcome (NPV negative, IRR below 10%).

In this study we analyzed the molecular species of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and related phospholipids, together with their metabolic enzyme activity, in plasma from Wistar rats exposed up to 300ppm Cd2+ in drinking water for 114days. Exposure of 300ppm Cd2+ for 114days enhanced autotoxin (ATX)/lysophospholipase D activity, but significantly lowered the total levels of LPA and lysophosphatidylethanolamine. Interestingly, the total level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was elevated dose-dependently by Cd2+. Cultured rat kidney-derived interstitial fibroblast cells, NRK49F cells and proximal epithelial cells, NRK52E cells, were both responsive to the protective action of LPA or S1P against Cd2+ toxicity. The former cell expresses ATX RNA. In conclusion, the elevation of LPA-producing enzyme activity and S1P concentrations in plasma after exposure of rats to Cd2+ would protect from the renal toxicity of Cd2+.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acadmium 3achronic exposure 3adrinking water 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelial cells 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3anephrotoxicity 3aphospholipids 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arenal failure 3atoxicology 0aαSMA 0aATX 0aCd 0aCdCl2 0aLC–MS/MS 0aDMEM 0aFCS 0aGAPDH 0aLPP 0aLPA1 0aLPA 0aLPC 0aLPE 0aLPG 0aLPI 0aLPS 0alysoPLD 0aS1P1 0aSPHK1 0aSPHK2 0aS1P 0aUUO 0aLysophosphatidic acid 0aSphingosine-1-phosphate 0aCadmium 0aRenal failure 0aNRK49F cells 0aNRK52E cells1 aIshihara, Akira1 aYamamoto, Aimi1 aAsaji, Hiroki1 aYamakawa, Syougo1 aTokumura, Akira0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Mar., v. 65 p.52-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2013.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012700160300002000287520129500307592002801602650001501630650001301645650001701658650001401675650001101689650001001700650001201710650002301722650001201745700001201757700001701769700001301786700002001799700001801819773012401837856007401961852000902035655001202044IND60642033720221118025723.0190506e20170713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064203372DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra05894b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Xianggang10aDissociation mechanism of H₂ molecule on the Li₂O/hydrogenated-Li₂O (111) surface from first principles calculations  ap. 35239-35250.  aHydrogen molecules in a purge gas are known to enhance the release of tritium from lithium ceramic materials, which has been demonstrated in numerous in-pile experiments. The static computational results suggest that the molecular adsorption of H₂ on the “ideal” Li₂O/hydrogenated-Li₂O (111) surface encounters high dissociation barriers in various entrance channels. The surface chemical inertness of the plane can be broken by introducing vacancy defects. In the present work, a combination of static DFT calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics has been performed to investigate the H₂ dissociative mechanism. Our theoretical results, that the end-on oriented H₂ could dissociate on the hydrogen monomer vacancy surface with one hydrogen atom ejected into the gas phase by the abstraction channel and the parallel H₂ molecule dissociates on the hydrogen dimer vacancy surface with two hydroxyls forming, suggest that hydrogen vacancy defects facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of H₂ molecule. The presence of the O²⁻ ion induced by the hydrogen vacancy provides some low energy states in which the H₂ electrons can be accommodated. This is very instructive for the comprehension of phenomena that occur during the operation of a thermonuclear reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aceramics 3adissociation 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3agases 3alithium 3amolecular dynamics 3atritium1 aYu you,1 aMa, Shenggui1 aGao, Tao1 aXiao, Chengjian1 aChen, Xiaojun0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 13, v. 7, no. 56 p.35239-35250dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra05894b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013100165300001400296520193900310592002802249650001702277650002202294650001002316650001302326650001102339650001302350650001502363653002702378653002202405653002302427653002802450653003202478700001402510700001502524700001702539700001502556773009002571856008402661852000902745655001202754IND60697961220221121003551.0200809e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069796122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yang10aPredicting drug-drug interactions using multi-modal deep auto-encoders based network embedding and positive-unlabeled learning  ap. 37-46.  aDrug-drug interactions (DDIs) are crucial for public health and patient safety, which has aroused widespread concern in academia and industry. The existing computational DDI prediction methods are mainly divided into four categories: literature extraction-based, similarity-based, matrix operations-based and network-based. A number of recent studies have revealed that integrating heterogeneous drug features is of significant importance for developing high-accuracy prediction models. Meanwhile, drugs that lack certain features could utilize other features to learn representations. However, it also brings some new challenges such as incomplete data, non-linear relations and heterogeneous properties. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal deep auto-encoders based drug representation learning method named DDI-MDAE, to predict DDIs from large-scale, noisy and sparse data. Our method aims to learn unified drug representations from multiple drug feature networks simultaneously using multi-modal deep auto-encoders. Then, we apply four operators on the learned drug embeddings to represent drug-drug pairs and adopt the random forest classifier to train models for predicting DDIs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for DDI prediction and significant improvement compared to other state-of-the-art benchmark methods. Moreover, we apply a specialized random forest classifier in the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning setting to enhance the prediction accuracy. Experimental results reveal that the model improved by PU learning outperforms the original method DDI-MDAE by 7.1% and 6.2% improvement in AUPR metric respectively on 3-fold cross-validation (3-CV) and 5-fold cross-validation (5-CV). And in F-measure metric, the improved model gains 10.4% and 8.4% improvement over DDI-MDAE respectively on 3-CV and 5-CV. The usefulness of DDI-MDAE is further demonstrated by case studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adrug interactions 3adrugs 3alearning 3amodels 3apatients 3aprediction 0aDrug-drug interactions 0aNetwork embedding 0aDeep auto-encoders 0aMissing link prediction 0aPositive-unlabeled learning1 aQiu, Yang1 aCui, Yuxin1 aLiu, Shichao1 aZhang, Wen0 tMethods.g2020 July 01, v. 179 p.37-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245009400170300002000264520149900284592002801783650001101811650001401822650001501836650003001851650001701881650001101898650000901909650001201918650001201930650002301942650001401965650001101979650002201990650001302012650001902025700001802044700002302062773014402085856007402229852000902303655001202312IND60708521020221123042720.0200826e20200825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852102DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta05132b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOspina-Acevedo, Francisco10aLithium oxidation and electrolyte decomposition at Li-metal/liquid electrolyte interfaces  ap. 17036-17055.  aWe examine the evolution of events occurring when a Li metal surface is in contact with a 2 M solution of a Li salt in a solvent or mixture of solvents, via classical molecular dynamics simulations with a reactive force field allowing bond breaking and bond forming. The main events include Li oxidation and electrolyte reduction along with expansion of the Li surface layers forming a porous phase that is the basis for the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) components. Nucleation of the main SEI components (LiF, Li oxides, and some organics) is characterized. The analysis clearly reveals the details of these physical–chemical events as a function of time, during 20 nanoseconds. The effects of the chemistry of the electrolyte on Li oxidation and dissolution in the liquid electrolyte, and SEI nucleation and structure are identified by testing two salts: LiPF₆ and LiCF₃SO₃, and various solvents including ethers and carbonates and mixtures of them. The kinetics and thermodynamics of Li₆F, the core nuclei in the LiF crystal, are studied by analysis of the MD trajectories, and via density functional theory calculations respectively. The SEI formed in this computational experiment is the “native” film that would form upon contact of the Li foil with the liquid electrolyte. As such, this work is the first in a series of computational experiments that will help elucidate the intricate interphase layer formed during battery cycling using metal anodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbonates 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrolytes 3aethers 3afoil 3aliquids 3alithium 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3asimulation models 3asolvents 3athermodynamics1 aGuo, Ningxuan1 aBalbuena, Perla B.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 8, no. 33 p.17036-17055dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta05132b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010500169300001400274520131500288592002801603650001501631650001701646650001301663650001301676650001401689650002601703650001301729650001701742650001101759650001801770650003101788650001501819650002001834650002401854650001701878650001101895650002701906650001601933650001101949653002701960653002401987653003502011653002002046653001902066653001802085700001202103700001802115700001702133773010502150856008202255852000902337655001202346IND60636200520221123004433.0191231e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063620052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2018.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSapirstein, Harry12aA study of factors influencing the water absorption capacity of Canadian hard red winter wheat flour  ap. 52-59.  aThe nature of variation in water absorption capacity in Canadian hard red winter (HRW) wheat genotypes was studied. Wheat and flour were evaluated for a range of physical and chemical properties including hardness indices, protein content, total and water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) contents and flour particle size by laser diffraction. Absorption, as measured by farinograph (FA) ranged from 54 to 66%. The most highly correlated conventional parameters to FA were protein and WEAX contents, particle size index and starch damage, with correlations ranging from r = 0.37 to 0.56 in absolute values. The volume fractions of large and small flour particles had the highest correlations to FA (r∼0.67). Multivariate regression analysis produced 3 or 4 variable models of FA prediction with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.95, depending on the sample population. Results indicated that FA is a complex quality parameter with low values attributable to one or more of low levels of wheat hardness, protein content or AX content, depending on genotype. Improving FA in HRW wheat consistent with hard spring wheat appears to be feasible by increasing concentration of deficient parameters by breeding, especially WEAX which has high heritability and ample variation in the HRW wheat germplasm that was studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aarabinoxylan 3abreeding 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ahard red winter wheat 3ahardness 3aheritability 3amodels 3aparticle size 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3aprotein content 3aregression analysis 3aspring wheat 3astarch 3awater binding capacity 3awheat flour 3awinter 0aFarinograph absorption 0aFlour particle size 0aWater-extractable arabinoxylan 0aProtein content 0aWheat hardness 0aStarch damage1 aWu, Yao1 aKoksel, Filiz1 aGraf, Robert0 tJournal of cereal science.g2018 May, v. 81 p.52-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2018.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04390naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245007500209300001400284520254600298592002802844650002402872650001002896650001302906650001102919650002402930650001102954650002002965650003802985650001003023650001403033650003203047650001703079650001503096650001903111650001403130650001203144651003103156651001003187653001003197653000703207653000803214653001103222653000703233653000703240653000703247653000703254653000903261653000803270653000803278653002403286653001703310653001103327653001003338653001903348700002503367700002203392700001903414700002303433700002303456773013203479856008403611852000903695655001203704IND60616817520221119071535.0201125e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkafor, Chika C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2895-834710aFactors associated with seroprevalence of bovine anaplasmosis in Texas  ap. 32-40.  aBovine anaplasmosis (BA), caused by Anaplasma marginale, is an economically important tick-borne disease of cattle in the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. Anecdotally, Veterinary Feed Directive prescriptions in the southeastern U.S. are written mostly for treatment/prevention of BA. However, there are no recent temporal seroprevalence estimates of BA in Texas (TX). Thus, this study was aimed at determining the seroprevalence of and factors associated with BA in TX. Data were obtained from an active slaughter survey (n = 215) performed between August and December 2014 as well as from reviewing Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (TVMDLs) records of specimens submitted for BA testing from January 2002 to June 2012 (n = 15,460). Irrespective of the assay used, the overall apparent seroprevalence of BA in TX between 2002 and 2012 was 15.91% (95% CI: 15.34 — 16.50%) and the yearly increase in seroprevalence followed a significant trend (P < .0001). With cELISA, the apparent seroprevalence of BA was 13.49% (95% CI: 9.56 — 18.7%) and 13.02% (95% CI: 9.74 — 17.18%) for the slaughter survey and TVMDLs records between October and December 2011, respectively. Whereas the estimated true seroprevalence for the same period was 12.35% (95% CI: 8.04 — 18.05%) and 12.78% (95% CI: 9.19 — 17.30%), respectively. Factors associated with positive BA results were age, breed, diagnostic assay used, year and quarter of the year the specimens were submitted. The odds of the outcome were 1.5 times as high when cattle were adults (vs juvenile). In comparison to other breeds, the odds of the outcome were 11.57, 7.16, and 2.5 times higher in Hereford, Angus, and mixed breeds, respectively. When compared to 2003, the odds of the diagnosis of BA was approximately 2 times as high in 2010 but 3 times as high in 2002, 2005, and 2011 and approximately 4 times as high in 2006 and 2007. In comparison to the duration from October to December, the odds of the outcome were approximately 1.5 as high from January to March and from July to September durations. Counties with specimen submissions for BA testing had a significantly greater cattle population (p = .0061) and number of cattle farms (p < .001) than counties without specimen submissions. Subsequent prevention and control measures for BA should target these factors and should prioritize on counties with higher cattle population in the eastern part of TX. Furthermore, TVMDLs records appear sufficient for the surveillance of BA in TX.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aAngus 3aHereford 3aadults 3abovine anaplasmosis 3acattle 3acontrol methods 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3ajuveniles 3alivestock and meat industry 3amixed breeds 3amonitoring 3aseroprevalence 3aslaughter 3asurveys 3aSoutheastern United States 3aTexas 0aAAVLD 0aBA 0aCFT 0acELISA 0aSe 0aSp 0aTX 0aUS 0aUSDA 0aVDL 0aVFD 0aAnaplasma marginale 0aAnaplasmosis 0aCattle 0aTexas 0aSeroprevalence1 aCollins, Samantha L.1 aDaniel, Joseph A.1 aHarvey, Benton1 aCoetzee, Johann F.1 aWhitlock, Brian K.0 tVeterinary Parasitology: Regional Studies and Reports.g2018 Dec., v. 14 p.32-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23280x2405-93907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2018.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245013300178520157200311592002801883650002801911650001601939650002801955650001901983650001902002650001902021650002502040650003002065650001602095653001802111653002602129653000902155653002302164700001602187773010302203856008702306852000902393655001202402IND60758451620221117214357.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075845162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1122352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoh, Melvin Wei Shern10aNon-raft submicron domain formation in cholesterol-containing lipid bilayers induced by polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine  aDomain formation in “HLC” ternary lipid bilayers, comprising a high transition temperature (High-Tₘ) lipid, a Low-Tₘ lipid, and cholesterol (Chol), has been extensively studied as raft-resembling systems. Recently, we reported the formation of submicron domains in an “LLC” lipid bilayer, encompassing Low-Tₘ phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), Low-Tₘ phosphatidylcholine (PC), and Chol. We hypothesized that the formation of this unique domain is driven by polyunsaturated PE. In this study, we explored the effects of the degree of PE unsaturation and the double bond distribution at the sn-position on the mechanism of formation and the composition of submicron domains. Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), comprising PE with various degrees of unsaturation, monounsaturated PC (POPC), and Chol, were investigated using fluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and the force–distance curve measurement. The area fraction of submicron domains in PE+POPC+Chol-SLB increased with the PE concentration and degree of unsaturation of the PE acyl chain. The results indicated that the submicron domains were enriched with polyunsaturated PE and were in the liquid-disordered-like state, whereas their surrounding regions were in the liquid-ordered-like state. Segregation of polyunsaturated PE from the Chol-containing region generated submicron domains in the LLC lipid bilayer. We propose a mechanism for the formation of these submicron domains based on molecular interactions involving the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the bilayer membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acholesterol 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bilayers 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3atemperature 0aLipid bilayer 0aPolyunsaturated lipid 0aRaft 0aForce spectroscopy1 aTero, Ryugo0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Feb., v. 210 p.112235-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1122353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100003000154245009800184300001600282520068300298592002800981650001601009650001101025650000801036650002001044650003301064650001601097650001601113650001901129650002801148650002301176651001201199651001001211651001501221653002401236653002001260653002401280653002601304700002001330700001401350700002401364700001901388700002001407700001801427700002001445773013301465856008801598852000901686655001201695IND60695996520221122064915.0200521e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069599652DNAL7 a10.1600/036364420X158628377912942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgumbau, Veronicah Mutele12aA New Species of Croton (Euphorbiaceae) from a Madagascan Lineage Discovered in Coastal Kenya  ap. 242-248.  aCroton kinondoensis, a new species from Kenya, is described and illustrated here with photographs.

Macrophages and Th17 cells play important roles in hypertension. However, it remains unclear whether S-MSCs are capable of improving angiotensin (AngII)-induced hypertension by acting on inflammatory cells. Therefore, we studied a direct effect of S-MSC treatment on an AngII-induced hypertensive mouse model. Twenty-seven C57BL/6 (WT) mice were divided into three groups: Control group (WT-NC), AngII-infused group (WT-AngII), and S-MSC treatment group (WT-AngII + S-MSCs). In contrast to WT-AngII group, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and vascular damage were strikingly attenuated after tail-vein injection of S-MSCs. Numbers of Th17 cells in mouse peripheral blood of S-MSC treated group were significantly decreased, and IL-17 mRNA and protein levels were also reduced in the aorta and serum compared with WT-AngII group. Furthermore, macrophages in S-MSC treated group were switched to a regulatory profile characterized by a low ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and a high ability to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines Arg1 and IL-10. Mechanistically, we found that S-MSCs inhibited Th17 cell differentiation and induced M2 polarization. Moreover, we found proliferation and migration of S-MSCs were elevated, and expression of CXCR4, the receptor for Stromal derivated factor −1(SDF-1), was markedly increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- stimulated S-MSCs. Given that SDF-1 expression was increased in the serum and aorta in AngII- induced hypertensive mice, the immunomodulatory effects exerted by S-MSCs involved the CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling. Collectively, our data demonstrated that S-MSCs attenuated AngII-induced hypertension by inhibiting Th17 cell differentiation and by modulating macrophage M2 polarization, suggesting that S-MSCs potentially have a role in stem cell based therapy for hypertension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCXCR4 receptor 3aanimal disease models 3aaorta 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3acaudal vein 3acell differentiation 3aencephalitis 3ahypertension 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-17 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3astem cells 3asystolic blood pressure 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aSkin mesenchymal stem cells (S-MSCs) 0aHypertension 0aTh17 cells 0aMacrophages1 aSun, Weihong1 aXi, Wenda1 aShen, Weili1 aWei, Tong1 aChen, Wendong1 aGao, Pingjin1 aLi, Qun0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Mar. 18, v. 497 p.1068-1075dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009100162300001800253520118100271592002801452650003401480650002201514650001701536650001501553650001101568650001401579650002101593650001101614650002201625650001301647650002401660650001801684650003701702653002801739653004001767653000901807653001101816653003701827700001601864700001301880700001201893700001401905700001601919700001701935700001301952700001901965700001301984700001701997700001402014700001402028700001802042700001302060773013102073856008302204852000902287655001202296IND60615289420221117181340.0181102e20181030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061528942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scib.2018.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Siwei10aFe5C2 nanoparticles as low-cost HER electrocatalyst: the importance of Co substitution  ap. 1358-1363.  aConstructing and understanding the doping effect of secondary metal in transition metal carbide (TMC) catalysts is pivotal for the design of low-cost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. In this work, we developed a wet-chemistry strategy for synthesizing Co-modified Fe5C2 nanoparticles ((Fe1−xCox)5C2 NPs) as highly active HER electrocatalysts in basic solution. The structure of (Fe1−xCox)5C2 NPs was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) and scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), indicating that the isomorphous substitution of cobalt in the lattice of Fe5C2. (Fe0.75Co0.25)5C2 exhibited the best HER activity (174 mV for j = −10 mA/cm²). Computational calculation results indicate that Co provides the most active site for HER. X-ray adsorption spectra (XAS) studies further suggested that the electron transfer in Fe–C bonds are enhanced by the substitution of Co, which modulates the hydrogen adsorption on the adjacent electronic-enriched carbon, and therefore promotes HER activity. Our results affirm the design of low-cost bimetallic TMCs based HER catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acobalt 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ananoparticles 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aWet-chemistry synthesis 0aBimetallic transition metal carbide 0aIron 0aCobalt 0aHydrogenation evolution reaction1 aRen, Pengju1 aYang, Ce1 aLiu, Xi1 aYin, Zhen1 aLi, Weizhen1 aYang, Hanjun1 aLi, Jian1 aWang, Xiaoping1 aWang, Yi1 aCao, Ruochen1 aLin, Lili1 aYao, Siyu1 aWen, Xiaodong1 aMa, Ding0 tScience bulletin.g2018 Oct. 30, v. 63, no. 20 p.1358-1363dElsevier B.V.aScience China PresswJournal:12554x2095-92737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2018.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009700171520168400268592002801952650001501980650001501995650000902010650001302019650001702032650001002049650001002059650001802069650001302087650002202100650000902122650002002131650002402151650001602175650001702191653000902208653002402217653000902241653002602250653002202276653001502298700002202313700002102335700002102356773010302377856008702480852000902567655001202576IND60758451720221117214405.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075845172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1122372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCañadas, Olga10aPulmonary surfactant inactivation by β-D-glucan and protective role of surfactant protein A  aPulmonary fungal infections lead to damage of the endogenous lung surfactant system. However, the molecular mechanism underlying surfactant inhibition is unknown. β-D-glucan is the major component of pathogenic fungal cell walls and is also present in organic dust, which increases the risk of respiratory diseases. The objective of this study was to characterize the interaction of this D-glucopyranose polymer with pulmonary surfactant. Our results show that β-D-glucan induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the surface adsorption, respreading, and surface tension-lowering activity of surfactant preparations containing surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C. Our data support a new mechanism of surfactant inhibition that consists in the extraction of phospholipid molecules from surfactant membranes by β-D-glucan. As a result, surfactant membranes became more fluid, as demonstrated by fluorescence anisotropy, and showed decreased Tₘ and transition enthalpy. Surfactant preparations containing surfactant protein A (SP-A) were more resistant to β-D-glucan inhibition. SP-A bound to different β-D-glucans with high affinity (Kd = 1.5 ± 0.1 nM), preventing and reverting β-D-glucan inhibitory effects on surfactant interfacial adsorption and partially abrogating β-D-glucan inhibitory effects on surfactant’s reduction of surface tension. We conclude that β-D-glucan inhibits the biophysical function of surfactant preparations lacking SP-A by subtraction of phospholipids from surfactant bilayers and monolayers. The increased resistance of SP-A-containing surfactant preparations to β-D-glucan reinforces its use in surfactant replacement therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanisotropy 3adust 3aenthalpy 3afluorescence 3afungi 3alungs 3aphospholipids 3apolymers 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3asurface tension 3asurfactant proteins 3asurfactants 3atherapeutics 0aLung 0aPhosphatidylcholine 0aSP-A 0aSurfactant inhibition 0aMembrane fluidity 0aMonolayers1 aSáenz, Alejandra1 ade Lorenzo, Alba1 aCasals, Cristina0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Feb., v. 210 p.112237-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1122373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009900163300001600262520095800278592002801236650000801264650001501272650002101287650003101308650001701339650002201356650001001378650000901388650001201397650000901409653003101418653001501449653001701464653001501481700001601496700001801512700001701530700001801547700001701565700001801582700001401600773014601614856008301760852000901843655001201852IND60591569820221120111013.0201125e20180325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059156982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wei10aCrystal structure of the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease IV from Mycobacterium tuberculosis  ap. 111-118.  aEndonuclease IV is a typical endonuclease of the apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) or abasic endonuclease superfamily. It repairs damaged DNA through base excision repair by cleaving the DNA backbone immediately 5′ of an AP site. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, endonuclease IV is the major AP endonuclease. This enzyme is absent from mammalian cells, making it an attractive target for anti-tuberculosis drug development. In this study, the structure of the recombinant endonuclease IV from M. tuberculosis (MtbEndo IV) was determined at a high resolution of 1.18 Å. MtbEndo IV was found to have a classical α8β8-fold TIM barrel with loops on its surface connecting the α-helices and β-strands that constitute a groove for DNA binding. Three zinc ions were identified at the active site. A comparison between the structures of MtbEndo IV and Escherichia coli End IV suggested that Gln32 of MtbEndo IV may plays a role in regulating substrate binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA repair 3aEscherichia coli 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aactive sites 3acrystal structure 3adrugs 3aions 3amammals 3azinc 0aMycobacterium tuberculosis 0aDNA repair 0aEndonuclease 0aMtbEndo IV1 aXu, Yueyang1 aYan, Mengrong1 aLi, Shanshan1 aWang, Huiying1 aYang, Haitao1 aZhou, Weihong1 aRao, Zihe0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Mar. 25, v. 498, no. 1 p.111-118dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010000174300002000274520154200294592002801836650002801864650001901892650001601911650001601927650001301943650001401956650001201970650002101982650003102003650001202034650003702046700001902083700003002102700002202132700003202154700002102186773010102207856008602308852000902394655001202403IND60585987320171221000000.0171114e20171114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058598732DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b021422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortier, François,10aStabilization of Collagen Fibrils by Gelatin Addition: A Study of Collagen/Gelatin Dense Phases  ap. 12916-12925.  aCollagen and its denatured form, gelatin, are biopolymers of fundamental interest in numerous fields ranging from living tissues to biomaterials, food, and cosmetics. This study aims at characterizing mixtures of those biopolymers at high concentrations (up to 100 mg·mL–¹) at which collagen has mesogenic properties. We use a structural approach combining polarization-resolved multiphoton microscopy, polarized light microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and transmission electron microscopy to analyze gelatin and collagen/gelatin dense phases in their sol and gel states from the macroscopic to the microscopic scale. We first report the formation of a lyotropic crystal phase of gelatin A and show that gelatin must structure itself in particles to become mesogenic. We demonstrate that mixtures of collagen and gelatin phase segregate, preserving the setting of the pure collagen mesophase at a gelatin ratio of up to 20% and generating a biphasic fractal sample at all tested ratios. Moreover, differential scanning calorimetric analysis shows that each protein separates into two populations. Both populations of gelatins are stabilized by the presence of collagen, whereas only one population of collagen molecules is stabilized by the presence of gelatin, most probably those at the interface of the fibrillated microdomains and of the gelatin phase. Although further studies are needed to fully understand the involved mechanism, these new data should have a direct impact on the bioengineering of those two biopolymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abioengineering 3abiopolymers 3acalorimetry 3acollagen 3acosmetics 3agelatin 3alight microscopy 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3atissues 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTeulon, Claire1 aNowacka-Perrin, Agnieszka1 aGuenneau, Flavien1 aSchanne-Klein, Marie-Claire1 aMosser, Gervaise0 tLangmuir.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 33, no. 45 p.12916-12925dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b021423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245005900163300001800222520155700240592002801797650001101825650002201836650001301858653002001871653003001891653002701921653002501948653003601973653002002009653002602029700001602055700001302071700001902084773013102103856008302234852000902317655001202326IND60615289520221117181334.0181127e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061528952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scib.2018.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lin10aDynamical classification of topological quantum phases  ap. 1385-1391.  aTopological phase of matter is now a mainstream of research in condensed matter physics, of which the classification, synthesis, and detection of topological states have brought excitements over the recent decade while remain incomplete with ongoing challenges in both theory and experiment. Here we propose to establish a universal non-equilibrium characterization of the equilibrium topological quantum phases classified by integers, and further propose the high-precision dynamical schemes to detect such states. The framework of the dynamical classification theory consists of basic theorems. First, we uncover that classifying a d-dimensional (dD) gapped topological phase of generic multibands can reduce to a (d-1)D invariant defined on so-called band inversion surfaces (BISs), rendering a bulk-surface duality which simplifies the topological characterization. Further, we show in quenching across phase boundary the (pseudo) spin dynamics to exhibit unique topological patterns on BISs, which are attributed to the post-quench bulk topology and manifest a dynamical bulk-surface correspondence. For this the topological phase is classified by a dynamical topological invariant measured from an emergent dynamical spin-texture field on the BISs. Applications to quenching experiments on feasible models are proposed and studied, demonstrating the new experimental strategies to detect topological phases with high feasibility. This work opens a broad new direction to classify and detect topological phases by non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics 3atopology 0aQuench dynamics 0aTopological quantum phase 0aBand inversion surface 0aBulk-surface duality 0aDynamical topological invariant 0aUltracold atoms 0aSynthetic gauge field1 aZhang, Long1 aNiu, Sen1 aLiu, Xiong-Jun0 tScience bulletin.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 63, no. 21 p.1385-1391dElsevier B.V.aScience China PresswJournal:12554x2095-92737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2018.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014500178300001600323500001500339520184600354592002802200650002402228650001002252650002602262650002802288650001802316650001902334650001502353650001102368650001302379650001302392650003202405650003802437650001602475650001402491650001802505650002202523650002202545650002302567650002902590650001102619650002002630650001802650650001302668650001002681650005202691650002002743650002602763653002002789653002402809700001702833700002602850700001202876700002202888773010102910856008403011852000903095655001203104IND60087120020221121053632.0141102e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008712002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Valle, Manuel10aDifferential recognition by tick-resistant cattle of the recombinantly expressed Rhipicephalus microplus serine protease inhibitor-3 (RMS-3)  ap. 159-169.  a2019-12-06  aRhipicephalus microplus is an important bovine ectoparasite, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world causing large economic losses to the cattle industry. Its success as an ectoparasite is associated with its capacity to disarm the antihemostatic and anti-inflammatory reactions of the host. Serpins are protease inhibitors with an important role in the modulation of host–parasite interactions. The cDNA that encodes for a R. microplus serpin was isolated by RACE and subsequently cloned into the pPICZαA vector. Sequence analysis of the cDNA and predicted amino acid showed that this cDNA has a conserved serpin domain. B- and T-cell epitopes were predicted using bioinformatics tools. The recombinant R. microplus serpin (rRMS-3) was secreted into the culture media of Pichia pastoris after methanol induction at 0.2mgl⁻¹. qRT-PCR expression analysis of tissues and life cycle stages demonstrated that RMS-3 was mainly expressed in the salivary glands of female adult ticks. Immunological recognition of the rRMS-3 and predicted B-cell epitopes was tested using tick-resistant and susceptible cattle sera. Only sera from tick-resistant bovines recognized the B-cell epitope AHYNPPPPIEFT (Seq7). The recombinant RMS-3 was expressed in P. pastoris, and ELISA screening also showed higher recognition by tick-resistant bovine sera. The results obtained suggest that RMS-3 is highly and specifically secreted into the bite site of R. microplus feeding on tick-resistant bovines. Capillary feeding of semi-engorged ticks with anti-AHYNPPPPIEFT sheep sera led to an 81.16% reduction in the reproduction capacity of R. microplus. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that R. microplus serpin (RMS-3) has an important role in the host–parasite interaction to overcome the immune responses in resistant cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aT-lymphocytes 3abioinformatics 3asubtropics 3aadults 3aepitopes 3aindustry 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aamino acids 3ascreening 3aB-lymphocytes 3asequence analysis 3acomplementary DNA 3aserine proteinases 3areproductive performance 3acattle 3aimmune response 3aculture media 3amethanol 3asheep 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalivary glands 3aproteinase inhibitors 0aPichia pastoris 0aBoophilus microplus1 aVance, Megan1 aMoolhuijzen, Paula M.1 aTao, Xu1 aLew-Tabor, Ala E.0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2012 June, v. 3, no. 3 p.159-169dElsevier GmbHx1877-959X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015100165300001400316520126700330592002801597650002001625650001401645650001001659650001001669650000901679650001501688650000901703650002701712650002101739650000901760653001201769653001401781653001401795653001401809653001201823700006101835700001501896700002001911700005901931773010601990856008202096852000902178655001202187IND60616817720221116160946.0191220e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061681772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vas.2018.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, R.A.10aEffects of blindfolding and tail bending of Egyptian water buffaloes on their behavioural reactivity and physiological responses to pain induction  ap. 38-43.  aThis experiment was carried out to determine the effect of blindfold and tail bend during restraint of Egyptian buffaloes on behavioural reactivity and physiological responses to stressful handling procedures. Twenty-four buffalo bulls, naïve to the testing situation, were arbitrarily assigned to either blindfold (visual restriction) (BF), tail bending (physical control) (TB) or control (CT) (no visual restriction or physical control) treatment during restraint. For three minutes each, during veterinary procedures animals entered the squeeze chute and were subjected to testing trials. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and various behaviours of reactivity were recorded. Average HR and RR decreased in both TB and BF bulls but the reduction was greater in BF bulls. Use of the blindfold and tail bend decreased behavioural indicators of reactivity including: chest chute forcing, head move, kicking and struggling. The reduction was greater in BF bulls in the case of use of the chest chute and struggling. Both tail bend and blindfolded buffaloes decreased behavioural and physiological indicators of stress but BF appeared more beneficial, and may therefore be recommended to reduce stress accompanying routine veterinary examination of buffaloes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3abuffaloes 3abulls 3achest 3ahead 3aheart rate 3apain 3aphysiological response 3arespiratory rate 3atail 0aBuffalo 0aBlindfold 0aTail bend 0aRestraint 0aWelfare1 aAbou-Ismail, U.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7616-81551 aShukry, M.1 aElmoslemany, A.1 aAbdel-Maged, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9570-90680 tVeterinary and Animal Science.g2018 June, v. 5 p.38-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:23501x2451-943X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vas.2018.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245011700166520142300283592002801706650002401734650002801758650002201786650002701808650002501835650002101860650002101881650001501902650002301917650003601940650001301976650001701989650001602006650001702022650001202039650001602051650001302067650003902080650001602119650001502135653001402150653001402164700001702178700001502195700001202210773010302222856008702325852000902412655001202421IND60758451820221117214409.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075845182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1122382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xue10aTypical structure, biocompatibility, and cell proliferation bioactivity of collagen from Tilapia and Pacific cod  aAquatic collagens, as the alternative sources of mammalian collagen, have received increasing attention due to its low-cost, low-antigenicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Pepsin-soluble collagens were extracted from the skins of Oreochromis mossambicus (Om-PSC) and Gadus macrocephalus (Gm-PSC), and their structural properties and bioactivities were probed to reveal their potential applications in biomedical material for tissue engineering. The results of Fourier transforms-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), circular dichroism (CD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet (UV) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated that Om-PSC and Gm-PSC had similar and intact triple helical structures. The amino acid composition and peptide profiles revealed Om-PSC and Gm-PSC were identified as type I collagen with the typical repetitive sequence of (Gly-X-Y) ₙ. However, the denaturation temperature (Td) was determined to be 29.7 ℃ of Om-PSC, much higher than that of Gm-PSC (17.3 ℃). Toxicological experiments demonstrated Om-PSC and Gm-PSC both had good biocompatibility and cytocompatibility, which met the requirements of medical materials. Fluorescence imaging and cell cycle distribution revealed Om-PSC and Gm-PSC could promote the proliferation of fibroblast and osteoblast cells. Therefore, Om-PSC and Gm-PSC showed the advantages in medical materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGadus macrocephalus 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamino acid composition 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acollagen 3adenaturation 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3amammals 3aosteoblasts 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3atemperature 3atoxicology 0aStructure 0aFish skin1 aLi, Zhaoxuan1 aLi, Yanyan1 aHou, Hu0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Feb., v. 210 p.112238-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.1122383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245005100176300001600227520117000243592002801413650001801441650002001459650001701479650002401496650002501520650001401545650001901559650001601578650002501594653001301619653001101632653003101643700001701674700001901691700002101710773013301731856008801864852000901952655001201961IND60695996720221122051444.0200521e20200513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069599672DNAL7 a10.1600/036364420X158628377913112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpooner, David M.10aMitochondrial DNA Sequence Phylogeny of Daucus  ap. 403-408.  aWe explored the phylogenetic utility of mitochondrial DNA sequences in Daucus and compared the results with prior phylogenetic results using the same 36 accessions of Daucus (and two additional outgroups) with plastid DNA sequences and with other nuclear results. As in the plastid study we used Illumina HiSeq sequencer to obtain resequencing data of the same accessions of Daucus and outgroups, and analyzed the data with maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. We obtained data from 47 of 71 total mitochondrial genes but only 17 of these 47 genes recovered major clades that were common in prior plastid and nuclear studies. Our phylogenetic trees of the concatenated data set of 47 genes were moderately resolved, with 100% bootstrap support for most of the external and many of the internal clades, except for the clade of D. carota and its most closely related species D. syrticus. There are areas of hard incongruence with phylogenies using plastid and nuclear data. In agreement with other studies, we conclude that mitochondrial sequences are generally poor phylogenetic markers, at least at the genus level, despite their utility in some other studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3adata collection 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 3aplastid DNA 3astatistical analysis 0aApiaceae 0acarrot 0anext generation sequencing1 aRuess, Holly1 aSimon, Philipp1 aSenalik, Douglas0 tSystematic botany.g2020 May 13, v. 45, no. 2 p.403-408dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1600/036364420X158628377913113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014000166500002200306520131100328592002801639650001101667650000801678650002001686650001501706650001001721650001701731650000901748650001601757650001701773650002101790650004301811653002001854653001401874653000801888653002301896653000801919700006401927700001901991773008902010856008302099852000902182655001202191IND60543548720221121052733.0190411e20141006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054354872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaner, Trevor10aEvaluation of a commercial in-clinic point-of-care polymerase chain reaction test for Ehrlichia canis DNA in artificially infected dogs  aPre-press version  aA novel in-clinic point-of-care (ICPOC) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was evaluated for its ability to detect Ehrlichia canis DNA in artificially infected dogs compared to a real-time PCR assay. Six Beagle dogs negative for E. canis antibodies and PCR negative were artificially infected with an Israeli E. canis strain (611). All dogs developed IgG antibodies 8 days post infection (PI), and clinical and hematological abnormalities on day 10 PI.Only the real-time PCR detected E. canis DNA in the blood of five dogs at days 3 and 5 PI. At day 12 PI during the acute phase of the disease, 1 day after the initiation of doxycycline treatment, the ICPOC PCR assay detected E. canis DNA in all infected dogs, which were also positive by the real-time PCR. Two days later the ICPOC PCR assay was able to detect only 3/6 infected dogs, which were all positive by the real-time PCR. At days 17 and 19 PI, the ICPOC PCR assay did not detect E. canis DNA in the dogs while the real-time PCR detected all dogs as positive on day 17 PI and two dogs on day 19 PI. In conclusion, the sensitivity of the ICPOC PCR assay was 75% for the acute phase of the disease and 30% for the whole study, suggesting that this ICPOC assay has a potential utility for the diagnosis of acute canine monocytic ehrlichiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeagle 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia canis 3aantibodies 3ablood 3adog diseases 3adogs 3adoxycycline 3aehrlichiosis 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aEhrlichia canis 0aDiagnosis 0aPCR 0aPoint-of-care test 0aDog1 aNachum-Biala, Yaarit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7336-46981 aHarrus, Shimon0 tveterinary journal.g2014 Oct. 06, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2014.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245014100176300001800317520104600335592002801381650002101409650002501430650002001455650002301475650002201498650003101520650001001551650002401561650001601585650001101601650001501612650002001627650001701647650002301664650002201687650002601709650001701735650002701752653002601779653001701805653001601822653002001838653002201858700002001880773014101900856008202041852000902123655001202132IND60591569920221120110957.0180320e20180318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059156992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Sanghati Roy10aCrystal structure of heat shock protein 15 (Hsp15) from Vibrio cholerae: Novel mode of trimerization and nucleic acid binding properties  ap. 1076-1081.  aVibrio cholerae, experiences a highly hostile environment at human intestine which trigger the induction of various heat shock genes. VcHsp15, the hslR gene product of V. cholerae O395 is a highly up regulated protein which targets erroneously dislodged 50S subunit upon heat shock that carries a tRNA attached to the abortive nascent polypeptide chain, and recycle it for another round of translation. In this study we report the crystal structure of VcHsp15 at 2.33 Å. Although the structure of VcHsp15 share very similar fold to E. Coli Hsp15 their oligomerization properties are quite different. While EcHsp15 is a monomer, VcHsp15 exhibit a novel trimeric form both in crystal structure and in solution. The putative αL motif of VcHsp15 shares a strikingly similar fold with several RNA binding proteins like ribosomal protein S4 and threonyl-tRNA synthetase. Curiously, their αL motif display a comparable surface charge, albeit extremely low sequence identity, indicating that this motif serves as a basic module to bind RNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aVibrio cholerae 3abinding properties 3acrystal structure 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3ahumans 3aintestines 3aoligomerization 3apolypeptides 3aribosomal proteins 3asequence analysis 3athreonine-tRNA ligase 3atransfer RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 0aHeat shock protein 15 0a50S ribosome 0aTranslation 0aDNA/RNA binding 0aCrystal structure1 aSen, Udayaditya0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Mar. 18, v. 497 p.1076-1081dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.02.1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02036naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011600165300002000281520095500301592002801256650001501284650001101299650001201310650002301322700002301345700002201368700002001390700002101410700002301431700002301454773013001477856008201607852000901689655001201698IND60580258620221120165017.0170914e20170914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058025862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b079532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaima, Tetsuya10aSexithiophene-Based Photovoltaic Cells with High Light Absorption Coefficient via Crystalline Polymorph Control  ap. 19699-19704.  aHerein, we report an efficient approach to control the crystalline polymorph of evaporated α-sexithiophene (6T) thin films by keeping them overnight (12 h) under vacuum. Further, we investigated the effects on the performance of organic photovoltaic devices of controlling the 6T polymorph via this vacuum technique so that the films take on the low-temperature (LT) polymorph (in which the backbones of the 6T molecules lie flatter on the substratethe so-called “lying-down” orientation). Our results revealed that when the organic layer was deposited directly onto a copper(I) iodide interlayer, the angle between the organic backbone and the substrate was reduced in the LT polymorph compared with the high-temperature (HT) polymorph. The power conversion efficiency of solar cells could thus be enhanced from 0.58 to 1.77% via a change in the crystal polymorph of the 6T layer from HT to LT by simply keeping the films in vacuum for 12 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acopper 3aiodides 3aphotovoltaic cells1 aShahiduzzaman, Md.1 aIshizeki, Takaaki1 aYamamoto, Kohei1 aKarakawa, Makoto1 aKuwabara, Takayuki1 aTakahashi, Kohshin0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Sept. 14, v. 121, no. 36 p.19699-19704dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.7b079533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006600146245004400212300002000256520077400276592002801050650001701078650001301095650002301108700002201131700002501153700006301178700002301241700006301264773013901327856008001466852000901546655001201555IND60671585120221122100531.0191003e20190904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067158512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b081942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedorets, Alexander A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6595-392710aOscillatory Motion of a Droplet Cluster  ap. 23572-23576.  aHorizontal oscillations of small droplet clusters (from one to four droplets) levitating over a locally heated water layer in upward vapor–air flow are investigated experimentally.

The path of the center of the droplet cluster is similar to a random walk in a potential well. The vibrational spectra of clusters’ centers obtained by Fourier analysis showed several frequency peaks between f = 1.61 and 5.96 Hz found in all clusters, which shows that the cluster tends to oscillate as a whole. The possibility of decoupling of the aerodynamic interaction between the gas flow and the droplets and the interaction between individual droplets is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerodynamics 3adroplets 3aphysical chemistry1 aAktaev, Nurken E.1 aGabyshev, Dmitrii N.1 aBormashenko, Edward1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1356-24861 aDombrovsky, L.

R.10aInhibition of Tetrahydrofuran Hydrate Formation in the Presence of Polyol-Modified Glass Surfaces  ap. 7816-7823.  aGlycerol was conjugated to glass test tube surfaces in four configurations by employing two different silane spacers, covalent attachment to glycerol at either the 1- or the 2-position, and with a succinic acid spacer. The resulting surfaces were tested for their ability to inhibit the nucleation of tetrahydrofuran hydrate (THF hydrate) in comparison with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a known polymeric inhibitor of THF hydrate formation. Contact angle measurements were used as an indication of surface modification throughout the glass derivatization steps. Of the four final surfaces modified with glycerol, only the coating with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and glycerol coupled at the 1-position (leaving a free 1,2-diol) showed significant inhibition of the formation of THF hydrate. The corresponding N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine (AEAPTMS) coating with glycerol coupled at the 1-position did not show a significant difference over the untreated test tubes. Attachment of glycerol at the 2-position yielded a coating with no benefit over the untreated test tubes regardless of the silane used, and a surface modified with APTES and succinic acid alone enhanced the formation of THF hydrate. The ability to inhibit THF hydrate formation using a polyol-modified surface is a first step in the development of a coating that, alone or in combination with known gas hydrate inhibitors, could be used to prevent gas hydrates from plugging pipelines in field applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aderivatization 3agas hydrate 3aglass 3aglycerol 3apipelines 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3asilane 3asuccinic acid 3atetrahydrofuran1 aBaures, Paul W.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Aug. 17, v. 31, no. 8 p.7816-7823dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b006663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015300155300001800308500001900326520137000345592002801715650001501743650001901758650002401777650002201801650002001823650000901843650002401852650001001876650001901886650001901905650001901924650001501943700001801958700001701976700001601993773012302009856007402132852000902206655001202215IND60731011520221123044946.0210315e20210305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073101152DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra00729g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Teng10aOne-step hydrothermal synthesis of a ternary heterojunction g-C₃N₄/Bi₂S₃/In₂S₃ photocatalyst and its enhanced photocatalytic performance  ap. 9788-9796.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, photoelectrocatalysis has been one of the hotspots of research. Graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) is one of the few non-metal semiconductors known and has good potential in the field of photocatalysis due to its simple preparation method and visible light effects. In this study, a method for compounding two semiconductor materials, In₂S₃ and Bi₂S₃, on the surface of g-C₃N₄via a one-step hydrothermal method is reported, and it was found that this resulting material showed remarkable properties. The advantages of this method are as follows: (1) the formation of a heterojunction, which accelerates the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers; (2) a large number of holes and defects on the surface of g-C₃N₄ are conducive to the nucleation, crystallisation and growth of In₂S₃ and Bi₂S₃. Compared with its counterpart catalysts, the CN/In₂S₃/Bi₂S₃ composite catalyst has significantly improved performance. Due to its high degree of crystallinity, the adsorption capacity of the catalyst itself is also significantly improved. In addition, the stability of the composite material maintains 90.9% after four cycles of use, and the structure is not damaged. In summary, CN/Bi₂S₃/In₂S₃ composite materials are believed to have broad application potential in the treatment of dye wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nitride 3acomposite materials 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adyes 3ahot water treatment 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3awastewater1 aZhu, Xiaofeng1 aHuang, Yufan1 aWang, Zijun0 tRSC advances.g2021 Mar. 05, v. 11, no. 17 p.9788-9796dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra00729g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013700173300001800310520198900328592002802317650003102345650002202376650002402398650001402422650001502436650001302451650003802464650002102502650002102523650002102544650002802565650001202593650001902605650002502624650003002649650003502679650001302714653002602727653004002753653001702793653003002810653001302840653002202853653003302875653002502908653001002933653000802943653000802951653001202959653000802971653000702979653000702986700002102993700002403014700001603038700002303054700001903077773009903096856008603195852000903281655001203290IND60535084320221118055208.0190319e20150731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053508432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Shirene M.10aSystemic immune responses to an inactivated, whole H9N2 avian influenza virus vaccine using class B CpG oligonucleotides in chickens  ap. 3947-3952.  aCommercial vaccines against avian influenza viruses (AIV) in chickens consist mainly of inactivated AIV, requiring parenteral administration and co-delivery of an adjuvant. Limitations in T helper 1 or T helper 2 biased responses generated by these vaccines emphasize the need for alternative, more efficacious adjuvants. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) 21 ligand, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), has been established as immunomodulatory in chickens. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the adjuvant potential of high (20μg) and low (2μg) doses of CpG ODN 2007 (CpG 2007) and CpG ODN 1826 (CpG 1826) when administered to chickens with a formalin-inactivated H9N2 AIV. Antibody responses in sera were evaluated in 90 specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens after intramuscular administration of vaccine formulations at 7 and 21 days post-hatch. Antibody responses were assessed based on haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) assays; virus-specific IgM and IgY antibody responses were evaluated by ELISA. The results suggest that the vaccine formulation containing low dose CpG 2007 was significantly more effective at generating neutralizing (both HI and VN) responses than formulations with high or low doses of CpG 1826 or high dose CpG 2007. Neutralizing responses elicited by low dose CpG 2007 significantly exceeded those generated by a squalene-based adjuvanted vaccine formulation during peak responses. A significantly higher IgM response was elicited by the formulation containing low dose CpG 2007 compared to high and low doses of 1826. Although the low dose of CpG 2007 elicited a higher IgY response than CpG 1826, the difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, 2μg of CpG 2007 is potentially promising as a vaccine adjuvant when delivered intramuscularly with inactivated H9N2 virus to chickens. Future studies may be directed at determining the mucosal antibody responses to the same vaccine formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aInfluenza A virus 3aToll-like receptors 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3achickens 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahemagglutination 3aimmunoglobulin M 3aimmunoglobulin Y 3aintramuscular injection 3aligands 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3avaccines 0aToll-like receptor 21 0aLow pathogenic avian influenzavirus 0aH9N2 subtype 0aCpG oligodeoxynucleotides 0aChickens 0aAntibody response 0aHaemagglutination inhibition 0aVirus neutralization 0aELISA 0aTLR 0aODN 0aCpG ODN 0aAIV 0aHI 0aVN1 aAlkie, Tamiru N.1 aHodgins, Douglas C.1 aNagy, Éva,1 aShojadoost, Bahram1 aSharif, Shayan0 tVaccine.g2015 July 31, v. 33, no. 32 p.3947-3952dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03634naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005100148245014600199300002000345520199900365592002802364596009502392596005902487596005902546650000802605650001502613650001302628650002502641650001102666650001702677650000902694650001602703650001702719650001202736650002402748650001302772650001102785650001102796650001102807650001602818650001102834651001002845700002002855700001802875773015502893856008303048852000903131655001203140IND60786945420221121050812.0220827e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078694542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19706-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Jia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5804-655X10aMigration and diffusion characteristics of air pollutants and meteorological influences in Northwest China: a case study of four mining areas  ap. 55003-55025.  aIn the process of exploiting mineral resources, dust enters the environment through air suspended particles and surface runoff, which has a serious impact on the atmospheric environment and human health. From all-year and seasonal scenarios, the migration trajectories and cumulative concentration based on the secondary development of Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) in four mining areas (SF, BC, SJZ, and MJT) in Northwest China are studied. The convergent cross mapping (CCM) method is used to study the causal relationship between concentration and meteorological factors. In this process, the problem of missing non-station meteorological data is solved with the help of the inverse distance weighted interpolation method, and the problem in which the convergence requirements of the CCM algorithm cannot meet the requirements is solved with the bootstrap method. The results indicated that the short path has the characteristics of slow movement, short migration path, low altitude(< 1 km), and high contribution rate, while the long path has the opposite characteristics. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the concentration is centered on the pollution source and diffuses around, with a diffusion radius of 220–270 km, showing a serious pollution center and slight gradient settlement on the edge, but the overall distribution of accumulated concentration is uneven. The results also show that temperature (TEMP and S_TEMP), evaporation, and air pressure are the main meteorological factors affecting the all-year concentration. The concentration and meteorological factors in the four mining areas also show significant seasonal characteristics, and the correlation in spring, summer, and autumn is stronger than that in winter. This study not only provides a reference for the green and sustainable exploitation of mineral resources but also provides theoretical support for the joint prevention and control of transboundary pollution.  aPublisher supplied data  a21YJCZH138cHumanity and Social Science Youth foundation of Ministry of Education of China  a71874134cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020M683433cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3aair 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3aatmospheric pressure 3aautumn 3acase studies 3adust 3aevaporation 3ahuman health 3ahybrids 3ameteorological data 3aresearch 3arunoff 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aChina1 aHuang, Guangqiu1 aZhang, Zhixia0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 36 p.55003-55025dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19706-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245012400211300001600335506007600351520143000427592002801857506003701885650000901922650001401931650001201945650001301957650001201970650001501982650002501997650002502022650001202047650002202059650003602081650001102117650000902128650005102137650003502188650002602223650003702249700002102286700002002307700001702327773011002344856004802454852000902502655001202511IND50060077320221207114059.0130220e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006007732DNAL7 a230698822pmid7 aPMC34960792pmcid7 a10.1007/s00359-012-0760-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVélez, Alejandro,10aDip listening or modulation masking? Call recognition by green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) in temporally fluctuating noise  ap. 891-904.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite the importance of perceptually separating signals from background noise, we still know little about how nonhuman animals solve this problem. Dip listening, an ability to catch meaningful ‘acoustic glimpses’ of a target signal when fluctuating background noise levels momentarily drop, constitutes one possible solution. Amplitude-modulated noises, however, can sometimes impair signal recognition through a process known as modulation masking. We asked whether fluctuating noise simulating a breeding chorus affects the ability of female green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) to recognize male advertisement calls. Our analysis of recordings of the sounds of green treefrog choruses reveal that their levels fluctuate primarily at rates below 10 Hz. In laboratory phonotaxis tests, we found no evidence for dip listening or modulation masking. Mean signal recognition thresholds in the presence of fluctuating chorus-like noises were never statistically different from those in the presence of a non-fluctuating control. An analysis of statistical effects sizes indicates that masker fluctuation rates, and the presence versus absence of fluctuations, had negligible effects on subject behavior. Together, our results suggest that females listening in natural settings should receive no benefits, nor experience any additional constraints, as a result of level fluctuations in the soundscape of green treefrog choruses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHyla 3aacoustics 3aanimals 3abreeding 3afemales 3aphonotaxis 3astatistical analysis 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimals 2aAnuraxphysiology 2aAuditory Perceptionxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPattern Recognition, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aPerceptual Maskingxphysiology 2aSignal-To-Noise Ratio 2aVocalization, Animalxphysiology1 aHöbel, Gerlinde1 aGordon, Noah M.1 aBee, Mark A.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2012 Dec., v. 198, no. 12 p.891-904dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-012-0760-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011200170300001800282520196100300592002802261650001502289650001302304650002302317650001802340650002002358650001302378650002202391700001702413773010402430856008602534852000902620655001202629IND60578321320221119174728.0170812e20170214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057832132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b019362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Tsung-Yeh10aAnisotropic Three-Particle Interactions between Spherical Polymer-Grafted Nanoparticles in a Polymer Matrix  ap. 1167-1183.  aSpherical nanoparticles (NPs) uniformly grafted with polymer chains have recently been shown to assemble into anisotropic phases like strings and sheets. Here we investigated the underlying basis for anisotropic interactions between polymer-grafted NPs in a polymer matrix by computing via molecular dynamics simulations the potential of mean force (PMF), and its three-body contribution, for a test NP interacting with a NP-dimer along a set of reaction coordinates differing in their orientation with respect to the dimer axis. The polymer-mediated portions of the PMF and of the three-body contribution were both found to be highly repulsive and anisotropic with the degree of repulsion rising with increasing angular deviation from the dimer axis. The anisotropy was shown to arise from the expulsion of polymer grafts from in between the dimer NPs which leads to a gradient in the graft segmental density around the dimer from its contact point to its poles. This effect produces a concomitant gradient in steric repulsion between test and dimer NP grafts, a significant portion of which is however negated by an opposing gradient in depletion attraction between NPs due to the matrix. The anisotropy in the polymer-mediated PMF was observed to be particularly strong for NP–polymer systems with long grafts, high grafting densities, and short matrix chains. The overall PMFs allowed us to compute the free energies of formation of two- and three-particle clusters, yielding a phase diagram in graft length–grafting density parameter space analogous to that observed experimentally for the dispersed, stringlike, and sheetlike phases of NPs. The PMFs also revealed possible existence of a stable dimer phase that remains to be tested experimentally. Taken together, this study illustrates how the deformability of NP grafts can introduce novel anisotropic interactions between otherwise isotropic NPs with far-reaching consequences in NP assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aisotropy 3amolecular dynamics 3ananoparticles 3aphysical phases 3apolymers 3asimulation models1 aArya, Gaurav0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Feb. 14, v. 50, no. 3 p.1167-1183dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b019363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245017200164300002000336500001900356520124000375592002801615650002401643650002101667650001301688650002201701650001701723650003901740650003701779700001401816700002301830700002501853700002101878773012501899856007402024852000902098655001202107IND60731011820221123032739.0210315e20210310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073101182DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra00762a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudra Paul, Abhijit10a7-Alkoxy-appended coumarin derivatives: synthesis, photo-physical properties, aggregation behaviours and current–voltage (I–V) characteristic studies on thin films  ap. 10212-10223.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we designed and synthesised a series of coumarin derivatives appended with a long alkoxy chain on the seventh position of the coumarin-3-carboxylate/carboxylic acid core to make thin film materials. Synthesised compounds were characterized by their UV and fluorescence spectra in solutions as well as their films prepared by both LB and spin-coated methods. The surface morphology and electrical behaviour of thin films were judged by AFM, SEM and I–V characteristic mapping respectively. Isotherm, UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic investigations revealed the formation of aggregates on thin films. The result of SEM and AFM images provides the information about the length and height of aggregates on the thin films of coumarin derivatives. From I–V characteristics, it was found that at room temperature, the spin-coated films of coumarin derivatives containing an ester functional group exhibited a threshold switching behaviour, whereas derivatives containing the carboxylic acid functional group showed both threshold and bipolar switching behaviours. We also noticed that the I–V characteristic features of synthesized materials depended on the length of the alkyl chain of individual series.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acarboxylic acids 3acoumarin 3afilms (materials) 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aDey, Bapi1 aSuklabaidya, Sudip1 aHussain, Syed Arshad1 aMajumdar, Swapan0 tRSC advances.g2021 Mar. 10, v. 11, no. 17 p.10212-10223dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra00762a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04365naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002800189245006800217300001800285506007600303520204600379592002802425506003702453650002102490650001502511650001802526650001902544650001602563650001202579650003702591650002502628650002302653650001202676650001002688650002302698650001002721650002302731650001502754650000902769650003002778650001102808650002902819650002402848650002402872650001602896650002302912650001302935650001902948650001602967653000902983653001802992653002803010653003203038700001803070700002103088700002703109700005803136700001603194700001303210700002103223700002303244700002403267700005703291700005503348773011203403856008303515852000903598655001203607IND60614450920221207091041.0200819e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061445092DNAL7 a302243052pmid7 aPMC64651712pmcid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2018.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnez-Bustillos, Lorenzo10aEffects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids on bones of healthy mice  ap. 2145-2154.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAltering the lipid component in diets may affect the incidence of metabolic bone disease in patients dependent on parenteral nutrition. Consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can impact bone health by modulating calcium metabolism, prostaglandin synthesis, lipid oxidation, osteoblast formation, and osteoclastogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary effects of PUFA on murine bone health.Three-weeks-old male (n = 30) and female (n = 30) C57BL/6J mice were randomized into one of three dietary groups. The diets differed only in fat composition: soybean oil (SOY), rich in ω-6 PUFA; docosahexaenoic acid alone (DHA), an ω-3 PUFA; and DHA with arachidonic acid, an ω-6 PUFA, at a 20:1 ratio (DHA/ARA). After 9 weeks of dietary treatment, femurs were harvested for micro-computed tomographic analysis and mechanical testing via 3-point bending. Separate mice from each group were used solely for serial blood draws for measurement of biomarkers of bone formation and resorption.At the microstructural level, although some parameters in cortical bone reached differences that were statistically significant in female mice, these were too small to be considered biologically relevant. Similarly, trabecular bone parameters in male mice were statistically different in some dietary groups, although the biological interpretation of such subtle changes translate into a lack of effect in favor of any of the experimental diets. No differences were noted at the mechanical level and in blood-based biomarkers of bone metabolism across dietary groups within gender.Subtle differences were noted at the bones' microstructural level, however these are likely the result of random effects that do not translate into changes that are biologically relevant. Similarly, differences were not seen at the mechanical level, nor were they reflected in blood-based biomarkers of bone metabolism. Altogether, dietary consumption of PUFA do not seem to affect bone structure or metabolism in a healthy model of growing mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarachidonic acid 3abiomarkers 3abone diseases 3abone formation 3abone health 3acalcium 3adevelopmental orthopedic disease 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aexperimental diets 3afemales 3afemur 3alipid peroxidation 3amales 3amechanical testing 3ametabolism 3amice 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3anutritional intervention 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aosteoblasts 3aparenteral feeding 3apatients 3aprostaglandins 3asoybean oil 0aBone 0aBone strength 0aBone micro-architecture 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aCowan, Eileen1 aCubria, Maria B.1 aVilla-Camacho, Juan C.1 aMohamadi, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0958-00911 aDao, Duy T.1 aPan, Amy1 aFell, Gillian L.1 aBaker, Meredith A.1 aNandivada, Prathima1 aNazarian, Ara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3992-34891 aPuder, Mark1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7941-29260 tClinical nutrition.g2019 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.2145-2154dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245041900169300001600588520107100604592002801675650004401703650002301747650001101770650001201781650001601793650002201809650001401831650001401845650001301859650004401872650001301916650002101929650001001950650001401960653004701974653001402021653001302035653000802048653002202056700002602078700002002104700001502124700001602139773013702155856007702292852000902369655001202378IND60522392920221122055710.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052239292DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2011-04072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Ernst-Christian10aMetal-Fluorocarbon Pyrolants.

Compounds 1 - 3, which form hydrates, were characterized by elemental analyses, differential heat flow calorimetry, multinuclear NMR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. A crystal structure determination was carried out on the solvate 2 ·2H₂O·4CH₃OH. Compounds 1 - 3 were tested as oxidizers in ternary pyrolant mixtures with magnesium and Vitonᵀᴹ. The burn rates, u (g s−1), of the pyrolants based on 1 show a distinct influence of the exothermicity of the primary reaction, whereas the burn rates of 2- and 3-based pyrolants do not show such behavior but display a steady increase of burn rate with increasing Mg content. At stoichiometries below 40 wt.-% Mg, the specific intensity Eλ (J g⁻¹ sr⁻¹) of the pyrolants based on 2 and 3 is superior to that of the standard mixture magnesium/polytetrafluoroethylene/Vitonᵀᴹ (MTV). This is assumed to be due to the expansion of the flame envelope by nitrogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aazoles 3acalcium 3acalorimetry 3acrystal structure 3aheat flow 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidants 3aperfluorocarbons 3asalts 3asynthesis 0aCalcium-bis(5H-perfluoroalkyltetrazolates) 0aMagnesium 0aPyrolant 0aNMR 0aCrystal Structure1 aKlapötke, Thomas M.,1 aRadies, Hendrik1 aLux, Karin1 aHahma, Arno0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 66, no. 4 p.378-386dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-2011-04073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009600183300001600279520137400295592002801669650003201697650002601729650001601755650002501771650001801796650001601814650002101830650001301851650001901864650002401883650001001907650003701917650001501954650001001969650001101979650001401990650001602004650001702020650002202037650002402059650008302083650006702166650001802233650002802251650001402279650008002293650002302373650002402396650003502420650005302455700001802508700001902526700002002545773009502565856004802660852000902708655001202717IND4473713620221123041657.0121003e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447371362DNAL7 a223273892pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-012-1244-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ying-Rong10aCharacterization of a new phage, termed ϕA318, which is specific for Vibrio alginolyticus   ap. 917-926.  aVibrio alginolyticus is an opportunistic pathogen of animals and humans; its related strains can also produce tetrodotoxin and hemolysins. A new phage, ϕA318, which lysed its host V. alginolyticus with high efficiency, was characterized. The burst size of ϕA318 in V. alginolyticus was 72 PFU/bacterium at an MOI of 1 at room temperature; the plaque size was as large as 5 mm in diameter. Electron microscopy (EM) of the phage particles revealed a 50- to 55-nm isomorphous icosahedral head with a 12-nm non-contractile tail, similar to the T7-like phages of the family Podoviridae. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete sequences of the DNA-directed RNA polymerase gene revealed that ϕA318 had 28-47% amino acid identity to enterobacteria phages T7 and SP6, and other Vibrio phages, and the phylogenetic distance suggested that ϕA318 could be classified as a new T7-like bacteriophage. Nevertheless, several motifs in the ϕA318 phage RNA polymerase were highly conserved, including DFRGR (T7-421 motif), DG (T7-537 motif), PSEKPQDIYGAVS (T7-563 motif), RSMTKKPVMTL PYGS (T7-627 motif), and HDS (T7-811 motif). Genetic analysis indicated that phage ϕA318 is not a thermostable direct hemolysin producer. The results suggest that the MOI should be higher than 0.1 to prevent the chance of hemolysin production by the bacteria before they are lysed by the phage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEnterobacteria phages 3aPodoviridae 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aVibrio phages 3aamino acids 3aanimal pathogens 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3aelectron microscopy 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahemolysins 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3atemperature 3atetrodotoxin 3athermal stability 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacteriophagesxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenome, Viral 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPodoviridaexchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVibrio alginolyticusxvirology 2aViral Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aChiu, Chi-Wen1 aChang, Feng-Yi1 aLin, Chan-Shing0 tArchives of virology.g2012 May, v. 157, no. 5 p.917-926dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1244-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012900164300001600293520128700309592002801596650001501624650002201639650002401661650001301685650001301698650002201711650002501733650001501758650001001773650001501783650001101798650002601809650001301835650001101848650001901859650001401878650001501892650001101907653002201918653002901940653001001969653002201979653002202001700001502023700005602038700001502094700001502109700001802124773011402142856008602256852000902342655001202351IND60619627420221119004221.0210114e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061962742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Chao10aSimultaneous electro-oxidation and in situ electro-peroxone process for the degradation of refractory organics in wastewater  ap. 468-474.  aDuring electro-oxidation (EO) wastewater treatment, the applied voltage must polarize both a dimensionally stable anode with a sufficiently high potential to effectively produce hydroxyl radicals (OH), as well as a cathode with a sufficiently low potential to catalyze the H₂ evolution reaction (HER). Nevertheless, H₂ does not contribute to pollutant degradation and yet increases energy consumption. Inspired by fuel cell technology, in which the O₂ reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed on the cathode, herein, a carbon nanotube-coated carbon-PTFE gas diffusion electrode was fabricated to catalyze ORR during EO for the treatment of leachate concentrates. In comparison to conventional HER-EO, ORR-EO was shown to save 17.7–23.2% energy consumption. Further, as the cathodic ORR byproduct, H₂O₂ can react with the ozone generated from the Ti/SnO₂-Sb₂O₅ anode to catalyze the peroxone process, which enhances OH generation for the degradation of organic products. This in situ electro-peroxone process was determined by salicylic acid OH trapping and liquid chromatography. The novel simultaneous EO and in situ electro-peroxone process described herein has great application potential and economic merit in the degradation of refractory organics in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3afuel cells 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydrogen production 3acathodes 3atrapping 3ahydrogen peroxide 3awastewater treatment 3abyproducts 3aozone 3apollutants 3acarbon 3aliquid chromatography 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3asalicylic acid 3aleachates 3awastewater 3aanodes 0aElectro-oxidation 0ain situ electro-peroxone 0aOzone 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aHydroxyl radicals1 aLu, Shanfu1 aLiang, Dawei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4645-373X1 aChen, Sian1 aXiang, Yan1 aZhang, Shujun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 364 p.468-474dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012600155300001800281520141000299592002801709650004101737650001401778650001201792650001901804650001301823650001101836650001101847650001701858650002401875650001501899650001101914651001201925700001701937700001801954700001701972773009301989856007302082852000902155655001202164IND60082180620221118230154.0141017e20141030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008218062DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.100572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruoyu10aIndividual and combined effects of land use/cover and climate change on Wolf Bay watershed streamflow in southern Alabama  ap. 5530-5546.  aLand use/cover (LULC) and climate change are two main factors affecting watershed hydrology. In this paper, individual and combined impacts of LULC and climate change on hydrologic processes were analysed applying the model Soil and Water Assessment Tool in a coastal Alabama watershed in USA. Temporally and spatially downscaled Global Circulation Model outputs predict a slight increase in precipitation in the study area, which is also projected to experience substantial urban growth in the future. Changes in flow frequency and volume in the 2030s (2016–2040) compared to a baseline period (1984–2008) at daily, monthly and annual time scales were explored. A redistribution of daily streamflow is projected when either climate or LULC change was considered. High flows are predicted to increase, while low flows are expected to decrease. Combined change effect results in a more noticeable and uneven distribution of daily streamflow. Monthly average streamflow and surface runoff are projected to increase in spring and winter, but especially in fall. LULC change does not have a significant effect on monthly average streamflow, but the change affects partitioning of streamflow, causing higher surface runoff and lower baseflow. The combined effect leads to a dramatic increase in monthly average streamflow with a stronger increasing trend in surface runoff and decreasing trend in baseflow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abase flow 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aland use 3arunoff 3aspring 3aurbanization 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aAlabama1 aKalin, Latif1 aKuang, Wenhui1 aTian, Hanqin0 tHydrological processes.g2014 Oct. 30, v. 28, no. 22 p.5530-5546dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.100573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011300157300002000270520143100290592002801721650001401749650001301763650003401776650001801810650001801828650001301846650001501859650001601874650001301890650001501903700001601918700001701934773012401951856007402075852000902149655001202158IND60667308920221119001950.0190919e20150302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066730892DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra00462d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Licheng10aFormation of cathode buffer layer by surface segregation of fluoroalkyl-modified ZnO for polymer solar cells  ap. 23213-23223.  aNovel zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) modified by silanization using triethoxy-1H,1H,2H,2H-tridecafluoro-n-octylsilane (TTFO), referred to as ZnOF NPs, have been successfully synthesized. Driven by the surface segregation behavior of the fluoroalkyl chains ascribed to their low surface energy, ZnOF NPs can migrate from the blend system with poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) to the surface of the active layer during the annealing process and consequently self-assemble as a cathode buffer layer. The addition of functionalized ZnOF NPs assists in the stacking of the P3HT chains to form a favorable morphology of the active layer with remarkable phase separation, especially upon annealing optimization in o-DCB solvent. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.4% is achieved with an open-circuit voltage (Vₒc) of 0.49 V, short-circuit current density (Jₛc) of 8.1 mA cm⁻² and fill factor (FF) of 61%, based on the self-assembled cathode buffer layer of ZnOF NPs (5 wt%) upon annealing in o-DCB. Therefore, this novel approach could realize the fabrication of both the active layer and cathode buffer layer through a single step, which not only simplifies the fabrication procedure and reduces the manufacturing cost of polymer solar cells, but also increases the PCE, by reduction of the Schottky barrier at the interface, and the stability of the devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3amanufacturing 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3aseparation 3asolar cells 3asolvents 3azinc oxide1 aHe, Zhijuan1 aChen, Yiwang0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 02, v. 5, no. 30 p.23213-23223dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra00462d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012600164300002000290520129000310592002801600650002201628650003701650650002201687650002301709650001301732650002801745650002101773650002101794650002101815650001601836650002301852650002301875650001901898650001301917650001901930650003701949650001601986700001502002700005602017700001402073700001602087773011702103856008402220852000902304655001202313IND60671586020221122131826.0191003e20190909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067158602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b015782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hong10aUnusual Photoelectrochemical Properties of Electropolymerized Films of a Triphenylamine-Containing Organic Small Molecule  ap. 12620-12629.  aThe electropolymerized films of poly(L)ₙ on an indium–tin oxide (ITO) electrode was prepared by anodic electrooxidation of a dichloromethane solution of a triphenylamine-carrying organic molecule L and were characterized/studied by ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and photoelectrochemical measurements. Poly(L)ₙ films were found to show surface-controlled TPA•⁺¹/⁰ associated quasi-reversible redox and exceptionally high photocurrent generation properties. At a zero external bias potential and under 100 mW/cm² white light irradiation, a photoelectrochemical device composed of a poly(L)₁-modified ITO as the working electode, a platinum disk counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode reference electrode in a 0.1 M Na₂SO₄ aqueous solution exhibited a significant cathode photocurrent density of 2.2 μA/cm², which could be switched to be anodic and outperform most previously reported molecule-based modified ITO electrodes under similar experimental conditions. The results indicate that poly(L)ₙ films offer a number of future perspectives ranging from organic photovoltaic to photoelectrochemical catalysis and sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric current 3aelectrochemistry 3aindium tin oxide 3airradiation 3amercurous chloride 3amethylene chloride 3aphotochemistry 3aplatinum 3asodium sulfate 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awhite light1 aYang, Tong1 aWang, Ke-Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2642-17701 aTong, Jin1 aYu, Shu-Yan0 tLangmuir.g2019 Sept. 09, v. 35, no. 39 p.12620-12629dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b015783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245008600155300001800241500001900259520128200278592002801560650001301588650001501601650002201616650002001638650000701658650002301665650001701688650001701705650002101722650001501743650001401758700001601772700001601788700001501804700002001819700001601839700001501855773012301870856007401993852000902067655001202076IND60731012520221121220537.0210315e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073101252DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01027a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Fuhua10aRemoval of tetracycline hydrochloride from wastewater by Zr/Fe-MOFs/GO composites  ap. 9977-9984.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aZirconium-iron metal–organic frameworks (Zr/Fe-MOFs) and Zr/Fe-MOF/graphene oxide (GO) composites were prepared via solvothermal synthesis using ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, zirconium acetate, and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid. The MOFs and composites were measured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectrometry (IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In this study, we explored the ability of Zr/Fe-MOFs and Zr/Fe-MOF/GO composites to adsorb tetracycline hydrochloride from an aqueous solution. Additionally, we optimized the adsorption performance by varying the ratio of MOFs and MOF composites to tetracycline hydrochloride solution, the concentration of tetracycline hydrochloride solution, and the pH of the solution. The results were investigated and fit to both pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The results of the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models indicate that Zr/Fe-MOFs and Zr/Fe-MOF/GO composites have heterogeneous adsorption surfaces and that tetracycline hydrochloride is adsorbed over Zr/Fe-MOFs and Zr/Fe-MOF/GO by multilayer adsorption. Overall, our findings indicate that Zr/Fe-MOFs and Zr/Fe-MOF/GO composites can effectively treat wastewater, providing an inexpensive alternative to other methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aferrous sulfate 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3aspectroscopy 3atetracycline 3athermogravimetry 3awastewater 3azirconium1 aRen, Qinhui1 aZhang, Huan1 aYang, Lili1 aChen, Hongliang1 aLiang, Zhao1 aChen, Ding0 tRSC advances.g2021 Mar. 09, v. 11, no. 17 p.9977-9984dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01027a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012300156300001600279500002000295520146300315592002801778650002701806650002301833650001901856650001101875650001501886650001801901650001701919650001101936650001501947650003101962650002001993650002802013650001502041650001102056650001202067650002202079650002402101650001102125650001402136650002202150650001302172650001302185650001502198650001302213650004002226651001102266700001702277700001602294700001802310700001902328773011802347856007302465852000902538655001202547IND60547793520221123002049.0160903e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054779352DNAL7 a10.1111/mve.121722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGAMES, P.

Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1823 (Diptera: Culicidae) is a known vector of lymphatic filariasis. Its control in Brazil has been managed using the organophosphate temephos. Studies examining the proteins of Cx. quinquefasciatus that are differentially expressed in response to temephos further understanding of the modes of action of the insecticide and may potentially identify resistance factors in the mosquito. In the present study, a comparative proteomic analysis, using 2‐dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time of flight (TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify midgut proteins in Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae that were differentially expressed in response to exposure to temephos relative to those in untreated controls. A total of 91 protein spots were differentially expressed; 40 were upregulated and 51 were downregulated by temephos. A total of 22 proteins, predominantly upregulated, were identified as known to play a role in the immune response, whereas the downregulated proteins were involved in energy and protein catabolism. This is the first proteome study of the midgut of Cx. quinquefasciatus and it provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of insecticide‐induced responses in the mosquito.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aYellow fever virus 3abioinformatics 3adengue 3adesorption 3adose response 3aencephalitis 3aenergy 3afilariasis 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3ainsecticidal properties 3aionization 3alarvae 3amalaria 3amass spectrometry 3amechanism of action 3amidgut 3apathogens 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atemephos 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aBrazil1 aALVES, S.

Quantitative metal extraction using 1 M H₂SO₄, pulp density of 25 g/L at 90 °C from waste NiMH battery was achieved. From leach liquor using 10 M NaOH, at pH 1.8, more than 99% REM was precipitated out and isolated through calcination at 600 °C. Undesired metals like Mn, Al, Zn, and Fe were scrubbed out from the leach liquor using 0. 7 M D2EPHA at the equilibrium pH of 2.30. From the scrubbed raffinate Co and Ni was separated using 0.5 M Cyanex 272 at pH 4.70 through solvent extraction. At pH 4.70 Co was completely extracted from solution leaving Ni in solution, which can be recovered completely. From Co loaded Cyanex 272, the Co was stripped by 1 M H₂SO₄ and regenerated Cyanex 272 can be reused and close the loop. Similarly, the undesired metal loaded D2EPHA can be regenerated and reused and close the loop. As the process is close-loop process recovers critical REMs, Co, and Ni, the valorization process efficiently addresses the circular economy and recycling challenges associated with waste NiMH battery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abatteries 3acircular economy 3acobalt 3airon 3aleaching 3amanganese 3anickel 3apH 3arecycling 3asodium hydroxide 3asolvents 3asulfuric acid 3awastes 3azinc 0aSpent Ni-MH batteries 0aRare earths 0aValorization1 aShim, Hyun-Woo1 aKim, Dae-Weon1 aSwain, Basudev0 tWaste management.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 104 p.254-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014400156300001800300520155900318592002801877650001101905650001101916650002101927650001301948650001501961650001701976650001101993650002102004650001102025650001302036650001402049650001302063700001402076700001502090700001702105700001102122700001502133700001502148700001502163773014202178856007502320852000902395655001202404IND60769684220221119143844.0220309e20220308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076968422DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta00164k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Dukang10aEngineered phase of nickel sulfides inside hairy hollow fibers towards high-performance anodes for flexible potassium ion hybrid capacitors  ap. 5569-5579.  aThe development of potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) is restricted by the cathode/anode kinetics mismatch and the limited working environments. Herein, a freestanding fiber assembled from tiny carbon nanotubes capped with nickel sulfide nanocrystallites (NSCN hollow fiber) is designed as an anode for PIHCs. The highly porous and conductive framework promotes fast electron/ion transport. Meanwhile, the nanoscale crystallites inside carbon nanotubes facilitate the accommodation of large volume change. Moreover, the interaction between N-doped carbon and nickel sulfide further promotes potassium storage. For the first time, the phase of nickel sulfide inside the NSCN hollow fiber is engineered and their properties are carefully evaluated. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the α-NiS phase shows the best kinetics and durability among all tailor-made phases of α-NiS, β-NiS and NiS₂. The superior performance of the α-NiS-NSCN hollow fiber is associated with the advantages of its well-designed architecture and preferable phase. Moreover, the full PIHC based on the α-NiS-NSCN anode achieves high energy/power densities and superior high-rate long-term performance. More impressively, the flexible PIHC incorporated with the polymer electrolyte achieves good pliability and low-temperature tolerance even at −20 °C. Therefore, this work not only provides a high-performance anode for potassium ion storage, but also sheds light on the fabrication of flexible power sources under diverse working conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3adurability 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3ananocrystallites 3anickel 3apolymers 3apotassium 3asulfides1 aHan, Bing1 aWang, Zili1 aShao, Yiying1 aWu, Yu1 aDeng, Chao1 aChen, Meng1 aZhang, Sen0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Mar. 8, v. 10, no. 10 p.5569-5579dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta00164k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100009400148245015100242300001800393520160700411592002802018650001102046650002802057650003702085650001402122650001902136650000802155650001102163650002402174650001002198651001102208651001802219653001802237653002802255653002102283700006602304700006602370700002602436773011202462856008302574852000902657655001202666IND60614451520221120131944.0200819e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061445152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2018.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález M., María Cristinaq(González Moreno),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3901-818210aBody composition using bioelectrical impedance: Development and validation of a predictive equation for fat-free mass in a middle-income country  ap. 2175-2179.  aWe developed and described a new equation to estimate fat-free mass derived from BIA using a sample population from Brazil and having Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference method. We also compared this new equation with two published and widely used equations developed in high-income countries.Cross-sectional study with 294 healthy adults from Pelotas, Brazil. DXA was used to assess total fat mass and fat-free mass aiming to obtain reference measures for the development of the new BIA equation. Multivariable linear regression models including fractional polynomials were used to find the best predictive model for FFM, using resistance, reactance, age, weight and height as the independent variables. Models were developed separately for men and women. The bootstrapping method was used to test the validity of the new equation. Finally, the Bland-Altman approach was used to assess the agreement of our equations and the two others widely used equations with the FFM measured by DXA.The new equations explained more than 80% of the variation in fat-free mass percentage from DXA. In the bootstrapping analysis, the new equations presented good validity, as the corrected RMSE was similar to those found in regression analysis. Finally, the new equations presented a better concordance when compared to two validated equations from US and Switzerland.The new developed equations appear to be the best options to predict fat-free mass percentage in Brazilian adults by bioelectrical impedance and appear to fit well in all Brazilian population due to the good validity presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abioelectrical impedance 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aequations 3alean body mass 3amen 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3awomen 3aBrazil 3aUnited States 0aFat-free mass 0aBioelectrical impedance 0aBody composition1 aOrlandi, Silvana Paiva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7340-743X1 aSantos, Leonardo Pozza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3993-37861 aBarros, Aluísio J.D.0 tClinical nutrition.g2019 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.2175-2179dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011700156300001800273500001500291520185700306592002802163650002402191650002602215650001002241650001102251650001902262650002502281650001602306650000902322650001502331650002002346650001102366650002102377651001002398653001802408700001502426700001502441700002302456700001502479700001602494773009302510856007302603852000902676655001202685IND60082180820221118230337.0141017e20141030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008218082DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.100512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Xiaonan10aTracing contributions to hydro‐isotopic differences between two adjacent lakes in the southern Tibetan Plateau  ap. 5503-5512.  a2019-12-06  aHydrological processes of lakes in the Tibetan Plateau are an important indicator of climate change. Due to the high elevation, inaccessibility and limited availability of historical observations, water budget evaluation of typical lake basins has been inadequate. In this study, stable isotopes are used to trace the multiple water sources contributing to two adjacent lakes on the north slope of the Himalayas, Gongmo‐tso and Drem‐tso. The two lakes have nearly the same elevation, lake area and climatic condition. However, the isotopic composition of the two lakes presents significant differences. Qualitative observations attribute the differences to hydrological discrepancies: Gongmo‐tso is a through‐flow lake, whereas Drem‐tso is a terminal lake. Quantitative analyses, including water and isotope mass balance modelling, clarify the fluxes and isotopic compositions among the various hydrological elements. The isotopic composition of input water, calculated as the summation of rainfall and upstream runoff, is estimated using the local meteoric water line (LMWL) combined with the time series of lake water isotope values. The isotopic composition of evaporation is calculated with a linear resistance model using local meteorological data. The results show that Drem‐tso is a closed lake in a hydrological steady state with relatively more enriched lake water isotope values resulting mainly from evaporation. In contrast, through‐flow accounts for more than 88% of the water input into Gongmo‐tso. The large amount of upstream runoff with lower isotopic composition and enrichment due to evaporation are the major contributions to the observed lake water isotope values. Isotopic modelling of the two neighbouring lakes is effective for isotopic and hydrological research in this region with limited in situ observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3ameteorological data 3aquantitative analysis 3alakes 3amodels 3aclimate change 3atime series analysis 3aevaporation 3arain 3awatersheds 3astable isotopes 3arunoff 3aclimatic factors 3aChina 0awater balance1 aZhang, Fan1 aTian, Lide1 aJoswiak, Daniel R.1 aZeng, Chen1 aQu, Dongmei0 tHydrological processes.g2014 Oct. 30, v. 28, no. 22 p.5503-5512dWileyx0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.100513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009400172300001800266520095000284592002801234650001501262650001901277650000901296650001801305650001801323700002801341773010401369856008601473852000901559655001201568IND60578322220221119174915.0170812e20170214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057832222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b022322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbott, Lauren
J.10aNanoscale Structure and Morphology of Sulfonated Polyphenylenes via Atomistic Simulations  ap. 1184-1192.  aWe performed atomistic simulations on a series of sulfonated polyphenylenes systematically varying the degree of sulfonation and water content to determine their effect on the nanoscale structure, particularly for the hydrophilic domains formed by the ionic groups and water molecules. We found that the local structure around the ionic groups depended on the sulfonation and hydration levels, with the sulfonate groups and hydronium ions less strongly coupled at higher water contents. In addition, we characterized the morphology of the ionic domains employing two complementary clustering algorithms. At low sulfonation and hydration levels, clusters were more elongated in shape and poorly connected throughout the system. As the degree of sulfonation and water content were increased, the clusters became more spherical, and a fully percolated ionic domain was formed. These structural details have important implications for ion transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahydrophilicity 3aions 3ananomaterials 3awater content1 aFrischknecht, Amalie L.0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Feb. 14, v. 50, no. 3 p.1184-1192dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b022323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245019700170300001600367520114700383592002801530650005001558650001201608650002301620650005301643650002101696650001301717650001801730650002201748650001401770650002601784650001201810650001101822700002101833700001901854700002201873700002301895700002501918773009501943856008402038852000902122655001202131IND60113096620221119155336.0141111e20130802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011309662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.05.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrupčík, Ján10aOn the use of ionic liquid capillary columns for analysis of aromatic hydrocarbons in low-boiling petrochemical products by one-dimensional and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography  ap. 225-236.  aOne-dimensional and comprehensive two-dimensional flow modulated gas chromatography with simultaneous flame ionization and mass spectrometric detection were applied for the identification and quantification of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes (BTEX) as well as of all C9–C11 aromatic hydrocarbons in the low-boiling petroleum products gasoline, reformate and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) samples.

In order to understand morphological and physiological changes of daylily buds during postharvest senescence, histological alterations and hormonal variations of different floral organs (receptacles, sepals, petals, stamens and pistils) were characterized during ambient storage (21 ± 1 °C). The external tissues (receptacles, sepals) turned yellowing and crimpling, while the internal tissues (petals, stamens) get autolyzed and collapsed in advance. Ultrastructural observations suggested that the rapid disassembly of cell walls, dismission of cell organelles (in particular, chloroplasts, mitochondrial, vacuoles), and disruption of cytoplasm occurred in floral segments. Results from biochemical measurements revealed variations of phytohormones including abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid, gibberellin, indole-3-acetic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, jasmonic acid, and brassinosteroids in different floral organs. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed associations of variations of these phytohormones with the senescence of different floral organs. ABA was found as the most abundant phytohormone and mostly positively corelated with the senescence of daylily buds. Pearson correlation analysis further unraveled that hormone-crosstalking co-works on the regulation of the senescence of daylily buds. The fundamental understanding on the postharvest senescence would help to establish novel postharvest strategies to maintain quality of daylily flower buds and extend shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aHemerocallis 3aabscisic acid 3abrassinosteroids 3achloroplasts 3agibberellins 3ahistology 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3amitochondria 3asalicylic acid 3ashelf life 3atechnology 0aABA 0aACC 0aBR 0aGA 0aIAA 0aJA 0aPCA 0aPCD 0aSA 0aSAG 0aDaylily 0aFloral tissues 0aSenescence 0aUltrastructure 0aHormones1 aZhang, Chaofan1 aCao, Jiankang1 aQu, Guiqin0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2022 Nov., v. 193 p.112054-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2022.1120543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245013400191300001600325520193900341592002802280650002302308650001202331650002002343650002102363650002102384650001102405650002002416650001502436650001002451650001102461650002402472650001402496650002802510650001302538650001202551650001102563650001102574650001802585650000902603650003202612650001702644650003002661650001602691700002302707773008802730856008402818852000902902655001202911IND60086944020221119215659.0141102e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008694402DNAL7 a235578262pmid7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, Jennifer B.10aEvaluating the indirect effect of self-compassion on binge eating severity through cognitive–affective self-regulatory pathways  ap. 224-228.  aCurrent theory and evidence point to disruptions in self-concept and difficulties with emotion regulation as contributing to the severity of binge eating. Alternatively, contemporary perspectives on self-compassion suggest that individual differences in this adaptive approach to self-regulation may serve to counteract these cognitive–affective triggers presumably resulting in reductions in binge eating severity. Accordingly, the present cross-sectional analysis examined an indirect effect model of positive dimensions of self-compassion on binge eating severity through both emotional tolerance and unconditional self-acceptance pathways. Two hundred fifteen undergraduate students (78% female) completed self-report measures of the variables of interest; BMI was calculated from self-reported heights and weights. Pearson's correlations revealed a positive linear association between self-compassion and unconditional self-acceptance; negative links were observed between self-compassion and emotional intolerance along with the severity of binge eating symptoms. A subsequent multiple mediator analysis utilizing both normal test theory and robust non-parametric bootstrap resampling procedures confirmed the presence of a significant total indirect effect of self-compassion on binge eating severity (−.15, p<0.001) through the combined mediators along with yielding specific indirect effects for both emotional tolerance (−.05, p<0.05) and unconditional self-acceptance (−.11, p<0.01) which were preserved in a model adjusted for BMI. Preliminary results underscore the need to further evaluate the tenability of this model in both prospective cohort and intervention-based research. Findings additionally invite considering the value of integrating self-compassion training into college health promotion efforts towards mitigating the appreciable levels of binge eating behavior prevalent in this at-risk population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aat-risk population 3abinging 3abody mass index 3acollege students 3ahealth promotion 3amodels 3aself-perception 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAffect 2aBulimiaxpsychology 2aCognition 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEmotions 2aEmpathy 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Concept 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aYoung Adult1 aForman, Mallory J.0 tEating behaviors.g2013 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.224-228dElsevier Ltdx1471-01537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009000161300001600251520160800267592002801875650001001903650001601913650001601929650000901945650001901954650001701973650001201990650001402002650001402016650002002030650001802050650001202068700002202080700002302102700002302125773010702148856008002255852000902335655001202344IND60522394120221122055730.0160602e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052239412DNAL7 a10.1089/cell.2016.00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ah Reum10aPhenotypes of Aging Postovulatory Oocytes After Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer in Mice  ap. 147-153.  aOocytes rapidly lose their developmental potential after ovulation, termed postovulatory oocyte aging, and often exhibit characteristic phenotypes, such as cytofragmentation, abnormal spindle shapes, and chromosome misalignments. Here, we reconstructed mouse oocytes using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) to reveal the effect of somatic cell-derived nuclei on oocyte physiology during aging. Normal oocytes started undergoing cytofragmentation 24 hours after oocyte collection; however, this occurred earlier in SCNT oocytes and was more severe at 48 hours, suggesting that the transferred somatic cell nuclei affected oocyte physiology. We found no difference in the status of acetylated α-tubulin (Ac-Tub) and α-tubulin (Tub) between normal and SCNT aging oocytes, but unlike normal oocytes, aging SCNT oocytes did not have astral microtubules. Interestingly, aging SCNT oocytes displayed more severely scattered chromosomes or irregularly shaped spindles. Observations of the microfilaments showed that, in normal oocytes, there was a clear actin ring beneath the plasma membrane and condensed microfilaments around the spindle (the actin cap) at 0 hours, and the actin filaments started degenerating at 1 hour, becoming completely disrupted and distributed to the cytoplasm at 24 hours. By contrast, in SCNT oocytes, an actin cap formed around the transplanted nuclei within 1 hour of SCNT, which was still present at 24 hours. Thus, SCNT oocytes age in a similar but distinct way, suggesting that they not only contain nuclei with abnormal epigenetics but are also physiologically different.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3achromosomes 3aepigenetics 3amice 3amicrofilaments 3amicrotubules 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3aphenotype 3aplasma membrane 3asomatic cells 3atubulin1 aShimoike, Takashi1 aWakayama, Teruhiko1 aKishigami, Satoshi0 tCellular reprogramming.g2016 June 01, v. 18, no. 3 p.147-153dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x2152-49987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fcell.2016.00143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013100173300001800304520144100322592002801763650001101791650001501802650001301817650001901830650002101849650002001870650001801890650001401908650001601922650001301938653003501951653001101986653001901997700002402016700002102040700001802061700002102079700002702100700002202127700002302149700001702172700003302189700001902222773011302241856008602354852000902440655001202449IND60614452020221120131846.0190401e20181029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061445202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErmlich, Susan J.10aSafety and immunogenicity of 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pneumococcal vaccine-naïve adults ≥50 years of age  ap. 6875-6882.  aPneumococcal disease remains a public health priority in adults. Safety and immunogenicity of 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15) containing 13 serotypes included in 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) plus 2 additional serotypes (22F and 33F) was evaluated in adults ≥50 years old (NCT01513551).691 adults received one dose of PCV15, PCV13, or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and were followed 14 days for safety. Serotype-specific IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were measured immediately prior and 1-month postvaccination.Safety profiles were comparable across vaccination groups. PCV15 induced comparable levels of IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs to PCV13 and PPV23 for shared serotypes. Serotype-specific antibodies were numerically higher among recipients of PCV15 than PCV13 and PPV23 for 7 and 12 shared serotypes, respectively; and lower for 4 and 1 serotype(s), respectively. PCV15 induced higher IgG and OPA antibodies than PCV13 or PPV23 for serotypes unique to PCV15 (22F and 33F not in PCV13; 6A not in PPV23).PCV15 displayed an acceptable safety profile and induced IgG and OPA to all 15 serotypes included in the vaccine, at levels comparable to PCV13 and PPV23 for shared serotypes with these vaccines.Study identification: V114-002.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV identifier: NCT01513551.© 2018 Merck & Co., Inc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantibodies 3ageometry 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3apolysaccharides 3apublic health 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aPneumococcal conjugate vaccine 0aSafety 0aImmunogenicity1 aAndrews, Charles P.1 aFolkerth, Steven1 aRupp, Richard1 aGreenberg, David1 aMcFetridge, Richard D.1 aHartzel, Jonathan1 aMarchese, Rocio D.1 aStek, Jon E.1 aAbeygunawardana, Chitrananda1 aMusey, Luwy K.0 tVaccine.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 36, no. 45 p.6875-6882dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245008600133300001800219500001900237520110700256592002801363650001001391650001601401650002601417650002101443650001301464650001401477650001301491650000701504650001501511650001401526650001901540650001401559650002101573653003501594653002001629700002701649773015301676852000901829655001201838IND60723789120221120124201.0210117e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072378912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadagouda, B.

Taking this problem into account, segmentation procedure utilizing splitting and merging is designed, iteratively. The proposed approach is based upon Bayesian inference, a maximum likelihood gamma distribution parameter estimator, and a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. By using of image splitting operation, SAR image is partitioned into finite regions iteratively, until all individual regions are coherent. Then each region is assigned a unique label to indicate the class to which the homogeneous region belongs. The intensities of pixels in each coherent region are assumed to satisfy identical and independent gamma distribution. Then an RJMCMC scheme is designed to simulate the posterior distribution in order to estimate the number of components and delineate an initial segmentation. Thus, the main purpose of this research is to define the number of homogeneous regions rather than a perfect segmentation, i.e. model outputs can be served for unsupervised segmentation methodologies as prior information. The results obtained from Radarsat-1/2 of SAR intensity images show that the proposed algorithm is both capable and reliable in defining the accurate number of homogeneous regions in a wide variety of SAR intensity images, comprising a high level of speckle noise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aXu, Aigong1 aLi, Yu1 aAlavipanah, Seyed Kazem0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2013 Sept., v. 41, no. 3 p.509-521dSpringer-Verlagx0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-013-0269-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013800162500002200300520131800322592002801640650002501668650003001693650001701723650001001740650000901750650001201759650002101771650002801792650001401820650001301834653001301847653001401860653003401874653003901908700001801947700001901965700005401984700001502038700001502053773006802068856008102136852000902217655001202226IND60570096320221119094205.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057009632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarcas, E.10aPartial filling affinity capillary electrophoresis as a useful tool for fragment-based drug discovery: A proof of concept on thrombin  aPre-press version  aWith the emergence of more challenging targets, a relatively new approach, fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), proved its efficacy and gained increasing importance in the pharmaceutical industry. FBDD identifies low molecular-weight (MW) ligands (fragments) that bind to biologically important macromolecules, then a structure-guided fragment growing or merging approach is performed, contributing to the quality of the lead. However, to select the appropriate fragment to be evolved, sensitive analytical screening methods must be used to measure the affinity in the μM or even mM range. In this particular context, we developed a robust and selective partial filling affinity CE (ACE) method for the direct binding screening of a small fragment library in order to identify new thrombin inhibitors. To demonstrate the accuracy of our assay, the complex dissociation constants of three known thrombin inhibitors, namely benzamidine, p-aminobenzamidine and nafamostat were determined and found to be in good concordance with the previously reported values. Finally, the screening of a small library was performed and demonstrated the high discriminatory power of our method towards weak binders compared to classical spectrophotometric activity assay, proving the interest of our method in the context of FBDD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adissociation 3adrugs 3alead 3aligands 3amolecular weight 3apharmaceutical industry 3ascreening 3athrombin 0aThrombin 0aInhibitor 0aFragment-based drug discovery 0aAffinity capillary electrophoresis1 aBouckaert, C.1 aServais, A.-C.1 aHanson, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7063-75901 aPochet, L.1 aFillet, M.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01762naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245008700172300001600259520047300275592002800748650000900776650001400785650001300799653001800812653001500830653002500845653002700870653002600897653003100923700001700954700001700971700001200988700001401000700001401014700001601028700001501044700001901059700001301078700001501091773011201106856008901218852000901307655001201316IND60582875820221118003019.0180830e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058287582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biotechadv.2017.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJablonsky, M.10aValorisation of softwood bark through extraction of utilizable chemicals.

The phenomena of these EEO reversals were described for the first time in present work, which is helpful to elucidate the chiral separation mechanism of these hydantoins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenantiomers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydantoins 3apolysaccharides 3atemperature 0aEnantiomer separation 0a3,5-Disubstituted hydantoins 0aChrialpak IA column 0aReversal of elution order1 aSu, Li1 aHou, Xuben1 aDing, Shengyong1 aXu, Wenfang1 aWang, Binghe1 aFang, Hao0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 1355 p.291-295dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03687naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245018800172300001600360520183000376592002802206650001902234650001302253650001202266650001502278650002202293650001502315650001902330650002902349650001502378650001902393650001302412650001202425650001202437650001402449650001702463650001702480650001002497651001102507653001702518653001802535653001902553653002002572653001802592653002602610700001602636700001902652700005402671700001902725700001802744700001902762700001902781700002002800700001802820700002102838773010602859856008702965852000903052655001203061IND60526762420221118183122.0190410e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThrän, Daniela10aMoving torrefaction towards market introduction – Technical improvements and economic-environmental assessment along the overall torrefaction supply chain through the SECTOR project  ap. 184-200.  aThe large-scale implementation of bioenergy demands solid biofuels which can be transported, stored and used efficiently. Torrefaction as a form of pyrolysis converts biomass into biofuels with according improved properties such as energy density, grindability and hydrophobicity. Several initiatives advanced this development. The first pilot-scale and demonstration plants displayed the maturity and potential of the technology.The European research project SECTOR intended to shorten the time-to-market. Within the project 158 Mg of biomass were torrefied through different technologies (rotary drum, toroidal reactor, moving bed). Their production led to process optimization of combined torrefaction-densification steps for various feedstocks through analysing changes in structure and composition. The torrefied pellets and briquettes were subjected to logistic tests (handling and storage) as well as to tests in small- and large-scale end-uses. This led to further improvement of the torrefied product meeting logistics/end-use requirements, e.g. durability, grindability, hydrophobicity, biodegradation and energy density. Durability exceeds now 95%.With these test results also international standards of advanced solid biofuels were initiated (ISO standards) as a prerequisite for global trade of torrefied material. Accompanying economic and environmental assessment identified a broad range of scenarios in which torrefied biomass perform better in these areas than traditional solid biofuels (e.g. white pellets), depending e.g. on feedstock, plant size, transport distances, integration of torrefaction in existing industries and end use. The implementation of industrial plants is the next step for the technology development. Different end user markets within and outside Europe can open opportunities here.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abriquettes 3adrums (equipment) 3adurability 3aenergy density 3aenvironmental assessment 3afeedstocks 3ahydrophobicity 3aindustry 3amarkets 3apellets 3apyrolysis 3asupply chain 3atorrefaction 3atrade 3aEurope 0aTorrefaction 0aSolid biofuel 0aSustainability 0aStandardization 0aDensification 0aMarket implementation1 aWitt, Janet1 aSchaubach, Kay1 aKiel, Jaap1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5675-04071 aCarbo, Michiel1 aMaier, Jörg,1 aNdibe, Collins1 aKoppejan, Jaap1 aAlakangas, Eija1 aMajer, Stefan1 aSchipfer, Fabian0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 June, v. 89 p.184-200dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245019400202300001600396520164200412592002802054596004802082596009402130596009502224650001402319650001802333650002002351650001102371650001802382650001202400650001302412650002202425650002002447650001702467650001402484650000702498650002102505650001002526650001502536650002002551651001102571700006502582700006102647700005702708773012902765856008302894852000902977655001202986IND60750533120221120190748.0220421e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075053312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05074-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRola, Kaja1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2241-108110aEffect of tree species identity and related habitat parameters on understorey bryophytes – interrelationships between bryophyte, soil and tree factors in a 50-year-old experimental forest  ap. 613-630.  aAIM: Overstorey tree species influence both soil properties and microclimate conditions in the forest floor, which in turn can induce changes in ground bryophyte communities. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of tree species identity and the most important habitat factors influencing understorey bryophytes. METHODS: We assessed the effect of 14 tree species and related habitat parameters, including soil parameters, vascular plant presence and light intensity on bryophytes in monospecific plots covered by nearly fifty-year-old trees in the Siemianice Experimental Forest (Poland). RESULTS: The canopy tree species determined bryophyte species richness and cover. The strongest differences were observed between plots with deciduous and coniferous trees. Soils with a more acidic pH and lower content of macronutrients supported larger bryophyte coverage. We also found a positive correlations between vascular plants and availability of light as well as bryophyte species richness. CONCLUSION: Tree species identity and differences in habitat conditions in the forest floor lead to changes of ground bryophyte richness, cover and species composition. Consequently, the changes in the dominant tree species in the stand may result in significant repercussions on ground bryophyte communities. We indicated that the introduction of alien tree species, i.e. Quercus rubra, has an adverse effect on bryophyte communities and suggested that the selection of tree species that contribute to the community consistent with the potential natural vegetation is highly beneficial for maintaining ground bryophyte biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/27/N/NZ8/00999cNarodowe Centrum Nauki  aK/ZDS/ 008054cInstitute of Botany, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University in Cracow  aN18/DBS/000002cInstitute of Botany, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University in Cracow 3aBryophyta 3aQuercus rubra 3aadverse effects 3acanopy 3aforest litter 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aintroduced plants 3alight intensity 3amicroclimate 3aoverstory 3apH 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3aunderstory 3avascular plants 3aPoland1 aPlášek, Vítězslav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4664-21351 aRożek, Katarzyna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7612-76281 aZubek, Szymon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1338-95720 tPlant and soil.g2021 Sept., v. 466, no. 1-2 p.613-630dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05074-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245015100206520164600357592002802003650001402031650001802045650001502063650001802078650001402096650001902110650002402129650001102153650002102164650001602185650001402201653001402215653002302229653003102252653001402283653002202297700001202319700001702331700005002348700001702398700005202415700001502467773010302482856008602585852000902671655001202680IND60773577020221119064837.0220502e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077357702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1077342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Liting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3058-585014aThe interfacial digestion behavior of crystalline oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by sodium caseinate during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion  aThe interfacial digestion behavior of crystalline oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions was studied using sodium caseinate-stabilized 4% and 20% palm stearin-in-water emulsions (4% PS and 20% PS) with 4% and 20% palm olein-in-water emulsions as control. Variations in fat crystal form and microstructure, interfacial adsorbed protein percentage and concentration, and rheological properties during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and intestinal lipid digestion behavior were determined. Initially, fat crystals in both PS-based emulsions were dominated by β′ polymorph. After gastric digestion, the β′-to-β transition was observed and both PS-based emulsions mainly contained β crystals, but 20% PS had a higher β crystal content (∼85% vs. 60%, p < 0.001) and viscosity than 4% PS. These β crystals induced in the gastric phase with large size, dense packing, and a high onset melting temperature (46.8 ± 0.2 °C) probably played a major role in slowing down lipid digestion, as confirmed by a greater extent of decreased lipolysis rate of 20% PS (∼37%) than 4% PS (∼10%) at the initial stage of intestinal digestion. The lipolysis extent of PS-based emulsions is strongly dependent on their solid fat content (SFC). The digestion extent of 4% PS was not affected by its low SFC (2.6%), while a high SFC of 20% PS (12.5%) promoted its lipolysis as fat crystals in it adsorbed at the oil-water interface to facilitate the formation of stable spherical droplets. This study highlighted the crucial role of gastric rather than initial fat crystal polymorph in impacting lipid digestion rate of protein-stabilized O/W emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adigestion 3ahydrocolloids 3aintestines 3alipid content 3alipolysis 3amicrostructure 3aoil-water interface 3asodium 3asodium caseinate 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aEmulsions 0aIn vitro digestion 0aFat crystal microstructure 0aPolymorph 0aSolid fat content1 aLi, Lin1 aXiao, Jiawei1 aHe, Ni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6131-20461 aZhang, Rixin1 aLi, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8084-26861 aZhang, Xia0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Sept., v. 130 p.107734-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1077343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008800171300001600259520129400275592002801569650002401597650001101621650001201632650001901644650001001663650001101673650003301684650001001717650001701727650000901744650002001753650001501773650000901788650002101797651002101818653001101839653000901850653001201859653001101871653001001882653000801892700001601900700001901916700001701935700001301952773010601965856008702071852000902158655001202167IND60526762520221118182816.0190410e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForbes, E.G.A.10aBiomass and bio-energy utilisation in a farm-based combined heat and power facility  ap. 172-183.  aFive different renewable energy technologies located at an agricultural and environmental research centre in Northern Ireland, were monitored to assess the cost, performance and efficiency in real-time operation of solar and bio-energy produced from crops and farm wastes utilised for energy generation in industrial grade equipment. Monitoring was conducted over a six year period, with power units running simultaneously or intermittently according to demand from the local district heating system. The purpose of the work was to investigate fossil fuel (oil) displacement, carbon dioxide emission (CO2e) reductions, financial and environmental sustainability of these technologies in a farm based scenario. Between 2009 and 2014, total heat output from the centre was 7.75 GWh with contributions of 47.2%, 17.1%, 9.8% and 13.5% from the biomass, biogas, multi-fuel boiler and biogas CHP unit respectively. Solar thermal produced 0.49% and the back-up oil boiler 11.9%. Total electrical output was 572.6 MWh with 95.2% generated from biogas CHP and 4.8% from the solar PV system. Fossil fuel and average CO2e reductions ranged from 20.1% to 54.1% and 23.3–55.7% respectively, reductions that combined with financial savings to present a viable and sustainable renewable energy system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acrops 3aenergy 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afarms 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3aheating systems 3amonitoring 3aoils 3asolar collectors 3aNorthern Ireland 0aEnergy 0aFarm 0aBiomass 0aBiogas 0aSolar 0aCO21 aOlave, R.J.1 aJohnston, C.R.1 aBrowne, J.D.1 aRelf, J.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 June, v. 89 p.172-183dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011700167300001600284520139600300592002801696650002601724650002801750650001401778650001101792650001601803650002101819653002901840653001601869653002601885653002501911653001301936653001501949700001301964700001501977700001501992773016102007856008202168852000902250655001202259IND60112416420221117104859.0190409e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011241642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2013.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamaswamy, H.S.10aScreening of twelve Clostridium botulinum (group I) spores for high-pressure resistance at elevated-temperatures  ap. 403-412.  aTwelve strains of Clostridium botulinum group I spores, suspended in phosphate buffer (0.1M) at approximately 107CFU/ml concentration, were subjected to high pressure treatments (800 and 900MPa; 0.5–15min) at elevated temperatures (90 and 100°C). The treatments were chosen to have a range of pressure/temperature severity to be able to discriminate the spore strains for their pressure resistance. An insulated test chamber was used to achieve temperature stability during treatment. Preliminary tests showed the need for an 8 day anaerobic incubation for enumeration. Results showed that strains PA9508B, HO9504A and CK2-A had higher pressure resistance than others among the 12 strains studied. Strain 62A was least resistant and completely inactivated by the treatment. Estimated D values of the more resistant strains were in the 0.66–1.8min range at 900MPa at 100°C treatment. The temperature sensitivity parameter (ZP value) in the 800–900MPa pressure range varied between 10 and 16°C, and pressure sensitivity parameter (ZT value) in the 90–100°C temperature range varied between 340 and 760MPa. The most pressure resistant strain was PA9508B with an estimated ZP value of 16.0°C and ZT value of 470MPa. Since the pathogenic strains of C. botulinum have different pressure resistance, the most resistance strain should be selected as the basis for process establishment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium botulinum 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ascreening 3aspores 3atemperature 3avirulent strains 0aHigh pressure processing 0aTemperature 0aClostridium botulinum 0aResistance screening 0aKinetics 0aProcessing1 aShao, Y.1 aBussey, J.1 aAustin, J.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2013 Oct., v. 91, no. 4 p.403-412dElsevier B.V.aThe Institution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01243naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007700163300001600240520038900256592002800645650001900673650001900692650001000711650001300721700001800734773012300752856008100875852000900956655001200965IND60121258020221119132253.0150219e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012125802DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-012-0231-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnil, P.

The road extraction scheme has three main steps: image segmentation using topological derivative, road cluster identification and road cluster filtering using mathematical morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3aroads 3atopology1 aNatarajan, S.0 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2013 Sept., v. 41, no. 3 p.719-724dSpringer-Verlagx0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-012-0231-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245011800175300001800293520196000311592002802271650002102299650002702320650001102347650001902358650001702377650001302394650001602407650001902423650002002442650002102462650001102483650001702494650005202511650001202563700002202575700001402597773008602611856009002697852000902787655001202796IND60090406620221122223448.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009040662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Shan-Hui,10aIsolation of the multipotent MSC subpopulation from human gingival fibroblasts by culturing on chitosan membranes  ap. 2642-2655.  aLiterature has different opinions regarding the percentage of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like population in human gingival tissue. Isolation of these cells is thus important for clinical applications. In this study, two typical but distinct types of gingival fibroblasts (GF), GF-A and GF-B, were grown from human gingival biopsies. They were characterized for surface markers by flow cytometry as well as the expressions of stemness and neural crest marker genes by RT-PCR. The two types of GF were slightly different in their surface markers; however, they had dramatic difference in the expression levels of stemness marker genes and neural crest marker genes. They also demonstrated distinct differentiation capacity. Upon the appropriate induction, GF-A were capable of osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and neurogenic differentiation while GF-B only underwent osteogenic differentiation. By culturing either type of GF on chitosan membranes for 24 h, we were able to isolate two distinct subpopulations in each type of GF, i.e. cells with spheroid-forming ability (GF-AS and GF-BS) or those remained flat and attached (GF-AN and GF-BN). We further characterized these cells, and determined the common properties shared by the spheroid-forming subpopulation “S”, as well as those shared by the non-spheroid-forming subpopulation “N”. The subpopulation “S” was capable of the multilineage differentiation, while the subpopulation “N” was only efficient in osteogenic differentiation. GF-A and GF-B had different proportions of subpopulations. Chitosan as the cell culture substratum up-regulated the N-cadherin expression of the “S” but not “N” subpopulation, which may account for the cell sorting effect. This study showed that chitosan membranes could be used for isolation of the spheroid forming subpopulation in human GF that contained multipotent adult stem cells of which the number varied among donors and sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadult stem cells 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiopsy 3abone formation 3acell culture 3achitosan 3afibroblasts 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic markers 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aneural crest 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asorting1 aHuang, Guo-Shiang1 aFeng, Fuh0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Mar., v. 33, no. 9 p.2642-2655dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245011000176300001800286520135100304592002801655650001901683650002001702650001101722650001601733650001501749650002301764650002701787700002001814700002001834700002201854700002101876700002101897773008601918856009002004852000902094655001202103IND60090406720221122223722.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009040672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhi-Yong14aThe potential of human fetal mesenchymal stem cells for off-the-shelf bone tissue engineering application  ap. 2656-2672.  aMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have become one of the most promising cell sources for bone tissue engineering (BTE) applications. In this review, we first highlight recent progress in the understanding of MSC biology, their in vivo niche, multi-faceted contribution to fracture healing and bone re-modelling, and their role in BTE. A literature review from clinicaltrials.gov and Pubmed on clinical usage of MSC for both orthopedic and non-orthopedic indications suggests that translational use of MSC for BTE indications is likely to bear fruit in the ensuing decade. Last, we disscuss the profound influence of ontological and antomical origins of MSC on their proliferation and osteogenesis and demonstrated human fetal MSC (hfMSC) as a superior cellular candidate for off-the-shelf BTE applications. This relates to their superior proliferation capacity, more robust osteogenic potential and lower immunogenecity, as compared to MSC from perinatal and postnatal sources. Furthermore, we discuss our experience in developing a hfMSC based BTE strategy with the integrated use of bioreactor-based dynamic priming within macroporous scaffolds, now ready for evaluation in clinical trials. In conclusion, hfMSC is likely the most promising cell source for allogeneic based BTE application, with proven advantages compared to other MSC based ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3aclinical trials 3ahumans 3aorthopedics 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atranslation (genetics)1 aTeoh, Swee Hin,1 aHui, James H.P.1 aFisk, Nicholas M.1 aChoolani, Mahesh1 aChan, Jerry K.Y.0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Mar., v. 33, no. 9 p.2656-2672dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245009400175300001600269500001400285520114500299592002801444650001701472650001301489650001701502650001001519650002101529650001501550650002001565650001701585653002401602653001901626653001701645653002601662700002401688773011101712856008401823852000901907655001201916IND60693116220221120212129.0200505e20120601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069311622DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2011.6518292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, Christopher M.10aIdentification of individual Eastern Screech-Owls Megascopsasio via vocalization analysis  ap. 127-140.  aNAL-light  aTo more easily and non-invasively monitor urban Eastern Screech-Owl populations, we developed a method of distinguishing individual owls using their calls. A set of seven variables derived from recordings of ‘bounce’ calls taken from 10 known (either free-ranging birds recorded at a single site on a single night or identifiable captive owls) owls was tested using a model-based clustering analysis (Mclust) as a method of discriminating individual owls. The cluster analysis correctly classified these calls with 98% accuracy. A second set of calls from nine owls was used to further test the method and correctly classified 84% of the calls using the same variables. Four owls were recorded repeatedly from 2008 to 2010 to determine the extent to which calls changed over time; the cluster analysis correctly assigned 89% of the calls to the correct owl regardless of the year the recordings were made. Based on these results, we are confident that the Mclust analysis can be used to reliably and safely estimate abundance and survival of Eastern Screech-Owls within the time frame of a few years and of population sizes < 15 owls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrigiformes 3aaccuracy 3abioacoustics 3abirds 3acluster analysis 3apopulation 3apopulation size 3avocalization 0aEastern Screech-Owl 0aMegascops asio 0aspectrograms 0avocalization analysis1 aRockwell, Robert F.0 tBioacoustics.g2012 June 1, v. 21, no. 2 p.127-140dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2011.6518293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03489naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010700166300001600273520215200289592002802441650001502469650002302484650002502507650003002532650002902562650002102591650001502612650002002627650002602647650001302673650001002686650001002696650002102706650001602727700002402743700001902767700002202786700002502808773013202833856008102965852000903046655001203055IND60440209420221119063740.0160304e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044020942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-015-0900-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrazza, Carlo10aInvestigation of green practices for paper use reduction onboard a cruise ship—a life cycle approach  ap. 982-993.  aPURPOSE: The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential green practices that can be adopted onboard a cruise ship in order to enhance the environmental performance of the cruise with particular attention to paper input and output flows in a waste minimization perspective. METHODS: A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of management scenarios of paper streams onboard a cruise ship is performed. The potential environmental impacts due to three strategic choices about paper and paper waste management onboard a case-study ship have been investigated through a so-called difference analysis, i.e. the digitalization of the daily information journal Today, the reduction of toilet paper and paper towels through the installation of auto-cut single extraction dispensers and the reduction of printing paper through dissemination of specific guidelines. In order to compare each scenario with the reference case in absence of the practice implementation, the functional unit in this study has been defined as 1 day of cruise. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The implementation of the analysed green practices show comparable environmental benefits onboard a pilot ship, on the basis the set of assumptions and hypothesis identified in this simulation. In particular, when comparing the potential GHG emission reductions, it results that the two most realistically feasible scenarios in the communication area, i.e. digitalization of 25 and 50 % shares of Today journal, show environmental savings comparable to measures related to reduction of consumables and guidelines for personnel. Nevertheless, the addition of a reasonable number of touch-screen devices for this purpose would not significantly influence the environmental impacts. CONCLUSIONS: A set of reduction measures of paper items onboard a cruise ship is able to both avoid the impacts related to production and incineration stages. In the form of forecast scenarios, the results of such modelization may represent a set of indicators to be considered in a feasibility analysis prior to selection of the green practices to be introduced, as a support to decisions for cruise managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adispensers 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aguidelines 3ahuman resources 3alife cycle assessment 3amanagers 3apaper 3aships 3awaste management 3awaste paper1 aDel Borghi, Adriana1 aGallo, Michela1 aManariti, Roberta1 aMissanelli, Emanuela0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2015 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.982-993dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0900-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013000169300001600299500001900315520151400334592002801848650002201876650001401898650001101912650001101923650002101934650001601955650001401971650001301985651001401998653001302012653001802025653002202043773010702065856008702172852000902259655001202268IND60680742320221119154706.0200221e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068074232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTittor, Anne14aThe changing drivers of oil palm cultivation and the persistent narrative of 'already degraded land'. Insights from Nicaragua  ap. 271-279.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe article explores the histories of oil palm in Nicaragua during the 20th century within a drastically changing Political Economy. In Nicaragua, palm oil cultivation dates back to the 1950s, when the United Fruit Company started to plant oil palm on the Atlantic Coast. In the 1980s, due to the agrarian reform of the Sandinista revolution, political conditions and economic strategies changed completely. In this era, a socialist government started to create agricultural cooperatives for oil palm. After the defeat of the revolution, during the neoliberal era of the 1990s, palm oil cultivation expanded in different surges. This expansion was tied to funding from international organizations, especially during the conjuncture of the bioenergy framework, which implied a new narrative of sustainability from the global level. The extent of the territory on which oil palm is cultivated more than quadrupled between 2005 and 2010, and again more than doubled between 2010 and 2016, although the Sandinista government was back in power and not particularly supportive of oil palm. The article argues that although the drivers, the main actors, their specific arguments, funding sources, and policies promoting oil palm have varied over time, the narrative of 'already degraded land' has consistently been used. Social contestations from below point not only to environmental and social consequences, but to the funding schemes and narratives of international institutions sponsoring and promoting oil palm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abioenergy 3acoasts 3afruits 3aland degradation 3aland reform 3apalm oils 3apolitics 3aNicaragua 0aOil palm 0aRural history 0aPolitical economy0 tJournal of rural studies.g2020 Feb., v. 74 p.271-279dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245011000174300001800284520153900302592002801841650001401869650002401883650001001907650001101917650001001928650001901938650002001957650001801977650001701995650002002012650000902032650002302041650001702064650001202081650001502093650001102108650001302119700002202132700002302154700003302177773008602210856009002296852000902386655001202395IND60090406920221122223516.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009040692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuanfei10aHydrogel delivery of erythropoietin to the brain for endogenous stem cell stimulation after stroke injury  ap. 2681-2692.  aDrug delivery to the brain is challenging because systemic delivery requires high doses to achieve diffusion across the blood-brain barrier and often results in systemic toxicity. Intracerebroventricular implantation of a minipump/catheter system provides local delivery, yet results in brain tissue damage and can be prone to infection. An alternate local delivery strategy, epi-cortical delivery, releases the biomolecule directly to the brain while causing minimal tissue disruption. We pursued this strategy with a hyaluronan/methyl cellulose (HAMC) hydrogel for the local release of erythropoietin to induce endogenous neural stem and progenitor cells of the subventricular zone to promote repair after stroke injury in the mouse brain. Erythropoeitin promotes neurogenesis when delivered intraventricularly, thereby making it an ideal biomolecule with which to test this new epi-cortical delivery strategy. We investigated HAMC in terms of the host tissue response and the diffusion of erythropoeitin therefrom in the stroke-injured brain for neural repair. Erythropoietin delivered from HAMC at 4 and 11 days post-stroke resulted in attenuated inflammatory response, reduced stroke cavity size, increased number of both neurons in the peri-infarct region and migratory neuroblasts in the subventricular zone, and decreased apoptosis in both the subventricular zone and the injured cortex. We demonstrate that HAMC-mediated epi-cortical administration is promising for minimally invasive delivery of erythropoeitin to the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acortex 3adrugs 3aerythropoietin 3ahyaluronic acid 3ahydrocolloids 3ainflammation 3amethylcellulose 3amice 3amigratory behavior 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3astem cells 3astroke 3atoxicity1 aCooke, Michael J.1 aMorshead, Cindi M.1 aShoichet, M.

To better understand the role these limiting nutrients play in determining the C balance of peatland ecosystems, we compile comprehensive N and P budgets for a forested bog in northern Minnesota, USA. METHODS: N and P within plants, soils, and water are quantified based on field measurements. The resulting empirical dataset are then compared to modern-day, site-level simulations from the peatland land surface version of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (ELM-SPRUCE). RESULTS: Our results reveal N is accumulating in the ecosystem at 0.2 ± 0.1 g N m⁻² year⁻¹ but annual P inputs to this ecosystem are balanced by losses. Biomass stoichiometry indicates that plant functional types differ in N versus P limitation, with trees exhibiting a stronger N limitation than ericaceous shrubs or Sphagnum moss. High biomass and productivity of Sphagnum results in the moss layer storing and cycling a large proportion of plant N and P. Comparing our empirically-derived nutrient budgets to ELM-SPRUCE shows the model captures N cycling within dominant plant functional types well. CONCLUSIONS: The nutrient budgets and stoichiometry presented serve as a baseline for quantifying the nutrient cycling response of peatland ecosystems to both observed and simulated climate change. Our analysis improves our understanding of N and P dynamics within nutrient-limited peatlands and represents a crucial step toward improving C-cycle projections into the twenty-first century.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE‐AC05‐1008 00OR22725 to UT BattellecOffice of Science  aDEB 1754756cNational Science Foundation 3aSphagnum 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3agroundwater 3amodels 3amosses and liverworts 3anitrogen 3apeatlands 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3asoil carbon 3astoichiometry 3aMinnesota1 aBrice, Deanne J.1 aBridgham, Scott1 aChilds, Joanne1 aGraham, Jake1 aGriffiths, Natalie A.1 aHofmockel, Kirsten1 aIversen, Colleen M.1 aJicha, Terri M.1 aKolka, Randy K.1 aKostka, Joel E.1 aMalhotra, Avni1 aNorby, Richard J.1 aPhillips, Jana R.1 aRicciuto, Daniel1 aSchadt, Christopher W.1 aSebestyen, Stephen D.1 aShi, Xiaoying1 aWalker, Anthony P.1 aWarren, Jeffrey M.1 aWeston, David J.1 aYang, Xiaojuan1 aHanson, Paul J.0 tPlant and soil.g2021 Sept., v. 466, no. 1-2 p.649-674dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05065-x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245017000172300001500342500001500357520136600372592002801738650002001766650001301786650001701799650001001816650001701826650001501843650001901858650001001877650001901887650001501906650001501921650001901936650001701955650001301972650001501985650001502000650002102015651001902036653001302055700002302068700002302091773008802114856004802202852000902250655001202259IND4468242720221117161154.0120504e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446824272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-011-0857-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠumberová, Kateřina10aLife-history traits controlling the survival of Tillaea aquatica: a threatened wetland plant species in intensively managed fishpond landscapes of the Czech Republic  ap. 91-110.  a2019-12-06  aTillaea aquatica (Crassulaceae) is considered as annual wetland species threatened by changes in land use and progressing eutrophication in large part of its European distribution range. We summarised the historical and recent data on this species, and analysed its distribution and associated habitat changes in the Czech Republic. We used permanent plots as well as seed bank and seed dispersal studies to obtain better insight into the plant’s survival strategy. During the second half of the twentieth century T. aquatica disappeared from most historical localities situated mainly in large fishponds. After 1999, altogether 18 new populations were found in small fry ponds and other fish-farming ponds. The largest populations of Tillaea were found in ponds with long-term bottom exposure where the vegetation of perennial herbs was eliminated by herbicides or grazing. Propagules easily dispersible by water, on gumboots or tyres of vehicles, and long-term soil seed bank also might contribute to persistence of the species in the habitats, diminishing the chance of extinction. As the fishpond management has changed, and so have done the original habitats of Tillaea, the species could survive in habitats different from those in the past. In this article, we suggest management measures aimed at promoting survival of Tillaea under new circumstances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aland use change 3awetlands 3aCrassulaceae 3aherbs 3alife history 3alandscapes 3aseed dispersal 3atires 3awetland plants 3aherbicides 3aextinction 3aeutrophication 3aburied seeds 3ahabitats 3avegetation 3afish ponds 3achronic exposure 3aCzech Republic 0avehicles1 aDucháček, Michal1 aLososová, Zdeňka0 tHydrobiologia.g2012 June, v. 689, no. 1 p.91-110dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0857-3  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245015100165300001800316500001900334520064000353592002800993650003601021650002601057650002001083700001701103700001701120700001801137700005501155700005401210700005401264773012001318856008301438852000901521655001201530IND60734223820221118002407.0210417e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073422382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c004932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Liwei10aα-Oxocarboxylic Acids as Three-Carbon Insertion Units for Palladium-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Cascade Synthesis of Diverse Fused Heteropolycycles  ap. 2878-2883.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative cascade cyclization for the assembly of diverse fused heteropolycycles by employing α-oxocarboxylic acids as three-carbon insertion units is reported.

Here, we show how changes in stratospheric circulation could play a significant role in future climate change in the extratropics through an additional shift in the tropospheric circulation. This shift in the circulation alters climate change in regional winter rainfall by an amount large enough to significantly alter regional climate change projections. The changes are consistent with changes in stratospheric winds inducing a change in the baroclinic eddy growth rate across the depth of the troposphere. A change in mean wind structure and an equatorward shift of the tropospheric storm tracks relative to models with poor stratospheric resolution allows coupling with surface climate. Using the Atlantic storm track as an example, we show how this can double the predicted increase in extreme winter rainfall over Western and Central Europe compared to other current climate projections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevaporation 3amodels 3arain 3astorms 3astratosphere 3atroposphere 3awind 3aCentral European region1 aSpangehl, Thomas1 aFereday, David R.1 aCubasch, U.,1 aLangematz, Ulrike1 aAkiyoshi, Hideharu1 aBekki, Slimane1 aBraesicke, Peter1 aButchart, Neal1 aChipperfield, Martyn P.1 aGettelman, Andrew1 aHardiman, Steven C.1 aMichou, Martine1 aRozanov, Eugene1 aShepherd, Theodore G.0 tClimate dynamics.g2012 May, v. 38, no. 9-10 p.2089-2097dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-011-1080-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100004100149245013700190300001800327500001900345520055700364592002800921650001300949650002800962650001800990650002301008650001201031650002101043700001801064700005201082773012001134856008301254852000901337655001201346IND60734223920221118002529.0210417e20210326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073422392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.1c005052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairuz Binte Sheikh Ismail, Siti Nur10aAccess to 5,6-Spirocycles Bearing Three Contiguous Stereocenters via Pd-Catalyzed Stereoselective [4 + 2] Cycloaddition of Azadienes  ap. 2884-2889.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe present herein a highly diastereo- and enantioselective Pd-catalyzed [4 + 2] cycloaddition of benzofuran-derived azadienes with vinyl benzoxazinanones, which represents a rare highly stereoselective cycloaddition of this class of fused azadienes as a two-atom synthon.

Opposed to a deterministic approach, we propose to solve the problem probabilistically, using a complete pipeline. First, the retention time(s) for a (probabilistic) number of compounds for each mass channel are estimated. The statistical dependency between m/z channels was implied by including penalties in the model objective function. Second, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is used as Occam’s razor for the probabilistic assessment of the number of components. Third, a probabilistic set of resolved spectra, and their associated retention times are estimated. Finally, a probabilistic library search is proposed, computing the spectral match with a high resolution library. More specifically, a correlative measure was used that included the uncertainties in the least square fitting, as well as the probability for different proposals for the number of compounds in the mixture. The method was tested on simulated high resolution data, as well as on a set of pesticides injected in a GC-Orbitrap with high coelution. The proposed pipeline was able to detect accurately the retention times and the spectra of the peaks. For our case, with extremely high co-elution situation, 5 out of the 7 existing compounds under the selected region of interest, were correctly assessed. Finally, the comparison with the classical methods of deconvolution (i.e., MCR and AMDIS) indicates a better performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the number of correctly resolved compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical chemistry 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amodels 3apesticides 3auncertainty 0aGC-Orbitrap data 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aDeconvolution 0aBayesian statistics 0aCompound identification1 aMol, H.G.J.1 aTienstra, M.1 aVivó-Truyols, G.0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2017.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010800172300001600280520141700296592002801713650002201741650002001763650000801783650002001791650002501811650001701836650001101853650001301864650001101877650001801888650001301906650000901919650001101928650001201939650002801951650002201979653001802001653001002019653001902029653001602048700003002064700002402094700002102118773016102139856008202300852000902382655001202391IND60112417020221117104720.0190409e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011241702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2012.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemarchi, Silvana M.10aEffect of temperature on hot-air drying rate and on retention of antioxidant capacity in apple leathers  ap. 310-318.  aFruit leathers are pectic gels, eaten as snack or dessert, obtained by dehydrating fruit purees. In this work, apple leathers were prepared by a hot-air drying process which allows the formation of a gel, following the “saccharide–acid–high methoxyl pectin” gelation mechanism. Leathers were produced at 50, 60 and 70°C, from two formulations: control and added with potassium metabisulphite (KM) as antioxidant. The drying process was studied applying a diffusive model, while antioxidant capacity (AC) losses were represented by a first-order model. Activation energy for drying (20.6kJ/mol) was lower than those estimated for AC losses in control (31.5kJ/mol) and KM-added (37.9kJ/mol) leathers. Therefore, the drying time reduction achieved by increasing air temperature is not sufficient to decrease AC losses in the range covered. AC retention decreased in both formulations at increasing air temperature. KM-added samples showed higher AC retention than the controls, except for those dried at 70°C. Kinetic constants were lower for KM-added samples, suggesting a protective effect of the additive, especially at moderate air temperatures. In the most favorable situation, AC retention was of only 16%. Therefore, the functional character of these products may not be preserved if dried with hot air and the research on economically viable, less-severe drying technologies should be intensified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadditive effect 3aair 3aair temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aapples 3adesserts 3adrying 3afruit leather 3agelation 3agels 3amodels 3apectins 3apotassium metabisulfite 3aprotective effect 0aFruit leather 0aApple 0aHot-air drying 0aAntioxidant1 aQuintero Ruiz, Natalia A.1 aConcellón, Analía1 aGiner, Sergio A.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2013 Oct., v. 91, no. 4 p.310-318dElsevier B.V.aThe Institution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2012.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001600257520127300273592002801546650001901574650001301593650002001606650002601626650001301652650001501665650001501680650001301695650001301708650001601721650002701737650001601764650001201780653001301792653001301805653001501818653001901833653001501852653002701867700001901894700002301913700001801936773016101954856008202115852000902197655001202206IND60112417120221117105140.0190409e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011241712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2013.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrcajo, Janire10aEgg yolk hydrolysed granules: Characteristics, rheological properties and applications  ap. 457-463.  aGiven its low-cholesterol content feature, granules from egg yolk can be used as a substitute of the whole egg yolk. However, the functional properties of the granular fraction should be improved. In this sense, hydrolysis of proteins frequently produces improvements in some of its nutritional and technological properties. For that reason, in this work egg yolk granules were treated with a proteolytic enzyme, trypsin (E.C. 3.4.21.4) with the purpose of making a comparative characterization of the products.Results showed that the enzymatic reaction produced a degree of hydrolysis of 12%, being the size of the different peptides obtained and quantified by chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. Mayonnaises made with these hydrolysed granules resulted more stable to temperature changes between 4 and 20°C than the one made with non-hydrolysed ones. In the rheological tests carried out, the mayonnaise elaborated with hydrolysed granules has the most similar rheological behaviour to that of a commercial one used as reference. In general, the results obtained suggest that the recipe elaborated with hydrolysed granules had better rheological characteristics than those prepared using non-hydrolysed granules, maintaining the low-cholesterol feature.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3aegg yolk 3aelectrophoresis 3afunctional properties 3agranules 3ahydrolysis 3amayonnaise 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3arheological properties 3atemperature 3atrypsin 0aEgg yolk 0aGranules 0aHydrolysis 0aEmulsification 0aMayonnaise 0aRheological properties1 aMarcet, Ismael1 aParedes, Benjamín1 aDíaz, Mario,0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2013 Oct., v. 91, no. 4 p.457-463dElsevier B.V.aThe Institution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2013.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245009000212300001600302520157900318592002801897596005501925596003801980596002902018650002102047650001702068650001202085650001102097650002502108650001702133650001202150650001502162650002202177650001102199650002102210650002102231650001402252650001702266651001102283700005902294700006202353700006202415773012902477856008302606852000902689655001202698IND60750533820221120190700.0220421e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075053382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05038-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJörgensen, Karolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5550-476210aForest management to increase carbon sequestration in boreal Pinus sylvestris forests  ap. 165-178.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Forest management towards increased carbon (C) sequestration has repeatedly been suggested as a “natural climate solution”. We evaluated the potential of altered management to increase C sequestration in boreal Pinus sylvestris forest plantations. METHODS: At 29 forest sites, distributed along a 1300 km latitudinal gradient in Sweden, we studied interactive effects of fertilization and thinning on accumulation of C in standing biomass and the organic horizon over a 40 year period. RESULTS: Abstention from thinning increased the total C stock by 50% on average. The increase was significant (14% on average) even when C in the removed timber was included in the total ecosystem C pool. Fertilization of thinned stands increased stocks similarly regardless of including (11%) or excluding (12%) removed biomass, and fertilization combined with abstention from thinning had a synergistic effect on C stocks that generated an increase of 79% (35% when removed timber was included in the C stock). A positive effect of fertilization on C stocks was observed along the entire gradient but was greater in relative terms at high latitudes. Fertilization also reduced soil respiration rates. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that changed forest management practices have major potential to increase the C sink of boreal forests. Although promising, these benefits should be evaluated against the undesired effects that such management can have on economic revenue, timber quality, biodiversity and delivery of other ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data  a217-2012-546cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas (SE)  a2015-04882cVetenskapsrådet (SE)  a2019-03167cVINNOVA (SE) 3aPinus sylvestris 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3aincome 3aorganic horizons 3asoil respiration 3asynergism 3awood quality 3aSweden1 aGranath, Gustaf1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3632-91021 aLindahl, Björn D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3384-45471 aStrengbom, Joachim1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1720-50160 tPlant and soil.g2021 Sept., v. 466, no. 1-2 p.165-178dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05038-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011100174300001400285500001400299520109600313592002801409650001701437650001101454650000801465650002701473650001701500650001401517650001401531650002101545650001601566650001401582650000901596650001301605650000901618650001701627653001501644653002801659653001501687653001101702653002001713700002301733700002101756773010901777856008501886852000901971655001201980IND60693116720221120212224.0200505e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069311672DNAL7 a10.1080/09524622.2011.97536342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVOLODINA, ELENA V.13aAn unusual effect of maturation on the alarm call fundamental frequency in two species of ground squirrels  ap. 87-98.  aNAL-light  aIn most mammals, adults produce relatively low frequency vocalizations compared to those of juveniles. This rule is not maintained however at least in four species of ground squirrels, whose juveniles call at the adult's fundamental frequency. These findings have been obtained however with separate sets of juveniles and adults and no data is available concerning the ontogeny linked to these differences. Here we analyze the acoustic structure of alarm calls of the same Yellow Spermophilus fulvus and Speckled S. suslicus ground squirrel individuals, recorded as pups and as adults after hibernation. We found the fundamental frequencies of adults within the same frequency ranges as those of pups, in spite of the significant difference in body mass. In ground squirrels, severing the relationship between body size and call frequency removes some vocal cues to age. We discuss some functional hypotheses advanced to explain manipulations with fundamental frequencies in ground squirrels and other animals, and suggest the lack of data for discussing the mechanisms of such vocal tuning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpermophilus 3aadults 3aage 3aantipredatory behavior 3abioacoustics 3abody size 3afrequency 3aground squirrels 3ahibernation 3ajuveniles 3amass 3aontogeny 3apups 3avocalization 0amaturation 0aanti-predatory behavior 0aalarm call 0arodent 0aground squirrel1 aMATROSOVA, VERA A.1 aVOLODIN, ILYA A.0 tBioacoustics.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 20, no. 1 p.87-98dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2011.97536343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013400205300002000339520193600359592002802295596009802323596010402421596008802525596007502613650002002688650002902708650001902737650002202756650001102778650001402789650003302803650001302836650001702849650001702866650002302883650001702906651001002923651001802933700001602951700001902967700001502986700001403001773015503015856008303170852000903253655001203262IND60745731220221118001226.0211002e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074573122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13203-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Kerong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4298-308X10aPerformance evaluation of urban environmental governance in Anhui Province based on spatial and temporal differentiation analyses  ap. 37400-37412.  aWhen the process of urbanization has brought economic benefits in the Yangtze River Delta of China, environmental pollution becomes increasingly prominent. In order to achieve integrated sustainable green development and reduce the gap in environmental governance performance between regions, this study analyzed the environmental issues of provincial cities in Anhui Province from 2013 to 2017 in the urban agglomeration of Yangtze River Delta. Governance performance is analyzed and the evaluation index system framework is determined using the “pressure-state-response” model with the panel and spatial data. Based on the global principal component analysis method and spatial autocorrelation analysis, the environmental governance performance of Anhui Province has generally increased steadily from 2013 to 2017. The situation in northern Anhui is still developing in a good state. Southern Anhui is in a trend of rising first and then stabilizing, whereas central Anhui has a downward trend after a rapid rise; in terms of the spatial pattern, the overall situation is central Anhui > northern Anhui > southern Anhui. The urban spatial distribution pattern of the region shows a positive spatial correlation. Particularly, the performance levels of Maanshan City and Huainan City have been at a poor level for a long time, whereas Hefei and Huangshan have strong comprehensive environmental governance capabilities with average efficiency values of 0.55 and 0.47, respectively. Corresponding countermeasures have been proposed to rectify polluting enterprises and optimize structure of industries, increase scientific and technological investment and infrastructure construction, strengthen the radiation driving effects, and establish a pollution monitoring system. Based on all the analyses and resulted findings, we concluded the study with corresponding policy implications/suggestions and recommended countermeasures.  aPublisher supplied data  aSK2020A0333cKey Project of Anhui Provincial Educational Commission Social Science Foundation  a202006f01050035cAnhui Science and Technology Innovation Strategy and Soft Science Research Project  aFYSK2019QD02cFuyang Municipal Leaders’ Project of Humanities and Social Sciences  a2018CXF163cAnhui Province Innovation and Development Research Project 3aautocorrelation 3aenvironmental governance 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3ariver deltas 3aspatial data 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aHou, Youxin1 aJiang, Liangyu1 aXu, Yasong1 aLiu, Wuyi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 July, v. 28, no. 28 p.37400-37412dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13203-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006100176300001400237520142200251592002801673650001101701650001601712650001101728650002101739650001501760650001201775650002201787650001101809650001801820650001401838650001301852650001201865653002001877653001101897653001401908653001401922653002001936653002101956700002701977700002902004700002002033773010302053856008702156852000902243655001202252IND60526763420221118183357.0190410e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMovil-Cabrera, Omar10aElectrochemical conversion of lignin to useful chemicals  ap. 89-96.  aElectrochemical conversion of waste lignin from pulping mills and biorefineries is an alternative renewable process for generating industrial chemicals that may afford better control over conversion than other catalytic or thermochemical processes because the electrode potential, and hence the reaction energetics, can be controlled. The authors report here electrochemical oxidation of lignin on a Co core/Pt partial shell nanoparticle alloy electrocatalyst, identify several oxidation products, and quantify oxidation product concentration as a function of oxidation time. Key results show that useful chemicals like heptane and apocynin are generated during the electrochemical oxidation of lignin. Some key oxidation product concentrations increase steadily over time, suggesting they are likely stable products that do not participate in other reactions. Concentrations of other oxidation products increase and then decrease with time, suggesting that they may participate in proceeding chemical or electrochemical reactions. Formation of other oxidation products like 1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-benzene and 1,4-di-tert-butylphenol suggest oxidative decomposition initiated by hydroxyl radicals that are likely generated at the anode. Overall, the results suggest that electrochemical oxidation of lignin is complex, with possibly many competing homogeneous chemical and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3abiorefining 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aheptane 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alignin 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3apulping 0aElectrochemical 0aLignin 0aOxidation 0aChemicals 0aElectrocatalyst 0aElectrocatalysis1 aRodriguez-Silva, Allen1 aArroyo-Torres, Christian1 aStaser, John A.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 May, v. 88 p.89-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02104naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007400173300001600247520083500263592002801098650001301126650002501139650001701164650001801181650001601199650001001215650002401225650001801249650001301267650001601280650001601296650002101312650002101333653003201354653002101386653002401407653000801431653000901439700002201448773009401470856008501564852000901649655001201658IND50060449320221122041149.0161020e20130120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006044932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScharf, Daniel H.10aEngineering fungal secondary metabolism: A roadmap to novel compounds  ap. 179-183.  aNatural products play important roles not only in the environment but also as useful compounds in various applications like in medicine or plant protection.

In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in the development of novel promising approaches for natural product discovery in fungi using genome mining, activation of silent gene clusters, heterologous expression of biosynthesis genes, exchange of enzyme modules as well as redesign of metabolic flux.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3aengineering 3afungi 3agenetic engineering 3agenome mining 3ahabitats 3ametabolites 3amethodology 3amultigene family 3aplant protection 0aFungal secondary metabolism 0aNatural products 0aGenetic engineering 0aPKS 0aNRPS1 aBrakhage, Axel A.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2013 Jan. 20, v. 163 p.179-183dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.06.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01043naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245007400155300001800229520019600247592002800443650002300471650001200494650001300506700001200519700001800531773013300549856007400682852000900756655001200765IND60660203520221121230459.0190823e20140516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066020352DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc02256d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin10aMembrane-mediated cascade reactions by enzyme–polymer proteinosomes  ap. 6278-6280.  aProteinosomes comprising a triad of enzyme–polymer amphiphilic building blocks capable of operating together as a multi-step membrane-mediated cascade system are prepared and characterized.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aenzymes 3apolymers1 aLi, Mei1 aMann, Stephen0 tChemical communications.g2014 May 16, v. 50, no. 47 p.6278-6280dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc02256d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245010400206300001400310520143700324592002801761650001701789650001901806650001301825650002001838650001001858650001201868650001001880650001101890650001701901650001901918650001801937653001701955653001101972653001301983653001701996653001302013700002102026700002302047700002202070773011802092856008302210852000902293655001202302IND60582877020221118002752.0190405e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058287702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2017.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPage, Allen E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6023-923014aThe Impact of Training Regimen on the Inflammatory Response to Exercise in 2-Year-Old Thoroughbreds  ap. 78-83.  aPrevious work has demonstrated that 2-year-old horses in race training experience a decrease in inflammatory cytokine production as work at higher speeds progresses. The goal of this study was to determine whether training methods influence inflammatory gene production in 2-year-old horses; as such, two groups of horses trained using different high-speed training regimens (traditional, twice weekly, flat-track training on an all-weather surface vs. once weekly training on a grass track and regular work over undulating hills) were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood samples were obtained on a weekly basis to measure the in vivo inflammatory mRNA expression of 10 different markers. Relationships between the markers were analyzed, and an Inflammation Score (IS) created from the average of all 10 markers for comparison between the two different training groups. Overall, while there were multiple marker relationships between the groups that were expected based on established inflammatory pathways, there were also relationships seen only in one group instead of the other, including a novel, positively correlated relationship between IL-17 and VEGFA in the traditional training group. Additionally, over time, the traditionally-trained group experienced a significantly increased IS compared with the grass-trained group, demonstrating that some training regimens may induce more inflammation in horses than others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThoroughbred 3ablood sampling 3aexercise 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrasses 3ahills 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-17 3amessenger RNA 0aThoroughbred 0aRacing 0aTraining 0aInflammation 0aCytokine1 aStewart, John C.1 aHolland, Robert E.1 aHorohov, David W.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2017 Nov., v. 58 p.78-83dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2017.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013900169300001400308520168200322592002802004650001302032650001202045650001602057650001102073650001902084650003102103650001702134650002902151650000902180650002002189650001502209650001302224650002102237650000902258650002002267650002002287650001102307651001102318653001402329653002102343653001402364653003302378653002002411653003002431700006002461700002102521700001702542773010402559856008702663852000902750655001202759IND60526763520221118183355.0190410e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsson, Olle10aKeep that fire burning: Fuel supply risk management strategies of Swedish district heating plants and implications for energy security  ap. 70-77.  aRecent decades have seen a strong increase in bioenergy utilization in Sweden, from 52 TWh in 1983 to 128 TWh in 2013. Much of this increase has been achieved by replacing fossil fuels with different forms of bioenergy in district heating. Increased use of bioenergy is generally seen as key to reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security.However, replacing fossil fuels with solid biomass fuels in stationary heat and power generation entails significantly more complicated fuel supply logistics, with geographically scattered material associated with storage difficulties and low energy density. Given these risks and challenges and the key role of biomass-based district heating in the Swedish energy system, disturbances in fuel supply to district heating could potentially be an energy security issue.Through literature studies and interviews with employees at 18 district heating plants, we mapped present and future risks and risk management strategies in district heating supply in the Mälardalen region, south-east Sweden. We found that although small disturbances to fuel supply are not uncommon, the likelihood of heat supply failures due to fuel supply problems is low. Risk awareness is generally high among fuel supply managers, with widespread use of multilevel redundancies and diversification as key risk management strategies. However, fuel supply to plants is highly dependent on functioning truck transport and, consequently, availability of diesel fuel for trucks. Risk management can be strengthened further by implementation of forward-looking risk assessments that are less reliant on past experiences.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3aburning 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3ahuman resources 3ainterviews 3amanagers 3apower generation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk management 3atrucks 3aSweden 0aBioenergy 0aDistrict heating 0aLogistics 0aSupply chain risk management 0aEnergy security 0aClimate change adaptation1 aEriksson, Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1858-76851 aSjöström, Joar1 aAnerud, Erik0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 July, v. 90 p.70-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02087naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245016100133300001800294500001900312520075400331592002801085650004201113650001801155650004301173650001601216650002301232650003001255650002201285650001001307650001601317650001401333650001401347650000901361650001301370653001501383653002301398653001701421700001801438700001701456700001801473773015301491852000901644655001201653IND60723790520221121231855.0210117e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072379052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhutukade, K.

In this study, biocontrol agent Trichoderma was isolatedfrom tomato fields. The effect of Trichoderma isolates on resistance induction in tomato was evaluated in vitro and in vivo conditions. Results obtained showed that, in dual culture study all Trichoderma isolates inhibitory effect on growth of test fungus and were effective in controlling the growth of the pathogen. Disease incidence was reduced when Trichoderma isolates applied in combination with soil + seedling treatment. This result has important practical implications for biocontrol of tomato diseases under commercial conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 3aFusarium wilt 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aTrichoderma 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3adisease incidence 3afungi 3ametabolites 3apathogens 3aseedlings 3asoil 3atomatoes 0abiocontrol 0aTrichoderma viride 0aT. harzianum1 aDeokar, C.

Irradiated by purple light (407 nm) using triethylamine as an electron donor, a variety of 1,2-diols and 1,2-diamines could be prepared. The oxidation potential of the excited state of CBZ6 is established as −1.92 V (vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)). The relative high reductive potential enables the reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds and their derivatives. CBZ6 can be prepared in gram scale and is acid/base- or air-stable. It could be applied in large-scale photoreductive synthesis and recovered in high yield after the reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aimines 3amercurous chloride 3aoxidation 3atriethylamine1 aQu, Jian-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5002-55941 aKang, Yan-Biao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7537-46270 tOrganic letters.g2021 Apr. 02, v. 23, no. 8 p.2900-2903dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19216x1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.1c005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011200170300001600282520155000298592002801848650001901876650001601895650001601911650001701927650000901944650004301953650001801996650001402014650003102028650001402059650001502073650001102088650002002099653003102119653002202150653002802172653002002200653002002220653002102240700001902261700002202280773011402302856008402416852000902500655001202509IND60599202620221120100647.0180702e20140815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059920262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGritti, Fabrice10aParticle size distribution and column efficiency. An ongoing debate revived with 1.9μm Titan-C18 particles  ap. 179-192.  aThe mass transfer mechanism in four prototype columns (2.1 and 3.0×50mm, 2.1 and 3.0×100mm) packed with 1.9μm fully porous Titan-C18 particles was investigated by using two previously reported home-made protocols. The first one was used to measure the eddy dispersion HETP of these new columns, the second one to estimate their intrinsic (corrected for HPLC system contribution) HETPs. Titan particles are fully porous particles with a narrow particle size distribution (RSD of 9.2%). The mean Sauter diameter (dSauter=2.04μm) was determined from Coulter counter measurements on the raw silica material (before C18 derivatization) and in the absence of a dispersant agent (Triton X-100) in a 2% NaCl electrolyte solution. The results show that these RPLC Titan columns have intrinsic minimum reduced HETPs ranging from 1.7 to 1.9 and generate up to 290,000 plates per meter. The 3.0mm i.d. columns are more efficient than the 2.1mm i.d. ones and short columns are preferred to minimize efficiency losses due to frictional heating at high speeds. This work also revealed that (1) the lowest h values of the Titan columns are observed at low reduced velocities (νopt=5); (2) this is due to the unusually small diffusivity of analytes across the porous Titan-C18 particles; and (3) the Titan columns are not packed more uniformly than conventional columns packed with fully porous particles. Earlier and recent findings showing that the PSD has no direct physical impact on eddy dispersion and column efficiency are confirmed by these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3adiffusivity 3adispersants 3aelectrolytes 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass transfer 3aoctoxynol 3aparticle size distribution 3aprotocols 3aprototypes 3asilica 3asodium chloride 0aParticle size distribution 0aColumn efficiency 0aMass transfer mechanism 0aEddy dispersion 0aTitan particles 0an-Alkanophenones1 aBell, David S.1 aGuiochon, Georges0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Aug. 15, v. 1355 p.179-192dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012200167300001600289520214700305592002802452596005902480650001102539650001202550650001502562650002502577650002202602650001102624650001102635650002602646650002302672650002202695650001902717650002102736650001302757650001302770650001502783650001702798650001802815700001402833700001702847773012902864856008302993852000903076655001203085IND60750534020221120140050.0220421e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075053402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-021-05025-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Quanchao10aPlant litter quality regulates soil eco-enzymatic stoichiometry and microbial nutrient limitation in a citrus orchard  ap. 179-191.  aAIMS: The impacts associated with litter decomposition in intensive cropping on eco-enzymatic stoichiometry and microbial nutrient limitation are still under debate. METHODS: To evaluate the dynamics of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in response to different litter additions, we investigated the variations in soil nutrients (nitrate N, ammonium N, available P), carbon mineralization rate, soil microbial biomass, and extracellular eco-enzymatic activities (alkaline phosphatase enzyme, AP; β-1,4-glucosidase, BG; β-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, NAG; l-leucine aminopeptidase, LAP) of soils inoculated with different orchard litters (citrus leaf and alfalfa leaf) and their mixtures in a microcosm experiment. RESULTS: Litter addition improved soil nutrients and microbial biomass. During the plant litter decomposition process, soil BG and AP continuously increased in the first 7 days and then decreased, while NAG and ALP reached a peak at the 14th day and then continuously reduced. Litter type was the main factor controlling eco-enzymatic activities and the ratios of eco-enzymatic activities (stoichiometry). The additions of alfalfa leaf enhanced soil nutrients and eco-enzymatic activities more than citrus leaf alone. Enzyme vector analysis revealed that soil microbial communities were co-limited by C and P during litter decomposition. Enzyme vector analysis showed that all vector angles were > 45°, suggesting that soil microorganisms were more limited by P than by N during the decomposition process. Random forest model revealed that litter type, cumulative mineralized C, and microbial biomass were the best predictor of enzyme vector angle. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that soil microbial activity (microbial biomass and enzyme activities) was sensitive to litter decomposition in orchards, and litter additions would relieve microbial nutrient limitations in orchards. Alfalfa litter played positive roles in improving soil nutrients and regulating nutrient limitation in citrus orchards, which would help manage highly intensive cropping and develop organic orchards for smart farming.  aPublisher supplied data  a41977023cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aCitrus 3aalfalfa 3aalgorithms 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aammonium nitrogen 3acarbon 3aleaves 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aorchards 3aphosphorus 3aplant litter 3astoichiometry1 aChen, Zhe1 aTan, Wenfeng0 tPlant and soil.g2021 Sept., v. 466, no. 1-2 p.179-191dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl49373x0032-079X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-021-05025-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003700148245015600185300001400341520193700355592002802292650001202320650001702332650001502349650001102364650001702375650001202392650001502404650001602419650000902435650001302444650002102457653001502478653001502493653001602508653001102524653001502535653001202550700004102562700002902603700002702632700003002659700003502689700002902724773011802753856008302871852000902954655001202963IND60582877120221118002840.0190405e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058287712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2017.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Archundia, Adriana Yolanda10aEffects of Jejunal Manipulation During Surgical Laparotomy Techniques and Its Evaluation Using Physical, Clinical, and Echographic Parameters in Horses  ap. 40-46.  aThe laparotomy surgical procedure allows for the identification and correction of intestinal lesions associated with acute abdomen in horses. The clinician relies on various laparotomy techniques to diagnose and treat this syndrome, and to date, the postsurgical effects of these techniques have not been clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of jejunal manipulation during three laparotomy techniques through physical and clinical parameters and echography. Fifteen healthy horses were randomly assigned to three groups: animals in G1 (n = 5) were subjected to an exploratory laparotomy, animals in G2 (n = 5) to a laparotomy with an enterotomy, and animals in G3 (n = 5) to a laparotomy with an enterectomy. Degree of pain, jejunal wall thickness, and clinical parameters were evaluated before and after surgery. Horses in G3 had higher heart rates, respiratory frequency, degree of pain, and jejunal wall thickness compared with G1. Clinical variables during the postsurgical period were compared among the laparotomy techniques, and higher values of erythrocytes, leucocytes, neutrophils, and proteins were found in horses belonging to G3 compared to those in G1. Intestinal manipulation during the surgical procedure altered the physical and clinical parameters, as well as the results of the echography evaluation, with more significant effects from laparotomy with enterectomy. In the postsurgical period, the heart rate of horses in G3 was higher (P = .02) than the values obtained in G1 and G2. Upon the evaluation of degree of pain, statistically significant differences (P = .04) were identified between horses in G1 versus G3. G3 animals presented a higher degree of pain. Regarding the erythrocytes (L/L), higher values were measured in G3 (P = .001) in comparison with G1 and G2. These results suggest that meticulous tissue handling is essential to minimize intestinal trauma and inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3aerythrocytes 3aheart rate 3ahorses 3ainflammation 3ajejunum 3alaparotomy 3aneutrophils 3apain 3aproteins 3arespiratory rate 0aLaparotomy 0aEnterotomy 0aEnterectomy 0aEquine 0aEchography 0aJejunum1 aIbancovichi-Camarillo, José Antonio1 aRecillas-Morales, Sergio1 aVenebra-Muñoz, Arturo1 aCipriano-Salazar, Moisés1 aCórdova Izquierdo, Alejandro,1 aSánchez-Aparicio, Pedro0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2017 Nov., v. 58 p.40-46dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2017.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002100197245014400218300001800362506007600380520123700456592002801693506003701721650002101758650001701779650001001796650001901806650000901825650001101834650001801845650001401863650001301877650001701890650001401907650001501921700001901936700002201955700002101977700003701998700003402035700002002069700001902089773008702108856009002195852000902285655001202294IND60090407620221207120208.0141102e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009040762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.12.0522doi7 aPMC32865962pmcid7 a222455572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, Andrew R.14aThe resistance of breast cancer stem cells to conventional hyperthermia and their sensitivity to nanoparticle-mediated photothermal therapy  ap. 2961-2970.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBreast tumors contain a small population of tumor initiating stem-like cells, termed breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). These cells, which are refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are thought to persist following treatment and drive tumor recurrence. We examined whether BCSCs are similarly resistant to hyperthermic therapy, and whether nanoparticles could be used to overcome this resistance. Using a model of triple-negative breast cancer stem cells, we show that BCSCs are markedly resistant to traditional hyperthermia and become enriched in the surviving cell population following treatment. In contrast, BCSCs are sensitive to nanotube-mediated thermal treatment and lose their long-term proliferative capacity after nanotube-mediated thermal therapy. Moreover, use of this therapy in vivo promotes complete tumor regression and long-term survival of mice bearing cancer stem cell-driven breast tumors. Mechanistically, nanotube thermal therapy promotes rapid membrane permeabilization and necrosis of BCSCs. These data suggest that nanotube-mediated thermal treatment can simultaneously eliminate both the differentiated cells that constitute the bulk of a tumor and the BCSCs that drive tumor growth and recurrence.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreast neoplasms 3adrug therapy 3afever 3aheat treatment 3amice 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3anecrosis 3aradiotherapy 3aremission 3astem cells1 aSingh, Ravi N.1 aCarroll, David L.1 aWood, James C.S.1 aD’Agostino, Ralph B., Jr.cJr.1 aAjayan, P.

Quantitative evaluation of toxic impacts is a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, termed “toxic footprint” in this article. We ask whether calculation of toxic footprints is a useful method to steer the textile industry towards more sustainable use of chemicals. METHODS: Three different methods by which strategic product toxicity assessment can be performed within the context of LCA are illustrated and compared using a wet treatment process for a cotton T-shirt as the basis of a case study. The methods are the USEtox model chosen for the European Product Environmental Footprint work, the Score System presented in the European Commission’s Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for the Textiles Industry, and the Strategy Tool presented by Askham. The methods are compared in terms of their ease of use and whether the results give a consistent evaluation of a set of chemicals. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: New USEtox characterisation factors for textile chemicals were calculated and used for this article. The results show that the three methods do not give a consistent evaluation of the different wet treatment chemicals. Both the Score System and the Strategy Tool are very concerned with persistent contaminants such as the optical brightener in this case study, which is deemed to be less important by USEtox. The calculations also show how the results generated by the USEtox model depend on whether users apply (1) only the recommended characterisation factors or (2) these and the interim characterisation factors or (3) these and the new characterisation factors calculated for this article. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: With current policy initiatives such as the Product Environmental Footprint now being applied for textile products, toxicity assessment will by default be performed in the LCA of textiles. It is important that the results are relevant and representative as the intended users are supposed to take actions based on them. Confidence in the results is crucial for a scientific method, and therefore, this exploratory comparison exercise shows how benchmarking can be a tool to make the differences in background assumptions explicit, to better understand the differences in the results, and help create such confidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3abest available technology 3acase studies 3aclothing 3acotton 3aecological footprint 3afabrics 3aissues and policy 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3atextile industry 3atoxicity1 aPeters, Gregory M.0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2015 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.903-912dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0895-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245011900132300001800251500001900269520076100288592002801049650001401077650002001091650001301111650001001124650001001134650001801144650001701162650001301179650001101192650001301203650001101216650001101227651001001238653001201248653001801260653001501278653001401293700002601307700001701333773015301350852000901503655001201512IND60723790720221121221805.0210117e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072379072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhanderi, G.

It grows well in both summer and winter, and is thus both a rabi and kharif crop. The disease reduces yield through poor seed set and causes harvesting difficulties due to sticky honeydew on seed heads and also grain quality distress heavily due to the presence of the fungal bodies. An experiment was conducted at Sorghum Research Station, NAU, Surat (Gujarat) to find out the most effective fungicide for the control of ergot disease in sorghum. From the result analysis, the ergot incidence was found significantly lower in the treatment of Hexaconazole 5% SC @ 0.005% (18.30% & 16.85%) respectively in both the years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClaviceps 3aSorghum bicolor 3adistress 3aergot 3afungi 3agrain quality 3ahexaconazole 3ahoneydew 3apeople 3aseed set 3asummer 3awinter 3aIndia 0aSorghum 0aClaviceps sp. 0aFungicides 0aTreatment1 aSandipan, Prashant B.1 aPatel, K.

Detection and “reading” of long calls as well as ranging of calling individuals seem essential for this role. This study used sound propagation experiments to investigate habitat caused degradation of long calls of the Golden Lion Tamarin Leontopithecus rosalia and its implications for “reading” and ranging long calls of calling tamarins. The experiments were made in lowland, evergreen forest in Brazil. Synthesized copies of natural sounds were broadcast and re-recorded using different combinations of microphone and speaker heights of 2.0 and 7.5 m and distances of 2.5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 m. Excess attenuation, blurring, signal-to-noise ratio and energy of tail of echoes were quantified. The highest frequency sounds attenuated most at all distances, showing the lowest signal-to-noise ratio. The more effective sound propagation at 2.0 m (below the canopy and in the upper part of the dense undergrowth where they forage) facilitates reading of the information content of the long calls and hence their use for communication during foraging. Although the high degradation of the long calls with distance at microphone and speaker heights of 7.5 m (inside the canopy) constrains reading of the long calls' information content it does provide very good conditions for ranging and may be one of several reasons for why long-calling tamarins approach long-calling neighbours through dense vegetation for group encountering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeontopithecus rosalia 3aNeotropics 3abioacoustics 3acanopy 3acohesion 3adegradation 3adetection 3aenergy 3aevergreen forests 3aforaging 3afrequency 3ahabitats 3ainformation 3amicrophones 3areading 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asounds 3aspatial distribution 3atail 3aBrazil 0agolden lion tamarin 0along call 0asound degradation 0acommunication 0aranging cues1 aRUIZ-MIRANDA, CARLOS R.1 aDabelsteen, Torben,0 tBioacoustics.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 20, no. 2 p.137-158dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:21583x2165-05867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2011.97536403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245012000179520180300299592002802102650001302130650002402143650002202167650002602189650002502215650001302240650001202253650001202265650001702277650002302294650001502317650001402332650001602346650004802362650003702410650001102447650001302458650001802471650001402489650002102503651001102524653002502535653001302560653002402573653000902597653000702606653000802613653000902621700003602630700002702666700002802693700003502721700003302756700003602789700006702825773010302892856008602995852000903081655001203090IND60680743120221119160632.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068074312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1039672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Sharon Vieira dos10aRemarkable capacity of brosimine b to disrupt methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) preformed biofilms  aMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major public health concern representing about 60% of S. aureus isolated from hospitalized patients in countries such as USA and Brazil in the last years. Additionally, the ability to adhere to surfaces and the development of biofilms are important properties of pathogenic bacteria involved in medical device-associated infections, and staphylococci are recognized as the major etiologic agents in these situations. The aim of this study is to evaluate three Brosimum acutifolium flavonoids, 4′-hydroxy-7,8(2″,2″-dimethylpyran)flavan (1), brosimine b (2) and 4-hydroxy-lonchocarpin (3), regarding their antibiofilm, antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Flavonoids 1 and 2 were able to reduce S. aureus viability within preformed biofilms in 73% at 50 μM while 2 also reduced biofilm biomass in 48% at 100 μM. Flavonoid 3 was not able to reduce biofilm biomass at assessed concentrations. When tested against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 2 (100 μM) reduced 70%–98% of viable bacteria within 24h-old biofilms. The minimum inhibitory concentration against the methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25904 was 50 μM for the three compounds. In preliminary assays to evaluate cytotoxicity, 1 was highly hemolytic at concentrations above 50 μM while 2 and 3 did not cause significant hemolysis at 100 μM. The antioxidant activity was observed only in the ethanolic extract and 2. In vivo toxicity evaluations using Galleria mellonella larvae as alternative host model resulted in 83.3% survival for treatment with 1, 76.7% for 2, and 100% for 3 at 500 mg/kg. This study highlights the potential of these flavonoids, especially 2, as antibiofilm agent to control preformed S. aureus biofilms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrosimum 3aGalleria mellonella 3aalternative hosts 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3acytotoxicity 3aetiological agents 3aflavonoids 3ahemolysis 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amodels 3apatients 3apublic health 3aviability 3avirulent strains 3aBrazil 0aBrosimum acutifolium 0aMoraceae 0aBiofilm eradication 0aMRSA 0aEE 0aMHA 0aTSBG1 aCouto, Nádia Miléo Garcês de1 aBrust, Flávia Roberta1 aTrentin, Danielle Silva1 aSilva, Joyce Kelly Rosário da1 aArruda, Mara Silvia Pinheiro1 aGnoatto, Simone Cristina Baggio1 aMacedo, Alexandre José1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8951-40290 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Mar., v. 140 p.103967-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1039673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012100170300001500291520127000306592002801576650001701604650001501621650001501636650001901651650001401670650002801684650001101712650001501723650002301738653002801761653002401789653003301813653001701846653002401863653004001887700002201927773011301949856008402062852000902146655001202155IND60599202820221121035842.0180702e20140822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059920282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.06.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGritti, Fabrice10aCalculated and experimental chromatograms for distorted gradients and non-linear solvation strength retention models  ap. 96-104.  aComputer calculations of gradient chromatograms were performed by taking into account the adsorption behavior of the strong eluent in RPLC and the true Henry constant of the analytes. This improves the accuracy of classical gradient calculations, which all assume no affinity of the eluent modifier for the stationary phase and that the linear solvation strength model (LSSM) applies. The excess adsorption isotherm of acetonitrile with respect to water was measured by the minor disturbance method onto a Symmetry-C18 RPLC adsorbent. The variations of the Henry constants of a nine compound mixture with the volume fraction of acetonitrile in the aqueous mobile phase were measured. The equilibrium dispersive model of chromatography combined with orthogonal collocation on finite elements was used to calculate chromatograms of the sample mixture for four gradient times decreasing from 25 to 1min. The results predict a loss of resolution for the less retained analytes when the gradient times becomes smaller than 4min. They also predict that this behavior can be eliminated when applying a quadratic gradient profile rather than a classical linear gradient. The predictions were validated by the agreement between the calculated and experimental chromatograms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3achromatography 3acomputers 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3aprediction 3asorption isotherms 0aGradient chromatography 0aComputer simulation 0aEquilibrium dispersive model 0aAcetonitrile 0aDistorted gradients 0aNon-linear solvation strength model1 aGuiochon, Georges0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Aug. 22, v. 1356 p.96-104dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.06.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01468naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008600158300001800244520043300262592002800695650000800723650001400731650002300745650001100768650001800779650002700797650001200824700001800836700001500854700001600869700001600885773013400901856007401035852000901109655001201118IND60660203820221120112458.0190823e20140717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066020382DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc02267j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Guodong10aHeterogeneous copper-catalyzed hydroxylation of aryl iodides under air conditions  ap. 9072-9075.  aIn this work, the ligand-free heterogeneous copper Cu-g-C₃N₄ was synthesized and used for the hydroxylation of aryl iodides to synthesize phenols using cheap bases.

We used 16S rDNA pyrosequencing to describe microbiota of chicken legs. Ten samples representing a wide diversity of labels and MAP available on the market were collected from local supermarkets and stored at 4 °C. Microbiota were collected, total DNA was extracted, and V1-V3 fragment of 16S rRNA genes were amplified and sequenced. For data analysis several pipelines were compared. The Qiime pipeline was chosen to cluster reads and we used a database previously developed for a meat and fish microbial ecology study. Variability between samples was observed and a listing of bacteria present on chicken meat was established. The structure of the bacterial communities were compared with traditional cultural methods and validated with quantitative real time PCR. Brochothrix thermosphacta, Pseudomonas sp., and Carnobacterium sp. were dominant and the nature of the gas used for packaging influenced the relative abundance of each suggesting a MAP gas composition dependent competition between these species. We also noticed that slaughterhouse environment may influence the nature of the contaminants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3aCarnobacterium 3aPseudomonas 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3achicken meat 3achickens 3adatabases 3afish 3agenes 3alegs 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3apipelines 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3ashelf life 3aslaughterhouses 3asupermarkets 3aFrance 0aPyrosequencing 0aChicken meat 0aSpoilage 0aModified atmosphere packaging 0aMicrobiota1 aMoriceau, Nicolas1 aPrévost, Hervé,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9384-83821 aRemenant, Benoît1 aZagorec, Monique0 tFood microbiology.g2018 Apr., v. 70 p.7-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2017.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007400167300001600241500001500257520115800272592002801430650002101458650001101479650002001490650002501510650001901535650002001554650001601574650002201590650001001612650001401622650002101636650001601657653001001673653003101683653001901714653002101733653001301754653002501767700002101792700002201813700002501835773016101860856008202021852000902103655001202112IND60112417620221117104715.0190409e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011241762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2013.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyagi, Atsushi10aColor control of Japanese soy sauce (shoyu) using membrane technology  ap. 507-514.  a2019-12-04  aThe present study systemically decolorized soy sauce using a membrane process to analyze the separation mechanism. An ultrafiltration (UF) membrane (NTU-2120) exhibited only slight decolorization ability. A nanofiltration (NF) membrane with a lower molecular weight cut-off and produced by sulfonated polysulfone (NTR-7400 series) rather than polyvinyl alcohol/polyamide (NTR-7250) had higher decolorization ability. The NF membranes rejected total nitrogen by 17–24%, unsalted soluble solid content by 24–32%, reducing sugar by 25–43%, and amino acids by 10–25%. The NTR-7400 series membrane rejected lactic acid by 6–9%, and pyroglutamic acid by 11–21%; other quality indexes were maintained. In the NF membrane processes, higher rejection of acidic amino acids than neutral and base amino acids was observed. The separation performance was governed by the electrical effect as well as the sieve effect. Soy sauce color could be controlled by blending NF membrane-processed soy sauce with feed soy sauce. Color can be matched to preference in accordance with dishes by suitably blending NF membrane-processed soy sauce with feed soy sauce.  aPublisher supplied data 3anitrogen content 3amixing 3areducing sugars 3atotal soluble solids 3adecolorization 3aultrafiltration 3aamino acids 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3acolor 3asoy sauce 3amolecular weight 3alactic acid 0aColor 0aJapanese soy sauce (shoyu) 0asoluble solids 0aMembrane process 0aBlending 0aSeparation mechanism1 aSuzuki, Takayuki1 aNabetani, Hiroshi1 aNakajima, Mitsutoshi0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2013 Oct., v. 91, no. 4 p.507-514dElsevier B.V.aThe Institution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2013.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008500168520164600253592002801899650000801927650002601935650002601961650002801987650001302015650002102028650002202049650002002071650001402091650002602105650001102131650002602142650002202168650002002190650001702210650002002227650001402247650001902261653001102280653001602291700001202307700001302319700001402332700001502346700001702361700001902378700001602397700001402413773010302427856008602530852000902616655001202625IND60680743220221119160615.0200221e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068074322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1039702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yuanyuan10aUnusual features and molecular pathways of Staphylococcus aureus L-form bacteria  aStaphylococcus aureus can be converted to cell wall-deficient L-form bacteria in specific environment which is associated with recurrent and persistent infections. The biophysical properties and molecular basis involved in S. aureus L-form formation are poorly understood. Here, S. aureus unstable L-form model was established not only in Newman strain, but also in ATCC 25923 and five different antibiotic-resistant clinical strains, and the morphology and mechanical properties of Newman strain L-forms were characterized by using atomic force microscopy. Meanwhile, zeta potential, growth and proliferation properties, and hemolysis of L-forms were determined. Gene expression changes involved in transition from S. aureus wild type into L-forms were identified. Our studies showed that L-form S. aureus presented pleomorphism, rough surface, and higher elasticity modulus. L-forms were characterized by less surface charge and had higher hemolysis than the walled form. The S. aureus L-form “fried egg” colony was derived from a single bacterium rather than from aggregation of different bacterial cells. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that several pathways involved in energy metabolism, stress response, protein synthesis, RNA metabolism, and virulence were involved in L-form formation in S. aureus. Our results shed new light on the biological properties and mechanisms underlying L-form formation in S. aureus. These findings will not only be useful for understanding the unique properties and mechanisms of L-form bacteria, but also provide therapeutic targets for developing more effective treatments for S. aureus L-forms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotic resistance 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacteria 3achronic diseases 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression 3ahemolysis 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aprotein synthesis 3astress response 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptomics 3avirulence 3azeta potential 0aL-form 0aPersistence1 aYuping,1 aWang, Li1 aJing, Tao1 aChen, Jing1 aXu, Xiaogang1 aZhang, Wenhong1 aZhang, Ying1 aHan, Jian0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 Mar., v. 140 p.103970-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1039703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01224naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010200157300001800259520022700277592002800504650000800532650002300540650002000563650001700583650001900600650001500619700001200634700001800646700001800664773013300682856007400815852000900889655001200898IND60660203920221120112351.0190823e20140529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066020392DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc02273d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Quanbo10aRegulative peroxidase activity of DNA-linked hemin by graphene oxide for fluorescence DNA sensing  ap. 6714-6717.  aThe inhibition effect of graphene oxide toward the peroxidase activity of DNA-linked hemin was identified and conveniently utilized in the design of a homogenous fluorescence strategy for DNA sensing with high sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achemical reactions 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3agraphene oxide 3aperoxidase1 aXu, Nan1 aLei, Jianping1 aJu, Huangxian0 tChemical communications.g2014 May 29, v. 50, no. 51 p.6714-6717dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc02273d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012600213300002000339520192400359592002802283650001602311650002902327650002202356650001102378650001202389650001102401650001102412650002502423650002502448650001702473650001202490650001802502650001402520650001902534650001302553650001002566650002102576650001602597650001502613700006902628700002902697773015502726856008302881852000902964655001202973IND60786943120221122004608.0220827e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078694312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19720-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuoneke, Obumneke Bob1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7314-983210aAgriculture, globalization, and ecological footprint: the role of agriculture beyond the tipping point in the Philippines  ap. 54652-54676.  aThis study is hinged on analyzing factors such as agriculture and globalization (de jure trade and financial) that threaten a sustainable environment using two proxies of ecological footprint: carbon and noncarbon ecological footprint in the Philippines while controlling for the influence of fossil to GDP, economic growth, urban population, and financial development using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework. The result provides evidence of long‐run stable state among the variables. The result validates inverted U‐shaped pattern of EKC involving relationship between agricultural development and ecological footprint for the Philippines indicating that initially, ecological footprint increases as the agriculture develops and then declines as the agriculture matures to generate efficiency and low carbon. In addition, this study explores elasticities of the variables using ARDL, FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR procedure and found that de jure financial globalization exerts positive influence on ecological footprint in the long run. De jure trade globalization is found to be negative and significant in the long run. It is also found that agricultural level operates below the threshold level required to maximize the growth benefits of agricultural system towards mitigating environmental sustainability. Further empirical result shows a positive relationship between economic growth, fossil fuel, urban-population growth, and ecological footprint, and negative insignificant relationship between credit to private sector and ecological footprint. The government should optimize the use of agricultural land through well-articulated economic integration strategy fashioned to pave way for cleaner and low-carbon technologies sources like solar, geothermal, biomass, biogas, tidal power, photovoltaic, and wind energy in the agricultural production to avoid further deterioration of the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhilippines 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural land 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acredit 3aecological footprint 3aeconomic development 3afossil fuels 3afossils 3aglobalization 3apollution 3aprivate sector 3aresearch 3atrade 3aurban population 3awater power 3awind power1 aOkere, Kingsley Ikechukwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1845-45831 aNwaeze, Chinwendu Nnamdi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 36 p.54652-54676dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19720-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024002200115024001900137040001800156100002300174245008600197300001300283520127500296592002801571650003101599650001301630650001501643650002301658650001901681650001601700650001401716650000901730650000901739650001901748700002401767773014601791856006701937856009902004990002302103852000902126655001202135IND60643373820221119084828.0190510e20071101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064337382DNAL7 a10.3791/4092doi7 aPMC25663262pmcid7 a189894492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatheu, Melanie P.10aIsolation of cd4+ t cells from mouse lymph nodes using miltenyi macs purification  ap. e409.  aIsolation of cells from the primary source is a necessary step in many more complex protocols. Miltenyi offers kits to isolate cells from several organisms including humans, non-human primates, rat and, as we describe here, mice. Magnetic bead-based cell separation allows for either positive selection (or cell depletion) as well as negative selection. Here, we demonstrate negative selection of untouched or na ve CD4+ helper T cells. Using this standard protocol we typically purify cells that are ≥ 96% pure CD4+/CD3+. This protocol is used in conjunction with the protocol Dissection and 2-Photon Imaging of Peripheral Lymph Nodes in Mice published in issue 7 of JoVE, for purification of T cells and other cell types to adoptively transfer for imaging purposes. Although we did not demonstrate FACS analysis in this protocol video, it is highly recommended to check the overall purity of isolated cells using the appropriate antibodies via FACS. In addition, we demonstrate the non-sterile method of T cell isolation. If sterile cells are needed for your particular end-user application, be sure to do all of the demonstrated procedures in the tissue culture hood under standard sterile conditions.

How rural providers respond to CDS developed for urban hospitals could shed light on extending CDS to resource‐limited settings. METHODS: ePNa was deployed into 10 rural and critical access hospital emergency departments (EDs) in Utah and Idaho in 2018. We reviewed pneumonia cases identified through ICD‐10 codes after local deployment to measure ePNa utilization and guideline adherence. ED providers were surveyed to assess quantitative and qualitative aspects of satisfaction. FINDINGS: ePNa was used in 109/301 patients with pneumonia (36%, range 0%‐67% across hospitals) and was associated with appropriate antibiotic selection (93% vs 65%, P < .001). Fifty percent of survey recipients responded, 87% were physicians, 87% were men, and the median ED experience was 10 years. Mean satisfaction with ePNa was 3.3 (range 1.7‐4.8) on a 5‐point Likert scale. Providers with a favorable opinion of ePNa were more likely to favor implementation of additional CDS (P = .005). Satisfaction was not associated with provider type, age, years of experience or experience with ePNa. Ninety percent of respondents provided qualitative feedback. The most common theme in high and low utilization hospitals was concern about usability. Compared to high utilization hospitals, low utilization hospitals more frequently identified concerns about adaptation for local needs. CONCLUSIONS: ePNa deployment to rural and critical access EDs was moderately successful and associated with improved antibiotic use. Concerns about usability and adapting ePNa for local use predominated the qualitative feedback.  aPublisher supplied data  a5T32HL105321cIntermountain Office of Research and National Institutes of Health Ruth L.

It was anticipated that this change in practice would have implications for other pests and pathogens affecting the crop. Use of net covers appeared to be the most effective approach and plot experiments confirmed that covers reduce damage by D. radicum considerably. The covers had less impact on feeding damage to foliage by Phyllotreta spp. and no impact on the prevalence of lesions believed to be caused by Peronospora parasitica. Despite the apparent effectiveness of the covers there were still incidents of high levels of damage by D. radicum in commercial crops. Possible reasons were investigated and, in particular, it appeared that the production system, where several crops were sown sequentially in the same piece of land, allowed infestations to develop from eggs laid on waste radish which remained after the crop was harvested and from where larvae moved onto the new crop. The study has shown clearly that a good understanding of pest biology is fundamental to developing an effective integrated approach to crop protection and that changing management approaches for one pest species may have implications for the management of others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelia radicum 3aPeronospora parasitica 3aPhyllotreta 3aRaphanus sativus 3aintegrated pest management 3alarvae 3aleaves 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3apathogens 3apests 3aplant protection 3aradishes 3awastes 0aDelia radicum 0aRadish 0aPhyllotreta spp. 0aIntegrated pest management1 aMoorhouse, Edwin R.1 aJukes, Andrew1 aElliott, Marian S.1 aCollier, Rosemary H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8519-952X0 tCrop protection.g2018 Dec., v. 114 p.148-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2018.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245023100167300002000398520160900418592002802027650001502055650001402070650001302084650001602097650002102113650002102134650001402155650001302169650001102182650001102193651001302204700002602217700005802243773015502301856008302456852000902539655001202548IND60786943220221121235536.0220827e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078694322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-022-19690-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhelev, Zhivko10aAre there correlations between the levels of fluctuating asymmetry in Pelophylax ridibundus (Anura: Ranidae) meristic morphological traits and morphological parameters used for assessing their physical fitness (health status)?  ap. 54677-54687.  aThe degree of developmental stability of individuals and populations is most often estimated by their level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) — the random deviations from perfect symmetry. In our previous work, we recorded high levels of FA (FAMI index: frequency of asymmetric manifestation of an individual) in Pelophylax ridibundus populations that inhabit biotopes at Sazliyka River, south Bulgaria with high levels of anthropogenic pollution (domestic sewage pollution). At the same time, in the biotopes located in the upper reaches of the river (less disrupted habitats), the populations showed low levels of FA. Currently, we present the results of the study of the values of several morphological parameters: snout-vent length (SVL), body weight (BW), and body condition factor (CF) in the same populations of P. ridibundus. In addition, we evaluate the correlation between the values of these morphological parameters and the values of fluctuating asymmetry (the FAMI index), using the Kendall rank correlation analysis. The analysis of the relationships between the parameters characterizing the physical fitness of frogs and the indicator of developmental stability — the FAMI index — did not establish statistically significant correlations in the analyses in the whole groups of P. ridibundus from each site and in the correlations between sexes. We believe that the approaches to the study of developmental stability (analysis of fluctuating asymmetry levels) and those related to the assessment of physical fitness (health status) of frogs should be applied independently of each other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelophylax 3aasymmetry 3abiotopes 3abody weight 3acondition factor 3aphysical fitness 3apollution 3aresearch 3arivers 3asewage 3aBulgaria1 aT︠S︡onev, Stefan,1 aMollov, Ivelin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9022-896X0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 36 p.54677-54687dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19690-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003800150245009400188300001600282520150900298592002801807650002601835650002801861650003001889650001501919650000901934650001001943650001601953650001601969650002101985650003002006650002502036650001602061650001902077650001002096650001502106650001102121650001302132653002302145653001602168653002502184700002402209700007502233700002402308700003302332700002902365700003102394773009902425856008502524852000902609655001202618IND60614449320221122175828.0190318e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061444932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2018.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasu, Érica das Graças Carvalho10aPochonia chlamydosporia applied via seed treatment for nematode control in two soil types  ap. 106-112.  aThe treatment of seeds with biological control agents is one of the most convenient methods of introducing microorganisms into the root environment. Pochonia chlamydosporia is a promising biological control agent of plant-parasitic nematodes and a good root colonizer. Seed treatment with this fungus would make its application viable for soybean and grain crops. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the influence of soil texture under the development of P. chlamydosporia applied as a seed dressing to control Meloidogyne incognita in soybean greenhouse. Soybean seeds treated with P. chlamydosporia were sown in PVC (55 cm × 10 cm) tubes containing clayey or sandy soil infested with M. incognita eggs. Sixty days after sowing, the tubes were sectioned into four parts (0.0–12.5, 12.5–25.0, 25.0–37.5, and 37.5–50.0 cm of length) to evaluate the percolation and multiplication of P. chlamydosporia at four different soil depths. The development of P. chlamydosporia in the absence of the nematode was also evaluated. It was possible to verify soil colonization by P. chlamydosporia throughout the profile of both soils tested. The fungus was able to percolate in the soil up to at least 50 cm depth and was efficient in controlling M. incognita in both sandy and clayey soils; however, in the sandy soil, the fungus presented greater colonization and percolation, which may explain why it is more efficient in controlling the nematode when applied in sandy soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aPochonia chlamydosporia 3abiological control agents 3aclay soils 3aeggs 3afungi 3agrain crops 3agreenhouses 3anematode control 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3asandy soils 3aseed dressings 3aseeds 3asoil depth 3asowing 3asoybeans 0aBiological control 0aGlycine max 0aNematophagous fungus1 aAmora, Deisy Xavier1 aMonteiro, Thalita Suelen Avelar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5248-50011 aAlves, Paula Soares1 ade Podestá, Guilherme Silva1 aFerreira, Fernanda Carla1 ade Freitas, Leandro Grassi0 tCrop protection.g2018 Dec., v. 114 p.106-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2018.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001900158245012200177300001600299520103000315592002801345650000901373650001201382650001201394650001201406650001301418650000901431700002101440773008101461856007301542852000901615655001201624IND60082178220221119062136.0141017e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008217822DNAL7 a251858662pmid7 a10.1002/zoo.211732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlukhova, Alla10aSuckling behavior in Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx L.) cubs: Characteristics and correlation with competitive interactions  ap. 388-393.  aThere is substantial evidence in the literature that the offspring of many mammal species prefer a particular pair of nipples. There is also a definite “nipple order” in individual litters in which each young predominantly uses one or two particular nipples. In combination with early competitive interactions, such “constancy” can play an important role in the social development of the young. In this study, we reveal an unequal use of different pairs of mothers' nipples by 42 Eurasian lynx cubs in 16 litters and investigate the relationship of this phenomenon with the early competitive interactions of the cubs and their physical development. For the lynx cubs, the most often used pair of nipples is the middle pair. There is also definite “nipple order” in each litter.

As expected, the amounts of ovarian lipids, proteins, and glycogen increased significantly from previtellogenesis to vitellogenesis and then, diminished during atresia. However, lipids and protein stores found at the atretic stages were higher in comparison to those registered at previtellogenesis. Specific lipid staining of ovarian tissue sections evidenced remarkable changes in the shape, size, and distribution of lipid droplets throughout the reproductive cycle. The role of lipophorin (Lp) as a yolk protein precursor was analyzed by co‐injecting Lp‐OG (where OG is Oregon Green) and Lp‐DiI (where DiI is 1,10‐dioctadecyl‐3,3,30,30‐tetramethylindocarbocyanine) to follow the entire particle, demonstrating that both probes colocalized mainly in the yolk bodies of vitellogenic oocytes. Immunofluorescence assays also showed that Lp was associated to yolk bodies, supporting its endocytic pathway during vitellogenesis. The involvement of Lp in lipid delivery to oocytes was investigated in vivo by co‐injecting fluorescent probes to follow the fate of the entire particle (Lp‐DiI) and its lipid cargo (Lp‐Bodipy‐FA). Lp‐DiI was readily incorporated by vitellogenic oocytes and no lipoprotein uptake was observed in terminal follicles of ovaries at atretic stages. Bodipy‐FA was promptly transferred to vitellogenic oocytes and, to a much lesser extent, to previtellogenic follicles and to oocytes of ovarian tissue at atretic stages. Colocalization of Lp‐DiI and Lp‐Bodipy‐FA inside yolk bodies indicated the relevance of Lp in the buildup of lipid and protein oocyte stores during vitellogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3avitellogenesis 3alipophorin 3aoocytes 3aglycogen 3aabnormal development 3adroplets 3alipid metabolism 3aanimal ovaries 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aDipetalogaster 3aOregon 0aHemiptera1 aFruttero, Leonardo L.1 aAguirre, Silvina A.1 aCanavoso, Lilián E.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2014 Nov., v. 87, no. 3 p.148-163dAlan R.

However, there is limited evidence linking these scores with patient outcomes or other metrics, including the need for interfacility transfer. This study aims to determine the association of pediatric readiness scores with the odds of interfacility transfer among a cohort of noninjured children (< 18 years old) presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in small rural hospitals in the state of California. METHODS: Data from the National Pediatric Readiness Project assessment were linked with the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development's ED and inpatient databases to conduct a cross‐sectional study of pediatric interfacility transfers. Hospitals were manually matched between these data sets. Logistic regression was performed with random intercepts for hospital and adjustment for patient‐level confounders. FINDINGS: A total of 54 hospitals and 135,388 encounters met the inclusion criteria. EDs with a high pediatric readiness score (>70) had lower adjusted odds of transfer (aOR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33–0.93) than EDs with a low pediatric readiness score (≤ 70). The pediatric readiness section with strongest association with transfer was the “policies, procedures, and protocols” section; EDs in the highest quartile had lower odds of transfer than EDs in the lowest quartile (aOR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31–0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients presenting to EDs at small rural hospitals with high pediatric readiness scores may be less likely to be transferred. Additional studies are recommended to investigate other pediatric outcomes in relation to hospital ED pediatric readiness.  aPublisher supplied data  aKL2 TR001859cNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences  aTL1 TR001861cNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences  aUL1 TR001860cNational Center for Advancing Translational Sciences  aH3AMC24073cHealth Resources and Services Administration 3across-sectional studies 3ahospitals 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arural health 3aCalifornia1 aMarcin, James P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7281-69471 aSigal, Ilana S.1 aHaynes, Sarah C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5399-97251 aDayal, Parul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0503-93371 aTancredi, Daniel J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3884-79071 aGausche‐Hill, Marianne1 aMouzoon, Jamie L.1 aRomano, Patrick S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6749-39791 aRosenthal, Jennifer L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5543-47090 tJournal of rural health.g2022 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.293-302dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44673x0890-765X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.125663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245017000167300002000337520142500357592002801782650001701810650001201827650002201839650002101861650001401882650001401896650003701910700001901947700001901966700002601985700002202011700002502033700005902058773013802117856008002255852000902335655001202344IND60671584020221122100552.0191003e20190830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067158402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b068252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClare, Laurie A.14aThe Role of H-Bonding in Nonconcerted Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer: Explaining the Voltammetry of Phenylenediamines in the Presence of Weak Bases in Acetonitrile  ap. 23390-23402.  aThe kinetics of many proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions cannot be adequately described by stepwise proton and electron transfer. Concerted electron–proton transfer (CPET) is another possibility, but examples exist where stepwise mechanisms are not viable yet there is no compelling evidence for CPET. This study investigates such a reaction, the oxidation of an NH-containing phenylenediamine radical cation, H₂PD⁺, in the presence of pyridines in acetonitrile, using CV and UV/vis spectroelectrochemistry. As observed previously, the E₁/₂ for the radical oxidation jumps to a considerably more negative potential upon addition of 1 equiv of pyridine. The CV wave broadens but stays chemically reversible. Further addition of pyridine leads to smaller E₁/₂ shifts with continued reversibility. Different explanations have been put forth for this behavior; however, this study provides strong evidence that the E₁/₂ shift can be completely explained by the overall reaction being H₂PD⁺ + pyr – e– → HPD⁺ + Hpyr⁺. Classic stepwise proton–electron transfer cannot explain the reversibility, but it can be explained by a “wedge” scheme mechanism in which electron and proton transfer occurs in a stepwise fashion within the H-bond complex formed as an intermediate in proton transfer. This result points to the important role H-bonding may play in PCET even without CPET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3acations 3aelectron transfer 3ahydrogen bonding 3aoxidation 3apyridines 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aPham, Tammy D.1 aRafou, Lily A.1 aBuenaventura, Ayla G.1 aScott, Tiffany R.1 aMikhaylova, Veronika1 aSmith, Diane K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8650-53460 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 30, v. 123, no. 38 p.23390-23402dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b068253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245014800162300002000310500001900330520185100349592002802200650001502228650001502243650002502258650001502283650001902298650001102317650001702328650002202345650002302367700005202390773011602442856008402558852000902642655001202651IND60719270620221120025626.0201201e20201117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071927062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c029382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Kai10aTheoretical and Experimental Investigation on the Moisture Sorption Kinetics of a PVA/LiCl Composite Membrane in a Dynamic Humidity Environment  ap. 14453-14460.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe PVA/LiCl composite membrane is an important material with a selective permeation to moisture. In this study, the sorption kinetics characteristics of the PVA/LiCl composite membrane are investigated in a dynamic humidity environment. The sorption kinetics curves of the PVA/LiCl composite membranes with different LiCl contents were measured in the range from 10 to 90% relative humidity, and the kinetics characteristics of the sorption components of the total moisture uptake were analyzed with a triple-mode sorption model. The results show that the process of pooling adsorption occurs only when the amount of Henry absorption exceeds a threshold. With the increase in LiCl content, the threshold gradually decreases, indicating that introducing LiCl in the membrane mainly affects the process of pooling adsorption. In the desorption part of the kinetics curve, the amounts of Henry absorption and pooling adsorption gradually decrease, while the moisture adsorbed by the hydrophilic hydroxyls, i.e., the amount of Langmuir adsorption, is still largely retained in the membrane, resulting in the water-retaining performance in a low-humidity environment. It is noteworthy that in a high-humidity environment, the amounts of Henry absorption and Langmuir adsorption are almost evenly distributed in the film, while the amount of pooling adsorption near the surface is significantly higher than that at the center. The reason is that with the increase in humidity, the rate of pooling adsorption near the surface increases significantly, resulting in the majority of the moisture diffusing into the dense membrane clusters near the surface. The established theoretical method and model parameters can be adopted to predict the moisture sorption and desorption processes of the PVA/LiCl composite membrane in a dynamic humidity environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aasymmetric membranes 3adesorption 3ahydrophilicity 3amodels 3apermeability 3arelative humidity 3asorption isotherms1 aYe, Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1366-18580 tLangmuir.g2020 Nov. 17, v. 36, no. 47 p.14453-14460dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c029383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01689naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009700160300001600257520071300273592002800986653000901014653001701023653001401040653001401054653001201068700002101080700002301101700001501124773015001139856007701289852000901366655001201375IND60522391020221122064223.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052239102DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2011-03042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBöhme, Bodo10aApplication of n-Dodecyltrimethylammonium Chloride for the Oxidation of Intermetallic Phases  ap. 230-238.  aThe thermal decomposition products of ionic liquids based on n-dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) were used for the preparation of the metastable allotrope Ge(cF136) by oxidation of Na₁₂Ge₁₇ in gas-solid reactions.

This study examined the role of perceptions of social norms on the relationship between body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Perceptions of descriptive and injunctive peer norms, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating were examined in a non-clinical sample of college men and women using cross-sectional survey methods. For women, perceptions of the injunctive norms of peer thinness and peer acceptability moderated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and disordered eating with an additive effect; perceptions of the descriptive norm peer prevalence of disordered eating behaviors did not. In men, norms did not moderate the relationship between body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Endorsement of injunctive norms is associated with reported disordered eating in women with high body dissatisfaction. Norm-based interventions may be best suited for women with high body dissatisfaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3acollege students 3across-sectional studies 3aeating disorders 3aeating habits 3amen 3arisk factors 3asocial behavior 3awomen 2aAdult 2aBody Imagexpsychology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxpsychology. 2aFeeding Behaviorxpsychology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSex Factors 2aSocial Perception 2aStudentsxpsychology 2aUniversities 2aYoung Adult1 aWard, Rose Marie0 tEating behaviors.g2013 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.73-78dElsevier Ltdx1471-01537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2012.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015900170300001600329520127300345592002801618650001501646650001001661650001101671650001101682650002001693650001801713650001201731650001601743650002201759650001501781650003401796650002201830650002101852653001901873653003201892653001901924653000901943653000901952700001301961700001501974700001701989700001402006700001802020700001902038700005802057773012902115856008602244852000902330655001202339IND60619625720221119004310.0210114e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061962572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoqing10aGreen chemical method for the synthesis of chromogenic fiber and its application for the detection and extraction of Hg2+ and Cu2+ in environmental medium  ap. 339-348.  aTo advocate environment friendly detection idea, we adopted the green chemical method to synthesis the 1-(2 amino ethyl) piperidine functionalized polyacrylonitrile fiber (APF) and the chromogenic fiber 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (APF-PAR). The APF has high adsorption selectivity of Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺, and the change of structure, surface morphology and thermo-stability before and after adsorption have been characterized by the infrared spectra, scanning electron microscope and thermogravimetric analysis. The APF achieved the adsorption equilibrium of Hg²⁺ just in 25 min and the adsorption capacity is 435.1 mg/g, while the adsorption equilibrium of Cu²⁺ costs 30 min and the adsorption capacity is 141.7 mg/g. The chromogenic fiber APF-PAR can recognize the Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺ in 2 s, which benefits from the rapid mass transfer and small fluid resistance of the chelating PAN fiber. The color changed from orange to purplish red due to the variation of HOMO-LOMO energy gaps during the reaction which confirmed by the UV–vis absorption spectrum. It also has high selectivity and excellent adsorption performance, which provides more convenient, accurate, reliable and faster testing methods of Hg²⁺ and Cu²⁺ in environmental medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acolor 3acopper 3aenergy 3agreen chemistry 3amass transfer 3amercury 3apiperidines 3apolyacrylonitrile 3aresorcinol 3ascanning electron microscopes 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 0aGreen chemical 0aChromogenic chelating fiber 0aFast detection 0aHg2+ 0aCu2+1 aLou, Yan1 aYe, Xinyan1 aChen, Xuedan1 aFang, Lei1 aZhai, Yinghao1 aZheng, Yuqiang1 aXiong, Chunhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8695-19120 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 364 p.339-348dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008700158300001800245520122400263592002801487650001401515650001201529650001301541650001101554650001901565650002401584650001301608700001801621700001301639700001801652700001401670700001301684700001901697700001201716700001601728700001501744773014201759856007501901852000901976655001201985IND60769682220221119143448.0220309e20220308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076968222DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta10805k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Dezhou10aCa-ion modified vanadium oxide nanoribbons with enhanced Zn-ion storage capability  ap. 5614-5619.  aVanadates with high theoretical capacity and various crystal structures are deemed promising layered cathode materials for aqueous Zn ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, their capacity and rate properties are still unsatisfactory as a result of their slow electron and ion transport rate. In this work, we report a one-pot hydrothermal method to introduce the divalent Ca-ion into V₃O₇ (CVO) nanoribbons, which markedly boosts their Zn-ion storage capacity and rate capability. The introduction of Ca²⁺ can remarkably enhance the conductivity and expand the interlayer spacing of V₃O₇ (VO), enabling a swift diffusion of Zn²⁺ and transfer of electrons. Hence, the Zn//CVO battery based on the CVO cathode obtained a satisfactory capacity of 432.3 mA h g⁻¹ at a current density of 1 A g⁻¹, excellent rate performance (165.5 mA h g⁻¹ at 10 A g⁻¹), and good cycle life (78.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles). Furthermore, the fabricated Zn//CVO battery delivered a high energy density of 340.0 W h kg⁻¹ and a peak power density of 8.7 kW kg⁻¹. This Ca²⁺ modification strategy may provide a new approach to the design and synthesis of other layered transition metal oxides for energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acalcium 3acathodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahot water treatment 3avanadium1 aPei, Xiaokang1 aLin, Hai1 aTang, Hongwei1 aSong, Yin1 aFeng, Qi1 aWang, Guangxia1 aXu, Wei1 aWang, Fuxin1 aLu, Xihong0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Mar. 8, v. 10, no. 10 p.5614-5619dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta10805k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002600113040001800139100002100157245011600178300001600294520178100310592002802091650002902119650001302148650002102161650001002182650001402192650002002206650002802226650002402254650002002278650002002298700001502318700002302333700002302356773007102379856007202450852000902522655001202531IND60082178720221119061937.0141017e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008217872DNAL7 a250884742pmid7 a10.1002/yea.30322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharmin, Dilruba10aEffects of deletion of different PP2C protein phosphatase genes on stress responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 393-409.  aA key mechanism of signal transduction in eukaryotes is reversible protein phosphorylation, mediated through protein kinases and protein phosphatases (PPases). Modulation of signal transduction by this means regulates many biological processes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 40 PPases, including seven protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C PPase) genes (PTC1–PTC7). However, their precise functions remain poorly understood. To elucidate their cellular functions and to identify those that are redundant, we constructed 127 strains with deletions of all possible combinations of the seven PP2C PPase genes. All 127 disruptants were viable under nutrient‐rich conditions, demonstrating that none of the combinations induced synthetic lethality under these conditions. However, several combinations exhibited novel phenotypes, e.g. the Δptc5Δptc7 double disruptant and the Δptc2Δptc3Δptc5Δptc7 quadruple disruptant exhibited low (13°C) and high (37°C) temperature‐sensitive growth, respectively. Interestingly, the septuple disruptant Δptc1Δptc2Δptc3Δptc4Δptc5Δptc6Δptc7 showed an essentially normal growth phenotype at 37°C. The Δptc2Δptc3Δptc5Δptc7 quadruple disruptant was sensitive to LiCl (0.4 m). Two double disruptants, Δptc1Δptc2 and Δptc1Δptc4, displayed slow growth and Δptc1Δptc2Δptc4 could not grow on medium containing 1.5 m NaCl. The Δptc1Δptc6 double disruptant showed increased sensitivity to caffeine, congo red and calcofluor white compared to each single deletion. Our observations indicate that S. cerevisiae PP2C PPases have a shared and important role in responses to environmental stresses. These disruptants also provide a means for exploring the molecular mechanisms of redundant PTC gene functions under defined conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acaffeine 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein phosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3asodium chloride 3astress response1 aSasano, Yu1 aSugiyama, Minetaka1 aHarashima, Satoshi0 tYeast.g2014 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.393-409dWileyx0749-503X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.30323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011900166300002000285520114600305592002801451650001901479650001201498650001401510650001301524650001301537650002101550650001901571650001301590650001301603650001301616650002301629650001101652700002001663700006101683700005901744700002201803700002401825700002401849700001701873700001601890700006101906700006301967773013902030856008002169852000902249655001202258IND60671584120221122072829.0191003e20190904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067158412DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b069512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchikawa, Shota10aDielectric and Sorption Responses of Hydrogen-Bonding Network of Amorphous C₆₀(OH)₁₂ and C₆₀(OH)₃₆  ap. 23545-23553.  aHydrophilic fullerene derivatives of C₆₀(OH)₁₂ (1) and C₆₀(OH)₃₆ (2) bearing different numbers of −OH groups formed amorphous solids of 1·x(H₂O) (x = 5–10) and 2·x(H₂O) (x = 15–22), respectively, according to the humidity. The thermally activated dynamic molecular motion of polar H₂O was confirmed in the DSC and dielectric spectra. Three-dimensional O–H···O hydrogen-bonding networks in amorphous 1 and 2 produced extrinsic adsorption–desorption pores with a hydrophilic environment posed by −OH groups, where N₂, CO₂, H₂, and CH₄ gases vapors and polar H₂O, MeOH, and EtOH molecules reversibly adsorbed into the networks. The molecular motion of polar H₂O was directly observed in dielectric enhancement and protonic conductivity in three-dimensional O–H···O hydrogen-bonding networks. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of amorphous 1 and 2 were 315 and 351 m² g–¹, respectively, from the CO₂ sorption isotherms.

Understanding the spatial and temporal scale of population structure is therefore fundamental for empirical population genetics – and of interest in itself, as it yields insights into the history and biology of a species. In this study we extend the genomic resources for the wild Mediterranean grass Brachypodium distachyon to investigate the scale of population structure and its underlying history at whole‐genome resolution. A total of 86 accessions were sampled at local and regional scales in Italy and France, which closes a conspicuous gap in the collection for this model organism. The analysis of 196 accessions, spanning the Mediterranean from Spain to Iraq, suggests that the interplay of high selfing and seed dispersal rates has shaped genetic structure in B. distachyon. At the continental scale, the evolution in B. distachyon is characterized by the independent expansion of three lineages during the Upper Pleistocene. Today, these lineages may occur on the same meadow yet do not interbreed. At the regional scale, dispersal and selfing interact and maintain high genotypic diversity, thus challenging the textbook notion that selfing in finite populations implies reduced diversity. Our study extends the population genomic resources for B. distachyon and suggests that an important use of this wild plant model is to investigate how selfing and dispersal, two processes typically studied separately, interact in colonizing plant species.  aPublisher supplied data  cSwiss National Science Foundation  cUniversity of Zurich Research priority program "Evolution in Action" 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aPleistocene epoch 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenomics 3agrasses 3ameadows 3amodels 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3aseed dispersal 3aselfing 3atemporal variation 3awild plants 3aFrance 3aIraq 3aItaly 3aSpain1 aGimmi, Elena L.1 aWyler, Michele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1097-53221 aBakali, Abdelmonaim H.1 aSkalska, Aleksandra1 aHasterok, Robert1 aMur, Luis A.

The results show trimodal distributions of V, Ni, and S compounds in the crude oils and residues. V and Ni compounds are present in both resins and asphaltenes. Trimodal distributions are clearly apparent in the resins but not apparent in the asphaltenes. In the latter, the predominant compounds have a high molecular weight (HMW), even when the solution of asphaltenes is diluted by 40000-fold. In the resins, compounds with a medium molecular weight (MMW) were expected; however, HMW compounds were observed, indicating that nanoaggregates or large molecules exist in both the asphaltenes and resins. Low-molecular-weight (LMW) compounds are predominantly present in the resins and do not represent more than 22% of V and Ni present in crude oil. These compounds appear to have molecular weights similar to simple metalloporphyrins.  aPublisher supplied data 3agel chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3anickel 3apetroleum 3aresins 3asulfur 3avanadium1 aVargas, Vicmary1 aFeo, Llinaber1 aCastellano, Olga1 aCastillo, Jimy1 aGiusti, Pierre1 aAcavedo, Socrates1 aLienemann, Charles-Philippe1 aBouyssiere, Brice0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Aug. 17, v. 31, no. 8 p.7783-7788dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b005273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012200167520096000289592002801249650001201277650001901289651001001308653001701318653003101335653002001366653002101386700001601407700001801423700001601441700001601457700001501473700001401488700001801502773012001520856008801640852000901728655001201737IND60786188020221121060114.0220921e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078618802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1065842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Feng10aIn-use stocks dynamic of durable goods in rural Chinese households: Spatial-temporal patterns and influencing factors  aThe in-use material stocks (MS) of durable household goods provide various functions or services, reflecting society's well-being. However, research on rural households is scarce. This study attempts to bridge this gap by analyzing rural households’ long-term in-use stock dynamics using follow-up survey data of more than 2000 rural households in five provinces in China from 2007 to 2018. Results reveal that by 2018, the MS of durable goods in rural China households reached 230.8 t per household, with an average annual growth rate of 5.3%, with residential buildings accounting for the largest proportion. From 2007 to 2015, the MS of buildings and home appliances revealed a trend of rapid growth initially, and then witnessed a slowdown. However, the MS of transportation tools is still growing rapidly. The east-west gap has been replaced by the north–south gap of MS. Moreover, high inequality exists between different rural household groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurveys 3atransportation 3aChina 0aIn-use stock 0aSpatial-temporal disparity 0aRural household 0aMicro-level data1 aYang, Nvjie1 aSun, Mingxing1 aLiu, Jingru1 aXu, Xiangbo1 aYang, Dong1 aShi, Feng1 aZhang, Linxiu0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 Nov., v. 186 p.106584-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.1065843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007800169300001600247520129400263592002801557650001601585650001601601650001701617650002501634650001701659650001601676650001801692650001301710650002201723650001601745650002101761650002001782650001401802650002001816650001501836653003201851653002401883653003501907653001901942653002401961700001801985700002002003773011402023856008602137852000902223655001202232IND60619625920221119004612.0210114e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061962592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Ja Young10aBiodegraded mackerel wastewater selectively inhibits harmful algal blooms  ap. 349-355.  aFunctional substances from mackerel wastewater were biodegraded and tested for inhibitory activity against harmful algal blooms (HABs) that are detrimental to aquaculture. The supernatant from a 48 h culture of mackerel wastewater had a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.54―0.68 mg/ml for the three tested HAB organisms (Heterocapsa triquetra, Alexandrium fundyense and Prorocentrum minimum). This inhibitory effect was not observed form 48-h biodegraded nutrient broth culture supernatant, indicating inhibitory substances did not originate from bacterial metabolites. Rough estimation of molecular weight using ultrafiltration indicated that the inhibitory substance was less than 2 kDa, and it did not inhibit the non-HAB organism (Skeletonema costatum), which is essential for preserving marine ecosystems in real-world applications. Furthermore, this inhibitory effect against HABs was not observed for biodegraded culture supernatants of other protein sources (skim milk and okara), indicating that the inhibitory substances were derived from a particular source present only in raw mackerel wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the selective inhibitory effects of the culture supernatant of mackerel wastewater against HABs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3aHeterocapsa 3aProrocentrum 3aSkeletonema costatum 3aalgal blooms 3aaquaculture 3aculture media 3amackerel 3amarine ecosystems 3ametabolites 3amolecular weight 3aprotein sources 3askim milk 3aultrafiltration 3awastewater 0aSelective inhibitory effect 0aHarmful algal bloom 0aLow molecular weight substance 0aBiodegradation 0aMackerel wastewater1 aJung, Hyun Yi1 aKim, Joong Kyun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 364 p.349-355dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245022200168300001400390520169000404592002802094650001602122650002002138650001602158650001602174650001702190650002302207650001502230650004302245650003302288650001802321650001802339650001702357650001402374650001902388650001302407650001602420650001602436650001602452700001502468700001702483700001602500773009402516856008402610852000902694655001202703IND60113094620221119155432.0141111e20130726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011309462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.02.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYou, Xiangwei10aUltrasound-assisted surfactant-enhanced emulsification microextraction based on the solidification of a floating organic droplet used for the simultaneous determination of six fungicide residues in juices and red wine  ap. 64-69.  aA novel ultrasound-assisted surfactant-enhanced emulsification microextraction technique based on the solidification of a floating organic droplet followed by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection was developed for simultaneous determination of six fungicide residues in juices and red wine samples. The low-toxicity solvent, 1-dodecanol, was used as an extraction solvent. For its low density and proper melting point near room temperature, the extractant droplet was collected easily by solidifying it at a low temperature. The surfactant, Tween 80, was used as an emulsifier to enhance the dispersion of the water-immiscible extraction solvent into an aqueous phase, which hastened the mass-transfer of the analytes. Organic dispersive solvent typically required in common dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction methods was not used in the proposed method. Some parameters (e.g., the type and volume of extraction solvent, the type and concentration of surfactant, ultrasound extraction time, salt addition, and volume of samples) that affect the extraction efficiency were optimized. The proposed method showed a good linearity within the range of 5μgL⁻¹–1000μgL⁻¹, with the correlation coefficients (γ) higher than 0.9969. The limits of detection for the method ranged from 0.4μgL⁻¹ to 1.4μgL⁻¹. Further, this simple, practical, sensitive, and environmentally friendly method was successfully applied to determine the target fungicides in juice and red wine samples. The recoveries of the target fungicides in red wine and fruit juice samples were 79.5%–113.4%, with relative standard deviations that ranged from 0.4% to 12.3%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3afruit juices 3afungicide residues 3afungicides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amass transfer 3amelting point 3apolysorbates 3ared wines 3asolidification 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3aultrasonics1 aWang, Suli1 aLiu, Fengmao1 aShi, Kaiwei0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 July 26, v. 1300 p.64-69dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.02.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03976naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010100156300001800257520191900275592002802194650001502222650002002237650001802257650003202275650001802307650001602325650002002341650002302361650001502384650001902399650001402418650000702432650001502439650001802454650001302472650001202485650001402497650001002511700001702521700001502538700001702553700001302570700001702583700001802600700001602618700001702634700001502651700001502666700001402681700001602695700001702711700001602728700002002744700001502764700002002779700001502799700001402814700003002828700001602858700001402874700001802888700001702906700001902923700002202942700001902964700001702983773012303000856007403123852000903197655001203206IND60662148420221120210141.0190904e20140528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066214842DNAL7 a10.1039/c3fo60702j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinekus, M.12aA standardised static in vitro digestion method suitable for food – an international consensus  ap. 1113-1124.  aSimulated gastro-intestinal digestion is widely employed in many fields of food and nutritional sciences, as conducting human trials are often costly, resource intensive, and ethically disputable. As a consequence, in vitro alternatives that determine endpoints such as the bioaccessibility of nutrients and non-nutrients or the digestibility of macronutrients (e.g. lipids, proteins and carbohydrates) are used for screening and building new hypotheses. Various digestion models have been proposed, often impeding the possibility to compare results across research teams. For example, a large variety of enzymes from different sources such as of porcine, rabbit or human origin have been used, differing in their activity and characterization. Differences in pH, mineral type, ionic strength and digestion time, which alter enzyme activity and other phenomena, may also considerably alter results. Other parameters such as the presence of phospholipids, individual enzymes such as gastric lipase and digestive emulsifiers vs. their mixtures (e.g. pancreatin and bile salts), and the ratio of food bolus to digestive fluids, have also been discussed at length. In the present consensus paper, within the COST Infogest network, we propose a general standardised and practical static digestion method based on physiologically relevant conditions that can be applied for various endpoints, which may be amended to accommodate further specific requirements. A frameset of parameters including the oral, gastric and small intestinal digestion are outlined and their relevance discussed in relation to available in vivo data and enzymes. This consensus paper will give a detailed protocol and a line-by-line, guidance, recommendations and justifications but also limitation of the proposed model. This harmonised static, in vitro digestion method for food should aid the production of more comparable data in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile salts 3abioavailability 3acarbohydrates 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3adigestibility 3aemulsifiers 3aenzyme activity 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3aionic strength 3anutrients 3apH 3apancreatin 3aphospholipids 3aproteins 3arabbits 3ascreening 3aswine1 aAlminger, M.1 aAlvito, P.1 aBallance, S.1 aBohn, T.1 aBourlieu, C.1 aCarrière, F.1 aBoutrou, R.1 aCorredig, M.1 aDupont, D.1 aDufour, C.1 aEgger, L.1 aGolding, M.1 aKarakaya, S.1 aKirkhus, B.1 aLe Feunteun, S.1 aLesmes, U.1 aMacierzanka, A.1 aMackie, A.1 aMarze, S.1 aMcClements, David Julian,1 aMénard, O.1 aRecio, I.1 aSantos, C.

Data collected from 250 households were used for OC estimation. REDD+ payment was estimated as the net present value (NPV) of agricultural rent and forest rent during land clearing, minus net returns from sustainable wood harvest, divided by the corresponding reduction in carbon stock. The median compensation required to protect the current carbon stock in the two vegetation types ranged from USD 1 tCO₂e⁻¹ for the montane forest to USD 39 tCO₂e⁻¹ for the degraded miombo woodlands, of which up to 70 % and 16 %, respectively, were for compensating OCs from forest rent during land clearing. The figures were significantly higher when the cost of farmers’ own labor was not taken into account in NPV calculations. The results also highlighted that incentives in the form of sustainable harvests could offset up to 55 % of the total median OC to protect the montane forest and up to 45 % to protect the miombo woodlands, depending on the wage rates. The findings suggest that given the possible factors that can potentially affect estimates of REDD+ payments, avoiding deforestation of the montane forest would be feasible under the REDD+ scheme. However, implementation of the policy in villages around the miombo area would require very high compensation levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagroecological zones 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acropland 3adeforestation 3aemissions 3afarmers 3aforests 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3aleasing 3aopportunity costs 3avillages 3awage rates 3awood 3awoodlands 3aTanzania1 aHofstad, Ole0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2016 Mar., v. 21, no. 3 p.421-443dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-014-9607-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245015700183500001900340520139700359592002801756650001001784650001801794650001801812650001201830650003101842650002001873650002701893650001701920653003101937653003101968653002601999653002102025653002202046700001902068700002402087700002302111700002402134773011902158856009002277852000902367655001202376IND60689837520221123004154.0200522e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068983752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.1112062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGabriëls, Suzan H.E.J.10aNon-destructive measurement of internal browning in mangoes using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy supported by artificial neural network analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVisible and near infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) (400−1000 nm) is a key emerging non-destructive technique for fruit quality assessment. This, because it is a unique method which allows rapid access to fruit pigments and chemical properties linked to fruit quality. In the present work, VNIRS has been used to predict the internal browning in ‘Keitt’ mangoes halves. The reference analysis was performed by cutting individual mango into halves and quantifying the extent of internal browning with a standardized color imaging (CI) cabinet as a browning index (BI). The CI provided a value for the “browning index” for each mango reflecting the presence and severity of internal browning. The data modelling involved both regression and classification analysis. The regression was performed to link the VNIR spectra with the BI values obtained from the internal color analysis. The classification analysis was performed for binary classification of mango into healthy or brown. Two different analysis techniques i.e. artificial neural network (ANN) and partial least square (PLS) were utilized. The study shows that VNIRS combined with ANN can classify mangoes as healthy or having internal brown with an accuracy of over 80 %. A robust and reliable classification system can potentially improve quality decisions through the mango supply chain, thereby reducing post-harvest losses.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3afruit quality 3aleast squares 3amangoes 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aneural networks 3anondestructive methods 3asupply chain 0aNear infrared spectroscopy 0aArtificial neural networks 0aMultivariate analyses 0aInternal defects 0aInternal browning1 aMishra, Puneet1 aMensink, Manon G.J.1 aSpoelstra, Patrick1 aWoltering, Ernst J.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2020 Aug., v. 166 p.111206-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2020.1112063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01626naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008300158300002000241520062300261592002800884650002200912650001700934650001700951650001400968650001900982650001301001700001701014700001401031700001901045700001701064773012401081856007401205852000901279655001201288IND60640480620221122052815.0190504e20160307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064048062DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra03252d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yueqin10aTuning the reaction rates of fluoride probes for detection in aqueous solution  ap. 25242-25245.  aFluoride detection in aqueous solution has drawn much attention. Most fluoride probes are based on the cleavage of a silyl group by fluoride for the generation of fluorescence. However, such a reaction is generally slow in aqueous solution. Herein we successfully demonstrate the concept that increasing the hydrophilicity of a pendent group enhances the reactivity of a silyl-based probe for fluoride detection in aqueous solution. By applying this concept, we also developed a new probe with a pendent PEG unit (BW-F-204), which showed excellent fluoride sensing ability both in aqueous solution and in cell culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acell culture 3afluorescence 3afluorides 3ahydrophilicity 3amoieties1 aDuan, Yuqing1 aJi, Kaili1 aWang, Run-Ling1 aWang, Binghe0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 07, v. 6, no. 30 p.25242-25245dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03252d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002000160245006500180300001700245500000900262500001500271520160900286592002801895650001601923650002301939650001601962650002201978650002102000650001702021650001902038653002102057653001502078653001102093653001802104700002102122773012402143852000902267856009702276655001202373IND2058295120221117234839.0191122e199509  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205829512DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1995.00021962008700050038x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, Paul M.10aWheat Response to Row Spacing in Relay Intercropping Systems  ap. 999-1003.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aRelay intercropping of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] or cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L.] into standing wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] allows for earlier planting of the summer crop than with sequential double-crop systems. Relay intercropping has been evaluated using modifications of standard planting and harvesting equipment as well as specifically designed equipment. In most relay intercropping systems, wheat is drilled in the fall in a row pattern that provides traffic-tire lanes as guides for planting the summer crop. Also, row spacing for wheat in relay intercropping is usually wider than for conventionally planted wheat. This field study, conducted during 1991-1992 and 1992-1993 near Blackville, SC, on a Varina loamy sand (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Paleudults), compared the yield and yield component response of soft red winter wheat produced with two different intercropping production schemes to the yield and yield component response of conventionally planted wheat. Yields of wheat planted in skip-row schemes designed to allow for relay intercropping of either soybean or cotton were not significantly different from yield of conventionally planted wheat under the given experimental conditions. For conventionally planted wheat, wheel traffic on certain rows reduced yields by as much as 50% compared with nontraffic rows. In the schemes designed to allow for relay intercropping, wheat grown with wider-spaced rows (0.31-0.61 m) compensated with respect to yield on an area basis compared with wheat grown with conventionally spaced rows (0.15-0.20 m).

Deca-BDE is increasingly used commercially, but little is known about the long-term fate and impact of its major component, decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), on the soil environment. In this study, we investigated the fate and ecological effect of BDE-209 over 4 years in outdoor lysimeters in a field planted with a rice–wheat rotation. BDE-209 and six lower-brominated PBDEs (BDE-28, -47, -99, -153, -154, and -183) were detected in soil layers of the test lysimeter. We calculated an average BDE-209 migration rate of 1.54 mg·m–²·yr–¹. In samples collected in May 2008, November 2008, November 2009, November 2010, and November 2011, 95.5%, 94.3%, 108.1%, 33.8%, and 35.5% of the spiked BDE-209 were recovered, respectively. We predicted the major pathway for debromination of BDE-209 in soil to be: BDE-209→BDE-183→BDE-153/BDE-154→BDE-99→BDE-47→BDE-28. In plants, BDE-209 and seven lower-brominated PBDEs (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, and -183) were detected. BDE-100 was mainly derived from the debromination of BDE-154 in plants, but sources of other lower-brominated PBDEs were still difficult to determine. In soils containing BDE-209 for 4 years, soil urease activity increased, and soil protease activity slightly decreased. Our results provide important insights for understanding the behavior of BDE-209 in agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aedaphic factors 3aenzyme activity 3alysimeters 3aplanting 3apollution 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aurease1 aJi, Rong1 aSun, Yuanyuan1 aZhu, Jianguo1 aWu, Jichun1 aGuo, Hongyan0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 47, no. 16 p.9167-9174dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes400730p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245012100160300002000281520105100301592002801352650002301380650002401403650001701427650001901444650001701463650001301480700001701493700001401510700001701524700001701541700001701558700005601575700001801631773017301649856008001822852000901902655001201911IND60608702720221120152619.0180808e20180710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b018212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Dekun10aZeolite Beta Precursors as Building Units toward Enhancing the Microporosity Fraction of Mesoporous Aluminosilicates  ap. 10234-10240.  aOur group has reported the synthesis of hydrothermally stable mesoporous aluminosilicates (MAs) by self-assembly of triblock copolymers and zeolite Y precursors. However, degradation of zeolite Y precursors in the acidic synthesis system will inevitably lead to low microporosity fraction of final products. Development of a facile route to obtain MAs simultaneously with high hydrothermal stability and microporosity fraction is still a great challenge. Herein, we employ zeolite Beta precursors as building units to solve this problem. In this strategy, zeolite Beta precursors were more stable than zeolite Y precursors in the acidic synthesis system due to the presence of organic directing agent TEAOH, which would result in more microporosity implanted into the framework of MAs. By fine-tuning the assembly time, the microporosity fraction could be adjusted in a range of 38.7%–52.9%. In addition, the synthesized MAs maintain well-resolved crystal patterns, high surface area, and pore volume even after a severe hydrothermal treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3ahot water treatment 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3asurface area 3azeolites1 aWang, Baojie1 aYue, Ting1 aLi, Xiaoping1 aMi, Xiaotong1 aLiu, Honghai1 aLiu, Hongtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4585-59801 aGao, Xionghou0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 July 10, v. 57, no. 31 p.10234-10240dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b018213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245019800171500002000369520112500389592002801514650002301542650001101565650002501576650001701601650001201618650001301630650000901643650001201652650002101664650001601685650002001701650001001721650000901731650002001740650002501760650001101785650001201796700001401808700003001822773010001852856007401952852000902026655001202035IND60572089220221117231545.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057208922DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.123512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlabiyi, Ayodeji Augustine10aEffect of dietary supplementation of tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus l.) and walnut (Tetracarpidium conophorum müll.

Arg.) on erectile function in normal male rats. Adult male (40) and female (40) rats (200–250 g) were procured for the study. The male rats were divided into five groups each consisting of eight rats (n = 8). The experiment was performed for fourteen (14) days after which behavioral studies (sexual and anxiety), sex hormone levels, and biochemical assays (catalase, superoxide dismutase, total thiol, and reduced glutathione) were conducted. The groups with supplemented diet containing tiger nut and walnut showed significantly increased sexual behavior, hormone levels, and antioxidant activities. These enhanced activities could be part of the mechanism by which the nuts exert their aphrodisiac properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results suggest the potential ability of tiger nut (Cyperus esculentus L.) and walnut (Tetracarpidium conophorum Müll.

This understanding is important to designing future foods that provide optimum nutrient bioavailability and deliver healthy outcomes.

To overcome this limitation, we propose an in situ light source to excite the photosensitizer to generate toxic singlet oxygen and kill tumor cells directly. In this research, luminol served as the in situ light source in 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic treatment of Caco-2 cell cultures. 72h after luminol excitation the viability of the treated cells significantly decreased compared to the control cells in assays including cell viability, cytotoxicity, flow cytometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy. According to the results, we suggested luminol could be used as an in situ light source for 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy. This method would have great potential to extend the application of photodynamic therapy to tumors located deep inside the body.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3acell viability 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3ahuman cell lines 3alasers 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3asinglet oxygen 3atherapeutics1 aHuang, Ling1 aLiu, Chia-Ching1 aChao, Pey-Jen1 aLin, Feng-Huei0 tProcess biochemistry.g2012 Dec., v. 47, no. 12 p.1903-1908dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2012.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013600169300001200305500001900317520143600336592002801772650001701800650001501817650002901832650002001861650001701881650002901898650001301927650001901940650001601959650001501975650002501990650002102015650001502036650001102051650001802062650001802080700001902098700002002117700001702137700002202154700002002176700002502196700001702221700006402238773015102302856008302453852000902536655001202545IND60693839420221117061258.0200718e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069383942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08257-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaydoun, Mohamad10aAssessment of metal/metalloid occurrence in rivers with their accumulation in macrophyte case study with Myriophyllum alterniflorum  ap. 337.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater quality monitoring with integrative tools is a main issue of concern for environment assessment. Submerged aquatic macrophyte can be a good candidate for the evaluation of contaminant content in rivers. Indeed, owing to their habitat, aquatic macrophytes interact directly with surface water; they can absorb contaminants and thus allow to detect their presence in water. In situ studies were conducted over 28 days in five aquatic environments, affected by different levels of anthropogenic pressure (domestic wastewater plant, industrial activities), during two field campaigns. We have investigated whether the accumulation of some metals and a metalloid (As) in Myriophyllum alterniflorum could be used to detect their occurrence in river waters. Our results demonstrated that long time bioaccumulation was correlated with the contaminant levels in water. However, the water composition and the duration of exposure affected the studied pollutants’ absorption. On an operational point of view, the optimal duration of exposure of Myriophyllum alterniflorum to assess the water quality is conditioned by the contaminant contents in waters that can induce different defense mechanisms as the reduction of pollutant absorption and their efflux. In addition, the nutrient concentration influenced the accumulation of pollutants since the higher the nutrient level, the higher the essential metal accumulation was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyriophyllum 3aabsorption 3aanthropogenic activities 3abioaccumulation 3acase studies 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahabitats 3ahydrochemistry 3amacrophytes 3ametalloids 3amunicipal wastewater 3anutrient content 3apollutants 3arivers 3asurface water 3awater quality1 aDa Silva, Anne1 aDecou, Raphaël1 aKrayem, Maha1 aHourdin, Philippe1 aCleries, Karine1 aFondanèche, Patrice1 aHak, Thierry1 aDeluchat, Véronique1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9433-56580 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 June, v. 192, no. 6 p.337-337dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08257-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012000164300001800284520089800302592002801200596009801228596009801326596009801424596012801522596010901650596006301759650002201822650001701844650001901861650001001880650002601890650002201916650002301938650002101961650000801982653001001990653001702000653002102017653001202038653002502050700005402075700001102129700005002140700001502190700001902205700001802224700005502242700005602297773014802353856008102501852000902582655001202591IND60776311620221117105448.0220505e20220421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077631162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.2c012102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Quan-Fei10aProfiling of Branched Fatty Acid Esters of Hydroxy Fatty Acids in Teas and Their Potential Sources in Fermented Tea  ap. 5369-5376.  aBranched fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid (FAHFA) is a class of natural lipid with important biological functions. In this study, we first profiled natural-origin FAHFAs in different teas using the chemical labeling-assisted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Consequently, we observed rich molecular diversity of FAHFAs with multiple regioisomers in teas. Additionally, the FAHFA contents had a positive relationship with the tea fermentation degree and a negative relationship with homologous fatty acids. Moreover, the highly accumulated FAHFAs (e.g., 3-MAHMA) in some postfermented teas (e.g., Fu brick tea) were also basically interpreted with regiospecificity of FAHFAs in both teas and fungus. This study revealed that tea is a rich natural source of FAHFAs, and some abundant FAHFAs might be the functional molecules accounting for the antidiabetic function of teas.  aPublisher supplied data  a21635006cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21721005cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21904099cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2018YFA0900400cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  aFDCTc, Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ci?ncias e da Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100006469  aAM201927cMacau Young Scholars Programdhttps://doi.org/NA 3afatty acid esters 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3afungi 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apositional isomers 3aregioselectivity 3atea 0aFAHFA 0aFu brick tea 0atea fermentation 0a3-MAHMA 0aantidiabetic effects1 aGe, Ya-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3063-63871 aAn, Na1 aLi, Na1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0404-64311 aXiao, Ying1 aHuang, Guo-Xin1 aZhang, Li Li,1 aFeng, Yu-Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-53851 aWu, Jian-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3875-185X0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 70, no. 17 p.5369-5376dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.2c012103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100003100171245014500202300001600347520102400363592002801387650001601415650001401431650001801445650001101463650001501474650001301489650002101502650001401523650001501537650001501552650002501567650001301592650001201605650001601617650001101633650001801644650003101662650001301693650002201706650002701728650002401755650002601779650002801805650002201833650001601855650001701871650003501888650001601923650004101939650003201980653001402012653002302026653001402049653002302063653002502086700002902111700001902140700001802159773010602177856008702283852000902370655001202379IND50069095920221121041547.0190409e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006909592DNAL7 a239322862pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.07.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacristán de Alva, Manuel10aGreen microalga Scenedesmus acutus grown on municipal wastewater to couple nutrient removal with lipid accumulation for biodiesel production  ap. 744-748.  aThe green microalga Scenedesmus acutus was cultivated in two different municipal wastewater discharges (pre- and post-treated), and was compared to a culture medium with basic nutrients (20% of N, P, K), in order to study the simultaneous potential of nutrient removal and lipid accumulation ability. The highest level of nutrient removal was found in the pretreated wastewater discharge (achieving a high removal of phosphorus [66%] and organic nitrogen [94%]). Likewise, better results on biomass productivity and lipid accumulation were found in cultures using pretreated wastewater compared to enriched medium, obtaining 79.9mg/L, and 280mg/L, respectively. Since the best results were found in pretreated wastewater, the biodiesel preparation was performed using said medium at small-scale. After cultivation, 249.4mg/L of biodiesel were obtained. According to this analysis, S. acutus could be used for wastewater treatment producing biomass with a suitable content of lipids, convenient for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3abiodiesel 3aculture media 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 2aBiofuels 2aBiomass 2aCalibration 2aCities 2aCulture Media 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLipidsxchemistry 2aMicroalgaexmetabolism 2aNitrogenxchemistry 2aPhosphorusxchemistry 2aScenedesmusxmetabolism 2aSpectrophotometry 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWastewater. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Purificationxmethods 0aBiodiesel 0aLipid accumulation 0aMicroalga 0aScenedesmus acutus 0aWastewater treatment1 aLuna-Pabello, Víctor M.1 aCadena, Erasmo1 aOrtiz, Edgar,0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Oct., v. 146 p.744-748dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.07.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245012600213300001600339506007600355520158500431592002802016506003702044650001702081650001202098650001902110650002002129650000902149650001802158650002002176650001702196651001202213700002102225700002202246700002102268700002102289773013402310856008102444852000902525655001202534IND60519258420221207125738.0160424e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051925842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-014-9602-32doi7 aPMC61080072pmcid7 a301975612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThieken, Annegret H.10aEstimating changes in flood risks and benefits of non-structural adaptation strategies - a case study from Tyrol, Austria  ap. 343-376.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFlood damage has increased significantly and is expected to rise further in many parts of the world. For assessing potential changes in flood risk, this paper presents an integrated model chain quantifying flood hazards and losses while considering climate and land use changes. In the case study region, risk estimates for the present and the near future illustrate that changes in flood risk by 2030 are relatively low compared to historic periods. While the impact of climate change on the flood hazard and risk by 2030 is slight or negligible, strong urbanisation associated with economic growth contributes to a remarkable increase in flood risk. Therefore, it is recommended to frequently consider land use scenarios and economic developments when assessing future flood risks. Further, an adapted and sustainable risk management is necessary to encounter rising flood losses, in which non-structural measures are becoming more and more important. The case study demonstrates that adaptation by non-structural measures such as stricter land use regulations or enhancement of private precaution is capable of reducing flood risk by around 30 %. Ignoring flood risks, in contrast, always leads to further increasing losses—with our assumptions by 17 %. These findings underline that private precaution and land use regulation could be taken into account as low cost adaptation strategies to global climate change in many flood prone areas. Since such measures reduce flood risk regardless of climate or land use changes, they can also be recommended as no-regret measures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aland use change 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3arisk management 3aurbanization 3aAustria1 aCammerer, Holger1 aDobler, Christian1 aLammel, Johannes1 aSchöberl, Fritz0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2016 Mar., v. 21, no. 3 p.343-376dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-014-9602-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009400157300001800251520147000269592002801739650002901767650001401796650001001810650001601820650002601836650001101862650001301873650001901886651001801905700002201923773012501945856007502070852000902145655001202154IND60534747720221122053556.0160803e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053474772DNAL7 a10.1021/es40097572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Shweta10aAccounting for the Biogeochemical Cycle of Nitrogen in Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment  ap. 9388-9396.  aNitrogen is indispensable for sustaining human activities through its role in the production of food, animal feed, and synthetic chemicals. This has encouraged significant anthropogenic mobilization of reactive nitrogen and its emissions into the environment resulting in severe disruption of the nitrogen cycle. This paper incorporates the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen into the 2002 input-output model of the U.S. economy. Due to the complexity of this cycle, this work proposes a unique classification of nitrogen flows to facilitate understanding of the interaction between economic activities and various flows in the nitrogen cycle. The classification scheme distinguishes between the mobilization of inert nitrogen into its reactive form, use of nitrogen in various products, and nitrogen losses to the environment. The resulting inventory and model of the US economy can help quantify the direct and indirect impacts or dependence of economic sectors on the nitrogen cycle. This paper emphasizes the need for methods to manage the N cycle that focus not just on N losses, which has been the norm until now, but also include other N flows for a more comprehensive view and balanced decisions. Insight into the N profile of various sectors of the 2002 U.S. economy is presented, and the inventory can also be used for LCA or Hybrid LCA of various products. The resulting model is incorporated in the approach of Ecologically-Based LCA and available online.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aemissions 3afeeds 3ainventories 3alife cycle assessment 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aUnited States1 aBakshi, Bhavik R.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 47, no. 16 p.9388-9396dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes40097573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011600171300001800287520104300305592002801348650001901376650001201395650001601407650002001423650001601443650001101459650001001470650001301480650000901493653001501502653001901517653001401536653001501550700002101565700001701586700002001603773010501623856008401728852000901812655001201821IND60122234220221122163913.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012223422DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2013.7788532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohan, Mahalaxmi10aAntidepressant, anxiolytic and adaptogenic activity of torvanol A: an isoflavonoid from seeds of Solanum torvum  ap. 2140-2143.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effect of torvanol A (10 and 30 mg/kg) isolated from Solanum torvum as antidepressant, anxiolytic and adaptogenic.

Torvanol A significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the immobility period, increased the time spent in open arms and entries in open arms, decreased the time spent in closed arms, increased the time spent in light area and decreased the time spent in dark area. Combination of torvanol A with various antagonists – prazocin(62.5 μg/kg, i.p.), para chloro phenyl alanine (pCPA) (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and haloperidol (50 μg/kg, i.p.) – has also produced the same effect in various behavioural parameters in FST, TST, EPM and LDA as the respective antagonists.

In this study, PAEU bock copolymers were synthesized, and their chemical structures and properties were characterized. In aqueous solution, the copolymers exhibited a sol-to-gel phase transition with increasing pH, or a gel-to-sol phase transition with increasing temperature. The formation of in situ gels has been observed within 20 min of subcutaneous injection of copolymer solutions into SD rats due to the sol-to-gel phase transition which occurs in response to local pH and temperature. The prepared polymers were employed for the fabrication of injectable radiopaque embolic materials, which are mixtures of an aqueous copolymer solution and a commercial long-lasting X-ray contrast agent, Lipiodol. The formulated radiopaque embolic hydrogel precursor solutions were then intraarterialy injected via the hepatic arteries feeding the VX2 hepatic tumors in rabbits using a 2.0 Fr microcatheter to investigate their gelability for potential application in liver cancer treatment. CT images and histological examination of excised tumor tissues confirmed the formation of hydrogels in the hepatic arteries and tumors. Doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug, was released from hydrogels with or without Lipiodol in sustained fashion, and the released DOX fully retained its bioactivity via inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro. These results have demonstrated that the synthesized PAEU block copolymers can be used to prepare radiopaque embolic solutions, which then exhibit a sol-to-gel phase transition to form hydrogels acting as anticancer drug depots to induce chemoembolization after being injected into tumor-feeding arteries, and therefore offer potential applications for TACE in liver cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaqueous solutions 3aarteries 3abioactive compounds 3abioactive properties 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3adoxorubicin 3agelation 3ahistology 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliver neoplasms 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3arabbits 3arats 3asubcutaneous injection 3atemperature 3atissues 3aurethane1 aNguyễn, Quang Vinh,1 aLym, Jae Seung1 aKim, Bong Sup1 aHuynh, Dai Phu1 aJae, Hwan Jun1 aKim, Young Il1 aLee, Doo Sung0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 16, v. 6, no. 53 p.47687-47697dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03263j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03383naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245010300208300001800311506007600329520157600405592002801981506003702009650001502046650002802061650001902089650001102108650001902119650001502138650002202153650001302175650002402188650001402212650001802226650002202244650001202266653003002278653001802308653002102326653002902347700002602376700001902402700002202421700002102443700002202464700002302486700002102509700002602530773017302556856007902729852000902808655001202817IND60230308420221207081325.0150614e20140218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023030842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14002741112doi7 aPMC39328512pmcid7 a245502652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEberlin, Livia S.10aMolecular assessment of surgical-resection margins of gastric cancer by mass-spectrometric imaging  ap. 2436-2441.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSurgical resection is the main curative option for gastrointestinal cancers. The extent of cancer resection is commonly assessed during surgery by pathologic evaluation of (frozen sections of) the tissue at the resected specimen margin(s) to verify whether cancer is present. We compare this method to an alternative procedure, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometric imaging (DESI-MSI), for 62 banked human cancerous and normal gastric-tissue samples. In DESI-MSI, microdroplets strike the tissue sample, the resulting splash enters a mass spectrometer, and a statistical analysis, here, the Lasso method (which stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and which is a multiclass logistic regression with L1 penalty), is applied to classify tissues based on the molecular information obtained directly from DESI-MSI. The methodology developed with 28 frozen training samples of clear histopathologic diagnosis showed an overall accuracy value of 98% for the 12,480 pixels evaluated in cross-validation (CV), and 97% when a completely independent set of samples was tested. By applying an additional spatial smoothing technique, the accuracy for both CV and the independent set of samples was 99% compared with histological diagnoses. To test our method for clinical use, we applied it to a total of 21 tissue-margin samples prospectively obtained from nine gastric-cancer patients. The results obtained suggest that DESI-MSI/Lasso may be valuable for routine intraoperative assessment of the specimen margins during gastric-cancer surgery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adesorption 3agastrointestinal system 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3aresection 3aspectrometers 3astomach neoplasms 3atissues 0amass spectrometry imaging 0abiostatistics 0asurgical margins 0aintraoperative diagnosis1 aTibshirani, Robert J.1 aZhang, Jialing1 aLongacre, Teri A.1 aBerry, Gerald J.1 aBingham, David B.1 aNorton, Jeffrey A.1 aZare, Richard N.1 aPoultsides, George A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 18, v. 111, no. 7 p.2436-2441dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14002741113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010300170300001600273520089200289592002801181650001501209650002201224650001301246650001501259650002601274650001701300650001101317650000901328650001501337653001901352653000901371653001401380653002601394700001901420700001701439773011701456856008601573852000901659655001201668IND60568099920221121033831.0190408e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056809992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.04.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLahtela, Ville14aThe effect of primary sludge on the mechanical performance of high-density polyethylene composites  ap. 129-132.  aEffective reutilization of by-product material is an important goal which should be aimed at globally. The effects of primary sludge instead of wood on the mechanical performance of composites are examined in this study. The studied composites were made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE), anhydride-grafted-polyethylene (MAPE), lubricant, and either wood flour or primary sludge from forest industry production. The HDPE −composites were compounded in a conical twin-screw extruder. The mechanical properties of the composites were characterized by tensile, flexural, hardness, and impact testing. The primary sludge as a component in the structure of the composite resulted in an improvement of mechanical performance in some of the tests, e.g. the properties of hardness and impact strength increased over 40 per cents, and weakened results were not noticeable in a larger scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3aforest industries 3ahardness 3alubricants 3amechanical properties 3apolyethylene 3asludge 3awood 3awood flour 0aPrimary sludge 0aHDPE 0aComposite 0aMechanical properties1 aMustonen, Kati1 aKärki, Timo0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 104 p.129-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.04.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169300001600290520155000306592002801856650001901884650001501903650002501918650001101943650001201954650003801966650002602004650002702030650001502057650003202072650002202104650001902126650001802145650001902163651001102182653002302193653002602216653002702242653002402269653001202293653002002305653002502325700002002350700002002370773009702390856008402487852000902571655001202580IND60547489220221120200600.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054748922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2015.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMancini, Lucia10aResource footprint of Europe: Complementarity of material flow analysis and life cycle assessment for policy support  ap. 367-376.  aThe availability and accessibility of natural resources are fundamental for human well-being and the functioning of global economies. International policies have been developed with the aim to ensure resource efficiency and to respond to environmental and socio-economic concerns towards the sustainable management of natural resources. In fact, building effective resource policies requires solid methodologies and indicators for monitoring resource extraction and consumption by the economies as well as all its related environmental impacts. The present study focuses on the European context, assessing current methodologies for resources analysis towards identifying their strengths and weaknesses in supporting policies. The study analyses trends in material resource extraction within Europe and imports over the past 10 years. Three approaches are compared: (i) “mass”-based accounting (i.e. material flow analysis); (ii) “impact assessment”-based, founded on the life cycle assessment methodology, and (iii) “resource criticality”-based, building on assessment of critical raw materials for EU economy. The paper shows through some examples that this methodological choice has relevant repercussions in terms of resource prioritization. Hence, the choice of the accounting methodology and the setting of targets should be guided by the policy objective(s) (i.e. dematerialization, environmental impact reduction and security of resource supply), possibly complementing the different insights coming from the three approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaccounting 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 3aimports 3ainternational policy and programs 3alife cycle assessment 3amaterial flow analysis 3amonitoring 3anatural resource management 3anatural resources 3aprioritization 3araw materials 3asocioeconomics 3aEurope 0aMaterial resources 0aLife cycle assessment 0aMaterial flow analysis 0aResource efficiency 0aTargets 0aResource policy 0aResource criticality1 aBenini, Lorenzo1 aSala, Serenella0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2015 Dec., v. 54 p.367-376dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2015.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002400160245007100184300001600255500000900271520217700280592002802457650002302485650002202508650001802530650002502548650002002573650002002593650001402613650001702627650001302644650001502657650001502672650001602687650002602703650002002729650002102749650001002770650001002780650002802790650002102818650001702839650002102856650002602877651001602903700001802919700002302937773012202960852000903082856009703091655001203188IND2058425920221117234946.0191122e199603  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205842592DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800020003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, William E.10aEvaluating Cotton Nitrogen Dynamics in the GOSSYM Simulation Model  ap. 127-132.  aepub  aPrediction of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) N requirements would be useful in preventing excessive vegetative growth and negative environmental effects from overapplication of fertilizer N. Field research studies were conducted at Holly Springs, MS, to evaluate early-maturing and full-season cultivar effects on N nutrition and yield. Cotton was grown across a range of N application rates and results were compared with simulations of the cotton model GOSSYM. Cotton cultivars Stoneville 825 and DES 119 were grown on a Grenada silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Glossic Fragiudalfs) in 1989 and 1990, and Deltapine 20 on a Loring silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, thermic Typic Fragiudalfs) in 1990, all with N rates of 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg ha⁻¹. Rainfall in May through September 1990 was only 52% of the rainfall during the same period in 1989. Cultivar effects on yield and cotton N nutrition were minimal. Averaged across cultivars and N rates, 24% of total plant N on the Grenada soil and 20% on the Loring soil in 1990 was in ground litter at first open boll, compared with 13% in 1989 on the Grenada soil. GOSSYM accurately predicted litter N for the Grenada site in 1990, but overpredicted N in litter in 1989 at this site and in 1990 for the Loring site. On the Grenada soil in 1989, an average of 61% of the total plant N at first open boll was in seed and burrs, while in 1990 it was 41%, due to a lower boll load. For both soils, N availability without fertilizer ranged from 68 to 77 kg N ha⁻¹. GOSSYM overestimated soil N availability by 10 to 30 kg N ha⁻¹. Averaged across cultivars on the Grenada soil in 1989, GOSSYM underpredicted yield on cotton with no fertilizer N by 463 kg lint ha⁻¹. Fertilizer N recovery was overpredicted by the model. These results point to the need for more accurate prediction of N dynamics if the model is to be used for N management on fragipan soils. Approved for publication as Journal Article no.

It is revealed that Zr⁴⁺ ions are doped into TiO₂ lattice in the substitutional mode and Pd²⁺ ions exist as –O–Pd–O– species on the surface of TiO₂. The energy level of the substitutional doped Zr⁴⁺ ions and –O–Pd–O– surface species are located about 0.15 eV below the conduction band and 0.4 eV above the valence band, respectively. Moreover, the band structure of TiO₂–Zr–Pdx can be further adjusted by changing the amount of Pd²⁺ ions. Owing to the synergistic effect of Pd and Zr, the response is extended into the visible region and the photogenerated charge carriers are separated effectively. Therefore, TiO₂–Zr–Pdx samples exhibit improved photocatalytic activity, compared with TiO₂–Zr and TiO₂–Pd under both UV and Vis irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aions 3airradiation 3apalladium 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asol-gel processing 3asynergism 3atitanium dioxide 3azirconium1 aYu, Yanlong1 aYan, Yabin1 aYuan, Jixiang1 aYin, Shougen1 aCao, Yaan0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 23, v. 6, no. 36 p.29950-29957dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03275c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245013500212520176500347592002802112650002502140650001402165650000902179650001302188650001302201650001002214650001102224650001402235650002102249650001002270650001302280650001202293651001802305653000902323653002602332653001602358653001602374653001602390700002302406700002102429700001602450773010602466856008602572852000902658655001202667IND60689838220221120130121.0200501e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068983822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Jason L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7226-650010aIf you build it and they come, will they stay? Maturation of constructed fish spawning reefs in the St. Clair-Detroit River System  aConstructed rock reefs have been used to remediate spawning habitat for Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and other lithophilic spawning fishes in the St. Clair-Detroit River System, North America. Early projects used a cross-channel design and species-specific metrics (e.g., proximity to historical spawning locations) to guide reef placement. However, the Middle Channel Reefs and portions of other early projects were compromised by fine sediment accumulation. Therefore, geomorphological criteria were considered in siting reefs constructed after 2013 to avoid sediment sources and improve the likelihood of successful reef function. To evaluate the effectiveness of the revised placement process, we quantified physical maturation of constructed reefs using annual side-scan and down-looking sonar surveys beginning in 2014 and underwater video surveys beginning in 2015. Reef areas and hardness were measured from sonar surveys and underwater video was used to quantify surficial sediment composition. Size and hardness of reefs developed using geomorphological criteria decreased with time, but at rates slower than what was observed at the Middle Channel Reefs. Sediment composition of the reefs remained similar through 2017 and prevalence of reef rock was high, except at Hart's Light Reef, where dreissenid mussel shells composed 32% of the surficial substrate by age three. However, accumulation of fine sediments was documented at all reefs in 2018. Despite using geomorphic criteria to identify areas most suitable for reef construction, reef sediment composition has changed, and future reef restoration projects could benefit by incorporating methods for maintenance, in addition to using geomorphic criteria, to identify restoration sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aDreissena 3afish 3ahabitats 3ahardness 3areefs 3arivers 3asediments 3ashell (molluscs) 3asonar 3aspawning 3asurveys 3aNorth America 0aReef 0aFish spawning habitat 0aLarge river 0aRestoration 0aMaintenance1 aRoseman, Edward F.1 aMayer, Christine1 aWills, Todd0 tEcological engineering.g2020 May 01, v. 150 p.105837-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2020.1058373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015400157300002000311520109200331592002801423650000801451650002401459650001701483650001301500650002201513700001501535700001601550700001501566700002001581700001501601700001701616773012401633856007401757852000901831655001201840IND60640481520221122064919.0190504e20160224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064048152DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra03281h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Kaiyong10aNovel aggregation-induced emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials based on thianthrene-9,9′,10,10′-tetraoxide derivatives  ap. 22137-22143.  aTwo novel luminescent molecules based on thianthrene-9,9′,10,10′-tetraoxide derivatives, named tCzDSO2 and 3tCzDSO2, have been synthesized and characterized. The compound tCzDSO2 emits intense aggregation-induced emission (AIE) with a high photoluminescence quantum yields (ΦF) of 0.92 at room temperature in the solid state. Simultaneously, by increasing the proportion of carbazole units, 3tCzDSO2 exhibits both AIE and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in the solid state with ΦF of 0.19 in air and 0.41 in N₂ atmosphere. The two compounds also display a bathochromic effect due to their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) attribute. The time-dependent DFT predicted the singlet and triplet splitting (ΔEST) values of tCzDSO2 and 3tCzDSO2 to be 0.29 eV and 0.06 eV, respectively. The ΔEST of 3tCzDSO2 is small enough to allow efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), leading to the TADF property at room temperature. As a result, the molecular design provides a simple and effective approach to integrate the features of AIE and TADF into one compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3afluorescence 3anitrogen 3aphotoluminescence1 aJiang, Wei1 aBan, Xinxin1 aHuang, Bin1 aZhang, Zhaohang1 aYe, Muyang1 aSun, Yueming0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 24, v. 6, no. 26 p.22137-22143dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03281h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002700146245009800173300002000271520171700291592002802008650002202036650003002058650001102088650001102099650003302110650001902143650002402162650001602186700006202202700002502264700007502289773017302364856008002537852000902617655001202626IND60608703420221120174218.0180808e20180705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b019572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Carvalho, Thiago P.10aMicrokinetic Modeling and Reduced Rate Expression of the Water–Gas Shift Reaction on Nickel  ap. 10269-10280.  aThe development of a first-principles-based microkinetic modeling of the water–gas shift (WGS) reaction on nickel surfaces is presented. The surface reaction mechanism consists of 19 elementary reversible steps among 10 adsorbates. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to calculate the binding energies and transitions states of all adsorbates and reactions on Ni(111) and Ni(211) surfaces [Catapan; DFT study of the water–gas shift reaction and coke formation on Ni (111) and Ni (211) surfaces. J. Phys. Chem. C2012, 116, 20281−20291]. Thermodynamic consistency of the DFT-predicted energetics was taken into account in the construction of the kinetic mechanism. Lateral interactions between adsorbates were calculated via DFT and included in the microkinetic modeling using a hierarchical approach. The model predictions compare well with experimental results on Ni/Al₂O₃ reported in the literature, reproducing CO conversion, apparent activation energy, and reaction orders for CO and H₂O. A reduced microkinetic model is derived using sensitivity and principal component analysis. The main reaction pathway analysis revealed that the carboxyl pathway is favored and the elementary step CO* + OH* ⇌ COOH* + * is the rate-determining step of WGS on Ni. A global one-step rate expression for WGS on Ni was also developed. Moreover, a novel thermodynamic-consistent treatment for the evaluation species coverages in the rate expression is proposed. This came with the use of a look-up table for the most abundant adsorbed species and has improved the performance of the one-step expression over a wide range of conditions (inlet compositions, volumetric flow rates, and different temperatures).  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3adensity functional theory 3amodels 3anickel 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprocess design 3areaction mechanisms 3atemperature1 aCatapan, Rafael C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3052-76311 aOliveira, Amir A.

While a high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction is important for proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) performance, the high stability of the electrocatalyst is essential for real applications under harsh operating conditions. The demands necessitate the development of advanced electrocatalysts that are resistant to corrosion. A combination of diazonium chemistry with Cu electrodeposition permits the selective protection of the carbon surface of the commercial Pt/C to prevent corrosion while improving wettability and ionic transfer. The resulting electrocatalysts exhibit an exceptional ORR stability after accelerated stress testing (AST) with a 250% improvement in comparison with unprotected commercial Pt/C. This novel electrochemical pathway provides a much-needed boost to carbon-based catalytic supports, which still face several stability challenges in energy applications in a harsh environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aNAcNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canadadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000038  a266388cFonds de Recherche du Qu?bec - Sant?dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000156 3acarbon 3acorrosion 3adiazonium compounds 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectroplating 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3awettability 0aelectrocatalyst 0afuel cell 0aPt 0adiazonium 0aoxygen reduction reaction 0ananomaterials1 aHarvey, Edward J.1 aMerle, Geraldine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8044-985X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2022 Apr. 22, v. 14, no. 17 p.19285-19294dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c234843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245006100160300001800221500001500239520150100254592002801755650001401783650001201797650001401809650001501823650001201838650001301850650002401863650000901887650001101896650001701907650001101924650002001935650001401955650001401969650001701983650002202000650001102022650001502033653001902048700001802067700002102085700001802106773012502124856007502249852000902324655001202333IND60534748120221121041129.0160803e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053474812DNAL7 a10.1021/es401019n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernes, Peter J.10aMolecular Trickery in Soil Organic Matter: Hidden Lignin  ap. 9077-9085.  a2019-12-06  aBinding to minerals is one mechanism crucial toward the accumulation and stabilization of organic matter (OM) in soils. Of the various biochemicals produced by plants, lignin-derived phenols are among the most surface-reactive compounds. However, it is not known to what extent mineral-bound lignin-derived phenols can be analytically assessed by alkaline CuO oxidation. We tested the potential irreversible binding of lignin from three litters (blue oak, foothill pine, annual grasses) to five minerals (ferrihydrite, goethite, kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite) using the CuO-oxidation technique, along with bulk organic carbon (OC) sorption. Up to 56% of sorbed lignin could not be extracted from the minerals with the CuO-oxidation technique. The composition of the irreversibly bound lignin component differed markedly between minerals and from that of the parent litter leachates, indicating different bonding strengths related to individual monomers and conformations. The difference in extractability of individual phenols suggests that abiotic processes, such as sorption/desorption, should be taken into account when using CuO oxidation data for assessing lignin turnover in mineral matrixes. However, given the apparent relationship between aromaticity as indicated by carbon-specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and bulk OC sorption, it is likely that irreversible sorption is a concern for any technique that addresses the broad class of aromatic/phenolic compounds in soils and sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3aannuals 3akaolinite 3aabsorbance 3aphenols 3agoethite 3asoil organic matter 3asoil 3acarbon 3acupric oxide 3aillite 3amontmorillonite 3aleachates 3aoxidation 3aferrihydrite 3aQuercus douglasii 3alignin 3adesorption 0aorganic matter1 aKaiser, Klaus1 aDyda, Rachael

D.10aHigh-sensitivity cassette for reducing limit of detection for diesel particulate matter sampling  ap. 333.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNIOSH researchers designed a high-sensitivity (HS) cassette to improve the limit of detection of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) method 5040 and the Airtec near real-time diesel particulate matter (DPM) monitor. This was achieved by reducing the size of the diesel particulate matter deposition spot from 8.0 cm² (NIOSH method 5040 mining samples) and 7.6 cm² (Airtec samples) to 0.5 cm². When compared with the standard cassette, the new high-sensitivity cassette improves the limit of detection of NIOSH method 5040 by approximately five times, and the differences between the elemental carbon results from the HS cassette and the standard three-piece cassette were within statistical error. The limit of detection for Airtec measurements improved by approximately 15 times, and the elemental carbon results with the HS cassette between the Airtec and NIOSH method 5040 were within statistical agreement. When used in the Airtec monitor, the high-sensitivity cassette showed promise for measuring short-duration spot checks of ambient concentrations but was limited when performing some long-term sampling due to the resultant loss of dynamic range. Only up to 7 μg of elemental carbon was collected onto the HS cassette before the increase in pump backpressure caused the flow fluctuations to exceed targeted values by unacceptable levels. The HS cassette shows promise for effective engineering evaluations of control technologies and strategies and near real-time diesel particulate matter measurements for a variety of occupations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3aoccupational health and safety 3aparticulates1 aBugarski, A.1 aVanderslice, S.1 aHummer, J.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 June, v. 192, no. 6 p.333-333dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8244-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03770naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245008600207520217500293592002802468650002002496650002502516650001102541650001702552650001902569650002002588650002002608650002702628650001602655650002002671650002102691650001302712650001902725650002102744650001402765650002202779650002502801650001702826651001002843651001002853651001802863653001202881653002102893653001502914653002002929653002502949700002302974700002202997773011403019856008603133852000903219655001203228IND60689838520221120140917.0200614e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068983852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1123812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFila, Gianni1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6881-979810aSimulating oilseed fatty acid composition through a stochastic modelling approach  aA simulation model was developed to study the accumulation dynamics of seed oil fatty acids (FAs) in response to environmental stimuli. The Petri Net (PN) formalism was used to encode a virtual analogue of the FA biosynthetic pathway, where the process is governed by rules targeting enzymatic regulatory mechanisms. Four alternative types of rules were conceived: i) constant enzymatic activity throughout seed development; ii) enzymatic activity regulated by temperature; iii) enzymatic activity regulated by time-dependent gene expression; iv) combination of temperature- and time-dependent regulatory mechanisms. A set of 10 PN-based candidate models were built upon these rules to be evaluated against real oil composition data gathered during seed development.Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz was chosen as a case-study crop to test model performance. Published experimental datasets from Italy, Spain and the USA were used to calibrate and validate the models through a cross-validation procedure.Models incorporating endogenous time-based regulation showed higher predictive power than those built upon temperature-based rules, but the best results were obtained when combinations of both types of rules were used. The highest scoring model used the beta function to model endogenously regulated time-dependency of enzymatic activity, and the response to temperature. The fitted model correctly reproduced time-course FA accumulation. In order to assess its behaviour under climate change, sample simulations were run under two artificial scenarios, one characterized by increased air temperature, and the other by imposed restriction to photosynthetic carbon supply to the seed. The latter scenario was intended to mimic drought stress in particular. At higher temperatures the model predicted an increase in saturated and monounsaturated FAs, with a concomitant decrease of the polyunsaturated fraction.Under simulated carbon restrictions the prevailing behaviour was a lowering of monounsaturated FAs whereas the polyunsaturated fraction markedly increased. In both case-studies the predicted responses were found to be consistent with previous literature reports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3amodel validation 3aoilseeds 3aphotosynthesis 3aseed development 3aseed oils 3asimulation models 3astochastic processes 3awater stress 3aItaly 3aSpain 3aUnited States 0aOilseed 0aSimulation model 0aPetri Nets 0aCamelina sativa 0aEnvironmental stress1 aCappelli, Giovanni1 aGinaldi, Fabrizio0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2020 Aug., v. 150 p.112381-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.1123813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245005900172300001800231520091500249592002801164650001301192650002501205650002001230650001901250650000901269650001801278650001801296650001201314650001301326650001401339650001001353650001501363650001201378653002701390653001401417653001701431653001001448653003201458700002201490700002301512700002101535773010501556856008401661852000901745655001201754IND60122234720221122194550.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012223472DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2013.7900272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Amany K.10aAnti-H5N1 virus flavonoids from Capparis sinaica Veill  ap. 2149-2153.  aMethanolic extract of Capparis sinaica Veill was tested for its in vitro antiviral activity against highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1 using plaque inhibition assay in Madin–Darby canine kidney.

The fractions eluted with EtOAc and 25% MeOH in EtOAc were found to hold the antiviral activity. Further chromatographic separation of the fractions holding the antiviral activity led to the isolation of quercetin (1), isoquercetin (2) and rutin (3) for the first time from this species. The isolates showed reduction in the virus titre by 68.13%, 79.66% and 73.22% inhibition at a concentration of 1 ng/ml, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapparis 3aantiviral properties 3aavian influenza 3achromatography 3adogs 3aethyl acetate 3afractionation 3akidneys 3amethanol 3aquercetin 3arutin 3aviral load 3aviruses 0aCapparis sinaica Veill 0aquercetin 0aisoquercetin 0arutin 0aanti-influenza virus (H5N1)1 aYoussef, Ahmed I.1 aArafa, Abdel Satar1 aAhmed, Safwat A.0 tNatural product research.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 27, no. 22 p.2149-2153dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2013.7900273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245012800152300002000280520188200300592002802182650001202210650001302222650001102235650002302246650002102269650001302290650001702303650001402320650001602334700002002350773012302370856007402493852000902567655001202576IND60640481820221122052707.0190504e20160509xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064048182DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra03299k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fei10aUltrafast photoisomerization of pinacyanol: watching an excited state reaction transiting from barrier to barrierless forms  ap. 45210-45218.  aPhotoisomerization of 1,1′-diethyl-2,2′-carbocyanine iodide (pinacyanol) in alcohols was investigated by means of femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. Only one out of two possible types of photoisomer was found. Viscosity-dependent kinetics indicate that the excited state dynamics consist of two parts, associated with a barrier-crossing observed in the blue side of stimulated emission (SE) and the barrierless isomerization observed in the red side of SE. These two processes occur sequentially. The blue barrier SE part is characterized by a decay lifetime (τ₁, 5.2 ps in methanol) that is constant over the observed spectral region. Dependence of τ₁ on solvent viscosity (η) is linear and follows Kramer’s law for barrier-crossing reactions. The red barrierless part is faster and is characterized by a rise in time constants, which increases with the wavelength (τ₂λ, from 0.2 to 0.6 ps for 720–1000 nm range in methanol). τ₂λ depends on η as a fractional power function and follows BFO theory for barrierless photoisomerization. The overall photoisomerization rate is limited by the barrier-crossing rate, τ₁⁻¹. A two-state two-mode model with a saddle-type of potential energy surface (PES) was used to explain the observed spectral dynamics. Along the stretching mode it is barrierless while along the torsion mode there is a very small barrier. As a result, the PES becomes ridge-like after displacement along the stretching coordinate. Comparing pinacyanol and 1,1′-diethyl-2,2′-cyanine iodide (1122C) with similar excited state lifetimes (5.2 vs. 4.9 ps) but quite different photoisomer quantum yields (QY, 3.6% vs. 26%, respectively), we conclude that excited state PES properties play the most important role in determining when the torsion mode couples with the stretching mode, and as a result the photoisomer QY.  aPublisher supplied data 3aisomers 3amethanol 3amodels 3aphotoisomerization 3apotential energy 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3aviscosity 3awavelengths1 aYartsev, Arkady0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 09, v. 6, no. 51 p.45210-45218dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03299k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04341naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245013500193300001800328520184600346592002802192650002502220650002302245650000902268650001502277650002502292650001602317650002702333650002302360650000902383650001202392650001402404650002102418650003002439650000902469650001302478650000902491650002302500650001202523650002202535650003702557650001602594650002302610650005902633650003502692650002202727650004302749650002102792650001102813650002402824650002702848650003802875650002902913650002102942650002202963650000902985650002302994650001503017650002603032650003303058650004203091650005603133650001803189700001903207700001203226700001703238700001603255700001803271700001803289700002003307773010603327856008103433852000903514655001203523IND50069441220221120225918.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006944122DNAL7 a232627492pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-012-0479-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Kristina E.10aDiverse effects of oats on cholesterol metabolism in C57BL/6 mice correlate with expression of hepatic bile acid-producing enzymes  ap. 1755-1769.  aPURPOSE: We previously reported that two substrains of C57BL/6 mice respond differently to oats with respect to reduction in plasma cholesterol. Analysis of this difference might offer clues to mechanisms behind the cholesterol-lowering effect of oats. Here, we address the possible roles of hepatic steroid metabolism and the intestinal microbiota in this respect. METHODS: Female C57BL/6 mice were fed an atherogenic diet with oat bran (27 %) or control fibres for 4 weeks. RESULTS: C57BL/6 NCrl mice responded to oat bran with 19 ± 1 % (P < 0.001) lower plasma cholesterol, 40 ± 5 % (P < 0.01) higher excretion of bile acids and increased expression of the bile acid-producing hepatic enzymes CYP7A1 and CYP8B1, but none of these effects were found in C57BL/6JBomTac mice. However, on control diet, C57BL/6JBomTac had tenfold higher expression of CYP7A1 and levels of hepatic cholesterol esters than C57BL/6NCrl mice. Plasma levels of fructosamine indicated improved glycemic control by oat bran in C57BL/6NCrl but not in C57BL/6JBomTac. C57BL/6JBomTac had higher intestinal microbiota diversity, but lower numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, Akkermansia and Bacteroides Fragilis than C57BL/6NCrl mice. Oat bran increased bacterial numbers in both substrains. Microbiota diversity was reduced by oats in C57BL/6JBomTac, but unaffected in C57BL/6NCrl. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support a connection between altered microbiota diversity and reduced plasma cholesterol, but the bacterial composition in the intestine may influence the effects of added fibres. The cholesterol-lowering properties of oats involve increased production of bile acids via the classical pathway with up-regulation of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1. Altered cholesterol or bile acid metabolism may interfere with the potential of oats to reduce plasma cholesterol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3abile 3abile acids 3acholesteremic effect 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3acholesteryl esters 3adiet 3aenzymes 3aexcretion 3aglycemic control 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amice 3aoat bran 3aoats 3asteroid metabolism 2aAnimals 2aAvenaxchemistry. 2aBile Acids and Saltsxmetabolism 2aBody Weight 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCholesterol Estersxmetabolism 2aDiet, Atherogenic 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aFructosaminexblood 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aLipid Metabolism 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMicrobiota 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSteroid 12-alpha-Hydroxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulation1 aAxling, Ulrika1 aXu, Jie1 aSwärd, Karl1 aAhrné, Siv1 aMolin, Göran1 aHolm, Cecilia1 aHellstrand, Per0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2013 Oct., v. 52, no. 7 p.1755-1769dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-012-0479-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245009900177300002000276520119400296592002801490650001201518650001201530650001301542650001701555650001101572650002501583650001101608650001301619650001901632650001101651650001001662700002501672700001901697700005701716700006101773773017301834856008002007852000902087655001202096IND60608703720180906000000.0180808e20180709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b020132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos, Antoniel Carlos C.12aA Perspective of Solutions for Membrane Instabilities in Olefin/Paraffin Separations: A Review  ap. 10071-10085.  aLight olefins are mainly produced by naphtha steam cracking, which is among the more energy intensive processes in the petrochemical industry. To save energy, some alternatives have been proposed to partially replace or combine with cryogenic distillation the conventional technology to separate olefins and paraffins. Within this aim, facilitated transport membranes, mainly with Ag⁺ cations as selective carriers, have received great attention owing to the high selectivity and permeance provided. However, to be used industrially, the undesirable instability associated with the Ag⁺ cation should be considered. Poisonous agents and polymer membrane materials are sources of Ag⁺ deactivation. In recent years, great achievements on the separation performance have been reported, but the current challenge is to maintain the selectivity in long-term separation processes. This work presents a critical analysis of the potential causes of Ag⁺ deactivation and points out some alternatives that have been proposed to overcome the hurdle. This review highlights and critically analyses some perspectives of the ongoing development and application of facilitated transport membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3acations 3acracking 3adistillation 3aenergy 3aoil and gas industry 3aolefin 3apolymers 3aprocess design 3asilver 3asteam1 ados Reis, Rodrigo A.1 aOrtiz, Alfredo1 aGorri, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5403-15451 aOrtiz, Inmaculada1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3257-48210 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 July 09, v. 57, no. 31 p.10071-10085dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b020133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010000164300001400264520147100278592002801749650003001777650001301807650003101820650001901851650001701870650001901887650002101906650001701927650001601944650001901960700001901979700001401998700002102012700001402033700001502047700001802062773009002080856008102170852000902251655001202260IND60085788320221118020944.0141101e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008578832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Li-Yun10aCharacterization of CdTe/CdSe quantum dots-transferrin fluorescent probes for cellular labeling  ap. 86-92.  aIn this paper, we prepared three types of transferrin-quantum dots conjugates (QDs-Tf) using three different methods (electrostatic interaction, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) coupling, denatured transferrin (dTf) coating). Fluorescence emission spectra, surface characteristics, zeta potentials of quantum dots (QDs) and QDs-Tf fluorescent probes were characterized by spectrophotometer, capillary electrophoresis, and dynamic light scattering. Fluorescent imaging of HeLa cells was also performed by QDs and QDs-Tf fluorescent probes. It was found that the fluorescence imaging performances of QDs-Tf probes prepared by electrostatic interaction and EDC coupling were better compared with the one prepared by dTf coating. Then a real-time single cell detection system was established to quantitatively evaluate cell labeling effects of QDs-Tf fluorescent probes. It was found that for cell labeling efficiency, the proportion of cells labeled by quantum dot probes to a group of cells, QDs-Tf probe prepared by EDC coupling showed the highest labeling efficiency (85.55±3.88%), followed by electrostatic interaction (78.86±9.57%), and dTf coating showed the lowest (40.09±10.2%). This efficiency order was confirmed by flow cytometry results. This study demonstrated the relationship between conjugation methods and the resultant QDs-Tf probes and provided a foundation for choosing appropriate QDs-Tf probes in cell labeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acoatings 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3alight scattering 3aquantum dots 3atransferrin 3azeta potential1 aLi, Yong-Qiang1 aLin, Song1 aZhang, Ming-Zhen1 aChen, Jun1 aMa, Zhi-Ya1 aZhao, Yuan-Di0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 741 p.86-92dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245015700162300001400319506002800333520107700361592002801438506003701466650001101503650001901514650002401533650001201557650001301569650001201582650003201594650001101626650001401637650001201651650001301663650001601676650001901692650002001711650001201731650003701743700002001780773013301800856007701933852000902010655001202019IND60785516920221207060005.0111202e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078551692DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha39262432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Ying-Ning,10aSodium Chloride Stress Induced Changes in Leaf Osmotic Adjustment of Trifoliate Orange (Poncirus trifoliata) Seedlings Inoculated with Mycorrhizal Fungi  ap. 64-69.  aResource is Open Access  aCitrus plants are sensitive to salinity, and thus employing new approaches to alleviate salt damage are necessary. The present study evaluated the effect of two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), Glomus mosseae and G. versiforme, on leaf osmotic adjustment of trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedings exposed to 100 mM NaCl. Salinity significantly inhibited mycorrhizal colonization, plant biomass and leaf relative water content, whereas the reduce of plant biomass was notably alleviated by the mycorrhizal colonization. Mycorrhizal seedlings exhibited significantly lower Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations, whilst also recorded higher K+ concentration and K+/Na+, Ca2+/Na+ and Mg2+/Na+ ratios at both salinity levels. Under salinity stress, mycorrhizal symbiosis markedly decreased sucrose concentrations of leaves and also increased glucose, fructose and proline concentrations of leaves. The results suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizas improved leaf osmotic adjustment responses of the seedlings to salt stress, thus enhancing salt tolerance of mycorrhizal plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCitrus 3aGlomus mosseae 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3acalcium 3afructose 3aglucose 3aleaf relative water content 3aleaves 3aphytomass 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asucrose 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aQiang-Sheng, WU0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2011 Nov., v. 39, no. 2 p.64-69dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha39262433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002100188245013600209300001100345506007600356520166300432592002802095506003702123650001802160650001702178650001702195650002302212650001802235650001302253650001902266650002602285650001202311650001302323650001402336650001302350650001502363650002202378650002202400700002602422700001902448700002202467773011802489856008202607852000902689655001202698IND60590575220221207115546.0191213e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059057522DNAL7 a295076082pmid7 aPMC58318432pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-018-1051-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Caterina10aCreating a more robust 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidase by combining computational predictions with a novel effective library design  ap. 56.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: HMF oxidase (HMFO) from Methylovorus sp. is a recently characterized flavoprotein oxidase. HMFO is a remarkable enzyme as it is able to oxidize 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA): a catalytic cascade of three oxidation steps. Because HMF can be formed from fructose or other sugars and FDCA is a polymer building block, this enzyme has gained interest as an industrially relevant biocatalyst. RESULTS: To increase the robustness of HMFO, a requirement for biotechnological applications, we decided to enhance its thermostability using the recently developed FRESCO method: a computational approach to identify thermostabilizing mutations in a protein structure. To make this approach even more effective, we now developed a new and facile gene shuffling approach to rapidly combine stabilizing mutations in a one-pot reaction. This allowed the identification of the optimal combination of seven beneficial mutations. The created thermostable HMFO mutant was further studied as a biocatalyst for the production of FDCA from HMF and was shown to perform significantly better than the original HMFO. CONCLUSIONS: The described new gene shuffling approach quickly discriminates stable and active multi-site variants. This makes it a very useful addition to FRESCO. The resulting thermostable HMFO variant tolerates the presence of cosolvents and also remained thermotolerant after introduction of additional mutations aimed at improving the catalytic activity. Due to its stability and catalytic efficiency, the final HMFO variant appears to be a promising candidate for industrial scale production of FDCA from HMF.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA shuffling 3aMethylovorus 3abiocatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aflavoproteins 3afructose 3aheat tolerance 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amutants 3amutation 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3aprediction 3aprotein structure 3athermal stability1 aOvalle Maqueo, Amaury1 aWijma, Hein J.1 aFraaije, Marco W.0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.56-56dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1051-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012400173300001600297500001500313520123700328592002801565650001701593650001301610650002801623650001401651650000901665650002101674650001701695650001401712650001001726650001501736650002001751650001701771650001501788650002001803650001401823653002101837653001701858653002701875653001101902700001901913700002001932700002301952700002301975773013101998856004802129852000902177655001202186IND50074624620221119150513.0140408e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007462462DNAL7 a10.1080/104083909035517472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrisciandaro, Luca D.10aEvidence Supporting the use of Probiotics for the Prevention and Treatment of Chemotherapy-Induced Intestinal Mucositis  ap. 239-247.  a2019-12-05  aAlthough chemotherapy remains the current best practice for the treatment of neoplasia, the severity of its associated side-effects continues to impact detrimentally on the quality of life. Mucositis can affect both the oral cavity and intestine, and represents one of the most common side-effects of chemotherapy. It is characterized by ulceration, inflammation, diarrhoea, and intense abdominal pain. Despite extensive research there remains no definitive therapy for mucositis. This may be due to the multiple factors which contribute to its pathogenesis, including up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased apoptosis of epithelial cells, alteration of the gastrointestinal microbiota, and damage to the epithelium. Although employed increasingly in other gastrointestinal disorders, probiotics are yet to be comprehensively investigated in the treatment or prevention of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Probiotic-based therapies have been shown to exert beneficial effects, including modulation of the microbiota and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review outlines the current evidence supporting the use of probiotics in intestinal mucositis, and suggests further research directions for the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug therapy 3adiarrhea 3agastrointestinal system 3aneoplasms 3apain 3aepithelial cells 3ainflammation 3acytokines 3amouth 3aprobiotics 3aquality of life 3apathogenesis 3aepithelium 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 0afunctional foods 0achemotherapy 0agastrointestinal tract 0acancer1 aGeier, Mark S.1 aButler, Ross N.1 aCummins, Adrian G.1 aHowarth, Gordon S.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 51, no. 3 p.239-247dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408390903551747  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245012300175300001400298506002800312520113700340592002801477506003701505650002301542650001001565650002601575650001501601650001001616650001501626650001501641650002401656650001301680653002501693653002801718653002601746773013001772856008901902852000901991655001202000IND60785517320221207055413.0180405e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078551732DNAL7 a10.20885/eksakta.vol18.iss1.art62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahmalia, Dinita10aEstimation of Exponential Smoothing Parameter on Pesticide Characteristic Forecast using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)  ap. 56-63.  aResource is Open Access  aPest in agriculture can raise plant disease and fail to harvest. The pest problem in agriculture can be solved by using pesticide. Pesticide usage must be done proportionally. So, the manufacturer should fix standard pesticide active ingredient in pesticide production. Forecast is a prediction of some future evens. In forecast problem, there are any parameters which should be determined. Parameters can be estimated by exact method or heuristic method. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is inspired from the cooperative behavior of ant colonies, which can find the shortest path from their nest to a food source. In this research, we use heuristic method like ACO to estimate exponential smoothing parameter on pesticide active ingredient forecast and pesticide sample weight forecast. From the simulation, on the first iteration, all ants choose parameter randomly. At the optimization process, we update pheromone until all ants choose the similar parameter so that process converges and variance approaches to zero. The optimal exponential smoothing parameter can be applied in forecasting with minimum sum of squared error (SSE).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive ingredients 3anests 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3apests 3apheromones 3aprediction 3asystem optimization 3avariance 0aParameter estimation 0aAnt Colony Optimization 0aExponential Smoothing0 tEksakta: Jurnal Ilmu-Ilmu MIPA.g2018 Mar., v. 18, no. 1 p.56-63dUniversitas Islam IndonesiawJournal:27753x2503-23647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20885/eksakta.vol18.iss1.art63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003600149245007800185300001600263520134800279592002801627650001701655650001201672650001801684650001701702650001101719650001301730650002101743653001501764653002701779653002401806653001801830653002501848653002301873700002401896700002901920700002301949700003201972773009502004856008402099852000902183655001202192IND60528023420221120151242.0190416e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052802342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2016.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabanelas, Iago Teles Dominguez10aCell diameter doesn't affect lipid productivity of Chlorococcum littorale  ap. 333-341.  aWe hypothesized that cells with different diameter have different division rates, which could affect lipid productivity (lipid content×biomass productivity). In the present work we assessed the influence of cell diameter, as a sorting parameter, on both biomass and lipid productivity of Chlorococcum littorale. Prior to sorting, cells were grown in a batch-wise nitrogen run-out including a long nitrogen depleted phase (N−) to stop cell division, thus only having vegetative cells (Pre-sorting). Cell sorting was done at the end of this N− phase using FACS (fluorescence assisted cell sorting) based on forward scatter as a proxy for diameter (size ranges (μm): 5–6 (small), 8–9 (medium), 11–14 (large) and 5–14 (control)). The sorting was done in 2 pools: multiple-cell (100 cells) and single-cell. After sorting, cells were recovered under low-light for 2weeks, and used to start the Post-sorting experiment (analogous to Pre-sorting). The populations derived from different sorted pools, single-cell and multiple-cell, showed similar size distributions after re-growth. No difference was observed in biomass and lipid productivities among Post-sorting cells and when compared to Pre-sorting cells under nitrogen depletion. We concluded that cellular size had no effect on both biomass and lipid productivity of C. littorale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorococcum 3abiomass 3acell division 3afluorescence 3alipids 3anitrogen 3avegetative cells 0aMicroalgae 0aChlorococcum littorale 0aCell sorting (FACS) 0aCell diameter 0aBiomass productivity 0aLipid productivity1 aFernandes, Carolina1 aKleinegris, Dorinde M.M.1 aWijffels, René H.1 aBarbosa, M.

Greener production is now becoming an order qualifier for the global competition. Modeling biofuel supply chains that achieve economic, social, and environmental feasibility is a challenge. This article develops biofuel platform planning and optimization that unifies biofuel product, production process and networks design into an umbrella of sustainable supply chain planning. A design of biofuel supply chain networks under various production paths is considered. The modeling results show that an optimum region of composition ratio between rice straws and waste cooking oils can be set within the range from 0% to 50%. Bio-diesel is favored over ethanol by occupying over 40% of the total biofuel outputs. However, ethanol yield is 99.1% and therefore it is sufficient to be directly mixed with gasoline at final depots. In terms of social contribution, it is estimated that the supply chain contribution to the case country GDP is about 0.17%. Looking at the above statistics, future research on global economic impacts and competitiveness of biofuel production is suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acooking fats and oils 3aeconomic impact 3aethanol 3afuel production 3agasoline 3akitchen waste 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aplanning 3arice straw 3astatistics 3asupply chain 3asustainable manufacturing 0aBiofuel 0aOptimization 0aRice straws 0aUsed cooking oil 0aSupply chains1 aZhu, Liandong0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Sept., v. 140 p.563-579dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.03.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012200155300001800277520141200295592002801707650002101735650001201756650001401768650001201782650001701794650001101811650002601822650001101848650002301859650001301882650001101895700001901906700001601925700001801941700002001959700001901979700001901998700002202017700002202039773011102061856007502172852000902247655001202256IND60529066620221121055331.0160717e20120619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052906662DNAL7 a10.1021/ac300355w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Gang10aMicroarray of Human P450 with an Integrated Oxygen Sensing Film for High-Throughput Detection of Metabolic Activities  ap. 5292-5297.  aA microarray chip containing human P450 isoforms was constructed for the parallel assay of their metabolic activities. The chip had microwells that contained vertically integrated P450 and oxygen sensing layers. The oxygen sensing film was made of an organically modified silica film (ORMOSIL) doped with tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium dichloride (Ru(dpp)₃Cl₂). Human P450s (23 types) expressed in E. coli and purified as membrane fractions were immobilized in agarose matrixes on the oxygen sensing layer. The activities of P450s were determined by evaluating the fluorescence intensity enhancement of the oxygen sensor due to the oxygen consumption by the metabolic reaction. By normalizing the responses with the amounts of oxygen sensor and P450 enzymes in microwells, we could obtain fluorescence enhancement patterns that were characteristic to the combination of P450 isoforms and substrate material. The patterns obtained from two psoralen derivatives resembled each other, whereas a structurally different substrate (capsaicin) resulted in a distinct pattern. These results suggest the potential of the microarray to analyze the activities of diverse P450 isoforms in a high-throughput fashion. Furthermore, mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) of P450 could be detected by successively incubating a chip with different substrate solutions and measuring the residual activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aagarose 3acapsaicin 3aenzymes 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3amicroarray technology 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3apsoralen 3asilica1 aMori, Yoshinao1 aMori, Saori1 aIrie, Takashi1 aNagai, Hidenori1 aGoto, Tatsushi1 aTatsu, Yoshiro1 aImaishi, Hiromasa1 aMorigaki, Kenichi0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 June 19, v. 84, no. 12 p.5292-5297dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac300355w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04844naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245013700167506025800304520289100562592002803453650002003481650002903501650001703530650001703547650002003564650001303584650002003597650001003617650001503627650001203642650001103654650001303665650001503678650001903693650001703712650001303729650001903742650001903761650001203780650001003792650002103802651001003823653002603833653003203859653003503891653001703926653001903943700001903962700003303981700001804014700002104032773011604053856007604169852000904245655001204254IND60573557920221116223135.0170724e20170623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057355792DNAL7 a10.4081/ija.2017.8472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFracchiolla, Mariano10aConservation and Pastoral Value of Former Arable Lands in the Agro-Pastoral System of the Alta Murgia National Park (Southern Italy)  aThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License (by-nc 4.0) which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.  aGrasslands are an important element of European landscapes and environment. In the last decades, several causes have contributed to their decline, among which the intensification of agriculture activities. The National Park of Alta Murgia represents a typical agro-pastoral karst system where the conversion to arable lands caused a drastic decline of semi-natural rocky grasslands of high naturalistic value that traditionally were used for sheep grazing. This change of land use created much concern about the lack of biodiversity and soil degradation. Thus, the Park Authority promotes reconversions of arable lands into grasslands to safeguard biodiversity, increase pastoralism and enhance the multi-functionality of farms. This study evaluates the conservation and pastoral value of plant communities in former arable lands derived from grasslands conversion (by crushing the rocky substrate) and subsequently abandoned. We selected seven sites of these abandoned arable lands, no longer ploughed or sown for three to five or twelve to fifteen years. In order to have a comparison with situations of low anthropic pressures, other five sites were selected in nearby natural rocky grasslands, without evidence of soil disturbance. Further two sites were selected in lands manually cleared from stones and taken out of crop production for more than fifty years. Vegetation samples were carried out according to the standard phytosociological method. Shannon and Richness indexes, ecological and phytogeographical quality and pastoral value were calculated. The ecological quality was calculated through the ratio between cover of diagnostic taxa of the higher syntaxonomic units characterising the undisturbed pastures and total cover. The phytogeographical value was evaluated considering the cover of endemic, sub-endemic and rare taxa out of the total cover value of each plant sample. For the calculation of pastoral value we considered the palatability of taxa on a scale ranging from 0 to 5 according to data found in scientific literature. From a conservation perspective, sites originated from the conversion of rocky pastures by crushing of the rocky surface showed marked differences from undisturbed grasslands, even after 15 years from abandonment. Lands manually cleared and abandoned for more than fifty years did not show appreciable differences from semi-natural grasslands, conserving many taxa of high conservation value. On the other hand, fields originated from grasslands conversion showed higher pastoral value. This paper emphasises the need for safeguarding the rocky substrates and their remnant typical grassland communities, even in the so-called quote. Results are useful for the sustainable management of the agro-pastoral system of Alta Murgia, taking into account the ecological and economic role of those lands whose rocky substrate had been crushed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagropastoralism 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarable soils 3abiodiversity 3acrop production 3acrushing 3adisturbed soils 3afarms 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3akarsts 3aland use 3alandscapes 3anational parks 3apalatability 3apastures 3aphytogeography 3aphytosociology 3aplowing 3asheep 3asoil degradation 3aItaly 0aAgro-pastoral systems 0aHigh nature value farmlands 0aMediterranean rocky grasslands 0aNatural park 0aStone crushing1 aTerzi, Massimo1 aD’Amico, Francesco Saverio1 aTedone, Luigi1 aCazzato, Eugenio0 tItalian journal of agronomy.g2017 June 23, v. 12, no. 2dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2039-68057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/ija.2017.8473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01917naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010100166300001600267520056700283592002800850650001900878650003300897650002500930650002100955650001400976650001900990650001101009650004101020650001401061650001501075650001001090651001401100651001201114653001201126653002601138653002801164700001801192700001701210700001601227700001901243773010401262856008401366852000901450655001201459IND60122927620221119070921.0150325e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012292762DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2012.6595212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcevedo, B.10aChemical profiles of Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia) peel oils of different cultivars of Argentina  ap. 131-136.  aPeel and leaf oils of three lime populations, belonging to the Citrus limonia Osbeck species were obtained from fruits collected on lime trees submitted to the same pedoclimatic and cultural conditions.

Assessing wind turbine performance under laboratory ideal conditions will always tend to be optimistic and rarely reflects how the turbine actually behaves in a real situation. Occasionally, some aerogenerators produce significantly different from nominal power curve, causing economic losses to the promoters of the investment. Our research aims to model actual wind turbine power curve and its variation from nominal power curve. The study was carried out in three different phases starting from wind speed and related power production data of a Senvion MM92 aero-generator with a rated power of 2.05 MW. The first phase was focused on statistical analyses, using the most common and reliable probability density functions. The second phase was focused on the analysis and modelling of real power curves obtained on site during one year of operation by fitting processes on real production data. The third was focused on the development of a model based on the use of an Artificial Neural Networks that can predict the amount of delivered power. The actual power curve modelled with a multi-layered neural network was compared with nominal characteristics and the performances assessed by the turbine SCADA. For the studied device, deviations are below 1% for the producibility and below 0.5% for the actual power curves obtained with both methods. The model can be used for any wind turbine to verify real performances and to check fault conditions helping operators in understanding normal and abnormal behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal behavior 3afinancial economics 3aneural networks 3apower generation 3aprobability distribution 3awind power 3awind speed 3awind turbines 0aWind energy, power curve 0aProducibility estimates 0aAero-generator 0aAnemometric campaign 0aArtificial neural network1 aD’Amico, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2848-03521 aDi Dio, V.1 aLo Brano, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5728-03790 tRenewable energy.g2019 Sept., v. 140 p.477-492dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.03.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245013000168300001600298500001500314520207300329592002802402650001202430650001202442650001502454650001802469650002202487650002302509650001102532650002302543650002202566650002102588650002702609650002202636651001802658651001102676653001702687700002802704700002102732773010502753856008102858852000902939655001202948IND4389664520221119211423.0151024e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438966452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-006-9033-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeFalco, Lesley A.10aVariation in the establishment of a non-native annual grass influences competitive interactions with Mojave Desert perennials  ap. 293-307.  a2019-12-06  aCompetition between native and non-native species can change the composition and structure of plant communities, but in deserts, the highly variable timing of resource availability also influences non-native plant establishment, thus modulating their impacts on native species. In a field experiment, we varied densities of the non-native annual grass Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens around individuals of three native Mojave Desert perennials—Larrea tridentata, Achnatherum hymenoides, and Pleuraphis rigida—in either winter or spring. For comparison, additional plots were prepared for the same perennial species and seasons, but with a mixture of native annual species as neighbors. Growth of perennials declined when Bromus was established in winter because Bromus stands had 2–3 months of growth and high water use before perennial growth began. However, water potentials for the perennials were not significantly reduced, suggesting that direct competition for water may not be the major mechanism driving reduced perennial growth. The impact of Bromus on Larrea was lower than for the two perennial grasses, likely because Larrea maintains low growth rates throughout the year, even after Bromus has completed its life cycle. This result contrasts with the perennial grasses, whose phenology completely overlaps with (Achnatherum) or closely follows (Pleuraphis) that of Bromus. In comparison, Bromus plants established in spring were smaller than those established in winter and thus did not effectively reduce growth of the perennials. Growth of perennials with mixed annuals as neighbors also did not differ from those with Bromus neighbors of equivalent biomass, but stands of these native annuals did not achieve the high biomass of Bromus stands that were necessary to reduce perennial growth. Seed dormancy and narrow requirements for seedling survivorship of native annuals produce densities and biomass lower than those achieved by Bromus; thus, impacts of native Mojave Desert annuals on perennials are expected to be lower than those of Bromus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3agrasses 3aperennials 3aplant density 3aLarrea tridentata 3aseasonal variation 3aBromus 3aindigenous species 3aplant competition 3ainvasive species 3aAchnatherum hymenoides 3aintroduced plants 3aMojave Desert 3aNevada 0aplant growth1 aFernandez, George C.

The levels of miRNAs can be useful biomarkers for cellular events or disease diagnosis, thus the method for sensitive and selective detection of miRNAs is imperative to miRNA discovery, study, and clinical diagnosis. Here we develop a novel method to quantify miRNA expression levels as low as attomolar sensitivity by target-assisted isothermal exponential amplification coupled with fluorescent DNA-scaffolded AgNCs and demonstrated its feasibility in the application of detecting miRNA in real samples. The method reveals superior sensitivity with a detection limit of miRNA of 2 aM synthetic spike-in target miRNA under pure conditions (approximately 15 copies of a miRNA molecule in a volume of 10 μL) and can detect at least a 10 aM spike-in target miRNA in cell lysates. The method also shows the high selectivity for discriminating differences between miRNA family members, thus providing a promising alternative to standard approaches for quantitative detection of miRNA. This simple and cost-effective strategy has a potential of becoming the major tool for simultaneous quantitative analysis of multiple miRNAs (biomarkers) in tissues or cells and supplies valuable information for biomedical research and clinical early diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3afluorescence 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative analysis 3atissues1 aZhang, Min1 aYin, Bin-Cheng1 aYe, Bang-Ce0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 June 19, v. 84, no. 12 p.5165-5169dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac300483f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017700165300001400342520114500356592002801501650002301529650001101552650001201563650001401575650001901589650001901608650004101627650002301668650000901691650002201700650000901722650000901731650001401740650001401754650001301768650001401781650001301795650001101808650003201819650001301851650001601864700001801880773009001898856008101988852000902069655001202078IND60085789020221118021122.0141101e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008578902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Hyun-Hee10aSensitive and robotic determination of bromate in sea water and drinking deep-sea water by headspace solid-phase micro extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 32-37.  aA robotic method has been established for the determination of bromate in sea water and drinking deep-sea water. Bromate in water was converted into volatile derivative, which was measured with headspace solid-phase micro extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME GC–MS). Derivatization reagent and the HS-SPME parameters (selection of fibre, extraction/derivatization temperature, heating time and; the morality of HCl) were optimized and selected. Under the established conditions, the detection and the quantification limits were 0.016μgL⁻¹ and 0.051μgL⁻¹, respectively, and the intra- and inter-day relative standard deviation was less than 7% at concentrations of 1.0 and 10.0μgL⁻¹. The calibration curve showed good linearity with r²=0.9998. The common ions Cl⁻, NO₃ ⁻, SO₄ ²⁻, HPO₄ ²⁻, H₂PO₄ ⁻, K⁺, Na⁺, NH₄ ⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Ba²⁺, Mn⁴⁺, Mn²⁺, Fe³⁺ and Fe²⁺ did not interfere even when present in 1000-fold excess over the active species. The method was successfully applied to the determination of bromate in sea water and drinking deep-sea water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3abarium 3acalcium 3achlorides 3aderivatization 3adrinking water 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrates 3apotassium 3aseawater 3asodium 3asolid phase microextraction 3asulfates 3atemperature1 aShin, Ho-Sang0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 741 p.32-37dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03833naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245012900208300001000337506007600347520232600423592002802749506003702777650001202814650001602826650001902842650001702861650001902878650001502897650001602912650001202928650001302940650001402953650002202967650001602989650002203005650002603027700002103053700002203074700002803096700002003124773011603144856008203260852000903342655001203351IND60590575820221207103901.0191213e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059057582DNAL7 a293718842pmid7 aPMC57710132pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-017-1008-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrenzel, Elrike10aIn vivo selection of sfGFP variants with improved and reliable functionality in industrially important thermophilic bacteria  ap. 8.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Fluorescent reporter proteins (FP) have become an indispensable tool for the optimization of microbial cell factories and in synthetic biology per se. The applicability of the currently available FPs is, however, constrained by species-dependent performance and misfolding at elevated temperatures. To obtain functional reporters for thermophilic, biotechnologically important bacteria such as Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius, an in vivo screening approach based on a mutational library of superfolder GFP was applied. RESULTS: Flow cytometry-based benchmarking of a set of GFPs, sfGFPs and species-specific codon-optimized variants revealed that none of the proteins was satisfyingly detectable in P. thermoglucosidasius at its optimal growth temperature of 60 °C. An undirected mutagenesis approach coupled to fluorescence-activated cell sorting allowed the isolation of sfGFP variants that were extremely well expressed in the chassis background at 60 °C. Notably, a few nucleotide substitutions, including silent mutations, significantly improved the functionality and brightness. The best mutant sfGFP(N39D/A179A) showed an 885-fold enhanced mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) at 60 °C and is the most reliable reporter protein with respect to cell-to-cell variation and signal intensity reported so far. The in vitro spectral and thermostability properties were unaltered as compared to the parental sfGFP protein, strongly indicating that the combination of the amino acid exchange and an altered translation or folding speed, or protection from degradation, contribute to the strongly improved in vivo performance. Furthermore, sfGFP(N39D/A179A) and the newly developed cyan and yellow derivatives were successfully used for labeling several industrially relevant thermophilic bacilli, thus proving their broad applicability. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the power of in vivo isolation of thermostable proteins to obtain reporters for highly efficient fluorescence labeling.

In the upper part of this river, there are 3 large dams (Saguling, Cirata, and Jatiluhur) which operates hydroelectric power that supply ± 20% electricity needs of Java-Bali area. Run off discharge of the river are fluctuating widely so greatly affect the performance of electricity production, supply of irrigation, and household water in the downstream area. The research aims to identify character of river discharge of Citarum Hulu and its relation with land use changes and farm management. River discharge were analyzed at the inlet of Saguling dam in Kampung Nanjung and some stream monitoring stations located in Ciwidey, Cisangkuy, and Cikapundung-Gandok. River discharge was highly fluctuating. In the peak of rainy season the flow rate can reach 578 m3/sec which caused flooding in several area such as Majalaya, Banjaran, and Dayeuhkolot. In contrary, in dry season the flow was very low, about 2.7 m3/sec, causing drought, failure of rice harvest, and reduced water supply to hydropower plant of Saguling. In addition to affecting rainfall patterns, the flow rate fluctuations was also influenced by pattern of land use and management. Land utilization that was not in accordance with the land capability was the main cause of land degradation which in turn would decrease hydrology function of watershed to control river discharge in rainy season.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrought 3adry season 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3afarm management 3ahydroelectric power 3airrigation 3aland capability class 3aland degradation 3arain 3arice 3ariver flow 3arivers 3astreams 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aIndonesia 0acitarum upper watershed 0aland capability 0aland use 0ariver discharge1 aMurtilaksono, Kukuh1 aWahjunie, Enni Dwi1 aPanuju, Diah Retno0 tJurnal Ilmu Pertanian Indonesia.g2013 Aug., v. 18, no. 2 p.109-114dBogor Agricultural UniversitywJournal:27739x2443-34627nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012600167300001400293520157700307592002801884650001501912650001901927650001501946650000901961650002201970650001701992650001802009650001302027650001502040650001102055700001802066700002502084700001902109700002402128773009002152856008102242852000902323655001202332IND60085789220221118021112.0141101e20120905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008578922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2012.06.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupré, Mathieu10aSilica nanoparticles pre-spotted onto target plate for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analyses of peptides  ap. 47-57.  aWe report on the simple deposition of Stöber silica nanoparticles (SiO₂ NPs) on conventional MALDI target plate for high throughput laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) analyses of peptide mixtures with sensitivity in the femtomolar range. This low-cost easily prepared material allowed straightforward LDI experiments by deposition of the studied samples directly onto a pre-spotted MALDI plate. This analytical strategy can be performed in any laboratory equipped with a MALDI-TOF instrument. All key benefits of organic matrix-free technologies were satisfied while maintaining a high level of detection performances (sensitivity and reproducibility/repeatability). In particular, sample preparation was simple and detection in the low mass range was not hampered by matrix ions. Imaging studies were undertaken to query sample dispersion into the inert SiO₂ NPs and to help into the search of the best experimental conditions producing homogeneous analyte distribution within the deposit. In contrast to commercial disposable LDI targets designed for single use and requiring an adaptor such as NALDI™, the proposed SiO₂ NPs pre-spotting on a MALDI target plate allowed very easily switching between MALDI and LDI experiments. They can be conducted either simultaneously (positions with an organic matrix or SiO₂ NPs) or in the row (support prepared in advance, stored and washed after use). The overall cost and versatility of the methodology made it very attractive to MALDI users in many domains (peptidomics, proteomics, metabolomics).  aPublisher supplied data 3adesorption 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3ananoparticles 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3asilica1 aCantel, Sonia1 aDurand, Jean-Olivier1 aMartinez, Jean1 aEnjalbal, Christine0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2012 Sept. 5, v. 741 p.47-57dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2012.06.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03493naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005600111024002100167040001800188072000900206100001700215245013300232300001600365500002400381500001500405520149800420650002301918650001701941650001301958650001301971650001401984650001101998650002302009650002802032650002202060650001102082650001102093650001602104650001202120650004002132650002502172650001502197650001102212650003602223650000902259650001002268650002302278650001402301651001502315653002102330653001802351653001602369700001802385773012502403852000902528856011002537856011202647930003302759945002502792946001302817961001302830655001202843IND4402349720221121030135.0080303e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440234972DNAL7 a183301392pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101[226:COSMFD]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/149832hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aCastle, S.J.10aComparison of Sampling Methods for Determining Relative Densities of Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) on Citrus  ap. 226-235.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aFour sampling methods that included A-Vac, D-Vac, pole-bucket, and beat-net devices were evaluated for estimating relative densities of glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) nymphs and adults on citrus (Citrus spp.) trees. All four methods produced similar temporal and spatial distribution profiles, although significant differences in quantities of H. vitripennis adults and nymphs caught by each device were observed. The four sampling methods also showed a consistent male bias in adult populations across a range of densities, suggesting that previously reported male-biased sex ratios in H. vitripennis adult populations are real and not a product of sampling bias. A strong relationship (R2 = 0.95) between the monitoring methods we evaluated and yellow sticky trap catches of female H. vitripennis adults suggest that yellow sticky trap catches may provide a good relative index of infestation levels in citrus trees. Based on quantitative analyses examining precision and cost, the pole bucket was the most efficient method for sampling nymphs, and it was as efficient as the beat-net method for sampling adults and both stages combined. In addition to these analyses, consideration of other sampling characteristics such as added flexibility in sampling and higher sensitivity in detecting infestations within individual trees helped to fortify the conclusion that the pole bucket was the best overall sampling method of those tested. 3atemporal variation 3asticky traps 3asampling 3atrapping 3asex ratio 3anymphs 3apopulation density 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3aspatial variation 3aCitrus 3aimagos 3afruit trees 2aAnimals 2aBiometryxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aCitrusxparasitology 2aDemography 2aFemale 2aHemipteraxgrowth & development 2aMale 2aNymph 2aPopulation Density 2aSex Ratio 3aCalifornia 0asampling devices 0aadult insects 0amethodology1 aNaranjo, S.E.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2008 Feb., v.  101, no.  1 p.226-235dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101%5B226:COSMFD%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/149833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/05/23  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03303naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015800171300001600329500001500345520170900360592002802069650002702097650002802124650002602152650001302178650001402191650001802205650002902223650001102252650001402263650001502277650002402292650001302316650002202329650001902351650001402370653003602384653001702420653001302437653001802450653002402468700001402492700001302506700001602519700001902535773013302554856008902687852000902776655001202785IND60601518920221119125028.0180706e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060151892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2014.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Wan-Jie10aColistin for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: A systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 477-485.  a2019-12-06  aVentilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) has emerged as an important and intractable clinical problem. This review assessed the efficacy and safety of colistin for treatment of MDR GNB VAP. PubMed and Embase were searched for controlled studies of colistin for treatment of MDR GNB VAP. The Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model was used to pool odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was clinical cure; secondary outcomes were microbiological eradication, ICU mortality, hospital mortality, length of ICU stay and nephrotoxicity. Fourteen controlled studies involving 1167 patients were identified, including six reporting colistin versus β-lactam antibiotics, three reporting aerosolised (AS) plus intravenous (IV) colistin versus IV colistin alone and five reporting colistin combined therapy versus colistin monotherapy. The clinical cure rate of colistin was comparable with that of β-lactam antibiotics (OR=1.00, 95% CI 0.68–1.47). Compared with IV colistin alone, AS plus IV colistin exhibited a better clinical cure (OR=2.12, 95% CI 1.40–3.20). Compared with colistin monotherapy, colistin combined therapy did not appear to provide a better clinical cure (OR=1.38, 95% CI 0.81–2.33). There was no significant difference in nephrotoxicity and other secondary outcomes between the treatment groups. Colistin appears as effective and safe as β-lactam antibiotics for the treatment of MDR GNB VAP. AS colistin may be a beneficial adjunct to IV colistin in the management of MDR GNB VAP. Colistin combined therapy does not appear to provide better outcomes compared with colistin monotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abeta-lactam antibiotics 3aintravenous injection 3acolistin 3ahospitals 3ameta-analysis 3amultiple drug resistance 3amodels 3apneumonia 3aodds ratio 3aconfidence interval 3apatients 3asystematic review 3anephrotoxicity 3amortality 0aVentilator-associated pneumonia 0atherapeutics 0aColistin 0aMeta-analysis 0aMultidrug-resistant1 aWang, Fei1 aTang, Lu1 aBakker, Jan1 aLiu, Jing-Chen0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2014 Dec., v. 44, no. 6 p.477-485dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2014.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001000279520238500289592002802674650001202702650001102714650001802725650001402743650001102757650002002768650001802788650001102806650001302817650001502830650002802845650001202873650002302885650002302908650001502931650002302946650002102969700001802990700002203008700002103030773013403051856008203185852000903267655001203276IND60573558420221116223102.0180619e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057355842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-016-2247-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEppley, TimothyM.10aPredator avoidance and dietary fibre predict diurnality in the cathemeral folivore Hapalemur meridionalis  ap. 4.  aThough numerous mammalian taxa exhibit cathemerality (i.e. activity distributed across the 24-h cycle), this includes very few primates, exceptions being species from Aotinae and Lemuridae. Four non-mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the ultimate determinants for cathemeral activity in lemurs: thermoregulatory benefits, anti-predator strategy, competition avoidance and metabolic dietary-related needs. However, these have only been explored in the frugivorous genus Eulemur, with some species increasing nocturnality as a possible response to avoid diurnal raptors and to increase their ability to digest fibre during resource-scarce periods. Since Eulemur lack specializations for digesting bulk food, this strategy would allow for processing fibres over the full 24-h. The folivorous lemurids, i.e. genus Hapalemur, provide a divergent model to explore these hypotheses due to gastrointestinal adaptations for digesting dietary fibre and small body size compared to Eulemur. We linked continuous activity data collected from archival tags with observational behaviour and feeding data from three groups of adult Hapalemur meridionalis from January to December 2013. We tested the effects of thermoregulation, predator avoidance and the weighted proportion of digestible dietary fibre on the daily diurnal/nocturnal activity ratio using a Linear Mixed-Model. Our best-fit model revealed that increased canopy exposure and dietary fibre predicted greater diurnality. Our findings partly contrast with previous predictions for frugivorous lemurids. We propose a divergent adaptive explanation for folivorous lemurids. We suggest that the need to avoid terrestrial predators, as well as longer digestive bouts during bulk food periods, may override cathemerality in favour of diurnality in these bamboo lemurs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Southern bamboo lemurs are active throughout the 24-h day, with high proportions of dietary fibre increasing diurnality, in contrast to other cathemeral primates. They also increase diurnality on days when using areas with greater canopy exposure, potentially avoiding nocturnal predators in risky foraging areas. We suggest that folivorous lemurids may require long periods of inactivity to conserve energy and digest dietary fibre, thus limiting activity to periods of optimal foraging efficiency over the 24-h cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEulemur 3aadults 3abirds of prey 3abody size 3acanopy 3adata collection 3adietary fiber 3aenergy 3aforaging 3afrugivores 3agastrointestinal system 3amammals 3anocturnal activity 3apredator avoidance 3aprediction 3astatistical models 3athermoregulation1 aWatzek, Julia1 aGanzhorn, JörgU.1 aDonati, Giuseppe0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2017 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.4-4dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl6766x0340-54437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-016-2247-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245009200164300001600256520106700272592002801339650002301367650001301390650001401403700001301417700001101430773009401441856005501535852000901590655001201599IND4437968520221119120040.0150416e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443796852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01307.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, L.10aIncorporating Correlation for Multivariate Failure Time Data When Cluster Size Is Large  ap. 393-404.  aWe propose a new estimation method for multivariate failure time data using the quadratic inference function (QIF) approach. The proposed method efficiently incorporates withinâcluster correlations. Therefore, it is more efficient than those that ignore withinâcluster correlation. Furthermore, the proposed method is easy to implement. Unlike the weighted estimating equations in Cai and Prentice (1995,âBiometrikaâ82, 151â164), it is not necessary to explicitly estimate the correlation parameters. This simplification is particularly useful in analyzing data with large cluster size where it is difficult to estimate intracluster correlation. Under certain regularity conditions, we show the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed QIF estimators. A chiâsquared test is also developed for hypothesis testing. We conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed methods. We also illustrate the proposed methods by analyzing primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abiometry 3aequations1 aWang, L.1 aQu, A.0 tBiometrics.g2010 June, v. 66, no. 2 p.393-404dBlackwell Publishing Incx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01307.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012100167300001600288520120000304592002801504650002001532650000801552650002601560650001401586650001401600650001901614650001101633650001301644650001701657650000901674650000901683650001701692650001801709650001701727650002301744650001401767650000901781650001401790650002201804650002601826653002001852653001701872653001401889653001801903653002001921653002201941653002201963653002201985653001502007653001402022653002002036653001502056653003202071653002702103653005202130700001602182773010402198856008402302852000902386655001202395IND60122928120221119070942.0150325e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012292812DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2012.6595272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForlot, Paul10aBergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau) essential oil: Biological properties, cosmetic and medical use. A review  ap. 195-201.  aThe present article reviews all aspects of the known pharmacological activities of bergamot essential oil (Citrus bergamia) and of its major phototoxic component bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen, 5-MOP) as well as their use in cosmetics and medicine. Photo-addition of 5-MOP to DNA induces a phototoxic reaction followed by significant increase of human skin pigmentation with a proved consistent protection of epidermal cell DNA against further exposure to ultraviolet light. This property was used in suntan products, but the potential risk of photocarcinogenis stopped the development of such compositions. Medical indications include phototherapy of dermatoses like psoriasis and vitiligo (photochemotherapy, PUVA). More recent studies were developed concerning the melatoninergic potential of bergapten and its potential use in depression and sleep disturbances as well as the capacity of 5-MOP to block potassium channels, a potential symptomatic treatment of multiple sclerosis in demyelinated nerves. The anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antifungal properties of bergamot oil will also be described as well as the most recent studies on its protection against neuropathic pain in cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus bergamia 3aDNA 3aantifungal properties 3abergapten 3acosmetics 3aessential oils 3ahumans 3amedicine 3anerve tissue 3aoils 3apain 3aphototherapy 3aphototoxicity 3apigmentation 3apotassium channels 3apsoriasis 3arisk 3asclerosis 3asleep deprivation 3aultraviolet radiation 0aCitrus bergamia 0abergamot oil 0abergapten 0aphototoxicity 0aphotoprotection 0aphotogenotoxicity 0aDNA photoaddition 0aphotochemotherapy 0adermatoses 0amelatonin 0asleep disorders 0adepression 0apotassium channels blockers 0ademyelinating diseases 0aanti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.1 aPévet, P.,0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 24, no. 2 p.195-201dRoutledgex2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2012.6595273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245017200187300001600359520119500375592002801570650002201598650001201620650002101632650001601653650001601669650002001685650002101705650001201726650001501738650002501753650001201778650004201790650002001832650004201852650001101894650003801905650004701943650001501990651000902005651001102014651001902025651001302044651000902057651001102066651001102077653003002088653002702118653002002145653001502165653002302180700002302203700002402226700001902250700002102269700001902290773013102309856004802440852000902488655001202497IND50074625520221119150841.0140408e20110414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007462552DNAL7 a214912662pmid7 a10.1080/104083910036289552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoffin, Dorothee10aWill Isomalto-Oligosaccharides, a Well-Established Functional Food in Asia, Break through the European and American Market?

It includes first a unique inventory of the different families of compounds which have been considered as IMOs and their specific structure. A description has been given of the different production methods including the involved enzymes and their specific activities, the substrates, and the types of IMOs produced. Considering the structural complexity of IMO products, specific characterization methods are described, as well as purification methods which enable the body to get rid of digestible oligosaccharides. Finally, an extensive review of their techno-functional and nutritional properties enables placing IMOs inside the growing prebiotic market. This review is of particular interest considering that IMO commercialization in America and Europe is a topical subject due to the recent submission by Bioneutra Inc. (Canada) of a novel food file to the UK Food Standards Agency, as well as several patents for IMO production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3aenzymes 3afunctional foods 3ainventories 3anovel foods 3anutritive value 3aoligosaccharides 3apatents 3aprebiotics 3apurification methods 2aAnimals 2aAnticarcinogenic Agentsxpharmacology 2aFunctional Food 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aImmunologic Factorsxpharmacology 2aOligosaccharidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPrebiotics 3aAsia 3aCanada 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAmerica. 0aAsia 0aCanada 0aEurope 0aisomalto-oligosaccharides 0agluco-oligosaccharides 0afunctional food 0aprebiotics 0atransglucosylation1 aDelzenne, Nathalie1 aBlecker, Christophe1 aHanon, Emilien1 aDeroanne, Claude1 aPaquot, Michel0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2011 Apr. 14, v. 51, no. 5 p.394-409dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408391003628955  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007300158300001800231520170200249592002801951650002501979650001402004650001302018650001502031650000902046650001302055650001502068650001102083650001102094650002002105650002902125650001202154650004402166700002802210700002602238700002502264700002702289773011102316856007502427852000902502655001202511IND60529067320170413000000.0160717e20120619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052906732DNAL7 a10.1021/ac300659h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuñez, Oscar,10aAtmospheric Pressure Photoionization Mass Spectrometry of Fullerenes  ap. 5316-5326.  aAtmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) was evaluated for the analysis of fullerenes. An important response improvement was found when using toluene mediated APPI in negative mode if compared with other atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources (electrospray and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization). Fullerene APPI negative mass spectra were dominated by the isotopic cluster of the molecular ion, although isotopic patterns for M+1, M+2, and M+3 ions showed higher than expected relative abundances. These discrepancies are explained by the presence of two isobaric ions, one due to ¹³C and the other due to the addition of hydrogen to a double bond of the fullerene structure. Triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry, ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry, and accurate mass measurements were used to confirm these assignments. Additionally, cluster ions M+16 and M+32 were characterized following the same strategy. Ions due to the addition of oxygen and alkyl additions were attributed to the presence of methanol in the mobile phase. For the fast chromatographic separation of fullerenes (less than 3.5 min), a sub-2 μm C18 column and isocratic elution (toluene/methanol, 45:55 v/v) was used. Highly selective-selected ion monitoring (H-SIM) mode (mass resolving power, >12 500 fwhm) was proposed monitoring the two most intense isotope ions in the [M]⁻• cluster. Method limits of quantitation down to 10 pg L–¹ for C₆₀ and C₇₀ fullerenes and between 0.75 and 5.0 ng L–¹ for larger fullerenes were obtained. Finally, the ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-APPI-MS method was used to analyze fullerenes in river and pond water samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3afullerene 3ahydrogen 3aionization 3aions 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3arivers 3astable isotopes 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoluene 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aGallart-Ayala, Héctor,1 aMartins, Claudia P.B.1 aMoyano, Encarnación1 aGalceran, Maria Teresa0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 June 19, v. 84, no. 12 p.5316-5326dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac300659h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245010500209300001600314520118900330592002801519650002101547650001201568650001601580650001001596650001101606650001601617650001401633650001301647650000901660650002301669650001901692650002001711650002101731650000901752650000901761650001601770650001401786650001501800650002101815650002001836650002301856650000901879653000901888653000901897653000901906653000901915653000701924653000701931653000701938653000801945653000701953653002101960653002401981653002702005653001902032653000902051700002502060700002602085700002602111773009502137856008402232852000902316655001202325IND60528024220221120121203.0190416e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052802422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2016.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeid, Agnieszka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1755-300210aBiomass of Spirulina maxima enriched by biosorption process as a new feed supplement for laying hens  ap. 342-347.  aThis paper presents the novel application of biosorption process as a method of enrichment of valuable biomass of Spirulina maxima to obtain new feed additives. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of microalgae enriched with Cu(II) and Fe(II) supplementation on the performance, egg traits and microelements content of eggs of laying hens. Birds were fed with a basal diet, supplemented with or without the microalgal biomass enriched with microelements. The biomass of S. maxima was enriched via the biosorption process involving Cu(II) and Fe(II) ions. The color of egg yolk as well as the contents of micro- and macroelements were analyzed. The major effect of this experimental diet on the nutrient composition of eggs was determined. Eggs fortified in Fe, Zn and Mn were obtained. The content of Fe, Zn and Mn in the egg albumen was higher in comparison with the control group, respectively by 860%, (p<0.001), 113% (p<0.001) and 195% (p<0.001). The experimental diet did not affect the organoleptic properties of feed as well as feed conversion rate. Egg shell strength was improved by 7.5% (p<0.05) and the effect of lower number of cracked eggs (by 14%) was noted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirulina maxima 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3acolor 3acopper 3aegg albumen 3aegg shell 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aexperimental diets 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3afeed supplements 3aions 3airon 3alaying hens 3amanganese 3amicroalgae 3anutrient content 3apoultry feeding 3asensory properties 3azinc 0aADFI 0aAPFI 0aADMG 0aAPMG 0aBW 0aEC 0aCV 0aFCR 0aNs 0aSpirulina maxima 0aBiosorption process 0aMineral feed additives 0aAnimal feeding 0aEggs1 aChojnacka, Katarzyna1 aOpaliński, Sebastian1 aKorczyński, Mariusz,0 tAlgal research.g2016 Nov., v. 19 p.342-347dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2016.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245011500169520115200284592002801436650001801464650001001482650000901492650001601501650001901517651001101536700003401547700002301581700002301604700002501627700002301652700002301675700002501698700002401723773012001747856008001867852000901947655001201956IND60703153820221122110705.0200720e20200319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070315382DNAL7 a10.3390/insects110301942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCipola, Nikolas  G.10aReview of Eyeless Pseudosinella Schäffer (Collembola, Entomobryidae, and Lepidocyrtinae) from Brazilian Caves  aHerein, eyeless Pseudosinella species from Brazilian caves are reviewed, including the description of 23 new species, new records plus additional notes on the descriptions of P. ambigua Zeppelini, Brito, and Lima and of P. guanhaensis Zeppelini, Brito, and Lima. We also provide an identification key to 27 eyeless species recorded from Brazil. To organize the 26 Brazilian eyeless taxa analyzed in this work, we organize them in apparently artificial groups: 11 species have one larger tooth on the unguiculus outer lamella (petterseni group); one presents unguiculus outer lamella smooth or serrated (never with a larger tooth), with 9 held prelabral chaetae undivided and the last 6 held prelabral chaetae bifurcated. The Brazilian species of eyeless Pseudosinella herein described present a remarkably conservate dorsal chaetotaxy; therefore, the main diagnostic characters are related to other features like prelabral, labral, and ventral head chaetotaxy and empodial complex morphology. In addition, our study suggests that Brazilian caves possibly shelter a great diversity of Pseudosinella taxa, several of them potentially cave dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntomobryidae 3acaves 3ahead 3anew species 3ataxonomic keys 3aBrazil1 aOliveira, João  Victor L.

QAE Sephadex A-25 was used as the anion exchanger in the DPX column for the purification and cleanup of honey samples. Analytes were eluted with a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1 M HCl, and the elution was subjected to LC analysis. This method was thoroughly validated for its reproducibility, linearity, trueness, and recovery. Satisfactory recovery of pesticides was obtained ranging from 72% to 111% with intraday RSDs (n = 5) of 1%–10%. High linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9987) was observed for all 16 pesticides. Limits of detection and quantification for all 16 compounds ranged from 0.3 to 3 μg/kg and from 1 to 10 μg/kg, respectively. Pesticide residues (9–113 μg/kg) were found in Chinese honey samples. The anion exchanger-DPX method was effective for removing sugars and retaining target analytes. Moreover, this method was highly reliable and sensitive for detecting neonicotinoids and IGRs in different floral sources of honey and will be applicable to matrixes with high sugar content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetamiprid 3aacetonitrile 3abuprofezin 3aclothianidin 3acyromazine 3adetection limit 3adinotefuran 3afenoxycarb 3ahoney 3ahydrochloric acid 3aliquid chromatography 3amethoxyfenozide 3anitenpyram 3apesticide residues 3asugar content 3asugars 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atebufenozide 3athiacloprid 3athiamethoxam 3atriflumuron 0aAnion exchanger-DPX 0aLC–MS/MS 0aNeonicotinoid insecticides 0aInsect growth regulators 0aHoney 0aPesticide residues1 aZhang, Cuifang1 aChen, Zhaojie1 aHe, Fengmei1 aWei, Jie1 aTan, Huihua1 aLi, Xuesheng0 tJournal of chromatography.g2018 July 06, v. 1557 p.51-61dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245014300181300001400324520124400338592002801582650001401610650001201624650002601636650001701662650001101679650002701690650001101717650002101728650001901749650001901768650000901787650001001796650001301806650002001819653002301839653002001862653001901882653002301901653001601924700002101940700002901961700001901990700002802009700003102037700002902068700002102097773010902118856008702227852000902314655001202323IND60541528320221118165742.0190318e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054152832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenha, Frederico Marques10aEvaluation of permeation of macauba oil and n-hexane mixtures through polymeric commercial membranes subjected to different pre-treatments  ap. 79-86.  aMacauba is a Brazilian palm tree with high edible oil productivity and of great interest to many applications. In the oil extraction process, solvent recovery is one point of major concern, due to its high energy consumption and oil quality losses. Those drawbacks can be partially overcome by integration of membrane technology to the usual solvent distillation step. The present work tested four ultrafiltration (UF) and one nanofiltration (NF) membrane (Microdyn-Nadir) on the solvent recovery of synthetic mixtures of macauba oil and n-hexane. Membranes were pre-treated before use with different solvents in specific time lengths, according to preliminary studies. The membrane performance was evaluated by permeate flux and oil retention. Macauba (pulp and kernel) oil was evaluated by determinations of acidity, peroxide value and fatty acid profile. Membranes showed usual flux behaviour, compatible with other studies concerning oil/solvent mixtures permeation, although its values were quite above the expected. Best results for retention (>30%) are related to the membranes with lower molar mass cut-off (MMCO), and the best balance between permeate flux and oil retention was found for the NF membrane (12.4gm−2h−1, 34.7%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrocomia 3aacidity 3acooking fats and oils 3adistillation 3aenergy 3afatty acid composition 3ahexane 3amolecular weight 3ananofiltration 3aperoxide value 3apulp 3aseeds 3asolvents 3aultrafiltration 0aPolymeric membrane 0aUltrafiltration 0aNanofiltration 0aNon-aqueous system 0aMacauba oil1 aRezzadori, Katia1 aProner, Mariane Carolina1 aZin, Guilherme1 aFogaça, Lara Alexandre1 aPetrus, José Carlos Cunha1 ade Oliveira, J.

These particles are entrained by the flue gas from the combustion plant. To assess the type of fuel and the influence of the operating parameters on the fine particle emission, it is useful to know the mass of the fine particles produced at combustion per unit amount of fuel. For this purpose, the authors carried out laboratory combustion tests using thermogravimetric analysis and identification of the fine particle size distribution in the flue gas. Different samples of beechwood were used for experimental measurements. The atmosphere of the combustion process was tested in the range of 0–21% of oxygen in a mixture with nitrogen. The measured mass ratios of the fine particles produced and the original fuel sample were compared with the experimental studies of other authors. The resulting mass emissions of fine particles were quantified between 2% and 9% of the initial fuel sample weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aflue gas 3afuels 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aparticle size distribution 3arenewable energy sources 3athermogravimetry 0aCombustion 0aParticles 0aEmission 0aPM1 0aWood1 aPospíšil, Jiří,1 aPoláčik, Ján1 aŠpiláček, Michal1 aVarbanov, Petar0 tRenewable energy.g2019 Sept., v. 140 p.390-396dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.03.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010000167520099300267592002801260650001601288650002801304650002201332650002301354650003001377650000901407650003101416650001901447650001001466650001301476650002001489650002301509650001101532700001901543700001901562700002501581700002001606773012001626856008001746852000901826655001201835IND60703154020221122134428.0200720e20200320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070315402DNAL7 a10.3390/insects110301962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallego, Juan  R.10aSelection of Predatory Mites for the Biological Control of Potato Tuber Moth in Stored Potatoes  aWorldwide, the potato tuber moth (PTM), Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller), is one of the most severe pests affecting potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), whether in open-air crops or during tuber storage. This work examines the potential control of this pest by two species of predatory mites, Macrocheles robustulus (Berlese) and Blattisocius tarsalis (Berlese), on pest eggs under laboratory conditions. In the two first assays, the acceptance rate of the pest eggs was assessed for each predatory mite. Then, in a third assay, the functional response of B. tarsalis was studied. The results showed that Macrochelesrobustulus did not prey on the pest eggs (number of eggs surviving = 4.33 ± 0.38), whereas B. tarsalis did (number of eggs surviving = 0.5 ± 0.5). Likewise, B. tarsalis showed a type II functional response when it killed the eggs. The results showed the potential use of Blattisocius tarsalis as a biological control agent of P. operculella in potato under storage conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrocheles 3aPhthorimaea operculella 3aSolanum tuberosum 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3afunctional response models 3ainsect control 3apests 3apotatoes 3apredatory mites 3astorage conditions 3atubers1 aCaicedo, Otto 1 aGamez, Manuel 1 aHernandez, Joaquín,1 aCabello, Tomas 0 tInsects.g2020 Mar. 20, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects110301963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009200174300001600266520096900282592002801251650002601279650002601305650001101331650001001342650001401352650001301366650001301379650001201392650001601404651001101420651001501431651001301446651001101459653003301470653001101503700002101514700001601535700002201551700002201573700002301595773013301618856008901751852000901840655001201849IND60601519420221119124847.0180706e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060151942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2014.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Hung-Jen10aIdentification of the first imported KPC-3 Klebsiella pneumoniae from the USA to Taiwan  ap. 431-435.  aEstablishment of KPC-associated genes into a new region usually requires travellers with hospital admission and their carriage into the communities. In this report, a worldwide spreading clone carrying KPC-3 was isolated from the sputum of a hospitalised patient with a serious infection who had just come from the USA and had been admitted to a New York hospital. By genetic comparison with a strain isolated from New Jersey (NJ-KPC-21), this isolate from the traveller was genetically related. The blaKPC-3 gene was harboured on a large plasmid with a complex structure of a Tn3-based transposon, Tn4401a. The KPC-3-carrying plasmid was very similar (>99.9% identity) to the 113 637-bp blaKPC-3-encoding plasmid pKpQIL that originated from the 2006 epidemic carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in Israel. With the first recognition of KPC-2 in 2011 and continuing spread, physicians should be aware of the coming of KPC-3 K. pneumoniae in Taiwan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aanti-infective agents 3aclones 3agenes 3ahospitals 3apatients 3aplasmids 3astrains 3atransposons 3aIsrael 3aNew Jersey 3aNew York 3aTaiwan 0aKPC-3, Klebsiella pneumoniae 0aTaiwan1 aChen, Ying-Tsong1 aChiang, Tom1 aFung, Chang-Phone1 aChuang, Yin-Ching1 aKristopher Siu, L.0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2014 Nov., v. 44, no. 5 p.431-435dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2014.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245010700209300001600316520145900332592002801791650001501819650001301834650001301847650001001860650002001870650001301890650003101903650001801934650002101952650001801973650001801991650001102009650000902020653000902029653002102038653000802059653002402067653001602091700005302107700001802160773010602178856008702284852000902371655001202380IND60622971320221119015843.0190130e20190205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062297132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Boer, F.Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3163-323610aColor-tunable particles through affinity interactions between water-insoluble protein and soluble dyes  ap. 154-160.  aThis research is focused on the delivery of color using zein particles as a carrier and contributes to understanding the interactions between colorants and zein. Co-precipitation of purified zein protein with anionic dyes such as sulfonate group containing azo-dyes (patent blue sodium salt, azorubine, and fast green FCF) are used to prepare red, green, and blue colored nanoparticles. These dyes had electrostatic interactions with zein and they remained bound in the zein particles even after dialysis. This was not the case for purpurin, for with hydrogen bonding was expected as interaction. Upon increasing dye concentration, the particle sizes increased as a result of a change in the kinetics of precipitation, which was affected by the association between zein and the dye. However, the encapsulation efficiency continued to be very high and no plateau was reached for the used concentrations. The post-addition of dye on undyed zein particles was used to confirm that there is indeed a high affinity between the dye and the protein. The amount of free dye was determined and the affinity was again found to be high (dye adsorption <95%). The amount of dye incorporated into the particles and the resulting color were similar using both techniques. These results show that there is a high affinity between the zein protein and the dye, and may be exploited to produce bio-based and optically-functionalized nanoparticles using zein as a carrier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aazo dyes 3acolloids 3acolor 3acoprecipitation 3adialysis 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asodium 3azein 0aZein 0aCo-Precipitation 0aDye 0aColor determination 0aInteraction1 aImhof, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7445-13601 aVelikov, K.P.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Feb. 05, v. 562 p.154-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245005100163300001800214520099300232592002801225650001001253650002201263650002001285650001801305650001801323650001601341650004401357650002201401650002101423700001701444700001301461700002001474700001301494700001701507700002101524700001801545700001901563773009501582856008501677852000901762655001201771IND60113995920221121223822.0141112e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011399592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2012.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Xia10aBiotransformation of osthole by Mucor spinosus  ap. 2542-2546.  aOsthole (1) as a natural product, has the potent anti-osteoporosis activity.

As a consequence of treatments histo-biochemical and growth parameters of cucumber were changed. Reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide) were accumulated early. Chlorophyll content, catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase activities were increased under various treatments, however, electrolyte leakage (EL) was decreased. The growth characters e.g. plant height, leaves number, fresh and dry weight/plant was significantly improved because of treatments.

While extensive efforts have been made to improve diagnoses by DRIS and M-DRIS, little has been done to refine CNL diagnoses for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. In this study, we compare diagnoses made by M-DRIS with those from CNL and modify these procedures to improve their diagnostic accuracy. Two databases of R2 (full bloom) soybean leaf nutrient concentrations from 828 field observations of known K, Mn, Zn, or P deficiencies or sufiiciencies were used for comparing the procedures. We optimized critical nutrient levels (modified CNL) using the same cases from a database that was used earlier to improveM-DRIS. Using this optimization database, the M-DRIS and modified-CNL procedures had ≤ 13 misdiagnoses each of K nutrient status compared to 81 by unmodified CNL. M-DRIS was more accurate than the two CNL procedures in diagnosing P deficiencies from cases in the optimized and independent data sets. Unmodified CNL produced 18 misdiagnoses for Zn status from cases in the independent data set, versus >27 for M-DRIS or modified CNL. Generally, M-DRIS was the same or more accurate than CNL methods in diagnosing nutrient status. We recommend CNL concentrations for R2 stage soybean of 3.1 g P kg⁻¹, 15.1 g K kg⁻¹, 17 mg Mn kg⁻¹, and 21 mg Zn kg⁻¹. For M-DRIS, we recommend critical index values of zero for K and Mn, 18 for P, and −19 for Zn. Approved for publication by the director of the Louisiana Agric. Exp.

Silver nanowires (AgNWs) are one of the most promising alternatives to conducting metal oxides because of their high electrical conductivity and superior ductility, which are essential criteria for flexible optoelectronics. In order to develop high-temperature resistant flexible electrodes, we combined colorless polyimide (CPI) as a backbone matrix substrate with the AgNW network. In this work, we firstly demonstrate the hybrid transparent electrodes of AgNWs-embedded CPI encapsulated by a ZnO layer (ZnO/AgNWs-embedded CPI) via KOH treatment based chemical modification of the CPI film. The ZnO/AgNWs-embedded CPI substrate exhibited a low sheet resistance of 24 Ω sq⁻¹ while maintaining a high optical transparency of 81%. More importantly, the hybrid transparent electrodes exhibited superior thermal stability (heat treatment for 24 hours at 230 °C) with negligible conductivity decay and outstanding bending stability (stable for 10 000 bending cycles). ZnO/AgNWs-embedded CPI showed relatively low roughness (RMS, 9.6 nm) compared with non-embedded AgNWs on CPI (RMS, 82 nm). Embedding of AgNWs on top of the CPI film offers a good potential for application in flexible TCEs with thermal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abrittleness 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3aheat treatment 3aindium tin oxide 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3apotassium hydroxide 3aroughness 3asilver 3athermal stability 3azinc oxide1 aYoun, Doo-Young1 aLuo, Zhenhao1 aKim, Il-Doo0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 23, v. 6, no. 36 p.30331-30336dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03200a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01437naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100012900140245008400269300001400353520034800367592002800715650001300743650001200756650002300768650001200791650000900803700002600812700002200838700002000860700001900880773012900899856007401028852000901102655001201111IND60659730020221119165927.0190823e20121127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065973002DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc37442k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaCurrent address: Department of Chemistry, College of Science, Nanjing Forestry University, Jiangsu 210037, China., Mengtao10aMetal-only Lewis pairs featuring unsupported Pt→M (M = Zn or Cd) dative bonds  ap. 48-50.  aReactions of [Pt(PCy₃)₂] (Cy = cyclohexyl) with group 12 metal dihalides have afforded the novel metal only Lewis pair (MOLP) complexes, [(Cy₃P)₂Pt→MX₂] (M = Zn or Cd, X = Br or I), or the oxidative addition product, trans-[(Cy₃P)₂(I)PtHgI].

Depending on location, beaver dams bring multiple benefits and/or require management. Using nationally available data, we developed: a Beaver Forage Index (BFI), identifying beaver foraging habitat, and a Beaver Dam Capacity (BDC) model, classifying suitability of river reaches for dam construction, to estimate location and number of dams at catchment scales. Models were executed across three catchments, in Great Britain (GB), containing beaver. An area of 6747 km² was analysed for BFI and 16,739 km of stream for BDC. Field surveys identified 258 km of channel containing beaver activity and 89 dams, providing data to test predictions. Models were evaluated using a categorical binomial Bayesian framework to calculate probability of foraging and dam construction. BFI and BDC models successfully categorised the use of reaches for foraging and damming, with higher scoring reaches being preferred. Highest scoring categories were ca. 31 and 79 times more likely to be used than the lowest for foraging and damming respectively. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression showed that modelled dam capacity was significantly related (p = 0.01) to observed damming and was used to predict numbers of dams that may occur. Estimated densities of dams, averaged across each catchment, ranged from 0.4 to 1.6 dams/km, though local densities may be up to 30 dams/km. These models provide fundamental information describing the distribution of beaver foraging habitat, where dams may be constructed and how many may occur. This supports the development of policy and management concerning the reintroduction and recolonisation of beaver.  aPublisher supplied data  aNERC/PE/2016_087cNatural Environment Research Council (GB) 3aBayesian theory 3aCastor fiber 3adams (hydrology) 3aforage 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability 3arivers 3astreams 3asurveys 3awatersheds 3aGreat Britain1 aPuttock, Alan1 aMacfarlane, William W.1 aWheaton, Joseph M.1 aGilbert, Jordan T.1 aCampbell-Palmer, Roisin,1 aElliott, Mark1 aGaywood, Martin J.1 aAnderson, Karen1 aBrazier, Richard E.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2020 June, v. 66, no. 3 p.42-42dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-020-01379-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245008700193300001800280500001500298520100200313592002801315650001301343650001101356650001501367650001401382650001501396650001201411650002401423650003201447650002801479650002001507650001401527650001201541650004301553650006301596650003801659650001801697650001101715650001401726651001601740653001601756773009801772856004801870852000901918655001201927IND50090618420221121022051.0140627e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009061842DNAL7 a245155322pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-014-1995-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Moneim, Ahmed S.10aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): evidence and speculations  ap. 1575-1584.  a2019-12-05  aIn 2012, a novel human coronavirus emerged and was tentatively named “Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus” (MERS-CoV). The high mortality rate of MERS-CoV focused attention on the ecology of the virus. It has been found that MERS-CoV belongs to the group C lineage of the genus Betacoronavirus. Coronavirus surveillance studies in different populations of bats have suggested that they are probable reservoirs for this novel virus, and phylogenetic analysis of both the spike (S1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins of MERS-CoV have revealed that it is related to bat viruses. Recently, the MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies were detected in dromedary camels. Despite the limited number of reported cases of person-to-person transmission, the rapid evolution of the virus poses a continuous threat to humans worldwide. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the virology, clinical spectrum, evolution, diagnosis and treatment of MERS-CoV infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3aChiroptera 3aviruses 3aCamelus dromedarius 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aBetacoronavirus 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aCoronavirusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aCoronavirus Infectionsxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxvirology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viral 2aGenome, Viral 2aHumans 2aPhylogeny 0aMiddle East 0adromedaries0 tArchives of virology.g2014 July, v. 159, no. 7 p.1575-1584dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-1995-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009000170300001800260520149500278592002801773650001401801650001501815650001601830650001301846650001401859650001001873650001101883650001301894650001101907650001601918650001301934650001601947650001501963650001601978650000901994650001902003650001502022650002102037650001302058700002402071700002202095700002102117773009702138856008102235852000902316655001202325IND60519256220221120192045.0160424e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051925622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-016-0687-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWashburn, Brian E.10aComposition and Diversity of Avian Communities Using a New Urban Habitat: Green Roofs  ap. 1230-1239.  aGreen roofs on buildings are becoming popular and represent a new component of the urban landscape. Public benefits of green roof projects include reduced stormwater runoff, improved air quality, reduced urban heat island effects, and aesthetic values. As part of a city-wide plan, several green roofs have been constructed at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport (ORD). Like some other landscaping features, green roofs on or near an airport might attract wildlife and thus increase the risk of bird–aircraft collisions. During 2007–2011, we conducted a series of studies to evaluate wildlife use of newly constructed green roofs and traditional (gravel) roofs on buildings at ORD. These green roofs were 0.04–1.62 ha in area and consisted of primarily stonecrop species for vegetation. A total of 188 birds were observed using roofs during this research. Of the birds using green roofs, 66, 23, and 4 % were Killdeer, European Starlings, and Mourning Doves, respectively. Killdeer nested on green roofs, whereas the other species perched, foraged, or loafed. Birds used green roofs almost exclusively between May and October. Overall, avian use of the green roofs was minimal and similar to that of buildings with traditional roofs. Although green roofs with other vegetation types might offer forage or cover to birds and thus attract potentially hazardous wildlife, the stonecrop-vegetated green roofs in this study did not increase the risk of bird–aircraft collisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSturnidae 3aaesthetics 3aair quality 3aairports 3abuildings 3adoves 3aforage 3aforaging 3agravel 3agreen roofs 3ahabitats 3aheat island 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3arisk 3asocial benefit 3astormwater 3avegetation types 3awildlife1 aSwearingin, Ryan M.1 aPullins, Craig K.1 aRice, Matthew E.0 tEnvironmental management.g2016 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.1230-1239dSpringer USx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-016-0687-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007900160300001600239500002000255520121900275592002801494650001401522650001401536650002601550650001101576650001301587651001101600773010801611856007301719852000901792655001201801IND60572087120221118063057.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057208712DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.012092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyler, Torbjörn14aThe last step towards a full revision of Hieracium sect.

Hydraulic and Mass Transfer Models and Their Uncertainty Quantification  ap. 10448-10463.  aRigorous process models are critical for reducing the risk and uncertainty of scaling up a new technology. It is essential to quantify uncertainty in key submodels so that uncertainty in the overall model can be appropriately characterized. In solvent-based postcombustion CO₂ capture technologies, mass transfer and column hydraulics are key factors affecting the performance of the absorber. Developing submodels for mass transfer, column hydraulics, and reactions is a challenging multiscale problem since the phenomena are tightly coupled and it is difficult to design experiments to isolate each properly. In particular, simultaneous mass transfer coupled with fast reaction kinetics makes it difficult to measure the mass transfer rate and reactions rate individually. The typical approach to solving this issue is to use proxy systems to conduct experiments under mass-transfer-limited or reaction-limited conditions. This approach can lead to inaccurate mass transfer submodels. In this paper, a novel simultaneous regression approach is proposed where submodels for mass transfer, diffusivity, interfacial area, and reaction kinetics are optimally identified using experimental data from multiple scales and operating conditions. Since all models have some level of uncertainty, a rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique is implemented for the hydraulic and mass transfer submodels based on Bayesian inference. Posterior distributions of submodel parameters are propagated through the column model to obtain the uncertainty bounds on critical performance measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acarbon dioxide 3adiffusivity 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aprocess design 3areaction kinetics 3aregression analysis 3atechnology 3auncertainty1 aMorgan, Joshua C.1 aOmell, Benjamin1 aBhattacharyya, Debangsu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9957-75281 aTong, Charles1 aMiller, David C.0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 July 12, v. 57, no. 31 p.10448-10463dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b014713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01557naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245005600166300001600222500002000238520044900258592002800707650001500735650002400750650001100774650001100785650001900796650001600815650002800831650002300859651001300882700002100895700002200916700002700938700001600965773010800981856007301089852000901162655001201171IND60572087420221118063105.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057208742DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.014392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBongcheewin, Bhanubong10aPogostemon nudus sp. nov.

In this study, a rapid isothermal real-time reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay was developed for the detection of SFTSV. The detection limit at 95% probability was 241 copies per reaction. A test of 120 serum samples of suspected severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) patients revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-RPA assay was approximately 96.00% (95%CI: 80.46%–99.79%) and 98.95% (95% CI: 94.28%–99.95%), respectively; the kappa value was 0.9495 (P＜0.001). The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 87.50% of the different data points were located within the 95% limits of agreement, indicating a good correlation between the results from RT-RPA assays and those of RT-qPCR assays. In conclusion, the rapid and efficient RT-RPA assay can be a promising candidate for point-of-care detection method of SFTSV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3afever 3amonitoring 3apatients 3apoint-of-care systems 3aprobability 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3arecombinases 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription 3athrombocytopenia 0aSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus 0aRecombinase polymerase amplification 0aDetection assay1 aWang, Qiujing1 aZhu, Lijun1 aLi, Shibo1 aLi, Wei1 aFu, Yongfeng1 aCheng, Xunjia0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2020 Aug., v. 52 p.101580-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3743x0890-85087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2020.1015803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245008900207300002000296520092300316592002801239650001901267650001201286650001401298650002301312650002301335650001801358650001601376650001701392650002101409650001401430650001901444650001001463650001601473700002601489700002201515700001801537700002401555700001801579700002301597700002201620700002001642700002001662773017301682856008101855852000901936655001201945IND60608701220180906000000.0180830e20180720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060870122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b014832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrande, Carlos A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9558-541310aProcess Intensification in Nitric Acid Plants by Catalytic Oxidation of Nitric Oxide  ap. 10180-10186.  aWe have evaluated the kinetics of the catalytic oxidation of NO to NO₂ using a Pt/alumina catalyst, under conditions relevant to industrial nitric acid production: NO and steam contents up to 5% and 20%, respectively, with temperatures from 250 to 350 °C, and pressures up to 4.7 bar. The objective is to replace the current homogeneous oxidation process, which requires cooling of the process gas and a long residence time, with a more intensive heterogeneous oxidation process, allowing the heat of reaction (114 kJ/mol) to be recovered. This may give a 10% improvement in overall heat recovery and, additionally, lead to reduced capital expenditure (CAPEX) and footprint of new build plants. With world production of nitric acid of 60 million tonnes per annum, the transformation from the homogeneous oxidation of NO to a heterogeneous oxidation can lead to significant environmental benefits and cost reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acapital 3acatalysts 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystem services 3aheat recovery 3anitric acid 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3aprocess design 3asteam 3atemperature1 aAndreassen, Kari Anne1 aCavka, Jasmina H.1 aWaller, David1 aLorentsen, Odd-Arne1 aØien, Halvor1 aZander, Hans-Jörg1 aPoulston, Stephen1 aGarcía, Sonia,1 aModeshia, Deena0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2018 July 20, v. 57, no. 31 p.10180-10186dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b014833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01462naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245007900163300001600242500002000258520041500278592002800693650002400721650001300745650001900758650001600777650002000793650002800813650002300841651001200864700002600876700002000902773010800922856007301030852000901103655001201112IND60572087620221118063043.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057208762DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.014342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Văn Dư,10aPothos vietnamensis sp. nov.

Although conceptual discussions around this notion are often confined to the triple bottom line (TBL) classification, it seems that the TBL approach does not provide the suitable framework to measure water services sustainability. It is argued that assets (or technical) and governance aspects are also indispensable dimensions. After revisiting the concept in broader terms, several criteria and metrics are suggested to operationalize and quantify the sustainability level of urban water services. To aggregate the numerous aspects that are relevant in this scope a multicriteria decision analysis approach is proposed. Furthermore, to illustrate the real-world application of the method, a multicriteria model applicable to the case of Portugal was developed and calibrated with the input of a decision-maker with extensive experience in the sector. With the suggested framework it is possible to assess the global sustainability level of the water services (e.g. of each utility) and also the performance in each particular dimension (‘social’, ‘environmental’, ‘economic’, ‘governance’ and ‘assets’).  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3agovernance 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aPortugal 0aDrinking water 0aIndicators 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis 0aSustainability 0aWastewater1 aDa Cruz, Nuno Ferreira,1 aPires, João,0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2015 Dec., v. 54 p.142-151dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2015.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008100171300001600252520161200268592002801880650001701908650001501925650002101940650002001961650002701981650001902008650000902027650002402036650001702060650001702077650001502094650001102109650001802120653002002138653002402158653001602182653001702198700001402215700001602229700001802245700001602263700001702279773010502296856008602401852000902487655001202496IND60568098220221121033933.0190408e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056809822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.04.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckett, C.T.S.10aCompaction conditions greatly affect growth during early plant establishment  ap. 471-481.  aSuccessful plant establishment is critical for the success of store/release cover systems. Such cover systems comprise several soil layers: highly compacted lower layers to isolate the waste; and nominally-loose upper layers to support vegetation. However, compaction of the upper layers under heavy machinery is often unavoidable, retarding plant growth and compromising the system's ability to capture infiltration.It is well known that compaction at different water contents imparts differing soil microstructures as well as densities. However, how to take advantage of those microstructures to mitigate compaction's effect on plant growth has yet to be investigated. This paper presents results for the growth of Avena sativa (oats) under different compaction conditions. Seeds were planted in soil columns comprising a sandy or clayey soil or layers thereof and allowed to grow under controlled climatic conditions for seven weeks. Plants were then extracted to examine the effects of compaction on plant features (root length and mass and shoot mass). Soil apparent hydraulic conductivity (unvegetated) was also measured. Results showed that compaction at the optimum water content, typical of geotechnical practice, was the most detrimental for plant growth. Rather, plant growth was greatest for compaction conditions which imparted both a lower dry density and hydraulic conductivity, for example typical of compaction at water contents above optimum. Results therefore highlighted the need to consider all facets of compacted soil texture when estimating the likely success of plant establishment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aclay soils 3aclimatic factors 3acompacted soils 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amicrostructure 3aoats 3aplant establishment 3aplant growth 3asoil texture 3avegetation 3awastes 3awater content 0aSoil compaction 0aSoil microstructure 0aroot growth 0acover design1 aGlenn, D.1 aBradley, K.1 aGuzzomi, A.L.1 aMerritt, D.1 aFourie, A.B.0 tEcological engineering.g2017 Sept., v. 106 p.471-481dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03459naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001400186245013900200300001800339506007600357520171700433592002802150506003702178650001802215650001802233650002802251650002002279650002102299650001802320650002102338650001902359650001802378650001302396650001002409650002902419650001302448650001402461650001802475650001702493650002602510650002202536653002302558653001902581700001802600700001802618700002002636773017302656856007902829852000902908655001202917IND60230306720221207082417.0150614e20140218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023030672DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13238451112doi7 aPMC39328862pmcid7 a245502952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jie10aPolyclonal type II natural killer T cells require PLZF and SAP for their development and contribute to CpG-mediated antitumor response  ap. 2674-2679.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like T cells with potent immunomodulatory function via rapid production of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. NKT cells comprise well-characterized type I NKT cells, which can be detected by α-galactosylceramide-loaded CD1d tetramers, and less-studied type II NKT cells, which do not recognize α-galactosylceramide. Here we characterized type II NKT cells on a polyclonal level by using a Jα18-deficient IL-4 reporter mouse model. This model allows us to track type II NTK cells by the GFP ⁺TCRβ ⁺ phenotype in the thymus and liver. We found type II NKT cells, like type I NKT cells, exhibit an activated phenotype and are dependent on the transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) and the adaptor molecule signaling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) for their development. Type II NKT cells are potently activated by β- D-glucopyranosylceramide (β-GlcCer) but not sulfatide or phospholipids in a CD1d-dependent manner, with the stimulatory capacity of β-GlcCer influenced by acyl chain length. Compared with type I NKT cells, type II NKT cells produce lower levels of IFN-γ but comparable amounts of IL-13 in response to polyclonal T-cell receptor stimulation, suggesting they may play different roles in regulating immune responses. Furthermore, type II NKT cells can be activated by CpG oligodeoxynucletides to produce IFN-γ, but not IL-4 or IL-13. Importantly, CpG-activated type II NKT cells contribute to the antitumor effect of CpG in the B16 melanoma model. Taken together, our data reveal the characteristics of polyclonal type II NKT cells and their potential role in antitumor immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulation 3aimmunotherapy 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-13 3ainterleukin-4 3aleukemia 3aliver 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amelanoma 3aphenotype 3aphospholipids 3athymus gland 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif 0aT-cell development 0atumor immunity1 aWeng, Xiufang1 aBagchi, Sreya1 aWang, Chyung-Ru0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Feb. 18, v. 111, no. 7 p.2674-2679dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13238451113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04722naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010400204300001800308500001900326520177500345592002802120596006202148596004002210596005402250596002202304596002202326596008902348596008902437596004402526596004602570650002202616650001102638650001202649650001002661650001102671650002302682651002802705651001402733651001002747651002902757651001002786700006202796700006202858700005902920700005702979700006003036700002103096700005803117700005903175700001603234700005903250700005503309700006203364700006003426700002403486700007103510700002503581700005603606700001803662700002203680700001603702700005803718773013303776856008203909852000903991655001204000IND60693838120221117070337.0200508e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069383812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-020-02238-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonek, Alois1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0460-479810aFactors determining variation in colour morph frequencies in invasive Harmonia axyridis populations  ap. 2049-2062.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis Pallas, native to eastern Asia, is an invasive, non-native species that has recently achieved an almost worldwide distribution. A conspicuous feature of this species is colour polymorphism of the elytra. In its native area, the populations consist of a recessive non-melanic morph, several dominant melanic morphs and small numbers of other (rare) morphs. The morph proportions in native populations have been intensively studied and vary with geographic area, climate and time. In contrast, colour polymorphism in invaded regions has been little studied. We examine and try to account for the morph frequencies observed across the different invaded regions. In America, monomorphic populations consist of the non-melanic morphs while European populations contain also melanic morphs. In particular geographic areas of Europe, the average percentage of the non-melanic morphs varied between 78 and 99%. It was highest in the lowlands of northern Italy and central and northern Europe and decreased in the Alps and western (Spain, UK) and eastern (southeast Russia) margins of the recently invaded area. In central Europe the frequency of the non-melanic morphs decreased over the course of the year but increased over the years from 2010 to 2018. The local differences might thus arise through gradual change of the morph composition of the founder invasive, non-native population. However, the variation in non-melanic morph frequency was not correlated with climatic characteristics that might affect coccinellid polymorphism. The observed rate of change in morph proportions in our data was too small to explain the diversification of what was supposedly a uniform invasive, non-native population at the point of introduction.  aPublisher supplied data  aMZE-RO0418cMinistry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic  aMSMT-15739/2019-6cVES19 INTER-COST  aRVO 67985807cAcademy of Science - Czech Republic  a1180533cFONDECYT  a1180533cFONDECYT  a2/0012/17cMinistry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic  a2/0032/19cMinistry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic  a16-14-10031cRussian Science Foundation  a17-06763ScGrant Agency of Czech Republic 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aRussia 3aclimate 3acolor 3aelytra 3aintroduced species 3aCentral European region 3aEast Asia 3aItaly 3aNorthern European region 3aSpain1 aBrown, Peter M.

Plants supplied with NH4+, or NH4NO3 had significantly higher above-ground biomass, leaf length, shoot number and shoot production rates than NO3− fed plants, whereas the relative growth rates, below-ground biomass, and other plant morphological parameters were indifferent to N nutrition. Leaf photosynthetic pigment concentrations and leaf specific area of NO3− −fed plants were lower than those of plants grown on NH4+, or NH4NO3. In addition, NH4+ and NH4NO3 fed plants had higher light-saturated rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance than NO3− fed plants and there were no differences in leaf dark respiration among N-form treatments. Both leaves and roots of A. donax had NRA, but NRA was much greater in leaves, particularly when plants were fed with NO3−. The N uptake rate of A. donax was greatest when supplied as NH4NO3 (1.10±0.34mgNg−1root DM h−1) although not different from the N uptake rate with NH4+ alone (0.61±0.08mgNg−1root DM h−1), whilst NO3− uptake velocities were similar among N-form treatments. Our results indicate that although some traits perform better in the presence of NH4+, presumably due to lower energetic costs of NH4+ uptake, A. donax grows well with either NH4+ or NO3−. This reflects its ability to grow well in both wetland and terrestrial soil types, which is an important consideration for its use as a candidate species for paludiculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundo donax 3aaboveground biomass 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrate 3abelowground biomass 3adry matter partitioning 3agrasses 3ahydroponics 3aleaves 3anitrate reductase 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3asoil types 3astomatal conductance 3awetlands 0aGiant reed 0aPhotosynthesis 0aNitrate reductase activity 0aUptake velocity 0aLeaf biochemistry 0aPaludiculture 0aInorganic nitrogen 0aBiomass1 aLambertini, Carla1 aEller, Franziska1 aBrix, Hans1 aSorrell, Brian K.0 tEcological engineering.g2017 Aug., v. 105 p.379-386dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.04.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245016100202300002000363520134800383592002801731650002301759650001301782650001601795653001601811653001101827653002601838653003101864653002401895700001501919700005701934700001701991773014202008856007802150852000902228655001202237IND60602872520221119080739.0180711e20180619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060287252DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b059562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyeong, Minkyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5044-591910aBODIPY-Based Conjugated Polymers for Use as Dopant-Free Hole Transporting Materials for Durable Perovskite Solar Cells: Selective Tuning of HOMO/LUMO Levels  ap. 23254-23262.  aRecently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as an excellent photovoltaic device owing to the outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE). Nevertheless, device instability remains a critical issue in this field. To overcome device instability without deteriorating PCE, dopant-free hole transporting materials (HTMs) are needed to separate the air-sensitive perovskite layer from extrinsic factors, which induce its degradation. Herein, we developed novel conjugate polymers of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) for use as HTMs without dopants. The pBDT–BODIPY polymer allows individual “dialing” of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels with small modifications to the molecular structure, enabling study of the impact of the frontier molecular orbital on PSC performance. Different alkyl chains on BDT can minutely adjust the HOMO level, and meso-substituents on BODIPYs can selectively set the LUMO level of the resulting polymers. Application of BODIPY-containing polymer into the perovskite solar cell as an HTM leads to a high PCE value (16.02%) and exceptional solar cell stability shown by the fact that over 80% of its original PCE value was maintained after 10 days under ambient air conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3apolymers 3asolar cells 0adopant-free 0aBODIPY 0aperovskite solar cell 0ahole transporting material 0aenergy level tuning1 aLee, Jinho1 aLee, Kwanghee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5907-86251 aHong, Sukwon0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 June 19, v. 10, no. 27 p.23254-23262dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b059563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010800172300001800280520116400298592002801462650001701490650001101507650001201518650002501530650001301555650001101568650001301579650001301592650001601605650001501621650001001636650001901646651001801665700002301683700001901706773009701725856008101822852000901903655001201912IND60519257020221120181335.0160424e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051925702DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-016-0680-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Lindsay K.10aKnowledge Co-production at the Research–Practice Interface: Embedded Case Studies from Urban Forestry  ap. 1262-1280.  aCities are increasingly engaging in sustainability efforts and investment in green infrastructure, including large-scale urban tree planting campaigns. In this context, researchers and practitioners are working jointly to develop applicable knowledge for planning and managing the urban forest. This paper presents three case studies of knowledge co-production in the field of urban forestry in the United States. These cases were selected to span a range of geographic scales and topical scopes; all three are examples of urban researcher-practitioner networks in which the authors are situated to comment on reflexively. The three cases resemble institutional structures described in the knowledge co-production literature, including participatory research, a hybrid organization of scientists and managers, and a community of practice. We find that trust, embeddedness, new approaches by both practitioners and researchers, and blending of roles all serve to recognize multiple forms of capability, expertise, and ways of knowing. We discuss the impacts of knowledge co-production and the ways in which hybrid institutional forms can enable its occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aforests 3agreen infrastructure 3amanagers 3amixing 3aplanning 3aplanting 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3atrees 3aurban forestry 3aUnited States1 aSvendsen, Erika S.1 aRoman, Lara A.0 tEnvironmental management.g2016 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.1262-1280dSpringer USx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-016-0680-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01440naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245005500166300001600221500002000237520050000257592002800757650001900785650001900804651001200823700002300835700002500858700002500883700002800908773010800936856007301044852000901117655001201126IND60572088020221117231513.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057208802DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.014802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemizowa, Margarita V.12aA revision of the family Petrosaviaceae in Vietnam  ap. 262-271.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe family Petrosaviaceae is represented by two species in Vietnam, viz.

In this paper we show the trade-off between the two types of uncertainty in a case of maize production with a focus on freshwater ecotoxicity due to pesticide application in The Netherlands. Parameter uncertainty in pesticide emissions, chemical-specific data, effect and damage data, and fractions of metabolite formation of degradation products was statistically quantified via probabilistic simulation, i.e. Monte Carlo simulation. Model structure uncertainties regarding the concentration–response model to be included, the selection of the damage model, and the inclusion of pesticide transformation products were assessed via discrete choice analysis. We conclude that to arrive at a minimum level of overall uncertainty the linear concentration–response model is preferable, while the transformation products may be excluded. Selecting the damage model has a relatively low influence on the overall uncertainty. Our study shows that quantifying the trade-off between different types of uncertainty can help to identify optimal model complexity from an uncertainty point of view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acrop production 3aecotoxicology 3aemissions 3afreshwater 3alife cycle impact assessment 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aparameter uncertainty 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3aNetherlands1 aHuijbregts, Mark A.

In this paper, MoS₂ nanoparticles with radar-like shapes were demonstrated as 808 nm laser-induced photothermal agents with outstanding photothermal performance. According to our calculations, the radar-like morphology endowed the MoS₂ nanoparticles with higher photothermal conversion efficiency (53.3%) compared to other morphologies including nanoflowers, microspheres and irregular nanoparticles. Cytotoxicity assay indicated that the radar-like nanoparticles were biocompatible. Results of in vitro photothermal therapy and apoptosis assay indicated that tumor cells treated with MoS₂ radar-like nanoparticles can be seriously damaged. Photothermal therapy on tumor-bearing mice was carried out to further verify the anti-cancer properties of the MoS₂ radar-like nanoparticles. All the aforementioned results suggested that the MoS₂ radar-like nanoparticles exhibit enormous potential for cancer photothermal therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3amedicine 3amice 3amicroparticles 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananoflowers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphotothermotherapy 3atoxicity testing1 aQi, Yafei1 aYu, Dexin1 aZhan, Jinhua0 tRSC advances.g2016 Mar. 29, v. 6, no. 37 p.31031-31036dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra03226e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01158naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009600163300001600259500002000275520033900295592002800634650001400662650001600676651001000692773010800702856007300810852000900883655001200892IND60572088320221117231543.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057208832DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.014882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaidu, Sarojinidevi10aEuphorbia venkatarajui sp. nov.

The hiatus is most likely a due to a significant and abrupt reduction in sedimentation rates, the driver of which is unclear; although it appears likely to have been climatically driven. The environmental changes captured in the Lake Shudu palaeorecord provide unambiguous evidence of late Holocene anthropogenic activity, most likely linked to mining activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3aChina1 aCook, Charlotte G.1 aZhang, Enlou1 aLangdon, Peter G.1 aJordan, Jason1 aTurney, Chris0 tHydrobiologia.g2012 Sept., v. 693, no. 1 p.223-235dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1124-y  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245009200214300001800306500001900324520178100343592002802124596008402152596006902236596004902305650001902354650001902373650001302392650001502405650002102420650001602441650002302457650001502480651001502495700002102510700006202531773013302593856008202726852000902808655001202817IND60693838520221117065955.0200508e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069383852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-020-02240-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharbonneau, Bianca R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4080-560X12aA decade of expansion of the invasive plant Carex kobomugi in a coastal foredune system  ap. 2099-2112.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMany plants show capacity for selective spatial and temporal expansion or foraging despite being sessile. In biogeomorphic coastal foredunes, the plant species that inhabit or colonize an area post-storm will affect habitat stability and thus future storm response. Along the mid-Atlantic US, invasive Asiatic sand sedge (Carex kobomugi) has come to dominate foredunes since its introduction in 1929 at Island Beach State Park, New Jersey. To understand controls on foredune invasive expansion, we mapped stand expanses along 3-km of foredune here since 2008, relative to shifting habitat features such as the location of the foredune crest and denuded areas ripe for colonization. Invasive stands have been laterally expanding from pre-existing stands with temporal variation in stand size and density. Stand area loss only occurred due to Hurricane Sandy, but burial level from Sandy did not impact this. Hurricane Sandy fragmented and destroyed stands, but these stands recovered by coalescing over time, and then expanded further whereby stands that lost more in the storm grew larger over 10 years than those that were eroded less. The invasive sedge shows some directionality in growth, typically expanding, but not consistenly across time, further from the crest which experiences less salt spray. Carex kobomugi also spread more extensively into adjacent vegetation than into bare areas, suggesting that replacement of natives is more likely than colonization of open habitat space. Plants are the foundation of coastal foredune systems. Understanding where invasive species are expanding and the underlying controls on invasion is key to predicting current and future impacts related to climate change and resultant changes in future storm frequency and intensity.  aPublisher supplied data  a32 CRF 168a: National Defense Science & Engineering GrantcArmy Research Office  a#NA06OAR4170086cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  aNJSG-20-953cNew Jersey Sea Grant Consortium 3aCarex kobomugi 3aclimate change 3ahabitats 3ahurricanes 3ainvasive species 3astate parks 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3aNew Jersey1 aNicoletta, Rocco1 aWootton, Louise S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1866-80600 tBiological invasions.g2020 June, v. 22, no. 6 p.2099-2112dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02240-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100002100160245010500181300001600286500000900302500001500311520143100326592002801757650000901785650001101794650003701805650001601842650001201858650002601870650002201896650001101918650001301929651001301942653002001955700001901975700002701994700002002021773012302041852000902164856009702173655001202270IND2058293020221121093320.0191122e199509  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205829302DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1995.00021962008700050028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiemira, Brendan10aProduction of Prenuclear Minitubers of Potato with Peat-Based Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Inoculum  ap. 942-946.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aPrenuclear minitubers of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) are the source material used to produce field-grown seed potatoes. Seed potatoes are in turn planted by commercial growers to produce potatoes for fresh packing and processing. Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) have been demonslrated to increase yield in low-input systems. This study was conducted to determine whether and how a commercial AM inoculum influences prenuclear minituber production under high-input commercial conditions. A peat-based medium containing the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradix was tested in a commercial minituber greenhouse production facility. This medium increased yields of the most valuable sizes of prenuclear minitubers by 84%, and increased total prenuclear minituber yield by 49% when compared with conventional peat-vermiculite media under commercial growing conditions. Potato plants grown in this mycorrhizal medium had more uniform stolon development, as well as stolons 39% longer than plants grown in the conventional medium. These yield increases and morphological changes occur in the presence of very low levels of mycorrhizal colonization, and there was no evidence of the enhanced plant P nutrition generally associated with mycorrhizai symbiosis. These effects may indicate the presence of a hormonally mediated plant response to the mycorrhizae that results in more uniform stolon growth and an increase in tuber initiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3aGlomus 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3avermiculite 3astolons 3agreenhouse production 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atubers 3ainoculum 3aMichigan 0acrop production1 aSafir, Gene R.1 aHammerschmidt, Raymond1 aBird, George W.0 tAgronomy journal.g1995 Sept., v. 87, no. 5 p.942-946dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1995.00021962008700050028x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01390naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012500156300001600281520036200297592002800659650001400687650001500701650001600716650002300732650000900755650001700764700001800781700002900799700002200828773013100850856007400981852000901055655001201064IND60659731320221119165949.0190823e20121211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065973132DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc37477c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvci, Ceren10aCritical role of surface hydration on the dynamics of serum adsorption studied with monoethylene glycol adlayers on gold  ap. 466-468.  aThe dynamics of serum adsorption on bare and monoethylene glycol adlayer-modified gold surfaces is investigated using acoustic wave physics.

It has also become a priority for the planning and decision-making process in sectors such as conservation, (land) resource efficiency, agriculture, forestry or urban development.In this paper we propose a methodology that can be used to identify and map GI elements at landscape level based on the notions of ecological connectivity, multi-functionality of ecosystems and maximisation of benefits both for humans and for natural conservation. Our approach implies, first, the quantification and mapping of the natural capacity to deliver ecosystem services and, secondly, the identification of core habitats and wildlife corridors for biota. All this information is integrated and finally classified in a two-level GI network. The methodology is replicable and flexible (it can be tailored to the objectives and priorities of the practitioners); and it can be used at different spatial scales for research, planning or policy implementation.The method is applied in a continental scale analysis covering the EU-27 territory, taking into account the delivery of eight regulating and maintenance ecosystem services and the requirements of large mammals’ populations. The best performing areas for ecosystem services and/or natural habitat provision cover 23% of Europe and are classified as the core GI network. Another 16% of the study area with relatively good ecological performance is classified as the subsidiary GI network. There are large differences in the coverage of the GI network among countries ranging from 73% of the territory in Estonia to 6% in Cyprus. A potential application of these results is the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, assuming that the core GI network might be crucial to maintain biodiversity and natural capital and, thus, should be conserved; while the subsidiary network could be restored to increase both the ecological and social resilience. This kind of GI analysis could be also included in the negotiations of the European Regional Development Funds or the Rural Development Programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abiodiversity 3abiological corridors 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforestry 3agreen infrastructure 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3anatural capital 3aplanning 3arural development 3asocial benefit 3aCyprus 3aEstonia 0aGreen infrastructure 0aEcosystem service 0aHabitat modelling 0aConnectivity 0aPrioritization 0aConservation 0aRestoration 0aEurope1 aKleeschulte, Stefan1 aDige, Gorm1 aMaes, Joachim1 aGrizzetti, Bruna1 aOlah, Branislav1 aZulian, Grazia0 tEnvironmental Science and Policy.g2015 Dec., v. 54 p.268-280dElsevier Ltdx1462-90117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2015.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01736naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005200165300001800217520058500235592002800820650002000848650001700868650001100885650004400896650002200940653002000962653001800982653001501000653001501015653002301030700001401053700001601067700001801083700001901101700002001120773010501140856008401245852000901329655001201338IND60122233220221120215418.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012223322DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2013.8211192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Zhiwei12aA new quassinoid from fruits of Brucea javanica  ap. 2016-2021.  aA new minor quassinoid named bruceine M (1), together with 12 known quassinoids (2–13), was isolated from the fruits of Brucea javanica (Simaroubaceae).

Tension wood is formed by both natural and man-made processes. Most attractively, tension wood contains higher glucan content and undergoes higher enzymatic conversion to fermentable sugars. Here, we have employed structural techniques, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) to elucidate structural and morphological aspects of tension wood conducive to higher sugar yields. RESULTS: Small-angle neutron scattering data exhibited a tri-modal distribution of the fibril cross-sectional dimension. The smallest size, 22 Å observed in all samples concurred with the WAXD results of the control and opposite side samples. This smallest and the most abundant occurring size was interpreted as the cellulose elementary microfibril diameter. The intermediate size of 45 Å, which is most pronounced in the tension side sample and consistent with WAXD results for tension side sample, indicates association of neighboring elementary microfibrils to form larger crystallite bundles. The largest size 61 Å observed by SANS was however not observed by WAXD and therefore associated to mesopores. CONCLUSIONS: Structure and morphology of tension wood is different from control wood. Cellulose crystallinity increases, lignin content is lower and the appearance of mesopores with 61 Å diameter is observed. Despite the presence of higher crystalline cellulose content in tension side, the lower lignin content and may be combined with the abundance of mesopores, substantially improves enzyme accessibility leading to higher yields in cellulose digestion.  aPublisher supplied data  aFWP ERKP752cBiological and Environmental Research  aBiofuels SFAcBiological and Environmental Research  aCenter for Structural Molecular BiologycBiological and Environmental Research  aBiofuels SFAcBiological and Environmental Research  aCenter for Structural Molecular BiologycBiological and Environmental Research  aBioEnergy Science CentercBiological and Environmental Research  aBioEnergy Science CentercBiological and Environmental Research  aCenter for Structural Molecular BiologycBiological and Environmental Research  aCenter for Structural Molecular BiologycBiological and Environmental Research0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3acrystallites 3adigestion 3alignin 3aneutrons 3asugars 3atension wood 3awood1 aKalluri, Udaya C.1 aO’Neill, Hugh1 aUrban, Volker1 aLangan, Paul1 aDavison, Brian1 aPingali, Sai Venkatesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7961-41760 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.44-44dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1043-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002100193245011500214300001600329520108300345650001101428650003101439650001401470650001201484650003601496650002601532650001101558650004401569650002101613650000901634650002601643650004201669650003601711653002301747653002201770700002101792700002701813700002501840700002201865773010801887852000901995856009202004930003302096946001102129655001202140IND4409785320221121030753.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440978532DNAL7 a187989182pmid7 aPMC25611372pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02939.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHimmel, Megan E.14aThe role of T-regulatory cells and Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel disease  ap. 145-153.  aTwo related chronic inflammatory diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are together often referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Current treatment options are not curative, and patients face lifelong therapy and debilitation. IBD is thought to be the product of a combination of genetic and environmental factors that result in the abnormal regulation of immune responses. Experimental models have demonstrated that normal CD4⁺ T-regulatory (Treg) cell responses and commensal bacteria are required for the maintenance of gut immune homeostasis. Recent evidence that CD4⁺ T cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and respond directly to TLR ligands, suggests that signals from commensal bacteria may directly affect T-cell responses in the gut. In this review, we focus on evidence that defects in Treg cells may underlie IBD in humans. In addition, we discuss evidence that direct signaling via TLRs to T cells can affect IBD and that T-cell-dependent responses to bacterial proteins, such as flagellin, are central to the aetiology of this disease. 3ahumans 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aflagellin 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aFlagellinximmunology 2aHumans 2aInflammatory Bowel Diseasesximmunology 2aLymphocyte Count 2aMice 2aModels, Immunological 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryximmunology 2aToll-Like Receptorsximmunology 0aToll-like receptor 0aT regulatory cell1 aHardenberg, Gijs1 aPiccirillo, Ciriaco A.1 aSteiner, Theodore S.1 aLevings, Megan K.0 tImmunology.g2008 Oct., v. 125, no. 2 p.145-153dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02939.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080905b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03707naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010900184300001600293520208200309650001902391650001502410650001502425650002202440650001802462650001302480650000902493650001702502650002602519650001802545650001302563650001402576650002602590650001202616650001202628650001702640650002202657650001202679650003102691650003902722650000902761650002902770650002402799653003102823653001802854653002002872700001602892773009502908852000903003856008503012930003303097946001103130655001203141IND4404760920221121030748.0080421e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440476092DNAL7 a176652742pmid7 a10.1007/s00726-007-0553-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaransaari, P. 10aNitric oxide is involved in taurine release in the mouse brain stem under normal and ischemic conditions  ap. 429-436.  aNitric oxide (NO) has been shown to regulate neurotransmitter release in the brain; both inhibitory and excitatory effects have been seen. Taurine is essential for the development and survival of neural cells and protects them under cell-damaging conditions. In the brain stem, it regulates many vital functions such as cardiovascular control and arterial blood pressure. Now we studied the effects of the NO-generating compounds hydroxylamine (HA), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on the release of preloaded [³H]taurine under normal and ischemic conditions in slices prepared from the mouse brain stem from developing (7-day-old) to young adult (3-month-old) mice. In general, the effects of NO on the release were somewhat complex and difficult to explain, as expected from the multifunctional role of NO in the central nervous system. The basal initial release under normal conditions was enhanced by the NO donors 5 mM HA and 1.0 mM SNAP at both ages, but SNP was inhibitory in developing mice. The release was markedly enhanced by K⁺ stimulation. The effects of HA, SNAP and SNP on the basal release were not antagonized by the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 1.0 mM), demonstrating that mechanisms other than NO synthesis are involved. Taurine release in developing mice in the presence of SNP was reduced by the inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-(1,2,3)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), indicating the possible involvement of cGMP. In normoxia, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA, 1.0 mM) enhanced the SNAP- and HA-evoked taurine release in developing mice and the HA-evoked release in adults. In ischemia, both K⁺ stimulation and NMDA potentiated the NO-induced release, particularly in the immature mice, probably without the involvement of the NO synthase or cGMP. The substantial release of taurine in the developing brain stem evoked by NO donors together with NMDA might represent signs of important mechanisms against excitotoxicity which protect the brain stem under cell-damaging conditions. 3ablood pressure 3abrain stem 3acyclic GMP 3aguanylate cyclase 3ahydroxylamine 3aischemia 3amice 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitroprusside 3anormoxia 3apotassium 3asynaptic transmission 3ataurine 3atritium 3ayoung adults 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBrain Ischemiaxmetabolism 2aBrain Stemxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aMice 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aTaurinexsecretion. 0aAdult and developing mouse 0aTissue slices 0aTaurine release1 aOja, S.

The European Water Framework Directive provides a framework for improving the ecological quality of stream ecosystems, with deviation from reference used as a measure of ecological status. 2. Here we examine the possibility of using less impacted stream sites from Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to establish a Danish reference network for macrophyte assemblages, and as a guiding image for identification of possible references sites within Denmark. Both approaches were evaluated using historical Danish records. 3. Four different macrophyte assemblages were identified for mid-sized streams in the Central and Eastern Lowland ecoregions. Macrophyte assemblages could not be delineated using physical stream site characteristics; however a gradual change in assemblage composition was attributed to differences in alkalinity and human impact. 4. Assemblages of contemporary vegetation in Denmark were quite similar to those found in Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian streams (26-35%). However, more importantly, from species-based predictions we noted higher similarity, particularly with Latvian and Lithuanian streams, before intensive land use commenced in Denmark (c. 1900). These results show that stream sites from these three countries can be considered in a Danish reference network. 5. Two of the four macrophyte assemblages comprised species such as Fontinalis antipyretica, Myriophyllum spicatum, Nuphar lutea, Potamogeton alpinus and P. perfoliatus that have a very scattered occurrence in the contemporary vegetation in Denmark. These groups were closely associated with the predictions from historic records, thereby lending support the conjecture that these assemblages could be part of the guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites within Denmark.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3aNuphar lutea 3aPotamogeton 3aalkalinity 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecoregions 3aecosystems 3aland use 3amacrophytes 3aprediction 3astreams 3avegetation 3aDenmark 3aLatvia 3aLithuania 3aPoland 0ahistoric data 0alowland 0anatural condition 0aWFD1 aSPRINGE, GUNTA1 aRIIS, TENNA1 aLarsen, Søren.1 aSAND-JENSEN, KAJ1 aKJELLERUP LARSEN, LARS M.0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 Sept., v. 53, no. 9 p.1890-1901dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02003.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02763naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012900167300001600296520113200312650001801444650001301462650001101475650001301486650001101499650001201510650003201522650001701554650001201571650001901583650000901602650001301611650002101624650001501645650000901660650001101669650002101680653002101701653002101722653002901743653002801772653002801800653002201828700002101850700002201871700001901893700002201912773013701934852000902071856008502080930003302165946001102198655001202209IND4404954320221121030720.0080425e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440495432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-007-9541-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda, Yoshifumi 10aCharacterization of aldehyde oxidase from Brevibacillus sp.

Aldehyde oxidase purified from a cell-free extract of the bacterium was a hetero-trimeric protein comprised of large, medium, and small subunits with molecular masses of 87, 35, and 19 kDa, respectively. Its UV/visible spectrum and the presence of molybdenum, 5'-CMP, flavin adenine dinucleotide, iron, and acid-labile sulfur suggested that the enzyme belonged to the xanthine oxidase family. The enzyme acted on a wide range of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. The K m value for formaldehyde was 32 mM, whereas those for the other aldehydes tested were below 0.2 mM. When 10 mM glutaraldehyde was treated with 2.0 units of the enzyme ml⁻¹ in the presence of 100 units ml⁻¹ catalase for 120 min, the concentration of the aldehyde decreased to below a detectable level. 3aBrevibacillus 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acatalase 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aflavin-adenine dinucleotide 3aformaldehyde 3aglucose 3aglutaraldehyde 3airon 3amethanol 3amolecular weight 3amolybdenum 3asoil 3asulfur 3axanthine oxidase 0aAldehyde oxidase 0aBrevibacillus sp 0aMethylotrophic bacterium 0aHetero-trimeric protein 0aXanthine oxidase family 0aOxidative removal1 aYagyu, Atsuhide 1 aSakurai, Akihiko 1 aFujii, Yutaka 1 aUchida, Hiroyuki 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 June, v. 24, no. 6 p.797-804dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9541-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03069naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001500169245011000184300001800294500002300312500001500335520162600350650001801976650001701994650001302011650001702024650001802041650001402059650002302073650001702096650001702113650001702130650001202147650001102159650002102170651002102191653001802212653001602230653002602246653001802272653001002290773009802300852000902398856007502407930003302482945002502515946001102540655001202551IND4377416720221121021724.0060125e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437741672DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWang, J.R.10aSpring and summer hydraulic conductivity of 14 woody species of the sub-boreal forest in British Columbia  ap. 2727-2733.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aFour hydraulic properties of the xylem, the Huber value (HV), hydraulic conductivity (K(h)), and specific (K(s)) and leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (K(1)) were studied during the spring before leaf-out and during the summer after full leaf-out for 14 co-occurring tree and shrub species in the sub-boreal mixedwood forests of central British Columbia. The 14 studied species were divided into deciduous and evergreen angiosperm and gymnosperm groups, including one deciduous gymnosperm species, the tamarack, Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch. I tested whether species with different life forms and classification divisions have different hydraulic properties. HVs were statistically similar for all angiosperms but significantly different among gymnosperms. Long-lived, late-successional species had higher HVs than pioneer and early-successional species. K(s) and K(1) values for all species except one, subalpine fir, Abies lasiocarpa var. lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., were significantly higher in the spring than in the summer. Conductivity was higher in angiosperms than in gymnosperms in both the spring and the summer, and was highest in deciduous species in both seasons. The results indicate that requirements for mechanical strength may account for the high HVs in conifers, and that the high HVs compensate for low K(s) and K(1) values. The high hydraulic conductivities observed in the spring coincide with high water availability and high water demand by trees with emerging leaves. The subsequent reduction in K(s) and K(1) values could be caused by drought-induced embolism and cavitation in early summer. 3afoliar uptake 3awater uptake 3aconifers 3aforest trees 3amixed forests 3aleaf area 3aseasonal variation 3awoody plants 3aGymnospermae 3aAngiospermae 3asapwood 3aleaves 3aleaf conductance 3aBritish Columbia 0aConiferophyta 0aHuber value 0aplant-water relations 0aMagnoliophyta 0axylem0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Nov., v. 35, no. 11 p.2727-2733x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1763Available from publisher's Web site  a20060408b20060529c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02909naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001400169245005900183300001800242500002300260500001500283520137600298650001201674650001901686650001701705650001401722650001801736650001801754650001501772650002901787650001701816650002501833650001901858650002201877650001401899650001501913650001901928651001001947653001501957653001701972700001401989700001502003700001802018700001502036700001402051700001502065773009802080852000902178856007502187930003302262945002502295946001102320655001202331IND4377416420221121021804.0060125e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437741642DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOsawa, N.10aLogging impacts on forest carabid assemblages in Japan  ap. 2698-2708.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aWe hypothesized that small-area logging (<1 ha) would greatly affect microhabitats of carabid beetles. To test this hypothesis, we studied the carabid assemblages at Kamigamo Experimental Station, Kyoto, Japan, from June 1999 to May 2001. From the analysis of the number of individuals and niche breadth, the numbers of large carnivores (Carabus dehanii Chaudoir, Carabus maiyasanus Bates, and Carabus yaconinus Bates) and large insectivores (Chlaenius posticalis Motschulsky and Haplochlaenius costiger (Chaudoir)) decreased because of logging, whereas the small carabids, Synuchus arcuaticollis (Motschulsky) and Synuchus cycloderus (Bates), may not have been negatively influenced by logging. The mass of the FH layer significantly affected the total number of Pterostichus latemarginatus (Straneo) and marginally affected the number of S. cycloderus. However, soil water content (%) and the mass of the L layer did not affect the total number of individuals in any species. The results of this study imply that (1) the richness of the FH layer and vegetation, that is, the potential food abundance and habitat richness, is involved in determining species richness and the density of the carabid assemblages and (2) even small-area logging may have a negative impact on the density of the large predatory carabids, which are sensitive indicators of forest disturbance. 3alogging 3aurban forestry 3aforest trees 3anutrients 3amicrohabitats 3awater content 3asoil water 3aanthropogenic activities 3aforest soils 3astatistical analysis 3ainsect ecology 3aspecies diversity 3aCarabidae 3avegetation 3aforest ecology 3aJapan 0aColeoptera 0abiodiversity1 aTerai, A.1 aHirata, K.1 aNakanishi, A.1 aMakino, A.1 aSakai, S.1 aSibata, S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Nov., v. 35, no. 11 p.2698-2708x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1883Available from publisher's Web site  a20060408b20060529c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100002100186245015600207300001800363500002300381500001500404520144800419650002801867650001201895650002101907650002401928650001701952650001801969650002601987650002202013650001402035650001902049650001702068651001102085651001102096653001502107653001602122653001802138700001702156700001502173700001802188700002002206700001602226773011302242852000902355856007502364930003302439945002502472946001102497655001202508IND4377415620221120235621.0060125e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437741562DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Catches of all carabids, forest specialists, and generalists were generally higher in uncut controls than in treatments. The catch of open-habitat specialists was generally lower in controls than in treatments. Although not significant, there was a common trend for scarification to decrease the catches of forest specialists and generalists. Bray-Curtis similarity measures and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination indicated that the composition of the carabid assemblage was more affected by harvesting treatment than by scarification. Carabid species composition varied consistently with increasing gap size and corresponded to the a priori generalized habitat-preference designations. Forest-specialist species were confined to uncut sites, while generalist species were widely distributed across all sites. Open-habitat species were found predominantly in clear-cut and two-gap sites. Hygrophilous species were consistently associated with two-gap, four-gap, and clear-cut sites. Small-gap harvesting is more favorable to the maintenance of the structure of natural arthropod assemblages than are traditional, larger clearcuts. 3asilvicultural practices 3alogging 3asite preparation 3ahabitat destruction 3aforest trees 3amixed forests 3aBetula alleghaniensis 3aspecies diversity 3aCarabidae 3aforest ecology 3aclearcutting 3aQuebec 0aCanada 0aColeoptera 0agap-cutting 0ascarification1 aLangor, D.W.1 aWork, T.T.1 aPelletier, G.1 aHammond, H.E.J.1 aGermain, C.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2005 Nov., v. 35, no. 11 p.2616-2628wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1703Available from publisher's Web site  a20060408b20060529c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03132naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100002200203245013000225300001800355500002300373520162000396650002302016650001902039650001702058650001302075650002602088650002002114650002202134650002002156650002202176650002602198650002002224650001702244650001202261651002102273653002302294700001602317700001502333700001602348773009702364852000902461856007502470930003302545945002502578946001102603655001202614IND4375503820221120225056.0051025e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437550382DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We examined this potential reduction in species richness by comparing ectomycorrhizal mushroom communities across four age-classes (pole stage, young, mature, and old growth) of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) - lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) stands on submesic sites in northwestern British Columbia. Almost 130 species of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms were identified over the 12 sites during the 3-year study period. EMF richness was lowest in pole stands and almost twice as high in the older age-classes. Species composition and abundance were related to stand age, with relatively large differences in communities between the ages of 20 and 120 and relatively smaller differences between 120 and 225 years. Twelve species, including the economically important pine mushroom (Tricholoma magnivelare (Peck) Redhead), were late-seral stand dependent, fruiting in forests that are at least older than 85 years. This distribution of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms across stand ages suggests EMF succession is primarily an accumulation of species and is likely affected by differences in dispersal by ectomycorrhizal fungi, soil properties (increased soil acidity and reduced nitrogen availability), and the rate of stand development. The evidence for EMF species limited to late-seral stands supports the maintenance of some mature forests within these landscapes to conserve EMF richness. 3aTsuga heterophylla 3aPinus contorta 3aforest trees 3atree age 3astand characteristics 3aectomycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3afruiting bodies 3aspecies diversity 3aecological succession 3aspore dispersal 3aforest soils 3asoil pH 3aBritish Columbia 0afungal communities1 aFriesen, J.1 aGamiet, S.1 aKroeger, P.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.1527-1539x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-0953Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02819naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100001700186245011800203300001800321500002300339520132000362650001201682650002001694650002001714650001401734650001801748650001701766650000901783650003001792650002501822650002801847653002801875700001701903700001701920700001601937700001501953700001601968700001301984700001401997700001602011700001302027773009602040852000902136856007502145930003302220945002502253946001102278655001202289IND4373808820221120204218.0050830e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437380882DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The aim of this study was to design a molecular method, coupled with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, to enable early identification of various forms of fungal decay in various types of wood. The resulting tool could be used to certify the healthiness of commercial woods and also to make more efficient use of chemicals and thus reduce their negative environmental impact. Sapwood plates of Distemonanthus benthamianus, Fagus sylvatica, Lophira alata, Pinus sylvestris, and Pycnanthus angolensis were incubated in vitro in the presence of Fibroporia vaillantii, Coniophora puteana, Gloeophyllum trabeum, Pycnoporus sanguineus, and Trametes versicolor according to the EN 113 standard method. Average mass losses ranging from 2.6% to 25.0% indicated that all wood samples had been actually infected and enabled us to test the reliability of our method. PCR products were obtained in 24 of 25 combinations, and DNA sequences were obtained in 21 of the 24 fungal PCR products. DNA sequences obtained from infected wood were compared with sequences from pure strains, thus confirming the identity of the infecting strains with 100% similarity for an average of 412 bp. 3asapwood 3abrown-rot fungi 3awhite-rot fungi 3adetection 3aBasidiomycota 3awood quality 3awood 3apolymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogen identification 0amolecular sequence data1 aDucousso, M.1 aDomergue, O.1 aFardoux, J.1 aRangin, C.1 aFouquet, D.1 aJoly, H.1 aSales, C.1 aDreyfus, B.1 aPrin, Y.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 May, v. 35, no. 5 p.1256-1260x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-0563Available from publisher's Web site  a20060120b20060202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03045naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001800203245008700221300001800308500002300326520161800349650002601967650001701993650001802010650002602028650002202054650001602076650002402092650001902116650001302135650001702148650001602165650001802181650001102199650001302210651001102223700001702234700001202251700001402263773009702277852000902374856007502383930003302458945002502491946001102516655001202527IND4375505820221120193928.0051025e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437550582DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSwenson, J.J.10aPredicting site index with a physiologically based growth model across Oregon, USA  ap. 1697-1707.  aSummary in French.  aWith expanded interests in sustaining productivity under changing climate, management, and disturbance regimes, we sought a means of mapping the potential productivity of forests across the state of Oregon in the Pacific Northwest, USA. We chose the mapping tool 3-PG, a simplified physiologically based process model that can be driven with monthly averaged climatic data (DAYMET) and estimates of soil fertility based on soil nitrogen content. Maximum periodic mean increment (MAI, m3.ha(-1).year(-1)), a measure of the forest's productive potential, was generated by the 3-PG spatial model and mapped at 1-km2 resolution for the most widely distributed tree species. Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Maximum MAI is linearly correlated with yield table site indices and therefore comparable with field-derived estimates of site indices obtained from measurement of tree heights and ages at 5263 federal forest survey points. The model predicted 100-year site index (SI) reasonably well (R2 = 0.55; RMSE = 9.1), considering the difference in spatial resolution between the modeled (1 km2) and field-measured SI (<0.1 ha) and that field plots were offset for confidentiality by 1-3 km. We created a map of the differences between modeled and field-measured SI and found that the 3000 points within +/-6 m error were relatively evenly distributed across Oregon. Improving the accuracy in modeling and mapping forest productivity using 3-PG will likely require refinements in soil surveys, the quality of climatic data, the location of field plots, and the model functions and species parameters. 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aforest trees 3agrowth models 3aenvironmental factors 3aspatial variation 3acartography 3ameteorological data 3asoil fertility 3anitrogen 3aforest soils 3atree growth 3aforest growth 3aheight 3atree age 3aOregon1 aWaring, R.H.1 aFan, W.1 aCoops, N.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.1697-1707x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-0893Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02624naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001700203245008000220300001800300500002300318500001500341520124400356650001601600650001701616650002601633650001701659650001301676650001401689650001601703650001801719650001301737650002001750650002101770651001201791653001701803653001501820700001601835700001701851773009701868852000901965856007501974930003302049945002502082946001102107655001202118IND4375506820221120193830.0051025e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437550682DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Karst.) was investigated in two long-term thinning experiments in southeastern Finland. The stands were approaching maturity, and their development had already been studied for 30 years. The intensities of thinning were low, normal, and high (i.e., the stand basal area after the thinning was, on average, 40, 27, and 24 m2.ha(-1), respectively, in Heinola, and 30, 28, and 17 m2.ha(-1) in Punkaharju, respectively). Compared with the low thinning intensity, the normal and high thinning intensities increased the basal-area increment of individual trees by 52% and 68%, respectively. Normal and high thinning intensities resulted in a relatively small reduction (1%-4%) of mean ring density compared with low thinning intensity. The random variation in wood density between and within trees was large. About 27% of the total variation in wood density was related to variation between rings. Our results indicate that the prevailing thinning intensities in Norway spruce stands in Fennoscandia cause no marked changes in wood density. At least, the possible reduction in wood density is low compared with the increase in individual tree growth. 3atree growth 3aforest trees 3along term experiments 3awood density 3atree age 3aearlywood 3aPicea abies 3astand density 3alatewood 3aforest thinning 3astand basal area 3aFinland 0agrowth rings 0abasal area1 aMakinen, H.1 aSaranpaa, P.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.1767-1778x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1183Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02302naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100002700186245009200213300001800305500002300323500001500346520088500361650001601246650001701262650001701279650001501296650001401311650002401325650001801349650002001367650001201387650002301399650001201422651001001434653002501444653001801469700001901487700002501506700001501531773009701546852000901643856007501652930003301727945002501760946001101785655001201796IND4375505520221120193901.0051025e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437550552DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Oerst.). The data were collected through destructive sampling of 27 trees and analyzed with analysis of variance and regression models. The projected leaf area was greater in trees from more intensely thinned stands. The specific leaf area and the projected leaf area / sapwood area ratio did not vary between treatments. The sapwood cross-sectional area at breast height (1.3 m) and at the base of the live crown provided the best fit for the relationship between projected leaf area and sapwood area. The current sapwood area provided the worst fit, suggesting that at an early age, coigue sapwood does not present permeability problems associated with tyloses. 3atree growth 3agrowth rings 3aforest trees 3atree crown 3aleaf area 3aregression analysis 3astand density 3aforest thinning 3asapwood 3aNothofagus dombeyi 3atyloses 3aChile 0aanalysis of variance 0acrown classes1 aEspinosa, M.A.1 aGonzalez, U. del  T.1 aRios, D.G.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.1679-1685x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-0983Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02604naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001500169245010400184300001800288500002300306520122300329650001801552650002301570650001701593650001501610650002201625650001801647650002401665650001901689650001601708650001501724650001101739650001701750653002301767653002401790653001901814700002001833700001901853773009701872852000901969856007501978930003302053945002502086946001102111655001202122IND4375504820221120183407.0051025e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437550482DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCruz, M.G.10aDevelopment and testing of models for predicting crown fire rate of spread in conifer forest stands  ap. 1626-1639.  aSummary in French.  aThe rate of spread of crown fires advancing over level to gently undulating terrain was modeled through nonlinear regression analysis based on an experimental data set pertaining primarily to boreal forest fuel types. The data set covered a significant spectrum of fuel complex and fire behavior characteristics. Crown fire rate of spread was modeled separately for fires spreading in active and passive crown fire regimes. The active crown fire rate of spread model encompassing the effects of 10-m open wind speed, estimated fine fuel moisture content, and canopy bulk density explained 61% of the variability in the data set. Passive crown fire spread was modeled through a correction factor based on a criterion for active crowning related to canopy bulk density. The models were evaluated against independent data sets originating from experimental fires. The active crown fire rate of spread model predicted 42% of the independent experimental crown fire data with an error lower then 25% and a mean absolute percent error of 26%. While the models have some shortcomings and areas in need of improvement, they can be readily utilized in support of fire management decision making and other fire research studies. 3awater content 3aconiferous forests 3aforest fires 3atree crown 3asimulation models 3afire behavior 3aregression analysis 3aboreal forests 3afire hazard 3awind speed 3acanopy 3abulk density 0aactive crown fires 0apassive crown fires 0arate of spread1 aAlexander, M.E.1 aWakimoto, R.H.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.1626-1639x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-0853Available from publisher's Web site  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02625naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012100165300001600286500002400302520153800326650001201864650002501876650001701901650001501918650000901933650001501942650001401957650002501971650001501996650001502011650001002026651001502036700002102051700001902072773009102091852000902182856004802191655001202239IND4405801020221120173355.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440580102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-008-9063-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBègue, Agnès.10aMulti-time scale analysis of sugarcane within-field variability: improved crop diagnosis using satellite time series  ap. 161-171.  aIncludes references  aWithin-field spatial variability is related to multiple factors that can be time-independent or time-dependent. In this study, our working hypothesis is that a multi-time scale analysis of the dynamics of spatial patterns can help establish a diagnosis of crop condition. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the within-field variability of a sugarcane crop at seasonal and annual time scales, and tried to link this variability to environmental (climate, topography, and soil depth) and cropping (harvest date) factors. The analysis was based on a sugarcane field vegetation index (NDVI) time series of fifteen SPOT images acquired in the French West Indies (Guadeloupe) in 2002 and 2003, and on an original classification method that enabled us to focus on crop spatial variability independently of crop growth stages. We showed that at the seasonal scale, the within-field growth pattern depended on the phenological stage of the crop and on cropping operations. At the annual scale, NDVI maps revealed a stable pattern for the two consecutive years at peak vegetation, despite very different rainfall amounts, but with inverse NDVI values. This inversion is linked with the topography and consequently to the plant water status. We conclude that (1) it is necessary to know the crop growing cycle to correctly interpret the spatial pattern, (2) single-date images may be insufficient for the diagnosis of crop condition or for prediction, and (3) the pattern of vigour occurrence within fields can help diagnose growth anomalies. 3aclimate 3adevelopmental stages 3aharvest date 3aprediction 3arain 3asoil depth 3asugarcane 3atime series analysis 3atopography 3avegetation 3avigor 3aGuadeloupe1 aTodoroff, Pierre1 aPater, Johanna0 tPrecision agriculture.g2008 June, v. 9, no. 3 p.161-171dSpringer USx1385-22567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-008-9063-3 7aarticle02856naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010500168300001600273520131100289650002801600650002201628650002401650650001001674650001001684650002401694650002101718650002601739650001101765650001801776650001501794650002201809650001101831650001201842650002101854650001001875651001101885653001901896653001301915653002301928653002201951653002201973700001401995700001402009700002002023700001602043773011002059852000902169856009202178930003302270946001102303655001202314IND4407649920221120163337.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440764992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3180.2008.00627.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFUMANAL, B.10aCan the large ecological amplitude of Ambrosia artemisiifolia explain its invasive success in France  ap. 349-359.  aIn order to understand the successful spread of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in France, the variability of colonised habitat by this species was studied at 48 locations, from its central to peripheral area of distribution. Each site was characterised by a vegetation survey, a description of the A. artemisiifolia population and a soil analysis. Differences in the number of species, Shannon diversity index, evenness index and plant life form spectra were compared among the sites. A total of 276 species occurring along with A. artemisiifolia was observed. Therophytes and hemicryptophytes represented more than 80% of all the species. The two most frequent species occurring along with A. artemisiifolia were Chenopodium album and Polygonum aviculare. Multivariate analysis of vegetation surveys showed that A. artemisiifolia has a wide ecological tolerance. It colonises a large range of disturbed habitats differing in terms of vegetation cover, species composition and type of soil. The present study highlights the potential of A. artemisiifolia for invading spring crops and all semi-natural or disturbed open areas. The success of its ongoing invasion can be explained by both its generalist character and the existence of vacant ecological niches, which are poorly occupied by the French native flora. 3aAmbrosia artemisiifolia 3aChenopodium album 3aPolygonum aviculare 3acrops 3aflora 3ahabitat destruction 3ahemicryptophytes 3amultivariate analysis 3aniches 3asoil analysis 3asoil types 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asurveys 3avegetation cover 3aweeds 3aFrance 0acommon ragweed 0ainvasion 0ageneralist species 0avegetation survey 0adisturbed habitat1 aGIROD, C.1 aFRIED, G.1 aBRETAGNOLLE, F.1 aCHAUVEL, B.0 tWeed research.g2008 Aug., v. 48, no. 4 p.349-359dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0043-17377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2008.00627.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080712b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02016naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245007200145300001400217520067400231650002500905650001500930650002800945650001000973650001100983650001800994650001301012650002001025650002401045650003701069650002301106650005401129650002801183650001301211650002301224650003401247650004001281700001801321700001701339773013601356852000901492930003301501945001301534946001101547655001201558IND2327780220221120163315.0020628e20020423ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232778022DNAL7 a120230782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraus, P.R.10aCharacterization of the Aspergillus nidulans 14-3-3 homologue, ArtA  ap. 61-66.  aThe 14-3-3 family of proteins function as small adaptors that facilitate a diverse array of cellular processes by mediating specific protein interactions. One such process is the DNA damage checkpoint, where these proteins prevent inappropriate activation of cyclin-dependent kinases. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans possesses a highly conserved 14-3-3 homologue (artA) that may function in an analogous manner to prevent septum formation. However, instead of blocking septation, over-expression of artA causes a severe delay in the polarization of conidiospores. This observation suggests that these proteins play an important role in hyphal morphogenesis. 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aDNA damage 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3afungi 3ahyphae 3amorphogenesis 3aproteins 2a14-3-3 Proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nidulansxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTyrosine 3-Monooxygenasexchemistry1 aHofmann, A.F.1 aHarris, S.D.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2002 Apr. 23, v. 210, no. 1 p.61-66aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02976naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186072001700203100001800220245010500238300001800343500002300361500001500384520117800399650001601577650002401593650001401617650003201631650002201663650001301685650001701698650001101715650002201726650002501748650002501773650001501798650002201813650001301835650002101848651001801869651001101887653002301898653002301921653002401944653002101968653001001989653001901999653003202018653001902050700001802069773009802087852000902185856007502194930003302269945002502302946001102327655001202338IND4377528520221120143345.0060131e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437752852DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We sampled used and available substrates around 126 stations distributed in an intensively managed forest in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. We developed a resource selection function (RSF), validated by a resampling procedure, and compared selection ratios for significant predictors. Diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees and snags was the most significant predictor, probably reflecting nesting selection by its main prey, carpenter ants (Camponotus spp.). The pileated woodpecker preferred deciduous substrates with DBH >35 cm and coniferous substrates with DBH >30 cm. Among deciduous substrates, it preferred snags over living trees, but there was no such preference for coniferous substrates. American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) was clearly preferred over all other species. The RSF we developed and the thresholds we obtained should help forest managers and conservation planners assess habitat quality for this keystone species. 3awoodpeckers 3ahabitat preferences 3adead wood 3atree and stand measurements 3aforest ecosystems 3asampling 3aforest trees 3amodels 3aFagus grandifolia 3awildlife food habits 3astatistical analysis 3aprediction 3aforest management 3aforaging 3akeystone species 3aNew Brunswick 0aCanada 0aDryocopus pileatus 0aforaging substrate 0awildlife management 0afeeding behavior 0abirds 0aanimal ecology 0anatural resource management 0aforest ecology1 aVillard, M.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Oct., v. 35, no. 10 p.2387-2393x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1483Available from publisher's Web site  a20060321b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03112naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100004100161245010500202300001700307500002400324520139500348650002101743650000901764650001401773650001001787650001401797650002001811650001201831650001001843650001901853650000901872650002001881650002001901650000901921650000801930650003101938650001001969650001201979650001801991650000902009650002802018650001102046650000902057650003002066650002602096650002602122650000902148650003602157650001602193700002102209700002502230700001702255700002602272700002202298773011202320852000902432856004502441655001202486IND4424387720221120133529.0090808e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442438772DNAL7 a196034052pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2008004872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenttinen-Damdimopoulou, Pauliina E.10aDietary sources of lignans and isoflavones modulate responses to estradiol in estrogen reporter mice  ap. 996-1006.  aIncludes references  aDietary phytoestrogens, such as the lignan metabolite enterolactone (ENL) and the isoflavone genistein (GEN), are suggested to modulate the risk of estrogen-dependent disease (e.g., breast cancer) through regulation of estrogen signaling. However, the effects of complex food items containing lignans or isoflavones on estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation have not been assessed so far. In this study, the modulation of ER-mediated signaling by dietary sources of lignans (cereals and flaxseed) and isoflavones (soy) was studied in vivo. Adult ovariectomized 3xERE-luciferase (luc) reporter mice received isocaloric diets supplemented with flaxseed, rye, wheat, or soy for 40 h or two weeks, and an additional group of mice was challenged with 17β-estradiol (E₂) following the two-week dietary intervention. In non-E₂-treated mice, soy diet induced luc expression in liver, mammary gland, and pituitary gland while the other diets had no effects. Interestingly, all diets modulated the E₂-induced luc expression. In particular rye diet efficiently reduced E₂-induced luc expression as well as uterine growth, the hallmark of estrogen action in vivo. It is concluded that dietary sources of lignans and isoflavones can modulate estrogen signaling in vivo. The results suggest intriguing possibilities for the modulation of the risk of estrogen-dependent diseases by dietary means. 3abreast neoplasms 3adiet 3aestradiol 3afoods 3agenistein 3ain vivo studies 3alignans 3aliver 3amammary glands 3amice 3apituitary gland 3aplant estrogens 3arisk 3arye 3atranscriptional activation 3awheat 2aAnimals 2aEdible Grain. 2aDiet 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFlax 2aIsoflavonesxpharmacology 2aLignansxpharmacology 2aLuciferasesxgenetics 2aMice 2aReceptors, Estrogenxphysiology 2aWeight Gain1 aPower, Krista A.1 aHurmerinta, Teija T.1 aNurmi, Tarja1 avan der Saag, Paul T.1 aMäkelä, Sari I.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2009 Aug., v. 53, no. 8 p.996-1006dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200800487 7aarticle02759naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245014000166300001800306500001500324520107800339650003001417650001501447650002501462650001001487650002501497650002001522650002101542650002301563650005601586650002401642650001801666650002701684650002701711650002301738650003101761650003101792650002801823650003601851650004401887653001201931653001301943653002801956653001901984653003002003700001602033700001702049773008402066852000902150939003302159946001302192655001202205IND9203604720221120133501.0920605e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920360472DNAL7 a15377922pmid7 aPMC2065422pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastle, L.A.10aCloning and sequencing of an Agrobacterium tumefaciens beta-glucosidase gene involved in modifying a vir-inducing plant signal molecule  ap. 1478-1486.  a2019-12-05  aInduction of Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence genes by plant phenolic compounds is essential for successful T-DNA transfer to a host plant. In Douglas fir needles, the major virulence region inducer is the glycoside coniferin (J.W. Morris and R.O. Morris, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:3612-3618, 1990). Agrobacterium strains with high beta-glucosidase activity respond to coniferin and infect Douglas fir seedlings, whereas most strains with low beta-glucosidase activity fail to respond to coniferin and are avirulent on this host. We have cloned two beta-glucosidase genes from A. tumefaciens B3/73 and sequenced one of them, cbg1. It appears to be part of a polycistronic unit and shows a high bias for GC-rich codons. When expressed in Escherichia coli, Cbg1 beta-glucosidase hydrolyzes coniferin but not cellobiose. The 88-kDa predicted product of cbg1 is highly similar to one other bacterial beta-glucosidase and several fungal beta-glucosidases. There is little homology between Cbg1 and other bacterial beta-glucosidases, including an Agrobacterium cellobiase. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3acellobiose 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 3abeta-glucosidase 3aphenolic compounds 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCellobiosexmetabolism 2aCinnamatesxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2abeta-Glucosidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acloning 0aconferin 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m59852 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aSmith, K.D.1 aMorris, R.O.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1992 Mar., v. 174, no. 5 p.1478-1486x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02975naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100002200149245013400171300001800305520109000323650002201413650002101435650002001456650002501476650002501501650002001526650002101546650002401567650001801591650002301609650003101632650002501663650004201688650003101730650002401761650002801785650003701813650007001850650002801920650004001948650002501988650002402013650003802037650002902075650002502104650002402129650003602153653001202189653002802201700001702229773008402246852000902330939003302339946001302372655001202385IND9203604620221120133616.0920605e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920360462DNAL7 a15377892pmid7 aPMC2065382pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanagasundram, V.10aCloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the structural gene encoding glucose-fructose oxidoreductase from Zymomonas mobilis  ap. 1439-1447.  aThe gene encoding glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (gfo) from Zymomonas mobilis was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. An open reading frame of 439 amino acids encoded a protein of 49 kDa. A leader sequence of 52 amino acids preceded the N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, indicating cleavage of the precursor protein at an Ala-Ala site to give rise to an active form of the enzyme of 43 kDa. Processing of the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase leader sequence, although not complete, was demonstrated in an in vitro translation system. The two Z. mobilis promoters of the gfo gene show considerable homology to other highly expressed Z. mobilis genes (pdc, adhB, gap, and pgk) as well as to the E. coli consensus sequence. Although translation of the gfo gene was demonstrated in vitro in an E. coli S30 coupled transcription-translation system, a functional stable protein was not produced in the E. coli clone. However, the gfo gene cloned into a shuttle vector was shown to overexpress glucose-fructose oxidoreductase to levels of up to 6% of the soluble protein in Z. mobilis. 3aZymomonas mobilis 3astructural genes 3aoxidoreductases 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFructosexmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlucose 1-Dehydrogenase 2aGlucose Dehydrogenasesxgenetics 2aGram-Negative Facultatively Anaerobic Rodsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProtein Engineering 2aProtein Sorting Signalsxgenetics 2aReading Framesxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data1 aScopes, R.K.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1992 Mar., v. 174, no. 5 p.1439-1447x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03037naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100001700186245007100203300001800274500002300292500001500315520144800330650002201778650001701800650001401817650002001831650002001851650002601871650001501897650002201912650002501934650001001959650002101969653001901990653001402009653001902023653001002042653002802052653001002080653001502090653002002105653002002125700001402145700001502159700001902174773011302193852000902306856007502315930003302390945002502423946001102448655001202459IND4377528220221120133540.0060131e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437752822DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Trees were mechanically overturned using a winch, and anchorage was quantified by measuring load, stem angle, and tree dimensions. Trees on the slope were overturned upslope, downslope, or across-slope. Critical turning moments were calculated around the tree base and the actual hinge point. Critical wind speeds required to uproot or snap trees in this stand were modelled to compare the vulnerability of trees to upslope and downslope winds. No overall difference in anchorage was found between trees grown on the horizontal and sloping parts of the site. However, for trees on the slope, those pulled upslope showed significantly more resistance to overturning for a given stem mass than those pulled downslope. Critical turning moments calculated at the hinge point were smaller than those calculated at the stem base, but differences were small and had no effect on the comparison between treatments. Critical wind speeds for uprooting were estimated to be 28 m.s(-1) for an upslope wind and 24 m.s(-1) for a downslope wind on this site. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to windthrow-risk modelling and forest soil conservation. 3asoil conservation 3aforest trees 3awindthrow 3awind resistance 3arisk assessment 3aenvironmental factors 3awind speed 3amechanical stress 3astatistical analysis 3aroots 3aPicea sitchensis 0atree anchorage 0auprooting 0atree stability 0aslope 0acritical turning moment 0aloads 0ahillslopes 0aslope stability 0aroot-soil plate1 aAchim, A.1 aMochan, S.1 aGardiner, B.A.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g2005 Oct., v. 35, no. 10 p.2360-2367wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1573Available from publisher's Web site  a20060321b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03646naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245011700192300001600309500002400325520134400349650001901693650002001712650001201732650001101744650001601755650002001771650001601791650000901807650002301816650001001839650002701849650000901876650001401885650001801899650001501917650002401932650002101956650009401977650001502071650002902086650002602115650003602141650001402177650003002191650002602221650008502247650002802332650002302360650002802383650003002411650003302441650003402474650002702508650002002535650002202555650001002577700001702587700002102604700002302625700002002648700002002668700002002688700001802708773011002726852000902836856005502845655001202900IND4399978020221120122901.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439997802DNAL7 a179032152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01455.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaatinen, Krista10aResponses of aerobic microbial communities and soil respiration to water-level drawdown in a northern boreal fen  ap. 339-353.  aIncludes references  aOn a global basis, peatlands are a major reserve of carbon (C). Hydrological changes can affect the decomposition processes in peatlands and in turn can alter their C balance. Since 1959, a groundwater extraction plant has generated a water-level gradient at our study site that has gradually changed part of the wet fen into a dry peatland forest. The average water-level drawdown of the gradient (from a pristine 9 cm to 26 cm in the dry end) is close to an estimate predicted by an increase in mean global temperature of 3°C. We studied the total microbial community of the aerobic surface peat in four locations along the gradient through phospholipid fatty acid and PCR-DGGE methods. Additionally, field measurements of soil respiration showed a threefold increase in the C-emission rate at the driest location compared with the wettest one, indicating enhanced decomposition. Also, both fungal and bacterial biomass increased in the drier locations. At the species level, the fungal community changed due to water-level drawdown whereas actinobacteria were less sensitive to drying. The majority of fungal sequences were similar to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, which dominated throughout the gradient. Our results indicate that ECM fungi might act as important facultative decomposers in organic-rich environments such as peatlands. 3aActinobacteria 3aair temperature 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adry forests 3aectomycorrhizae 3afatty acids 3afens 3afungal communities 3afungi 3agroundwater extraction 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aphospholipids 3aprediction 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 2aActinobacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aAerobiosis 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDNA, Fungalxanalysis 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxanalysis 2aEcosystem 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gel 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFungixclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPhospholipidsxanalysis 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aWater1 aLaiho, Raija1 aVuorenmaa, Anita1 adel Castillo, Urko1 aMinkkinen, Kari1 aPennanen, Taina1 aPenttilä, Timo1 aFritze, Hannu0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2008 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.339-353dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-29127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2007.01455.x 7aarticle01997naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245011300155300001800268500001500286520100400301650002001305650002401325650001101349650001401360650000901374650001501383653002101398653002101419653000901440700001401449773008001463852000901543930003301552945002501585946001301610655001201623IND4376398420221120102111.0051201e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437639842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The model is based on the equilibrium of static and inertial forces on an arch. The cohesive bulk material is simulated as thin layers connected by elastic and damping elements during vibration. The model predicts the minimum acceleration amplitudes and thrust forces required for destructing arches at certain locations in storage bins. A small cylindrical bin of 178 mm diameter and 120 mm high was used to conduct an experiment to validate the prediction model. Tests were conducted for vibration frequencies from 18 to 90 Hz. It is theoretically proven that the optimal vibration frequencies for arch destruction are among the natural frequencies of the cohesive material storage system. The model predictions compared favorably with experimental results. The average difference between the model predictions and measured acceleration amplitudes for arch destruction was 7%. 3astored products 3amathematical models 3aenergy 3avibration 3aflow 3aprediction 0avibratory energy 0aarch destruction 0abins1 aZhang, Q.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 5 p.1905-1910x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060201b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/01  aOther US 7aarticle02724naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245005800168300001400226520173500240653002001975653002401995653003502019653003902054700002302093700002602116700002402142700002302166773011402189852000902303856008502312946001302397655001202410IND4445531220221120102041.0101126e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444553122DNAL7 a10.1007/s00232-010-9306-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErnest, Nola Jean 10aBiophysical Properties of Human Medulloblastoma Cells  ap. 59-69.  aMedulloblastoma is a pediatric high-grade cerebellar malignancy derived from neuronal precursors. Although electrophysiologic characteristics of cerebellar granule neurons at all stages of cell development have been well described, such characterization has not been reported for medulloblastoma. In this study we attempt to characterize important electrophysiologic features of medulloblastoma that may distinguish it from the surrounding cerebellum. Using patient-derived cell lines and tumor tissues, we show that medulloblastoma cells have no inward Na⁺ current or transient K⁺ current involved in action potential generation and propagation, typically seen in granule neurons. Expression and function of calcium-activated, large-conductance K⁺ channels are diminished in medulloblastoma, judged by electrophysiology and Western analysis. The resting membrane potential of medulloblastoma cells in culture is quite depolarized compared to granule neurons. Interestingly, medulloblastoma cells express small, fast-inactivating calcium currents consistent with T-type calcium channels, but these channels are activated only from hyperpolarized potentials, which are unlikely to occur. Additionally, a background acid-sensitive K⁺ current is present with features characteristic of TASK1 or TASK3 channels, such as inhibition by ruthenium red. Western analysis confirms expression of TASK1 and TASK3. In describing the electrophysiologic characteristics of medulloblastoma, one can see features that resemble other high-grade malignancies as opposed to normal cerebellar granule neurons. This supports the notion that the malignant phenotype of medulloblastoma is characterized by unique changes in ion channel expression 0aMedulloblastoma 0aMembrane biophysics 0aCalcium-activated K⁺ channel 0aModulation of neuronal ion channel1 aLogsdon, Naomi J. 1 aMcFerrin, Michael B. 1 aSontheimer, Harald 1 aSpiller, Susan E. 0 tJournal of membrane biology.g2010 Oct., v. 237, no. 2-3 p.59-69dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0022-26317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00232-010-9306-x3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02732naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100002000186245009300206300001800299500002300317500001500340520117700355650001801532650001601550650001701566650002101583650001901604650001201623650001501635650002701650650002001677650002701697650001401724650001901738650001901757650001901776650002501795650001101820650002801831653001901859653001801878700001601896700001601912773009701928852000902025856007502034930003302109945002502142946001102167655001202178IND4376430320221120081641.0051202e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437643032DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

(red pine) on a potassium-deficient sandy soil at the Charles Lathrop Pack Demonstration Forest in Warrensburg, New York, is influenced by fine-textured lenses at 2-3 m below grade. A possible mechanism for an observed increase in surface soil potassium over time is nutrient uptake by red pine roots penetrating into these fine-textured, subsoil layers, and subsequent cycling of these nutrients between foliage and surface soil horizons. To test this hypothesis, we applied nutrient tracers directly to the deep subsoil and measured their uptake over several growing seasons: Strontium was applied in 1989 and 1993, while rubidium-free potassium (the Rb/K reverse tracer method) was applied only in 1993. Trees treated in 1989 had significantly greater concentrations of foliar and bud strontium than control trees, and trees treated only in 1993 also demonstrated significant uptake of potassium 2 years after treatment. These effects were present regardless of whether the trees had been surface-fertilized with potassium five decades earlier. The results demonstrate the importance of subsoil nutrient pools in forest ecosystem function. 3afoliar uptake 3asandy soils 3aforest trees 3aisotope labeling 3asoil nutrients 3asubsoil 3aloam soils 3afertilizer application 3anutrient uptake 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3apotassium 3asoil fertility 3atree nutrition 3aPinus resinosa 3astatistical analysis 3aleaves 3asoil-plant interactions 0asurface layers 0atracer uptake1 aNowak, C.A.1 aWhite, E.H.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.1978-1983x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1023Available from publisher's Web site  a20060322b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03217naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001500169245011000184300001800294500002300312500001500335520168400350650001902034650002202053650002602075650001902101650001702120650001702137650001802154650001402172650001602186650002202202650002402224650002002248650001502268651001202283651001102295653001102306653002902317653002402346653002102370700001702391700001702408773009702425852000902522856007502531930003302606945002502639946001102664655001202675IND4376430020221120081607.0051202e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437643002DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, there is little known about the role of gaps in the development of forest stands that initially dominate following stand-replacing disturbance. We investigated gap disturbance during the breakup of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands at two scales: at the stand level we quantified gap fraction and gap size as stand development proceeds; at the gap level we determined causes of gap-maker mortality and evaluated resulting gap-maker structure and decay as stand development proceeds. We also evaluated the impact that gaps have on stand transition by quantifying the abundance and growth of juvenile trees in gaps of different sizes and ages. Ten stands between 60 and 120 years since fire in northeastern Ontario were sampled using line intersect transects. Gap fraction doubled (approximately 18%-36%) and mean gap size was more than four times greater (approximately 45-200 m2) over the time period. Standing dead gap makers in early states of decay were most frequent in young stands, whereas snapped gap makers in various states of decay were most frequent in old stands. Infection by fungal pathogens was the most frequent cause of mortality (56%) and was not related to time since fire. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) was the most abundant juvenile recruit. However, transition probabilities for tree species were independent of gap type. These results indicate that gap creation is frequent during early stages of stand development in boreal forests; however, it is unlikely that successional trajectory is affected by their formation. 3aforest decline 3aforest succession 3aquantitative analysis 3aboreal forests 3aforest trees 3adecayed wood 3aforest stands 3amortality 3acanopy gaps 3astand composition 3aPopulus tremuloides 3astand structure 3aunderstory 3aOntario 0aCanada 0acanopy 0asmall-scale disturbances 0agap characteristics 0atree recruitment1 aMallik, A.U.1 aChen, H.Y.H.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.1942-1951x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1263Available from publisher's Web site  a20060322b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02851naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245007000195300001800265506007600283520132400359506003701683650001401720650001601734650002001750650001001770650002101780650001201801650002301813650001401836650001801850650001301868650001401881650002901895700002001924700001801944700001601962700001901978700001801997700002302015700002502038700002102063773008302084852000902167856007802176930003302254946001102287990002302298655001202321IND4430097720221207083036.0091218e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443009772DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp8332doi7 aPMC27941842pmcid7 a198201072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xueqing10aDNaseI hypersensitivity at gene-poor, FSH dystrophy-linked 4q35.2  ap. 7381-7393.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA subtelomeric region, 4q35.2, is implicated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a dominant disease thought to involve local pathogenic changes in chromatin. FSHD patients have too few copies of a tandem 3.3-kb repeat (D4Z4) at 4q35.2. No phenotype is associated with having few copies of an almost identical repeat at 10q26.3. Standard expression analyses have not given definitive answers as to the genes involved. To investigate the pathogenic effects of short D4Z4 arrays on gene expression in the very gene-poor 4q35.2 and to find chromatin landmarks there for transcription control, unannotated genes and chromatin structure, we mapped DNaseI-hypersensitive (DH) sites in FSHD and control myoblasts. Using custom tiling arrays (DNase-chip), we found unexpectedly many DH sites in the two large gene deserts in this 4-Mb region. One site was seen preferentially in FSHD myoblasts. Several others were mapped >0.7 Mb from genes known to be active in the muscle lineage and were also observed in cultured fibroblasts, but not in lymphoid, myeloid or hepatic cells. Their selective occurrence in cells derived from mesoderm suggests functionality. Our findings indicate that the gene desert regions of 4q35.2 may have functional significance, possibly also to FSHD, despite their paucity of known genes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahypersensitivity 3amuscles 3amuscular dystrophy 3amyoblasts 3anucleic acids 3apatients 3aphenotype 3atranscription (genetics)1 aTsumagari, Koji1 aSowden, Janet1 aTawil, Rabi1 aBoyle, Alan P.1 aSong, Lingyun1 aFurey, Terrence S.1 aCrawford, Gregory E.1 aEhrlich, Melanie0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Dec., v. 37, no. 22 p.7381-7393x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp8333Available from publisher's Web site  a20091218b20100101c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02811naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100002000186245012000206300001800326500002300344500001500367520134200382650002801724650001601752650002101768650002301789650001901812650001801831650001301849650001701862650001101879650001101890650001701901650001901918650002101937651002101958651001101979653001901990700001802009700001602027773009702043852000902140856007502149930003302224945002502257946001102282655001202293IND4376429320221120071716.0051202e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437642932DNAL7 a10.1139/x05-1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of different kinds of MSP were compared to a control in the tenth growing season at two research sites in northern British Columbia. To compare MSP results with those of the natural disturbance regime, a burned windrow treatment was also included in the analysis. The bedding plow, fire, and madge treatments all had significantly greater crop-tree growth compared to the control. The bedding plow and madge treatments had significantly lower soil bulk density, higher soil temperature, and lower soil water throughout the growing season compared with that of the control. The bedding plow also resulted in significantly higher concentrations of total carbon, total nitrogen, NH4(+), and NO3(-) than that of the control, at both the 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. The madge rotoclear resulted in significantly greater potential mineralizable N than that of the control. Ionic resins bags, installed for one growing season, did not show any significant treatment differences in available soil nitrogen. MSP did not reduce soil fertility on these sites when compared with an untreated control, but it is difficult to say that it improved it. 3asilvicultural practices 3atree growth 3asoil temperature 3asoil water content 3asoil nutrients 3amineral soils 3anitrogen 3amicroclimate 3aheight 3acarbon 3aforest soils 3asoil fertility 3asite preparation 3aBritish Columbia 0aCanada 0asoil chemistry1 aSchmidt, M.G.1 aBedford, L.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.1854-1866x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x05-1273Available from publisher's Web site  a20060322b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02643naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245008300162300001800245520155500263650001801818650002101836650002001857650002101877650002401898650002301922650002901945651001201974653001601986653002302002653002402025700001902049700001702068773008002085852000902165930003302174945002502207946001302232655001202245IND4377690420221120071805.0060206e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437769042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOlson, E.C.S.10aEffects of fresh versus composted manure on hydrologic responses from cropland  ap. 2163-2168.  aA two-year (1999-2000) study examined the hydrologic response of cropland amended with fresh manure and composted manure using a rainfall simulator. We hypothesized that composted manure would increase infiltration and decrease runoff compared to fresh manure because of its more uniform and finer particle size. The dry-weight application rates of both fresh and composted manure from straw-bedded pens were low (14 Mg ha(-1)), medium (42 Mg ha(-1)), and high (83 Mg ha(-1)), plus an unamended control. Amendment type treatment effects depended on their interaction with rate and year. Interactions of amendment type and rate were observed for initial abstractions in 2000 and for average runoff rates and runoff coefficients in 1999. Initial abstraction in 2000 was generally higher for the high rates of fresh and composted manure and for the medium rate of fresh manure. Initial abstractions were also lower in 1999 (4 to 21 mm) than in 2000 (10 to 115 mm). Runoff rates and runoff coefficients were generally lower for the high and medium rates of fresh manure. For all seven treatments, runoff rates when runoff volumes reached 10 L varied between 36 and 55 mm h(-1), and runoff coefficients varied between 0.12 and 0.53. Based on the results of our two-year study, application of composted manure or fresh manure to cropland at rates up to 83 Mg ha(-1) should have similar impacts on hydrologic response. However, longer-term effects are unknown and should be examined to better understand potential hydrological and water quality differences. 3acattle manure 3acomposted manure 3asoil amendments 3aapplication rate 3aagricultural runoff 3aagricultural soils 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aAlberta 0arunoff rate 0arunoff coefficient 0ainitial abstraction1 aChanasyk, D.S.1 aMiller, J.J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 6 p.2163-2168x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060616b20060702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/28  aOther US 7aarticle02525naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009100167300001600258520159300274650001601867650001001883650001401893653002101907653002001928700003001948773010701978852000902085856008502094930003302179946001102212655001202223IND4444340220221120061633.0101029e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444434022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11046-010-9338-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebb, Brandon J. 10aChronic Invasive Sinus Aspergillosis in Immunocompetent Hosts: A Geographic Comparison  ap. 403-410.  aPurpose To investigate potential differences in clinical presentation, histopathology, and outcomes of chronic invasive sinus aspergillosis (CISA) based on geographic region and species of Aspergillus isolated. Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of published cases of CISA with a comparison of North American and worldwide cases comprised a systematic search of the English language literature. Thirty-four articles were identified detailing 15 North American and 76 global cases of CISA with cranio-cerebral extension in clinically immunocompetent patients. Results North American patients with CISA were older, had a more rapidly progressive course, and appeared to have higher rates of treatment failure and mortality. Anatomic distribution and presenting symptoms were similar between the two groups. North American cases were mostly due to A. fumigatus, while A. flavus was the predominant pathogen worldwide. While granulomatous inflammation was a rare observation in North American cases, it was seen in the majority of cases worldwide. CISA due to A. fumigatus was encountered in older adults, was associated with a chronic inflammatory response, an accelerated clinical course, and a trend toward treatment failure and higher mortality. Patients with A. flavus were younger, demonstrated granulomatous inflammation, and pursued an indolent, clinically responsive course. Conclusion Observed differences in clinical presentation, histopathology, and outcome might involve a complex interplay between the human host, Aspergillus species, and local climactic conditions. 3aAspergillus 3afungi 3asinusitis 0aChronic invasive 0aImmunocompetent1 aVikram, Holenarasipur R. 0 tMycopathologia.g2010 Dec., v. 170, no. 6 p.403-410dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0301-486X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11046-010-9338-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101029b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02835naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001500178245009800193300001600291520149700307650001301804650000901817650001701826650001301843650002601856650002201882650002501904650002701929650002101956650001901977650002601996650002602022650001102048650001602059651001102075700001802086700001602104700001802120700001802138700001502156773007802171852000902249930003302258945002502291946001302316655001202329IND4370402920221120061229.0050523e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437040292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKarimi, Y.10aDiscriminant analysis of hyperspectral data for assessing water and nitrogen stresses in corn  ap. 805-813.  aThe development and implementation of both economically and environmentally sustainable precision crop management systems can be greatly enhanced through the use of remote sensing. In this study, the potential of narrow-waveband hyperspectral observations in the discrimination of nitrogen and water stresses in corn (Zea mays L.) was investigated. A field experiment was conducted in the summer of 2002 at the Macdonald Research Farm, McGill University, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada. Corn was grown in forty 9.0 x 10.0 m test plots laid out in a split-plot design with irrigation (non-irrigated, irrigated) as the main treatment and nitrogen fertilizer application rate (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 kg ha(-1)) as the sub-treatment. Hyperspectral measurements in 2151 wavebands (350 to 2500 nm) were made with a field spectroradiometer during the entire growing season. Using a stepwise procedure, the most effective wavebands capable of discriminating treatment effects were selected. By applying a discrimination procedure with a well-chosen subset of the selected wavebands, treatments were correctly classified with more than 95% accuracy. Specific narrow wavebands, from different portions of the spectrum, allowed the discrimination of plots differing in their irrigation and nitrogen treatments. This study supports past work suggesting that greater spectral resolution should lead to more consistent relationships between the spectral data and different crop status indicators. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3awater stress 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3airrigated farming 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3aapplication rate 3aremote sensing 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aprecision agriculture 3acanopy 3areflectance 3aQuebec1 aPrasher, S.O.1 aMcNairn, H.1 aBonnell, R.B.1 aDutilleul, P.1 aGoel, P.K.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 2 p.805-813x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle01913naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245006200143300001600205500001500221520095900236650002101195650001401216650002301230650002201253650002401275653002301299653001201322653001701334653002601351700001601377773007801393852000901471930003301480945002501513946001301538655001201551IND4370403220221120061323.0050523e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437040322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Grain flow into the machine was modulated using electronically controlled gate valves. Base grain flows ranged from 0.91 to 6.36 kg s(-1) in 0.91 kg s(-1) steps. Flow perturbations of 0.91, 1.82, and 2.73 kg s(-1) were introduced into the combine through a separate conduit. The results showed that lag time varied with the mass flow through the harvester. Grain flow was measured using both an experimental torque-based sensor and an impact plate-type sensor. Lag time was determined using an author-written software program, LagFinder. LagFinder was used to determine lag times for both the grain flow plate and torque-based sensors. Lag time increased with increasing flow rates. Applying varying lag times using a quadratic delay model to yield monitor output could be a simple way to improve the accuracy of yield maps over using constant lag times. 3ayield monitoring 3amass flow 3acombine harvesters 3acomputer software 3asmall cereal grains 0aLagFinder software 0asensors 0asmall grains 0aprecision agriculture1 aChaplin, J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 2 p.823-829x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle02695naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002600127245010600153300001600259500001500275520142600290650001501716650002701731650001901758650003001777650001901807650001601826650002201842650003001864650001301894650001501907650002001922650001601942650002001958650002701978653003002005653001302035700001502048700001602063773007802079852000902157930003302166945002502199946001302224655001202237IND4370403520221120061221.0050523e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437040352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The proper combination of automated systems with fluorescent reporter genes offers the potential for non-destructive analysis of gene expression over time. One of the fluorescent genes more commonly used in many different areas of biology is the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene from jellyfish. The expression of this reporter gene can be detected in the tissues of any transgenic organism by using a microscope equipped with special illumination and emission filters. The main aim of this work was to develop a computer-controlled automated system to monitor GFP gene expression over time. The automated system consists of a two-dimensional belt-driven positioning table, a custom-designed sample holder, and a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera mounted on a stereomicroscope equipped for GFP fluorescence detection. To precisely control the system, software with custom applications was generated. The automated system was used to monitor the response of GFP-expressing Agrobacterium to plant tissues in vitro. Gene expression and bacterial growth were successfully monitored and quantified using image analysis. Our results showed that bacterial colonies growing in the presence of plant tissue had faster growth than those growing in the absence of plant tissues. 3amicroscopy 3agenetic transformation 3atissue culture 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimage analysis 3aGlycine max 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3asoybeans 3aautomation 3agene expression 3amicroscopes 3agenetic markers 3anondestructive methods 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0arobotics1 aLing, P.P.1 aFiner, J.J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 2 p.841-847x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle03259naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245008600166300001600252500001500268520197800283650002302261650002802284650000902312650001802321650002002339650001802359650001402377650001702391650002302408650001802431650002102449650001202470650002102482650001302503650002102516653002902537653002002566700001602586700001702602773007802619852000902697930003302706945002502739946001302764655001202777IND4370345420221120044456.0050520e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437034542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKarthikeyan, K.G.10aNitrogen and solution dynamics in soils receiving chemically treated dairy manure  ap. 601-610.  a2019-12-05  aAn incubation study was conducted to determine the effect of chemically treated manure addition on short- and long-term N dynamics in soils. Three treatments (alum - Al, FeCl3 - Fe, and CaO - Ca) and two manure application rates were used in addition to a control sample (no manure). Subsamples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), water-extractable NO3(-) (WENO3), NO2(-), and K(+)-extractable NH4(+) after 1 day, after 1 and 2 weeks, after 1, 3, and 6 months, and after 1 and 2 years. Soil pH increased significantly only for the application of Ca-treated manure after all incubation periods and was sensitive to the application rate; however, soil pH decreased sharply between 1 day and 1 to 2 weeks or remained unchanged (compared to the control) for the other treatments. Nitrate release was controlled by the treatment type (untreated > chemically treated manure > control) and increased sharply between 1 day and 1 week and then increased slowly at longer incubation periods. Based on the percent of applied inorganic N released as WENO3 (P(WENO3)), differences between chemical treatment types mostly followed this order: untreated > Al-treated > Ca-treated > Fe-treated. Doubling the manure application rate had no effect on P(WENO3). The trend in EC followed that of WENO3, resulting in an excellent correlation (r2 = 0.94) between the two variables. In contrast to NO3(-), K(+)-exchangeable NH4(+) exhibited a sharp decrease between 1 day and 1 week and then remained relatively constant for up to 2 years. Untreated manure had the highest ratio of exchangeable NH4(+) to applied inorganic N after 1 week, and the differences between chemical treatment types were insignificant. Application of chemically treated (especially Fe- and Ca-treated) manure appears capable of decreasing the extent of initial (up to 1 week) rapid nitrification. Besides short-term effects, FeCl3 addition is effective in lowering WENO3 even after 2 years of incubation. 3aagricultural soils 3aelectrical conductivity 3aalum 3acalcium oxide 3awaste treatment 3acattle manure 3achlorides 3adairy cattle 3aammonium compounds 3anitrification 3amanure spreading 3asoil pH 3aapplication rate 3anitrates 3aliming materials 0aanimal manure management 0aferric chloride1 aKalbasi, M.1 aMiller, P.S.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 2 p.601-610x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/15  aOther US 7aarticle02303naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001300157245007500170300001600245500001500261520108000276650003801356650001101394650001301405650001201418650002001430650002001450650002301470650001901493653001701512653001701529653001501546700001401561700001401575700002501589700001601614700001501630773008101645852000901726856007801735939003301813946001101846655001201857IND9105191420221123045145.0911216e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910519142DNAL7 a242729052pmid7 a10.1007/BF000175842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlah, Z.14aThe phosphorylation site of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase from alfalfa  ap. 453-461.  a2019-12-04  aA 50 kDa, calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) was purified about 1000-fold from cultured cells of alfalfa (Medicago varia) on the basis of its histone H1 phosphorylation activity. The major polypeptide from bovine histone H1 phosphorylated by either animal protein kinase C (PK-C) or by the alfalfa CDPK gave an identical phosphopeptide pattern. The phosphoamino acid determination showed phosphorylation of serine residues in histone H1 by the plant enzyme. Histone-related oligopeptides known to be substrates for animal histone kinases also served as substrates for the alfalfa kinase. Both of the studied peptides (GKKRKRSRKA; AAASFKAKK) inhibited phosphorylation of H1 histones by bovine and alfalfa kinases. The results of competition studies with the nonapeptide (AAASFKAKK), which is a PK-C specific substrate, suggest common features in target recognition between the plant Ca2+-dependent kinase and animal protein kinase C. We also propose that synthetic peptides like AAASFKAKK can be used as a tool to study substrates of plant kinases in crude cell extracts. 3aMedicago sativa nothosubsp. varia 3aserine 3ahistones 3acalcium 3aphosphorylation 3aenzyme activity 3asynthetic peptides 3ainorganic ions 0apurification 0arequirements 0ahistone h11 aBogre, L.1 aLehel, C.1 aFaragó, Annamária.1 aSeprodi, J.1 aDudits, D.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1989 Apr., v. 12, no. 4 p.453-461x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000175843Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01383naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001400207520059800221650003400819650001500853650002000868650002400888653002700912653001900939653001100958773006900969852000901038939003301047946001301080655001201093IND9201191120221123045255.0920227e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920119112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, D.A.10aNo classes, no campus, no problem: non-traditional degree-granting programs  ap. 14-16.  aToday's higher educational leaders must be fully cognizant of their ever-changing environments.

In contrast, spectral measurements for the hy 3, hy 4, and hy 5 long hypocotyl mutants indicate that they each contain levels of phytochrome equivalent to the wild-type parent. Immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against the chromophore-bearing region of etiolated-oat phytochrome demonstrates that extracts of all mutant and wild-type Arabidopsis tissues, prepared by extraction of proteins into hot SDS-containing buffer, have identical levels of one major immunodetectable protein (116 kDa). An assay involving controlled in vitro proteolysis, known to produce distinctive fragmentation patterns for Pr and Pfr (Vierstra RD, Quail PH, Planta 156: 158-165, 1982), indicates that the 116 kDa polypeptide from the wild-type parent represents Arabidopsis phytochrome. The 116 kDa protein from either hy 3, hy 4, or hy 5 displays the same fragmentation pattern found for the wild type. Together with the spectral data, these results indicate that the mutant phenotype of these variants does not involve lesions in the polypeptide sequence that lead to gross conformational aberrations, and suggest that the genetic lesions may affect steps in the transduction chain downstream of the photoreceptor. In contrast, this same analysis for hy 1 and hy 2 has revealed that the 116 kDa protein from either of these mutants is not degraded differently in response to the different wavelengths of irradiation given in vitro. Moreover, whereas immunoblot analysis of tissue extracts from light-grown wild-type seedlings show that the 116 kDa phytochrome protein level is greatly reduced relative to dark-grown tissue as expected, similar extracts of light-grown hy 1 and hy 2 seedlings contain the 116 kDa polypeptide in amounts equivalent to those of dark-grown tissue. Combined, these data indicate that the hy 1 and hy 2 mutants both produce normal levels of immunochemically detectable phytochrome that is photochemically nonfunctional. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aphytochrome 3amolecular conformation 3aproteolysis 3aimmunochemistry 3amutants 3ahypocotyls 3alength 3aspectral analysis 0adefects1 aShanklin, J.1 aKoornneef, M.1 aKendrick, R.E.1 aQuail, P.H.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1989 Apr., v. 12, no. 4 p.425-437x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000175823Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02805naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245007100178300001600249500001500265520177200280650002102052650001802073650001002091650001802101650002202119650001602141650002302157653003102180653002602211700002402237773007802261852000902339930003302348945002502381946001302406655001202419IND4372612220221123043023.0050721e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437261222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aReyniers, M.10aComparison of two filtering methods to improve yield data accuracy  ap. 909-916.  a2019-12-05  aYield maps are useful management tools, so it is important that they represent as closely as possible the true yield in the field and not an artifact generated by the combine harvester or other systematic errors. Two filtering techniques were compared in their usefulness when processing grain yield data from a combine harvester. The first technique used a normal low-pass filter. The second technique used a filter model based on the characteristics of the machine dynamics, after a low-pass filter. The accuracy of both filters on combine yield was tested under extreme field conditions and abrupt field changes. Compared to yield reference measurements, it was clear that when one of the filters was used in the yield processing, yield values were more accurate than when no filter was used. The low-pass filtering turned out to be robust and useful, but not where abrupt speed or cutting width variations were imposed. An advantage of using the low-pass filter was that when abrupt yield variations existed in the field, they stayed so throughout the yield processing. Where the low-pass filtering did not compensate for abrupt grain yield variations because of changing field conditions, machine dynamics filtering partly did. Machine dynamics filtering appeared very useful when measurement conditions changed suddenly. With machine dynamics filtering, there was a decrease in points containing extreme and impossible yield values. A great advantage of using the machine dynamics filtering method was that it solved a great part of the errors introduced by the delay time, the lead time, and the lag time. In fact, both filtering techniques had their own advantages and can be seen as complementary with respect to grain yield variation from different origins. 3ayield monitoring 3ayield mapping 3awheat 3adata analysis 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3acombine harvesters 0amathematics and statistics 0aprecision agriculture1 aDe Baerdemaeker, J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 3 p.909-916x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050914b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/08  aOther US 7aarticle02835naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001400157245016100171300001600332520147200348650003001820650001801850650001401868650001901882650001701901650002201918650003801940650002801978650001202006653001502018653001602033653002702049653002202076653002602098700001702124700001802141700001802159773008102177852000902258856007802267939003302345946001102378655001202389IND9105190820221123043013.0911213e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910519082DNAL7 a242728992pmid7 a10.1007/BF000175782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, X.Q.10amRNAs for two ribosomal proteins are preferentially translated in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under conditions of reduced protein synthesis  ap. 385-394.  aTwo mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, one deficient in the small subunit of the chloroplast ribosome and the other having chloroplast ribosomes with reduced function under certain conditions, show a characteristic syndrome of photosynthetic defects resulting from reduced chloroplast protein synthesis. These include subnormal levels of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), reduced Hill reaction activity, diminished capacity to fix CO2, and abnormal thylakoid stacking. However, these mutants accumulate normal appearing chloroplast ribosome monomers or large subunits containing normal ribosomal protein components. In this paper, we demonstrate that pulse-labeled cells of these mutants synthesize two large subunit chloroplast ribosomal proteins at about 60% of the wild-type rate, whereas Rubisco large subunit (LSU) and the alpha subunit of CF1 are made at only 4 to 8% of the wild type rate. No difference in the rate of turnover between ribosomal proteins and Rubisco LSU in mutant and wild-type cells was observed during a subsequent 60 min chase. Differences between the mutants and wild-type cells in the relative synthesis rates of these proteins were not reflected in the relative levels of mRNA (either hybridizable or in vitro translatable). In aggregate, these data suggest that C. reinhardtii preferentially translates chloroplast ribosomal protein mRNAs under conditions of reduced total chloroplast protein synthesis. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3amessenger RNA 3aribosomes 3anucleoproteins 3achloroplasts 3aprotein synthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3amutants 0adeficiency 0atranslation 0aribosomal protein l-13 0acoupling factor 1 0aribosomal protein l-11 aHosler, J.P.1 aBoynton, J.E.1 aGillham, N.W.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1989 Apr., v. 12, no. 4 p.385-394x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000175783Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02361naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009500143300001400238520094200252650001701194650001101211650003001222650000901252650001301261650002301274650002101297650002001318650002201338650001101360650002001371650001601391650001101407650001201418650004401430650002901474650000901503650001101512650000901523650003501532650001801567653001701585700001501602700001901617700001501636700001801651773008401669852000901753930003301762945001301795946001101808655001201819IND2054674020221123043009.0961230e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205467402DNAL7 a75478302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowe, N.M.12aA stable isotope study of zinc kinetics in Irish setters with gluten-sensitive enteropathy  ap. 69-76.  aThe short-term kinetics of Zn turnover were studied in Irish setters with gluten-sensitive enteropathy and control dogs following intravenous injection of 0.25 mg 96.5% enriched 70ZnCl2. The 70Zn enrichment of serum was found closely to obey two-compartment kinetics and the derived two-compartment decay equation was used to calculate the size and turnover of the two initial rapidly exchanging pools of body Zn. In normal Irish setters isotopic Zn initially equilibrates with a pool (a) of size 1.27 (SD 0.46) micromoles/kg and then with a second pool (b) of size 6.83 (SD 1.72) micromoles/kg. The fractional turnover of pool (b) was approximately one eighth that of pool (a). Enteropathic dogs showed no reduction in the size of either rapidly exchangeable Zn pool, reduction in serum Zn concentration or abnormality in Zn balance and hence these results do not support the possibility of an underlying Zn deficiency in this disorder. 3aIrish Setter 3agluten 3adigestive system diseases 3azinc 3akinetics 3amineral metabolism 3anutrient balance 3astable isotopes 3anutrient reserves 3ayields 3anutrient intake 3ablood serum 3amodels 2aAnimals 2aCeliac Diseasexmetabolismxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxmetabolism 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aMale 2aZincxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aZinc Isotopes 0acompartments1 aHall, E.J.1 aAnderson, R.S.1 aBatt, R.M.1 aJackson, M.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1995 July, v. 74, no. 1 p.69-76x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19970203b19970210c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01794naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245019700126300001800323500001500341520074300356650001601099650002301115650001401138650001401152650001901166650002601185650004301211653001401254653003001268700001901298773008401317852000901401939003301410946001301443655001201456IND9201180620221123021558.0920303e199108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920118062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, K.J.10aTemperature-dependent fecundity, longevity, and host-killing activity of Diglyphus intermedius (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) on third instars of Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) (Diptera: Agromyzidae)  ap. 1195-1199.  a2019-12-04  aThe longevity and fecundity of the parasitoid Diglyphus intermedius (Girault) and the host mortality induced by the parasitoid were studied at five constant temperatures from 15.6 to 31.1 degrees C.

The cumulative distributions of adult longevity, host mortality, and fecundity in relation to physiological age are described. 3aparasitoids 3aLiriomyza trifolii 3alongevity 3afecundity 3ainsect control 3aDiglyphus intermedius 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aparasites 0aparasites of insect pests1 aSchuster, D.J.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1991 Aug., v. 20, no. 4 p.1195-1199x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03222naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245012000190300001800310520140300328650002601731650001301757650001201770650002501782650002701807650002901834650008401863650002201947650002401969650002601993650000902019650008402028650002402112650008002136650004902216650000902265650001702274650002902291650001902320653000902339653000902348653001602357700002102373700002202394700001802416773010602434852000902540856008502549930003302634946001302667655001202680IND4442625220221123021458.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444262522DNAL7 a206868262pmid7 a10.1007/s11095-010-0216-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirasaka, Yoshiyuki 10aIntestinal Absorption of HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor Pravastatin Mediated by Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide  ap. 2141-2149.  aPurpose The purpose of this study is to clarify the impact of organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) on intestinal absorption of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin. Methods OATP/Oatp-mediated pravastatin uptake was evaluated with Xenopus oocytes systems. Intestinal permeability was measured by an in situ closed loop method in rats. In vivo pravastatin absorption was kinetically assessed by measuring plasma concentration after oral administration in rats. Results Uptake of pravastatin by Oatp1a5, Oatp2b1, OATP1A2, and OATP2B1 cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes was significantly increased compared with that by water-injected oocytes. Naringin, a potent inhibitor of Oatps and Mdr1, decreased the Oatp1a5-mediated uptake of pravastatin with IC ₅₀ value of 30.4 μM. Rat intestinal permeability of pravastatin was significantly reduced in the presence of 1,000 μM naringin. Similar results were obtained in in vivo absorption studies in rats. Furthermore, no significant change in the permeability was observed in the presence of elacridar, a potent inhibitor of both Mdr1 and Bcrp, though the permeability was significantly decreased in the presence of both elacridar and naringin, suggesting that Mdr1 and Bcrp are not involved in intestinal absorption of pravastatin. Conclusion Oatp, but not by Mdr1 or Bcrp, contributes to the intestinal absorption of pravastatin in rats. 3aintestinal absorption 3anaringin 2aAnimals 2aBiological Transport 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aFlavanonesxpharmacology 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitorsxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aIleumxmetabolism 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aMale 2aMultidrug Resistance-Associated Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxphysiology. 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aOrganic Anion Transportersxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPravastatinxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aXenopus laevis 0aMdr1 0aOatp 0apravastatin1 aSuzuki, Kensuke 1 aNakanishi, Takeo 1 aTamai, Ikumi 0 tPharmaceutical research.g2010 Oct., v. 27, no. 10 p.2141-2149dBoston : Springer USx0724-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-010-0216-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01394naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245006700161300001600228520043000244653004800674653009700722653002900819653002200848700002400870773011500894852000901009856008501018946001301103655001201116IND4444312720221123022134.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444431272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10593-010-0599-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, D.

By exploiting homology with classical model organisms, this makes possible predictions of pathways and cellular functions currently impossible to address in intractable organisms. Echoing realization that core metabolic processes were established very early following evolution of life on earth, it is now emerging that many eukaryotic cellular features, including the endomembrane system, are ancient and organized around near-universal principles. Rab proteins are key mediators of vesicle transport and specificity, and via the presence of multiple paralogues, alterations in interaction specificity and modification of pathways, contribute greatly to the evolution of complexity of membrane transport. Understanding system-level contributions of Rab proteins to evolutionary history provides insight into the multiple processes sculpting cellular transport pathways and the exciting challenges that we face in delving further into the origins of membrane trafficking specificity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell membranes 3aendomembrane system 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenomics 3aphysiological transport 3aprediction 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aCell Compartmentation 2aEukaryotaxenzymology 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aHumans 2aIntracellular Membranesxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2arab GTP-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aTrafficking 0aEukaryogenesis 0aRab protein 0aSystems biology1 aDacks, Joel B. 1 aField, Mark C. 0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2010 Oct., v. 67, no. 20 p.3449-3465dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-010-0436-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03110naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001600193245010700209300001600316520156100332653002901893653003501922653002101957653002501978653002202003653005702025653002902082653003502111653002102146653002502167653002202192653005702214700001502271700001902286700001902305700002202324773017302346852000902519856009202528930003302620946001102653655001202664IND4417633820221123022234.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441763382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-985X.2009.00580.x2doi7 aPMC32479052pmcid7 a222110052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Binbing10aModelling population-based cancer survival trends by using join point models for grouped survival data  ap. 405-425.  aIn the USA cancer as a whole is the second leading cause of death and a major burden to health care; thus medical progress against cancer is a major public health goal. There are many individual studies to suggest that cancer treatment breakthroughs and early diagnosis have significantly improved the prognosis of cancer patients. To understand better the relationship between medical improvements and the survival experience for the patient population at large, it is useful to evaluate cancer survival trends on the population level, e.g. to find out when and how much the cancer survival rates changed. We analyse population-based grouped cancer survival data by incorporating join points into the survival models. A join point survival model facilitates the identification of trends with significant change-points in cancer survival, when related to cancer treatments or interventions. The Bayesian information criterion is used to select the number of join points. The performance of the join point survival models is evaluated with respect to cancer prognosis, join point locations, annual percentage changes in death rates by year of diagnosis and sample sizes through intensive simulation studies. The model is then applied to grouped relative survival data for several major cancer sites from the 'Surveillance, epidemiology and end results' programme of the National Cancer Institute. The change-points in the survival trends for several major cancer sites are identified and the potential driving forces behind such change-points are discussed. 0aAnnual percentage change 0aBayesian information criterion 0aJoin point model 0aProportional hazards 0aRelative survival 0aSurveillance, epidemiology and end results programme 0aAnnual percentage change 0aBayesian information criterion 0aJoin point model 0aProportional hazards 0aRelative survival 0aSurveillance, epidemiology and end results programme1 aHuang, Lan1 aTiwari, Ram C.1 aFeuer, Eric J.1 aJohnson, Karen A.0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Auxin, ethylene, and light are also required for the induction of root hair formation. To investigate the mechanism by which ethylene production is regulated during root hair formation, we isolated three 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase genes (Ls-ACO1, 2, and 3) from lettuce, each of which exists as a single copy in the genome. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the three ACO proteins as well as a phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ls-ACO3 was the most divergent among the ACO family. Northern hybridization analyses revealed that the mRNA levels of Ls-ACO2, but not Ls-ACO1 and Ls-ACO3, increased in the primary root after the transfer to a pH 4.0 medium. Addition of ACC or indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to the pH 6.0 medium induced root hair formation, and a concomitant accumulation of Ls-ACO2 mRNA was observed. In contrast, the mRNA levels of Ls-ACO1 and Ls-ACO3 were unaffected by either ACC or IAA treatment. Furthermore, white light irradiation of dark-grown seedlings following the transfer to pH 4.0 medium induced the accumulation of all three ACO mRNAs. However, accumulation of Ls-ACO2 mRNA was also observed in non-irradiated seedlings, suggesting that the expression of Ls-ACO2 was induced not by light but by low pH. These results suggest that among the differentially regulated ACO genes, Ls-ACO2 plays a key role in ethylene production during low-pH-induced root hair formation in lettuce. 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aLactuca sativa 3aNorthern blotting 3aamino acid sequences 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aindole acetic acid 3airradiation 3alettuce 3amessenger RNA 3apH 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aroot hairs 3aseedlings 3awhite light 0aLactuca sativa L 0aLow pH 0aRoot hair1 aShinkawa, Testuhito 1 aNakai, Shinjiro 1 aInoue, Yasunori 0 tPlant growth regulation.g2010 Nov., v. 62, no. 2 p.137-149dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-010-9499-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101022b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02081naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245010800175300001600283500001500299520087500314650001501189650001601204650001801220650002001238650001501258650001701273650002001290650001101310650002301321653003001344653002301374653002301397653000801420700002001428773008001448852000901528856007801537939003301615946001101648655001201659IND9105189720221122233847.0911213e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910518972DNAL7 a242710682pmid7 a10.1007/BF000369662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClure, B.A.10aTissue print hybridization.

This technique is modified from that originally published by Cassab and Varner (J Cell Biol 105: 2581-2588, 1987) for the localization of extensin protein in soybean seed using an antibody probe. We extended this original tissue print procedure by utilizing 35S-labeled antisense RNAs for localization of specific RNAs immobilized on nylon membranes. We also employed modifications to improve the resolution of the autoradiographic images. We have used this technique to demonstrate the tissue-specific expression of auxin-regulated genes in elongating hypocotyl regions of etiolated soybean seedlings and the rapid turn-over of RNAs encoded by these genes during gravistimulation. 3aRNA probes 3aGlycine max 3aantisense RNA 3aautoradiography 3ahypocotyls 3agravitropism 3agene expression 3aauxins 3aanalytical methods 0ain situ rna hybridization 0asmall auxin up rna 0amolecular genetics 0aRNA1 aGuilfoyle, T.J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1989 May, v. 12, no. 5 p.517-524x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000369663Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01613naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245006700134300001400201300002800215520077100243650001301014650001201027650001901039650001601058653002201074711008101096773007301177852000901250939003301259945000801292946001101300655001201311991577605200742620221122223532.0811208s1979    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810021142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalabanski, L.10aDiet and physical performance in the rehabilitation of obesity  ap. 33-40.  ap. 33-40. ill., charts.  aRestricted physical activity is usually a factor in the caloric imbalance that results in obesity, but whether inactivity is the cause or result of obesity is not clear. A 9-year weight reduction program in 2 Bulgarian sanatoriums investigated effects of diet-exercise regimes. Seven diets (hypocaloric, normocaloric, hypolipidic, Atkins, and raw food) were combined with a course of intensive physical activity; all proved effective. As body weight (adipose tissue) was reduced, physiometric indices showed improvement, including oxygen utilization, endurance to submaximal loading, respiratory capacity, pulse rate, and muscular force. Increased physical activity as an alternative to dietary restrictions is supported in weight loss and maintenance programs.

The D₁₀-value, the radiation dose needed to inactivate 90% of the microbial load in the food medium, is used to relate the amount of absorbed energy to the fractional population of the viable cells. Numerous experimental studies have been performed to determine the D₁₀ values of several food borne microorganisms irradiated under various conditions. Nevertheless, accurate prediction of D₁₀ value for a radiation treatment of a food product that has not been empirically examined can not be made due to insufficient understanding of the biological response to radiation exposure. A theoretical model for the derivation of the D₁₀-value has been proposed in this study to mechanistically assess the DNA damage by energetic electrons. The step-by-step Monte-Carlo simulation technique which employed the detailed histories of the ionizing particles and the radiolytic species was utilized. The impacts of the genomic sequence, the number of the genome equivalents, and the method of DNA double strand break determination were hypothetically investigated. The developed computational methodology as well as the results presented can be used as an analytical tool to evaluate the effect of ionizing radiation on the cell survival. The presented methodology can be employed as an investigative technique complementary to other approaches to understand the physical, chemical and biological changes in food-born pathogens exposed to e-beam. 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3acommodity foods 3adose response 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3afood processing 3aionizing radiation 3amicrobial load 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3anutritive value 3apathogens 3aprediction 3aradiation resistance1 aEKPANYASKUN, N.1 aBRABY, L.A.0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2010 Feb., v. 33, no. s1 p.314-340dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2009.00512.x 7aarticle01665naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245007400161300001800235520074100253650001000994650001101004700002801015700001801043700002001061700001701081773012701098852000901225856008301234930003301317946001301350655001201363IND4406823620221122200309.0080613e20080613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440682362DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11554662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlin, Erika10aTransfer of Learning After Updating Training Mediated by the Striatum  ap. 1510-1512.  aProcess-specific training can improve performance on untrained tasks, but the magnitude of gain is variable and often there is no transfer at all. We demonstrate transfer to a 3-back test of working memory after 5 weeks of training in updating. The transfer effect was based on a joint training-related activity increase for the criterion (letter memory) and transfer tasks in a striatal region that also was recruited pretraining. No transfer was observed to a task that did not engage updating and striatal regions, and age-related striatal changes imposed constraints on transfer. These findings indicate that transfer can occur if the criterion and transfer tasks engage specific overlapping processing components and brain regions. 3abrain 3amemory1 aNeely, Anna Stigsdotter1 aLarsson, Anne1 aBäckman, Lars.1 aNyberg, Lars0 tScience.g2008 June 13, v. 320, no. 5882 p.1510-1512dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11554663Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03307naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002200182245010100204300001600305500002400321506007600345520149900421506003701920650002001957650002101977650001301998650001402011650001402025650002002039650001002059650001602069650002202085650001202107650001402119650002302133650001002156650001102166650003802177650002702215650001302242650005702255650004202312650006102354700002302415700002102438700002002459700002602479773011302505852000902618856008102627856003302708655001202741IND4387781020221207082722.0070211e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438778102DNAL7 a171585892pmid7 aPMC18037422pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.106.0879572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimons, Joanne L.10aAnalysis of the DECREASED APICAL DOMINANCE Genes of Petunia in the Control of Axillary Branching  ap. 697-706.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aControl of branch development is a major determinant of architecture in plants. Branching in petunia (Petunia hybrida) is controlled by the DECREASED APICAL DOMINANCE (DAD) genes. Gene functions were investigated by plant grafting, morphology studies, double-mutant characterization, and gene expression analysis. Both dad1-1 and dad3 increased branching mutants can be reverted to a near-wild-type phenotype by grafting to a wild-type or a dad2 mutant root stock, indicating that both genes affect the production of a graft-transmissible substance that controls branching. Expression of the DAD1 gene in the stems of grafted plants, detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction correlates with the branching phenotype of the plants. The dad2-1 mutant cannot be reverted by grafting, indicating that this gene acts predominantly in the shoot of the plant. Double-mutant analysis indicates that the DAD2 gene acts in the same pathway as the DAD1 and DAD3 genes because the dad1-1dad2-1 and dad2-1dad3 double mutants are indistinguishable from the dad2-1 mutant. However, the dad1-1dad3 double mutant has an additive phenotype, with decreased height of the plants, delayed flowering, and reduced germination rates compared to the single mutants. This result, together with the observation that the dad1-1 and dad3 mutants cannot be reverted by grafting to each other, suggests that the DAD1 and DAD3 genes act in the same pathway, but not in a simple stepwise fashion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPetunia hybrida 3aapical dominance 3abranches 3abranching 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agenes 3agermination 3agrafting (plants) 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant architecture 3aroots 3ashoots 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aMutation 2aPetuniaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stemsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aNapoli, Carolyn A.1 aJanssen, Bart J.1 aPlummer, Kim M.1 aSnowden, Kimberley C.0 tPlant physiology.g2007 Feb., v. 143, no. 2 p.697-706dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.0879573Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02835naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245008200167300001600249500002400265500001500289520154700304650001301851650001601864650001801880650001001898650001201908650001101920650002301931650002001954650001201974650002001986650002102006650002402027650002602051650002602077650000902103650001702112653002802129700001202157700001202169700001502181773010502196852000902301856005502310655001202365IND4450617820221122131349.0110311e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445061782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00720.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAN, X.-Y.10aDietary copper requirement of juvenile yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco  ap. 170-176.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present experiment was conducted to quantify dietary copper (Cu) requirement for juvenile yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco. The six experimental diets were formulated to contain the graded levels of CuSO₄·5H₂O (0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 g kg⁻¹ diet respectively) providing the actual dietary copper values of 2.14 (control), 3.24, 4.57, 7.06, 12.22 and 22.25 mg Cu kg⁻¹ diet respectively. Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of yellow catfish (initial body weight: 3.13 ± 0.09 g, means ± SD) in an indoor static rearing system for 7 weeks. Fish fed the diet containing 3.24 mg Cu kg⁻¹ diet had the highest weight gain and specific growth rate, but they were not significantly different from that of fish fed the 4.57 and 7.06 mg Cu kg⁻¹ diets (P > 0.05). The poorest feed conversion rate, the lowest protein efficiency ratio, the lowest hepatosomatic index and viscerosomatic index were observed in fish fed the diet containing the highest Cu content diet (P < 0.05). Condition factor showed no significant differences among the treatments (P > 0.05). Proximate composition of fish body was significantly affected by dietary copper level (P < 0.05). Cu contents of whole body and liver increased with dietary Cu levels (P < 0.05), but muscle Cu content remained relatively stable (P > 0.05). Analysis by the second-order regression of SGR and linear regression of whole-body Cu retention of the fish indicated that dietary Cu requirements in juvenile yellow catfish were 3.13-4.24 mg Cu kg⁻¹ diet. 3aproteins 3aweight gain 3alinear models 3aliver 3arearing 3acopper 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3amuscles 3anutritive value 3abody composition 3aregression analysis 3aTachysurus fulvidraco 3aproximate composition 3afish 3afish feeding 0aPelteobagrus fulvidraco1 aLUO, Z.1 aLIU, X.1 aXIE, C.-X.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2011 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.170-176dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1353-57737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2009.00720.x 7aarticle03965naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245013400141300001600275500001500291520220400306650001702510650001502527650001302542650001002555650001102565650001702576650001002593650001202603650001702615650001502632650001602647650002402663650001302687650001802700650002302718650001902741650001302760650001602773650001202789650001902801650001402820650002502834650003802859650000902897650002202906650002202928650002502950650002202975650001702997650002003014650002403034653001303058653001603071700001803087700001603105700001803121773008603139852000903225930003303234945001303267946001103280655001203291IND2053861420221122131321.0961104e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205386142DNAL7 a78270122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Y.14aThe effect of condensed tannins in Lotus corniculatus on plasma metabolism of methionine, cystine and inorganic sulphate by sheep  ap. 923-935.  a2019-12-05  aFresh Lotus corniculatus containing 27 g extractable condensed tannin (CT)/kg dry matter (DM) and 8 g bound CT/kg DM was fed at hourly intervals to sheep held in metabolism cages to study the effects of CT on nutrient digestion and on metabolism of methionine, cystine and inorganic sulphate in plasma. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was continuously infused into the rumen of half the sheep to remove the effects of CT. Principal measurements in the two groups were plasma irreversible loss (IRL) rate and interconversions of methionine, cystine and inorganic sulphate using 35S labelling. CT in Lotus corniculatus had no effects on the apparent digestion of cellulose and minerals, slightly depressed DM, organic matter and hemicellulose digestion and markedly reduced the apparent digestion of N (P < 0.01). The concentration of NH3 and molar proportions of iso-butyric acid, iso-valeric acid and n-valeric acid in rumen fluid were markedly increased by the PEG infusion (P < 0.01), whereas total volatile fatty acid concentration and molar proportions of acetic acid, propionic acid and n-butyric acid were not affected. PEG infusion temporarily increased rumen protozoa numbers. CT greatly increased the IRL of plasma cystine (13.1 v. 7.0 micromole/min; P < 0.05) and reduced IRL of plasma inorganic sulphate (36.8 v. 48.1 micromole/min; P < 0.01) but had no effect on methionine IRL. CT increased transulphuration of methionine to cystine (4.37 v. 1.24 micromole/min; P < 0.05), increased cystine entering the plasma from whole-body protein turnover plus absorption from the small intestine (9.34 v. 5.75 micromole/min; P < 0.05) and increased cystine flux to body synthetic reactions (11.89 v. 5.41 micromole/min; P < 0.05). CT had no effect on the proportion of methionine total flux transferred to sulphate (0.05 v. 0.06; P < 0.05), reduced the proportion of methionine flux transferred to body synthetic reactions (0.68 v. 0.86) and markedly reduced the proportion of cystine flux transferred to sulphate (0.09 v. 0.27; P < 0.01). It was concluded that CT in Lotus corniculatus reduced rumen protein degradation and markedly increased utilization of plasma cystine for body synthetic reactions. 3arumen fluids 3ametabolism 3asulfates 3asheep 3amodels 3ablood plasma 3afeces 3atannins 3apolyethylene 3amethionine 3afeed intake 3apolyethylene glycol 3akinetics 3adigestibility 3aLotus corniculatus 3aanimal feeding 3acysteine 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCystinexblood 2aDigestion 2aFabaceaexmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aMale 2aMethioninexblood 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPolyethylene Glycols 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSheepxblood 2aSulfatesxblood 2aTanninsxmetabolism 0ainfusion 0aamino acids1 aWaghorn, G.C.1 aBarry, T.N.1 aShelton, I.D.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1994 Dec., v. 72, no. 6 p.923-935x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02426naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245015100155300001600306500002400322520121200346650001701558650002001575650001201595650002001607650002101627650002601648650001901674650003001693650003701723650001701760650000901777650001601786650001301802700002001815700001701835700002401852773009301876852000901969856003801978655001202016IND4438014620221122131406.0100604s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443801462DNAL7 a10.1071/CP093092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifi, Peyman10aGenetic main effect and genotype × environment interaction for cooking quality traits in a diallel set of Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties  ap. 475-482.  aIncludes references  aGenetic main effects and genotype×environment (GE) interactions were determined for cooking quality traits of rice (Oryza sativa L.) using a complete diallel cross of seven. The field experiments were carried out over 2 years as a randomised complete block design with two replications. Amylose content (AC), gel consistency (GC) and gelatinisation temperature (GT) were affected by both genetic effects and GE interaction. Grain elongation (GEL) was found to be controlled by genetic main effects and general combining ability (GCA)×environment interaction. The high magnitude of GCA variances for all traits indicated that additive effects were more prominent in the determination of these characteristics. Narrow-sense heritabilities for AC, GT, GC and GEL were 61.21, 60.83, 29.98 and 52.29%, respectively. Among the genetic and GE interaction effects, GCA and GCA×environment were the main components for all traits. Relatively large narrow-sense heritabilities for AC, GT and GEL indicated that selection for these traits could be possible. However, due to the significance of genotype×year effects for AC, GT, and GEL genetic materials should be evaluated over several years in breeding programs. 3aOryza sativa 3aadditive effect 3aamylose 3acooking quality 3adiallel analysis 3afield experimentation 3agelatinization 3ageneral combining ability 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aheritability 3arice 3atemperature 3avariance1 aDehghani, Hamid1 aMoumeni, Ali1 aMoghaddam, Mohammad0 tCrop & pasture science.g2010, v. 61, no. 6 p.475-482dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP09309 7aarticle04224naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245017600143300001600319500001500335520225200350650002002602650001102622650001602633650002002649650002202669650001002691650001802701650001202719650002302731650001402754650002302768650001602791650001802807650001902825650000902844650000902853650001202862650001602874650005902890650001102949650002602960650002202986650006103008650003403069650003303103650001503136650001403151650002503165650000903190650002503199650001703224653002203241653002303263653001603286653001803302653002103320700001703341700001603358773008603374852000903460930003303469945001303502946001103515655001203526IND2053859420221122073010.0961104e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205385942DNAL7 a78270042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPine, A.P.10aMaternal protein reserves and their influence on lactational performance in rats. 4. Tissue protein synthesis and turnover associated with mobilization of maternal protein  ap. 831-844.  a2019-12-05  aThe present study was undertaken to investigate the changes in muscle protein turnover involved in the rapid mobilization of protein in rats subjected to severe protein restriction during lactation. Estimates of mammary gland and liver protein synthesis were also made during lactation. Multiparous female Sprague-Dawley rats, caged individually following mating, were offered a high-protein diet (H; 215 g crude protein (N X 6.25; CP)/kg dry matter (DM)) ad lib. until parturition. Following parturition, half the females continued to receive diet H, whilst the remainder were offered a diet low in protein (L; 90 g CP/kg DM) ad lib. On days 2, 4, 8 and 12 of lactation, groups of females were used in the estimation of tissue protein synthesis (flooding dose of [3H]phenylalanine) immediately after a milk sample had been obtained. Rates of muscle protein synthesis were unchanged during lactation in group H. The feeding of diet L during lactation reduced the muscle protein synthesis on day 12 to rates that were lower than group II and also the rate on diet L on day 2 (P < 0.01). However, this fall in muscle protein synthesis was not rapid and muscle fractional synthesis rate (FSR) was different from group H only from day 8 (P < 0.05). Estimated rates of mammary protein synthesis appeared to be generally unchanged by dietary treatment or stage of lactation. Liver FSR was also unchanged by dietary protein supply or stage of lactation. The effect of dietary protein restriction on liver size and protein content during lactation influenced liver absolute synthesis rate (ASR), and on days 8 and 12 of lactation liver ASR was lower in group L than in group H (P < 0.001). The loss of muscle protein in rats fed on diet L during lactation (133 mg) occurred mainly between days 2 and 8 of lactation and was primarily associated with a dramatic increase in degradation (13.0% per d), with the decline in synthesis having a much smaller role. A decline in muscle protein degradation during the latter half of lactation was part of the mechanism that prevented excessive muscle protein catabolism. It is thought that the estimation of mammary protein synthesis in the present study was impaired by the milk sampling procedure previously used. 3anutrient intake 3aweight 3aweight gain 3adietary protein 3aprotein synthesis 3aliver 3alitter weight 3amuscles 3aexperimental diets 3alactation 3amaternal nutrition 3afeed intake 3aanimal models 3amammary glands 3arats 3apups 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMammary Glands, Animalxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aMuscle Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aMusclesxanatomy & histology 2aOrgan Size 2aPregnancy 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTime Factors 0alactating females 0aprotein metabolism 0acomposition 0aweight losses 0aprotein turnover1 aJessop, N.S.1 aAllan, G.F.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1994 Dec., v. 72, no. 6 p.831-844x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02205naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245005800147300001400205520101400219650000901233650001101242650001801253650001701271650000901288650001101297650001801308650002201326650001201348650005101360650004201411650001301453650001101466650001801477650002101495650000901516650000901525650001001534650001201544653002801556700001901584773007701603852000901680939003301689946001301722655001201735IND9201202120221122072917.0920306e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920120212DNAL7 a22362812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRockwood, G.A.10aHigh-fat diet preference in developing and adult rats  ap. 79-82.  aDiet preference tests in rats have yielded equivocal results, as some investigators have reported a strong preference for diets high in fat over those containing less fat, while others have failed to see this preference. To further explore this unresolved problem, two diet preference experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, adult rats were maintained for at least three months on one of three powdered diets (control, high-carbohydrate or high-fat), Rats were then given a preference test with all three diets available. Animals from each group overwhelmingly preferred the high-fat diet. To determine whether this preference was also present in younger, developing rats, in Experiment 2, weanling animals were tested with the same three diets as in Experiment 1. As observed with adult animals, weanling rats also showed a strong preference for the high-fat diet. The idea that rats prefer a diet with a relatively high level of fat is supported. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed. 3adiet 3alipids 3acarbohydrates 3afood choices 3arats 3aadults 3ayoung animals 2aAgingxpsychology 2aAnimals 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDrinking 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFood Preferences 2aMale 2aRats 2aTaste 2aWeaning 0ahigh-carbohydrate diets1 aBhathena, S.J.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g1990 July, v. 48, no. 1 p.79-82x0031-93847nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02741naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007500146300001400221520137500235650000901610650001501619650001701634650002101651650001201672650001301684650001001697650001201707650004101719650003701760650001101797650001101808650002801819650000901847650002301856650001201879650005601891650002001947650003201967651001601999653002502015653001202040700001602052700001802068773009402086852000902180939003302189946001302222655001202235IND9201201020221122072943.0920305s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920120102DNAL7 a23810222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElliott, G.S.10aStudies on the pharmacokinetics and mutagenic potential of rhodamine B  ap. 45-59.  aRhodamine B is used as a marker dye in herbicide sprays. There is evidence that spray operators and others may absorb rhodamine B through the skin. This study was undertaken to investigate the in vivo mutagenicity of rhodamine B, to compare the in vitro mutagenicity of two commercial preparations of the dye with that of known mutagens including rhodamine 6G and to elucidate the pharmacokinetics of rhodamine B in the rabbit. Following the i.v. treatment of adult female New Zealand White rabbits with rhodamine B (1 mg/kg body wt), the plasma concentration of rhodamine B decreased rapidly and was accompanied by the appearance of at least four fluorescent polar metabolites. These metabolites, as well as a very small amount of rhodamine B, were also present in the urine which, when tested in the Ames assay was not significantly mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 either with or without metabolic activation. Urine from a human subject who had been contaminated with marker dye was also non-mutagenic. Both commercial preparations of rhodamine B were found to be weakly mutagenic, using the same assay system. It is concluded that while appropriate hygiene measures should be exercised by users of products containing this dye, the results do not support the hypothesis that rhodamine B is a genotoxic hazard in the mammalian organism. 3adyes 3aherbicides 3amutagenicity 3apharmacokinetics 3arabbits 3aspraying 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aMale 2aMutagenicity Tests 2aRabbits 2aRhodaminesxmetabolismxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aSkin Absorption 2aXanthenesxpharmacokinetics 3aNew Zealand 0aoccupational hazards 0amarkers1 aMason, R.W.1 aEdwards, I.R.0 tJournal of toxicology : clinical toxicology.g1990, v. 28, no. 1 p.45-59x0731-38107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01590naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007900144300001600223520034000239650002800579650001000607650001500617650001900632650001600651650002000667650002600687650004700713650002800760650002900788650002600817650001700843650002400860650002300884650002700907650002600934653001500960653002900975700001801004773006901022852000901091939003301100946001101133655001201144IND9201199720221122073016.0920309e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920119972DNAL7 a22199552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalajee, S.10aDissimilation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid by Azotobacter chroococcum  ap. 607-617.  aA strain of Azotobacter chroococcum which could use 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as sole carbon source was isolated.

  1 aDeNardo, J.C.10aStormwater mitigation and surface temperature reduction by green roofs  ap. 1491-1496.  a2019-12-05  aGreen roofs on small 1.8 by 2.4 m buildings consisting of a conventional flat roof covering, a root barrier, a 12 mm thick Enka drainage layer, 89 mm of growth medium, 25 mm of porous expanded polypropylene (PEPP), and Sedum spurium planted 76 mm on center were evaluated to determine their potential to reduce stormwater impacts and roof surface temperatures. Hydrology data were collected from three replicate buildings with experimental green roofs, and roof surface temperatures were collected from both green and conventional roofs, each with a 1:12 slope. The green roof media had an average porosity of 55 m3 m(-3) and a field capacity of 34 m3 m(-3). Rain and roof runoff data collected from seven rains during October and November 2002 showed that the green roofs delayed the start of runoff an average of 5.7 h. The green roofs retained an average of 45% (range 19% to 98%) of the rain from the seven storms evaluated and delayed the peak runoff by 2 h. Roof temperature data collected between April 2002 and February 2003 showed that the green roof maximum surface temperatures averaged 6 degrees C higher in the winter and more than 19 degrees C lower in the summer. The differences between the average maximum diurnal temperature change at the roof surface averaged 19 degrees C during the cooling season (August and September) and 8 degrees C during the heating season (October to February). 3aplant growth 3astormwater management 3astormwater 3asurface temperature 3abuildings 3aSedum 3aPennsylvania 0avegetation covered roofs 0aSedium spurium 0aroofs 0aroof surface temperature1 aJarrett, A.R.1 aManbeck, H.B.1 aBeattie, D.J.1 aBerghage, R.D.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 4 p.1491-1496x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060407b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/19  aOther US 7aarticle02916naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245007000148300001600218500001500234520125000249650002101499650002101520650000801541650001601549650000901565650002001574650001201594650001101606650001001617650001001627650002601637650001101663650001201674650002101686650001001707650001201717650002801729650002501757650001101782650001101793650002601804650000901830650000901839650003101848650002201879650001001901650002101911650002301932653001001955653001601965653001801981653002101999653002302020653001102043700001802054700001802072773008602090852000902176930003302185945001302218946001102231655001202242IND2053860220221122063256.0961104e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205386022DNAL7 a78270072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetterson, D.S.10aAbsorption of zinc from lupin (Lupinus angustifolius)-based foods  ap. 865-871.  a2019-12-05  aThe absorption of Zn from a lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) milk fortified with Ca, a bread containing lupin flour (230 g/kg), a sauce containing lupin flour and a sauce containing a lupin-protein isolate was determined in humans by measuring the whole-body retention of radioisotope from meals labelled with 0.02 MBq 65Zn, allowing for endogenous excretion of Zn, after 14 d. The absorption of Zn from the Ca-enriched milk (16.2%) and the bread made with lupin flour (27.0%) was similar to literature figures for comparable soya-bean products. The absorption from composite meals made with lupin flour (28.2%) and protein isolate (32.7%) was significantly higher than that reported for comparable soya-bean products. In a second experiment the absorption of Zn from a lupin-milk base and a soya-bean-milk base was compared with that from Ca-supplemented bases. The absorption of Zn from the lupin-milk base (26.3%) was significantly higher than from the soya-bean-milk base (17.6%), and neither was significantly altered by the addition of Ca. Overall the absorption of Zn from lupin-protein foods was found to be higher than from comparable soya-bean products. Lupin milk could be an attractive alternative to soya-bean milk for infant formulas. 3aprotein isolates 3anutrient content 3amen 3ablood serum 3azinc 3abioavailability 3acalcium 3asauces 3awomen 3aflour 3aintestinal absorption 3abreads 3asoymilk 3afood consumption 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aFabaceaexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aMale 2aMilk 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aSeeds 2aZincxmetabolism 2aZinc Radioisotopes 0ameals 0acomparisons 0afortification 0amilk substitutes 0amineral absorption 0alupins1 aSandstrom, B.1 aCederblad, A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1994 Dec., v. 72, no. 6 p.865-871x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02044naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245011600163300001800279520101900297650001501316650001601331650001301347650002101360650001401381650001301395650002501408653001401433653002301447653002401470700001601494773008001510852000901590930003301599945002501632946001301657655001201670IND4376394920221122044032.0051201e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437639492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Pneumatic conveying and cleaning systems were developed for the device based on dilute-phase design principles. Also presented is a structured approach for using dilute-phase pneumatic design principles to solve conveying and cleaning problems associated with soybean harvesting. The device threshed standing uncut soybean plants with an array of plastic fingers fixed to counter-rotating shafts. The threshed materials were initially pneumatically cleaned and then pneumatically conveyed to a grain tank. The collection system captured 85% of the threshed beans. A two-stage cleaning system was incorporated to remove the material-other-than-grain (MOG) before the grain reached the grain tank. Over 95% of the MOG, excluding soybean stalks, was removed in the first stage of the cleaning system. The second stage of the cleaning system further removed the chaff from the grain. The average efficiency of the conveying system was 92%. 3aharvesters 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aequipment design 3aconveyors 3acleaning 3aparts and components 0athreshing 0apneumatic cleaning 0apneumatic conveying1 aHanna, M.A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 5 p.1681-1688x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle01843naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245007700160300001800237520091900255650003501174650001301209650001001222650001101232650002101243650001801264653001901282653001401301700001801315773008001333852000901413930003301422945002501455946001301480655001201493IND4376394820221122043956.0051201e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437639482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Italica) seed pelleting was conducted in a 143 mm diameter conventional spouted bed granulator. The influence of initial seed size and seed condition (naked and pelleted seed) on germination is discussed. The experiments followed a mixed design of two and three factors, and the results were analyzed using response surface methodology. The pelleting process was carried out with broccoli seeds sorted by size using sieves with openings of 2.00, 1.68 and 1.48 mm. The naked and pelleted seeds for each size class were evaluated considering the germination capacity. The results did not show significant differences in germination capacity between pelleted and non-pelleted seeds for seeds of the same size class. Naked and pelleted seeds with initial sizes larger than 1.68 mm were the most representative and displayed the highest physiological quality. 3aBrassica oleracea var. italica 3abroccoli 3aseeds 3asowing 3aseed germination 3aparticle size 0apelleted seeds 0apelleting1 aTaranto, O.P.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 5 p.1677-1680x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060130b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle02700naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001600169245010200185300001400287500002300301520121000324650002701534650002701561650001801588650002201606650001401628650001601642650002101658650001301679650002301692650001601715650001501731650001101746650002701757650001601784650001901800651001101819653003001830700001801860700001301878700001701891700001601908773009301924852000902017856007502026930003302101945002502134946001102159655001202170IND4369714320221122044101.0050509e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436971432DNAL7 a10.1139/x04-1502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Bref. s. lato causes severe damage to forests. This study describes a model for simulating the infection and spread of Heterobasidion spp. in stands of Picea abies (L.) Karst. and Pinus sylvestris L. The model includes submodels for stand dynamics (plot simulation, growth and yield, and cross-cutting of trees) and disease dynamics: (i) spore infection, (ii) stump colonization, (iii) colonization of stump roots, (iv) vegetative transfer to tree roots, (v) spread of disease in tree roots, (vi) spread of decay in stems, and (vii) disease effect on tree growth and survival. To illustrate the model, a simulation was carried out on a Swedish Norway spruce stand where logging occurred during the high-risk season for spore infection. The model provides a means of incorporating the impact of root disease into forest planning. A change of parameters indicated that model predictions were sensitive to the spread rate and presence of initial disease centers. Further research is called for in areas related to the development of coarse root systems of various tree species and the probability and rate of transfer of disease from various sources of inoculum to healthy trees. 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3aforest stands 3asimulation models 3aequations 3aPicea abies 3aPinus sylvestris 3aconifers 3aconiferous forests 3adecay fungi 3aprediction 3astumps 3amicrobial colonization 3atree growth 3atree mortality 3aSweden 0aHeterobasidion parviporum1 aMoykkynen, T.1 aThor, M.1 aRonnberg, J.1 aStenlid, J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.74-84x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x04-1503Available from publisher's Web site  a20060525b20060607c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02844naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245010200161300001800263520164800281650001501929650002901944650002701973650001402000650001202014650001302026650001902039650002002058650001502078650001302093650001902106650001802125650002202143650002002165700001602185700001802201700001902219773008002238852000902318930003302327945002502360946001302385655001202398IND4376395420221122033557.0051201e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437639542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGaskin, J.W.10aEvaluating onsite beneficial reuse of ground engineered wood wastes from residential construction  ap. 1731-1738.  aWood wastes from residential construction can be potentially reused onsite as mulches. Engineered wood products (EWP) are estimated to comprise about 30% of residential construction wood waste. Due to the presence of various adhesives, there is concern about the beneficial reuse of these materials. We evaluated potential environmental impacts of mulches with a ground EWP component. No hazardous levels of constituents were found using a toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). Changes in runoff water quality and soil chemistry below the mulch were evaluated through rainfall simulation on 0.9 x 4.6 m test plots using four treatments: bare soil control, 100% dimension lumber, typical residential mix of wood wastes, and 100% structural EWPs. A companion study evaluated the effect of the 100% EWP and the typical residential mix mulches on the growth of common landscaping plants. No purgeable halocarbons, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, or phenols were detected in runoff. Nutrient concentrations in runoff from the freshly ground wood treatments ranged from 0.5 to 8.19 mg L(-1) for total nitrogen and 0.13 to 0.21 mg L(-1) for total phosphorus. The freshly ground 100% EWP treatment had the highest total nitrogen concentrations in runoff (8.19 mg L(-1)). Biochemical oxygen demand was similar for all freshly ground wood treatments, ranging from 155 to 273 mg L(-1). These concentrations decreased by an order of magnitude after one year. There were no significant impacts on the growth of three common landscaping plants. Results indicate that these wood wastes can be beneficially reused rather than landfilled. 3awaste wood 3aengineered wood products 3aconstruction materials 3aadhesives 3amulches 3amulching 3asoil pollution 3awater pollution 3apollutants 3aleaching 3asoil chemistry 3aphytotoxicity 3aornamental plants 3arisk assessment1 aRisse, L.M.1 aKastner, J.R.1 aMcLaurin, W.J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 5 p.1731-1738x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060131b20060202c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/01/30  aOther US 7aarticle02787naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245007400178300001800252500001500270520161900285650002301904650002101927650002401948650002701972650001701999650001302016650002102029650001502050650001802065650002402083651001302107653003002120653002702150700001602177773008002193852000902273930003302282945002502315946001302340655001202353IND4376395820221122033605.0051201e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437639582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJesiek, J.B.10aSensitivity analysis of the Virginia phosphorus index management tool  ap. 1773-1781.  a2019-12-05  aThe phosphorus index (P-Index) is a risk assessment and management tool to aid in reducing the risk to water quality due to movement of excess phosphorus (P) from fields. An allowable P application rate is specified based on the computed risk. This study focused on the Virginia P-Index. The objectives were to determine the factors to which the P-Index is most sensitive and to determine the factors to which the resulting P application rate recommendations are most sensitive. A differential analysis was used to calculate relative sensitivity for nine baseline scenarios: a low, medium, and high baseline within three different regions of Virginia. Impact of user variability in estimating factor values was evaluated using a probability distribution analysis. The P-Index was most sensitive in the low and medium baseline scenarios to P management factors, including annual application rate, method of fertilizer application, and source availability factor. In high-risk baseline scenarios, the P-Index was most sensitive to transport factors (erosion, runoff, or leaching). User variability had a greater impact on the P-Index and on P application rate recommendations as P risk increased over each of the three regions. The closer a field's P-Index value is to a threshold between P recommendation rate categories, the higher the probability that alternate P application rates will be recommended due to user variability. The results highlight the need for consistent estimation of factor values, particularly the factors to which the P-Index is most sensitive and particularly in the higher-risk situations. 3aagricultural soils 3afertilizer rates 3aagricultural runoff 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arisk factors 3aleaching 3alosses from soil 3aphosphorus 3awater erosion 3anutrient management 3aVirginia 0aVirginia phosphorus index 0afertilizer application1 aWolfe, M.L.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 5 p.1773-1781x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060202b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/01  aOther US 7aarticle02367naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245015600146300001600302500001500318520087200333650001001205650002301215650002301238650001101261650002001272650002401292650002401316650001201340650001101352650002401363650001301387650002801400650002501428650003101453650002201484650006501506650002601571650003501597653001701632653001501649700001701664700001901681700001501700773009301715852000901808939003301817946001101850655001201861IND9201198220221122020243.0920306e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920119822DNAL7 a22918132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDryjanski, M.10aSerine proteinase from Cucurbita ficifolia seed; purification, properties, substrate specificity and action on native squash trypsin inhibitor (CMTI I)  ap. 889-895.  a2019-12-04  aA proteinase was purified from resting seeds of Cucurbita ficifolia by ammonium sulfate fractionation and successive chromatography on CM-cellulose, (Sephacryl) S-300 and TSK DEAE-2SW (HPLC) columns. Inhibition by DFP and PMSF suggests that the enzyme is a serine proteinase. The apparent molecular mass of this enzyme is ca. 77 kDa. The optimum activity for hydrolysis of casein and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA is around pH 10.5. The following peptide bonds in the oxidized insulin B-chain were hydrolysed by the proteinase: Phe1-Val2, Asn3-Gln4, Gln4-His5, Cya7-Gly8, Glu13-Ala14, Ala14-Leu15, Cya19-Gly20, Pro28-Lys29 and Lys29-Ala30. The proteinase is more selective towards the native squash seed trypsin inhibitor (CMTII) and primarily cuts off only its N-terminal arginine. The inhibitor devoided of the N-terminal arginine residue is still active against trypsin. 3aseeds 3aserine proteinases 3atrypsin inhibitors 3acasein 3aenzyme activity 3aCucurbita ficifolia 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptidesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSeedsxenzymology 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxmetabolism 0apurification 0asubstrates1 aOtlewski, J.1 aPolanowski, A.1 aWilusz, T.0 tBiological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler.g1990 Sept., v. 371, no. 9 p.889-895x0177-35937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01637naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001200127245011500139300001800254500001500272520061900287650001100906650001100917650002300928650001100951650001500962650001100977653001200988653002001000653001901020653001901039653001701058700001601075773008001091852000901171930003301180945002501213946001301238655001201251IND4374119720221122020623.0050909e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437411972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Ten citrus trees with different foliage densities were scanned by the laser system, and the calculated results were compared with the corresponding visual assessments of tree densities. Overall, laser measurements and visual assessments had a good correlation (R2 = 0.96; RMSE = 6.1%). Laser density measurements also had a good repeatability, with an average coefficient of variation of less than 3%. 3acanopy 3alasers 3aanalytical methods 3aCitrus 3aalgorithms 3aleaves 0asensors 0afoliage density 0alaser scanners 0alaser scanning 0aleaf density1 aSalyani, M.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 4 p.1595-1601x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060407b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/19  aOther US 7aarticle02325naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245008000163300001800243500001500261520121800276650001601494650002201510650001101532650001701543650001601560653001101576653002401587653002401611653002301635653001301658700001801671700001801689700001901707700001701726773008001743852000901823930003301832945002501865946001301890655001201903IND4374119920221122020820.0050909e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437411992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAnderson, I.P.13aAn autonomous forest robot that uses a hierarchical, fuzzy logic controller  ap. 1603-1617.  a2019-12-05  aThis article presents a hierarchical fuzzy logic controller that arbitrates recommendations from lower-level modules in order to autonomously guide a robot down forest trails. This robot would be used to move logs or trees from where they are cut to a location where they could be further processed or loaded onto trucks. The lower-level modules contribute recommendations derived from lower-level tasks or behaviors. Each lower-level module provides its own recommendation based on its limited perception of the environment. A fuzzy quality measure is used by the hierarchical controller to determine how best to fuse the individual control recommendations of lower-level modules. The quality measure provides an approximate determination of the value of each lower-level module recommendation. These quality measures, as well as other fuzzy sets used in the controller, were defined with a set of parameters. A computer simulation was used to tune subsets of the fuzzy set parameters to improve the performance of the controller. After these parameters were tuned, they were used in the fuzzy logic controller, which was tested in a vehicle. The results of these vehicle tests are also discussed in the article. 3afuzzy logic 3acomputer analysis 3arobots 3aforest roads 3acontrollers 0atrails 0acomputer simulation 0aautonomous vehicles 0aforest engineering 0avehicles1 aCarlson, A.C.1 aEdwards, D.B.1 aAnderson, M.J.1 aFeeley, J.J.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 4 p.1603-1617x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20060407b20060529c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/09/19  aOther US 7aarticle02420naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245005000177300001600227520129400243650001701537650002601554650002001580650002001600650001601620650001301636650000901649650002201658650001001680650001601690650001301706650001801719651001301737653002801750700002001778700001801798773007801816852000901894930003301903945002501936946001301961655001201974IND4372611920221122001326.0050721e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437261192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWells, L.G.10aCrop yield response to precision deep tillage  ap. 895-901.  aExperimental precision deep tillage was applied at three sites in central Kentucky with relatively well-drained silt loam soils in no-till crop production. Fields were divided into 0.4 ha (1 ac) grid cells using DGPS mapping. Assessment of soil compaction by machinery traffic was made using multiple soil cone penetrometer measurements and expressed as cone index (CI). Corn, wheat, and soybean yields were depressed in grid cells with CI(avg) greater than or equal to 1.5 MPa (218 psi) prior to application of tillage treatments at sites 1 and 3, whereas at site 2, where most of the highest average CI values ranged from 1.44 to 1.49 MPa (209 to 216 psi), the opposite was true. In general, deep tillage resulted in yield improvement in compacted grid cells relative to those receiving no deep tillage; however, differences were significant at the 10% level in only two of six instances. Cells tilled to 40 cm generally had higher yields than cells tilled only to the depth at which CI(avg) greater than or equal to 1.5 MPa (218 psi) (precision deep tillage) at sites 1 and 3. However, the opposite was true for double-crop soybean subjected to limited rainfall. At site 2, tilled cells had higher yields than non-tilled cells, with precision tillage showing the maximum relative yield. 3adeep tillage 3aprecision agriculture 3asilt loam soils 3asoil compaction 3agrain yield 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3asoil strength 3aKentucky 0aprecission deep tillage1 aStombaugh, T.S.1 aShearer, S.A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 3 p.895-901x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050914b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/08  aOther US 7aarticle03223naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001800176245007800194300001400272500002400286500001500310520134600325650001601671650001701687650001401704650002301718650001301741650001801754650003801772650001501810650002201825650002001847650001201867650003301879650004701912650005001959650002202009650001302031650002302044650004602067650003102113650002702144650004202171650003202213651001302245653001402258700001702272700003502289700002402324773009502348852000902443856008802452930003302540945002502573946001102598655001202609IND4434568720221121230737.0100326e20100419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443456872DNAL7 a200833552pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aSousa, Susana10aSerotyping of naturally Toxoplasma gondii infected meat-producing animals  ap. 24-28.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSerotyping was previously described as a promising method for typing strains of Toxoplasma gondii. The majority of precedent studies utilized serum samples collected from human patients with different T. gondii-associated pathologies. The aim of this work was to study the applicability of the same procedure for serotyping naturally infected meat-producing animals. An ELISA test based on GRA6 and GRA7 C-terminal polymorphic peptides was used. Peptide GRA6II has polymorphisms specific for the archetypal strains type II, GRA6I/III for strains type I and III, GRA7I for strains type I and GRA7III for strains type III. As reference material, and to validate this approach, serum samples from eleven free-range chickens and fifteen pigs used for Toxoplasma genotypes isolation were selected. These strains integrate the Biological Resource Centre (BRC) ToxoBS Bank. Three serum samples from chickens and two from pigs had serotyping results in agreement with genotyping. Thirty-five serum samples from chickens, twenty-nine from pigs and fifty from sheep, seropositive for T. gondii, from which no isolate was obtained, were also serotyped. Serotype III appeared significantly more frequent among sheep. Our results show that serotyping still need refinement, but may become a valuable tool for typing Toxoplasma strains from animal origin. 3ablood serum 3afood animals 3aserotypes 3astrain differences 3apeptides 3atoxoplasmosis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene banks 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aAntigens, Protozoanxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFood Parasitology 2aGenotype 2aMeatxparasitology 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSerotypingxveterinary 2aToxoplasmaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aToxoplasmosisxparasitology 0aPortugal 0aisolation1 aCanada, Nuno1 aCorreia da Costa, José Manuel1 aDardé, Marie-Laure0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2010 Apr. 19, v. 169, no. 1-2 p.24-28dElsevierx0304-40177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.12.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/05/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03051naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245009700173300001600270520164900286650002501935650002501960650001501985650001202000650002302012650002602035650001202061650002502073650002202098650001302120650001802133650001402151650002402165650001102189650001402200651000902214653002702223653004202250653002202292700002302314773010602337852000902443856008502452930003302537946001102570655001202581IND4441882720221120214343.0100827e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444188272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-010-9749-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristensen, Deanna L. 10aPopulation dynamics of goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) in the core of its historical range  ap. 195-211.  aGoldenseal, Hydrastis canadensis L. (Ranunculaceae), is a perennial woodland herb of eastern North America harvested for the medicinal properties of its rhizome. Although listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species, little is known of its population dynamics in the core of its historical range. We investigated the demography of wild populations at three forest interior sites in Ohio, including both sexual and asexual reproduction, in order to model population dynamics in the core of its historical range. We recognized six life history stages, and parameterized stage-structured (Lefkovich) transition matrices for each population. Marked individuals were monitored and field experiments were conducted to characterize and quantify seed dormancy, seedling establishment, and vegetative reproduction. We found seedling recruitment to be more common than suggested by previous studies, but less common than vegetative reproduction, and less important to projected population growth. The finite rate of increase, λ, was greater than 1 for each population based on transition matrices for 1998-1999, but much less than 1 for two populations (and ≈1 for the third) based on 1999-2000 matrices. This reduction in λ appears due to lower survival and growth of established (non-seedling) plants, which may have been due to drought in spring 1999. In both year-to-year transitions, fertile plants typically regressed to the large sterile stage. This research provides a basis for exploring the effects of different harvest strategies on the population dynamics of H. canadensis, enabling assessment of sustainability. 3aHydrastis canadensis 3aasexual reproduction 3ademography 3adrought 3aendangered species 3afield experimentation 3aforests 3amedicinal properties 3apopulation growth 3arhizomes 3aseed dormancy 3aseedlings 3aspecies recruitment 3aspring 3awoodlands 3aOhio 0aSeedling establishment 0aSexual versus vegetative reproduction 0aTransition matrix1 aGorchov, David L. 0 tPlant ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 210, no. 2 p.195-211dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-010-9749-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100827b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02729naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245012100148300001600269500001500285520103000300650001501330650001901345650001701364650001601381650001401397650001301411650001501424650002501439650002001464650001301484650001501497650001001512650000901522650002201531650003301553650002701586650002801613650001201641650003401653650001101687650002501698650001101723650002101734650000901755650001601764650002501780650002501805650002401830653001501854653002101869700001701890700001801907700001501925773008501940852000902025930003302034945001302067946001102080655001202091IND2053588420221120214340.0961017e199305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205358842DNAL7 a83293402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutcliffe, J.F.10aNew and simple equations to estimate the energy and fat contents and energy density of humans in sickness and health  ap. 631-644.  a2019-12-05  aTwo formulas were derived to estimate the energy content of the human body which use only body mass, total body water by 3H2O dilution space and body minerals assessed by anthropometry.

Body glycogen was assumed to be 14-6% of the mineral component. Body fat was obtained by difference, body mass less the sum of water, protein, minerals and glycogen. The standard deviation in the estimate of body energy content was 30 MJ or 4.1% of the energy content of reference man. Two formulas for body energy content were derived by regression with body mass, total body water and body minerals or height.

In addition, we explored how often physicians referred their patients to health-related Internet sites. We sent a questionnaire to all the rheumatologists and oncologists in the Netherlands. The questionnaire included questions concerning demographics, experiences with patients' health-related Internet use, referral behavior, and attitudes to the consequences of patients' health-related Internet use (for patients themselves, the physician-patient relationship and the health care). The response rate was 46% (N = 238). Of these respondents, 134 practiced as a rheumatologist and 104 as an oncologist. Almost all physicians encountered their patients raising information from the Internet during a consultation. They were not, however, confronted with their patients' health-related Internet use on a daily basis. Physicians had a moderately positive attitude towards the consequences of patients' health-related Internet use, the physician-patient relationship and the health care. Oncologists were significantly less positive than rheumatologists about the consequences of health-related Internet use. Most of the physicians had never (32%) or only sometimes (42%) referred a patient to a health-related Internet site. Most physicians (53%) found it difficult to stay up-to-date with reliable Internet sites for patients. Physicians are moderately positive about their patients' health-related Internet use but only seldom refer them to relevant sites. Offering an up-to-date site with accredited websites for patients might help physicians refer their patients. 3aattitudes and opinions 3aInternet 3apatients 2aAdult 2aCommunication 2aConsumer Health Informationxmethods 2aFemale 2aHealth Educationxmethods 2aHumans 2aInternet 2aMale 2aMedical Oncologyxmethods 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhysician-Patient Relations 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aReferral and Consultation 2aRheumatologyxmethods 0aNetherlands 0aOncologists 0aOnline health information 0aRheumatologists1 aDrossaert, Constance H.

  1 aDehghanisanij, H.14aThe effect of chlorine on emitter clogging induced by algae and protozoa and the performance of drip irrigation  ap. 519-527.  aLimited information exists on the use of chlorine in drip irrigation systems (DIS) to prevent or reduce emitter clogging induced by biological clogging agents (BCAs), such as algae and protozoa (AP), and to enhance the performance of drip irrigation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the impact of AP-induced changes on discharge rate and uniformity from different types of emitters under two management schemes of without (S1) and with (S2) chlorine injection into the irrigation water at the Tohaku irrigation project, Japan. In a field experiment, six types of emitters on each of six laterals in two similar subunits of DIS, for S1 and S2, were assessed for AP-induced emitter discharge performance. The assessment also included different orifice area (OA), with or without a pressure compensation (PC) system, and with or without built-in filtration area (FA) in the emitters. The discharge from emitters increased with chlorine injection into the irrigation water and with increasing OA and FA, but decreased with increasing algae counts. The values for the mean discharge ratio variation (Dra) indicated that the cumulative impact of manufacturing variations (Vm) and that induced by AP and chlorine on emitter discharge was classified as low during the irrigation season when chlorine was injected into the irrigation water (S2). The values for the statistical uniformity coefficient (Uc) were higher than 93% for both S1 and S2, indicating that the uniformity of emitter discharge along a lateral was high. Due to the reduction in emitter discharge induced by AP, the clogging was uniform along a lateral. The values for field performance variation (Vf) along a lateral were in the order S1 > S2 for each emitter. The values were classified low to medium, particularly in PC emitters. 3amicroirrigation 3aemitters (equipment) 3abiofilm 3amicroalgae 3aProtozoa 3adisinfection 3achlorine 3achlorination 3airrigation water 3aJapan 0aemitter clogging1 aYamamoto, T.1 aAhmad, B.O.1 aFujiyama, H.1 aMiyamoto, K.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 2 p.519-527x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/06/15  aOther US 7aarticle03335naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245016800190300001600358500002400374500001500398520123500413650001501648650002601663650001501689650002201704650001001726650002501736650001901761650002801780650001101808650002001819650002201839650001301861650001401874650001901888650001901907650001401926650001901940650001901959650001201978650002601990650002802016650005702044650002602101650002802127650003602155650005502191653001002246700001702256700002502273700003402298700002002332700001802352700002102370700001802391700002502409700002202434700002002456773010902476852000902585856005502594655001202649IND4427690320221120214332.0091023e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442769032DNAL7 a198497872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2009.00585.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, John T.10aIdentification and functional characterization of effectors in expressed sequence tags from various life cycle stages of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida  ap. 815-828.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this article, we describe the analysis of over 9000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cDNA libraries obtained from various life cycle stages of Globodera pallida. We have identified over 50 G. pallida effectors from this dataset using bioinformatics analysis, by screening clones in order to identify secreted proteins up-regulated after the onset of parasitism and using in situ hybridization to confirm the expression in pharyngeal gland cells. A substantial gene family encoding G. pallida SPRYSEC proteins has been identified. The expression of these genes is restricted to the dorsal pharyngeal gland cell. Different members of the SPRYSEC family of proteins from G. pallida show different subcellular localization patterns in plants, with some localized to the cytoplasm and others to the nucleus and nucleolus. Differences in subcellular localization may reflect diverse functional roles for each individual protein or, more likely, variety in the compartmentalization of plant proteins targeted by the nematode. Our data are therefore consistent with the suggestion that the SPRYSEC proteins suppress host defences, as suggested previously, and that they achieve this through interaction with a range of host targets. 3ahost range 3ain situ hybridization 3aparasitism 3acomplementary DNA 3ahosts 3adevelopmental stages 3abioinformatics 3aexpressed sequence tags 3aclones 3agene expression 3aGlobodera pallida 3apotatoes 3acytoplasm 3acDNA libraries 3acell nucleolus 3ascreening 3acyst nematodes 3aplant proteins 2aAnimals 2aComputational Biology 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aHelminth Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSolanum tuberosumxparasitology 2aTylenchoideaxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 0agenes1 aKumar, Amar.1 aPYLYPENKO, LILIYA A.1 aTHIRUGNANASAMBANDAM, AMARNATH1 aCASTELLI, LYDIA1 aCHAPMAN, SEAN1 aCOCK, PETER J.A.1 aGRENIER, ERIC1 aLILLEY, CATHERINE J.1 aPHILLIPS, MARK S.1 aBLOK, VIVIAN C.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2009 Nov., v. 10, no. 6 p.815-828dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2009.00585.x 7aarticle02315naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245011800140300001600258500001500274520115800289650002801447650001701475650002601492650002301518650002201541650002401563650002601587650003001613653001201643653004601655653001801701653002901719700001101748773007801759852000901837930003301846945002501879946001301904655001201917IND4369435720221120214455.0050502e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436943572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSu, X.L.10aSurface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance immunosensors for detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7  ap. 405-413.  a2019-12-05  aSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) techniques have been studied in label-free immunosensors for direct detection of bacteria. However, there is a lack of comparative investigations on SPR and QCM immunosensors. In this study, SPR and QCM immunosensors were compared for their applications in bacterial detection using Escherichia coli O157:H7 as a model pathogen. In both immunosensors, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies were used as capture antibodies and Protein A method was used for antibody immobilization. The stepwise assembly of the immunosensors was characterized by SPR, QCM, and cyclic voltammetry. Both SPR and QCM could detect E. coli O157:H7 in 1 h with detection ranges of 10(5) to 10(8) and 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/mL, respectively. QCM was more sensitive than SPR in terms of both detection limit and signal-to-noise ratio. For both immunosensors, no significant interference was found from brain heart infusion (BHI) broth or Salmonella Typhimurium. The binding efficiency of the QCM immunosensor at 10(5) to 10(8) CFU/mL was found to be 95.9% to 2.9%, decreasing with increasing cell concentration. 3abacterial contamination 3aimmunoassays 3apolyclonal antibodies 3afood contamination 3afood microbiology 3amicrobial detection 3aEscherichia coli O157 3asurface plasmon resonance 0asensors 0aquartz crystal microbalance immunosensors 0aimmunosensors 0aEscherichia coli O157:H71 aLi, Y.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2005 , v. 48, no. 1 p.405-413x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20050828b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/27  aOther US 7aarticle00867naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245003500131300001400166500001500180520012900195650000900324650001000333650001300343653001700356653001700373653001400390773009800404852000900502939003300511945000800544946001300552655001200565991577591520742620221120204354.0820712s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE829209742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, J.M.10aConsumers and the hunger lobby  ap. 68-78.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: This essay will examine the relationship between public interest advocacy groups and the Department of Agriculture. 3aUSDA 3afoods 3afood aid 0adistribution 0aOrganization 0aconsumers0 tProceedings of the Academy of Political Science.g1982, v. 34, no. 3 p.68-78x0065-06847nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19820712c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle02565naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245005300147300001600200520102200216650001401238650002601252650001501278650001701293650002001310650001401330650002501344650001401369650000801383650001601391650002401407650001601431650002501447650001201472650003501484650003601519650001001555650002101565650001101586650001101597650003801608650000901646650002301655650004401678651001501722651001501737653001701752653001601769700002101785700001801806773008501824852000901909930003301918945001301951946001101964655001201975IND2053595020221120214354.0961017e199305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205359502DNAL7 a83293562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Farouk.10aVitamin A absorption in children with ascariasis  ap. 817-825.  aThe effect of Ascaris lumbricoides infection on retinol absorption was investigated in young children from a slum area of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Twenty-four children aged 4-10 years were screened and in every case eggs of either Ascaris, Trichuris or hookworm were isolated from the stool. The average serum retinol was 0.91 (SD 0.35) micromole/l and sixteen children had levels below 1.05 micromole/l. This compared with a serum retinol concentration of 1.70 (SD 0.52) micromole/l in five reference children from a more privileged social background. An oral dose of retinol (41.8 micromole) was given to ten children in whom the concentration of Ascaris eggs in the stool varied. Less than 1% of the supplement could be recovered in the stool collected over the following 48 h. Ascaris worms were isolated from the stool and assayed for retinol content. In no case was retinol detected in the worms. These findings do not support the contention that infection with Ascaris predisposes to malabsorption of vitamin A. 3avitamin A 3aintestinal absorption 3aascariasis 3atrichuriasis 3aschool children 3ahookworms 3aAscaris lumbricoides 3aTrichuris 3aova 3ablood serum 3avitamin supplements 3aurban areas 3asocioeconomic status 2aAnimals 2aAscariasisxbloodxmetabolism. 2aAscaris lumbricoidesxchemistry 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aMale 2aParasite Egg Count 2aVitamin Axanalysisxbloodxmetabolism. 3aBangladesh 0aBangladesh 0ahelminth ova 0ahuman feces1 aMohiduzzaman, M.1 aJackson, A.A.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1993 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.817-825x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03600naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012000163300001300283520224500296650001402541650001602555650001702571650001702588650001702605650001202622650001602634650002102650650002802671650002002699650001402719650001702733650001102750650000702761650001402768650001602782650001402798653001502812653001302827653003102840700001902871700002102890773010002911852000903011856008503020946001303105655001203118IND4446883320221120214449.0101224e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444688332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-010-9096-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Weibing 10aComparison of Insect Gut Cellulase and Xylanase Activity Across Different Insect Species with Distinct Food Sources  ap. 1-10.  aInsect guts represent unique natural biocatalyst systems for biocatalyst discovery and biomass deconstruction mechanism studies. In order to guide the further research for enzyme discovery and biodiversity analysis, we carried out comprehensive xylanase and cellulase activity assays for the gut contents of three insect species representing different orders and food sources. The three insect species are grasshopper (Acrididae sp.), woodborer (Cerambycidae spp.), and silkworm (Bombyx mori) to represent the wood-consuming, grass-consuming, and leaf-consuming insects from Orthoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera orders, respectively. Generally speaking, the enzyme activity assays have shown that the cellulase and xylanase activities for grasshopper and woodborer guts are significantly higher than those of silkworm under various conditions. In addition, both pH and temperature have a significant impact on the enzyme activities in the gut contents. For the grasshopper gut, the means of xylanase and cellulase activities at pH 7 were 3,397 and 404 μM mg⁻¹ min⁻¹, which are significantly higher than the activities at pH 4 and 10 (P < 0.05). However, woodborer guts have shown the highest cellulase activity at pH 10. The results suggested that systems similar to woodborer guts could be good resources for discovering alkaline-tolerant enzymes. Moreover, the enzyme activities in response to different substrate concentrations were also analyzed, which indicated that grasshopper gut had particularly high cellulase activity. The enzyme activities in response to the reaction time were also examined, and we found that the enzyme activities (micromolar per milligram per minute) of different insect gut juices in response to the increase of incubation time fit well to the power function equation (E c = K ⋅ t b ) with high coefficients (r ² > 0.99). The newly developed model serves well to compare the characteristics of the enzyme mixtures among different insect species, which can be applied to other studies of natural biocatalyst systems for the future. Overall, the data indicated that grasshopper and woodborer guts are valuable resources for discovering the novel biocatalysts for various biorefinery applications. 3aAcrididae 3aBombyx mori 3aCerambycidae 3abiocatalysts 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3adigestive system 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3aequations 3agrasshoppers 3ajuices 3apH 3asilkworms 3atemperature 3axylanases 0aInsect gut 0aXylanase 0aNatural biocatalyst system1 aDing, Shi-You 1 aYuan, Joshua S. 0 tBioEnergy research.g2011 Mar., v. 4, no. 1 p.1-10dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1939-12347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-010-9096-03Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02864naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008700142300001600229520135700245650001501602650002701617650002901644650002301673650001601696650001701712650001501729650001201744650001501756650002601771650001101797650001001808650001001818650002801828650001101856650006001867650001101927650001501938650003801953650003701991650003402028653001402062700001802076700001402094700001902108700001602127700001602143773008502159852000902244930003302253945001302286946001102299655001202310IND2053633720221120204351.0961021e199305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205363372DNAL7 a83293572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBower, C.10aAbsorption of pteroylpolyglutamates in mothers of infants with neural tube defects  ap. 827-834.  aThe ability to hydrolyse and absorb pteroylpolyglutamates (PteGlu(n) included in a standard meal in mothers who had defect birth to an infant with a neural tube defect was tested by comparing them with mothers who had not had any infants with this defect. When compared with control mothers working in the research unit in which the study was performed case mothers had significantly lower baseline serum and erythrocyte folate levels, and smaller increases in serum folate following the meal containing PteGlu(n). However, all estimates of folate were similar when case mothers were compared with a group of mothers who were friends of the case mothers. The results show that the higher the baseline levels of serum and erythrocyte folate the greater the increase in serum folate after the test meal. Fitting a model for the serum folate response curve resulted in coefficients which differed significantly between case mothers and all control mothers. We conclude that intestinal hydrolysis of PteGlu(n) taken orally is not impaired in mothers who have had infants with neural tube defects when compared with control mothers with similar baseline folate levels, although the curves describing the response to the meal for the two groups do differ significantly. Further investigation is required to determine the mechanism underlying this difference. 3aglutamates 3acentral nervous system 3acongenital abnormalities 3amaternal nutrition 3ablood serum 3aerythrocytes 3afolic acid 3amothers 3ahydrolysis 3aintestinal absorption 3amodels 3awomen 2aAdult 2aErythrocytesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexbloodxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHydrolysis 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aMetabolism, Inborn Errorsxblood 2aNeural Tube Defectsxetiology 0aresponses1 aStanley, F.J.1 aCroft, M.1 aDe Klerk, N.H.1 aDavis, R.E.1 aNicol, D.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1993 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.827-834x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02981naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245016500148300001600313520133900329650001601668650002101684650002101705650002001726650001801746650002101764650001901785650001501804650001301819650001301832650000701845650002101852650001401873650001101887650001001898650001301908650001401921650003101935650003101966650002001997650002602017650003702043653001702080653001302097653001802110700002202128700002402150700002702174700001902201700002002220773008502240852000902325930003302334945001302367946001102380655001202391IND2053634520221120193550.0961021e199305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205363452DNAL7 a83293592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolters, M.G.E.12aA continuous in vitro method for estimation of the bioavailability of minerals and trace elements in foods: application to breads varying in phytic acid content  ap. 849-861.  aA continuous in vitro method for the estimation of the bioavailability of minerals and trace elements is presented. This in vitro method is believed to be more representative of in vivo physiological conditions than in vitro methods based on equilibrium dialysis, because dialysable components are continuously removed from the pancreatic digestion mixture. The continuous in vitro method is compared with the equilibrium in vitro method with respect to the dialysability of Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu and Zn from eight different types of bread (varying in phytic acid content). The results show a pronounced effect of continuous removal of dialysability components from the pancreatic digestion mixture on the dialysability of minerals and trace elements. Furthermore, removal of dialysable components influences the effect of phytic acid on the bioavailability of minerals and trace elements. For these two reasons the importance of removal of dialysable components in vitro for the estimation of bioavailability in vivo needs further investigation. The bioavailability of minerals and trace elements from bread samples is not related to the phytic acid content only. Therefore, the effect of phytic acid on the bioavailability of minerals and trace elements cannot be studied separately from the effects of other components on bioavailability. 3aphytic acid 3afood composition 3anutrient content 3abioavailability 3afood analysis 3adietary minerals 3atrace elements 3aestimation 3adialysis 3aaccuracy 3apH 3apancreatic juice 3adigestion 3abreads 2aBread 2aDialysis 2aDigestion 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMineralsxpharmacokinetics 2aNutritive Value 2aPhytic Acidxanalysis 2aTrace Elementsxpharmacokinetics 0ainteractions 0ain vitro 0adialysability1 aSchreuder, H.A.W.1 aHeuvel, G. van den.1 aLonkhuijsen, H.J. van.1 aHermus, R.J.J.1 aVoragen, A.G.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1993 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.849-861x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01235naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100001700117245009500134300001400229500001500243520035500258650001100613650003500624650001300659650002400672650001200696650001100708650002200719650002000741653000900761773008900770852000900859939003300868945000800901655001200909991577589320742620221120183709.0780201e197710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799116922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, M.A.10aU. s. palm oil imports: an economic analysis of recent events and prospects for the future  ap. 25-31.  a2019-12-06  aExtract: This article analyzes those events which led to the recent palm oil crisis and discusses the outlook for the U.S. fats and oils industry. specific references to the soybean sector are made. the article also comments on the broader policy dilemma which the U.S. periodically faces as a result of situations such as the recent palm oil crisis. 3aprices 3aeconomic outlook and situation 3asoybeans 3aplant fats and oils 3aimports 3alipids 3aissues and policy 3aeconomic impact 0aoils0 pJ Am Soc Farm Manage Rural Appraisg1977 Oct., v. 41, no. 2 p.25-31x0003-116X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780201c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle01450naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002200117245008800139300001400227500001500241520065500256650001700911650002400928650001600952651001300968653002300981700001701004773008901021852000901110939003301119945000801152655001201160991577589180742620221120183731.0780201e197710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7799116962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJennings-Jr, R.J.10aRegression analysis in estimating land values: a North Central Oklahoma application  ap. 54-61.  a2019-12-06  aExtract: An obvious goal of the appraisal profession is to be objective when estimating value. while standard texts invariably point out that land valuation is not an exact science and that the subjective element must play a major role in the appraisal process they are not clear as to what extent individual judgment and opinion should be used in the process. this paper attempts to present the case for the use of regression analysis in the appraisal process. both shortcomings and advantages of using regression in the appraisal process are enumerated and its application is demonstrated using data from the North Central Oklahoma Farm Sale Study. 3amarket value 3aregression analysis 3aland values 3aOklahoma 0aeconomic valuation1 aKletke, D.D.0 pJ Am Soc Farm Manage Rural Appraisg1977 Oct., v. 41, no. 2 p.54-61x0003-116X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19780201c00000000  aAGE 7aarticle03021naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245016200141300001600303500001500319520117100334650001701505650000901522650001101531650001201542650001201554650002001566650002601586650001301612650002101625650001301646650002001659650002101679650002801700650001201728650003401740650003501774650002301809650002501832650002701857650003101884650003001915650004001945650003301985650000902018650001702027650001702044650004402061653001402105653001602119653002002135653001202155700001902167700001802186700001602204773008502220852000902305930003302314945001302347946001102360655001202371IND2053590520221120183720.0961017e199305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205359052DNAL7 a83293512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTin-Aung14aThe effect of Escherichia coli heat-stable (ST(A)) enterotoxin on in vitro uptake of amino acids by small intestine of sucking rats during fluid accumulation  ap. 757-766.  a2019-12-05  aIn vitro uptake of 14C-labelled amino acids by segments of small intestine was determined in sucking (2-4-d-old) Wistar rats. Intragastric injections of heat-stable (ST) toxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) were given to produce fluid accumulation, defined as a gut weight:carcass weight value of > 0.085. Continued active uptake of the prototypic amino acids, leucine (by active transport system 1 for monoamino monocarboxylic (neutral) amino acids), lysine (by active transport system 2 for dibasic amino acids), and proline (by active transport system 3 for N-substituted amino acids), persisted during the active fluid accumulation response to ETEC ST toxin. The mean Kt and mean Vmax of the amino acid transport systems were similar in control (non-injected) and ST toxin-injected rats. The present study provides a scientific basis for the use of amino acids in oral rehydration solutions utilizing amino acid transport systems which are linked to absorption of Na (and water) so that reduction in diarrhoeal stools can be achieved, and emphasizes the importance of maintaining feeding during acute diarrhoea to prevent development of malnutrition. 3aenterotoxins 3arats 3alysine 3aleucine 3aproline 3anutrient uptake 3aintestinal absorption 3aduration 3aactive transport 3akinetics 3asmall intestine 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Sucklingxmetabolism 2aBacterial Toxinsxpharmacology 2aCulture Techniques 2aDiarrheaxmetabolism 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnterotoxinsxpharmacology 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIntestine, Smallxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTime Factors 2aWater-Electrolyte Balancexdrug effects 0asucklings 0aamino acids 0aduodenal fluids 0asucking1 aMaung-U, Khin.1 aWai-Wai-Than.1 aThida-Aung.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1993 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.757-766x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle04087naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013600145300001600281500001500297520207000312650003002382650000902412650001702421650001702438650001102455650003202466650002002498650002202518650002802540650000702568650002202575650001002597650000902607650002002616650002102636650001602657650001202673650002502685650002002710650002002730650004002750650002902790650001902819650004902838650004802887650000902935650002502944650005902969650000903028650002203037650003703059653001903096700001703115700001503132700001803147700001703165700001403182700001503196700001503211773008503226852000903311930003303320945001303353946001103366655001203377IND2053635720221120162805.0961021e199305  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205363572DNAL7 a83293642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeslin, J.C.10aEffects of galacto-oligosaccharide and bacterial status on mucin distribution in mucosa and on large intestine fermentation in rats  ap. 903-912.  a2019-12-05  aThe purpose of the present paper was to study the effects of a dietary undigestible carbohydrate and intestinal microflora on mucin distribution (neutral, acid, sulphonated), glycolytic activities: beta-D-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23), N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.43), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamidase (EC 3.2.1.30), alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) and bacterial metabolism (gas production, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid caecal concentration) in gene-free (GF), conventional (CV) and heteroxenic (HE) rats (GF rats associated with a human flora). Rats were fed on either a control diet or a diet containing 40 g trans-galactosylated oligosaccharide (TOS)/kg. In GF rats fed on the control diet caecal pH was almost neutral and glycolytic activities negligible. The number of mucus-containing cells increased from the caecum to the colon for the three types of mucin. TOS had no effect in the caecum but it modified mucin cell repartition in the colon. In CV and HE rats fed on the control diet caecal pH was similar (6.8), but caecal SCFA and lactic acid concentrations (micromol/g) and gas production (ml/24 h) were higher in CV (70, 5.9 and 2.3 respectively) than in HE rats (32, 4.6 and 0.4 respectively). In CV, as in HE rats, acid-mucin-containing cells increased from the caecum to the colon and glycolytic activities were similar. TOS reduced acid-mucin-containing cells in the caecum of CV rats by twofold but had no effect in either the caecum or the colon of HE rats. TOS strongly increased beta-galactosidase activity and slightly modified the other glycolytic activities. Its effect on bacterial metabolites depended on bacterial status. However, comparison between CV and HE rats showed no evident relationship between the number of mucus-containing cells and measured bacterial metabolites. Differences between CV and HE rats might be due to bacterial microflora specificity. TOS had an intrinsic effect on mucus cell distribution in the colon of GF rats. In CV and HE rats the presence of the flora abolished this effect. 3aintestinal microorganisms 3adiet 3afermentation 3aglycosidases 3amucins 3agas production (biological) 3alarge intestine 3agerm-free animals 3ashort chain fatty acids 3apH 3aintestinal mucosa 3amucus 3arats 3aenzyme activity 3aoligosaccharides 3alactic acid 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aCecumxcytology 2aColonxcytology 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexbiosynthesis 2aFermentationxphysiology 2aGerm-Free Life 2aIntestinal Mucosaxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aIntestine, Largexmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMale 2aMucinsxbiosynthesis 2aOligosaccharidesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2abeta-Galactosidasexbiosynthesis 0amicroorganisms1 aAndrieux, C.1 aSakata, T.1 aBeaumatin, P.1 aBensaada, M.1 aPopot, F.1 aSzylit, O.1 aDurand, M.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1993 May, v. 69, no. 3 p.903-912x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle01660naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008000183300001600263500002400279520054400303650001600847650001300863650002000876650000900896650001100905650006100916650004500977650004701022650002601069650001101095650004501106773009001151852000901241856004801250655001201298IND4450889020221120142551.0110319e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445088902DNAL7 a213927022pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHite, Adele H.10aQuestioning population strategies to reduce sodium intake: What is the goal  ap. 390-391.  aIncludes references  aThe call to force industry to lower sodium levels in processed foods seems unwarranted in the face of little evidence to support such a move.

Body condition scores were available at calving, postpartum, first service, pregnancy check, before dry off, and at dry off from the Dairy Records Management Systems in Raleigh, NC, through the PCDART program. Heritabilities, genetic correlations, and phenotypic correlations were estimated assuming an animal model using average information REML. Herd-year-season effects and age at calving were included in all models. Prior calving interval was included in models for second and third lactations. Analyses that included reproductive traits were conducted with and without mature equivalent milk as a covariable. Heritability estimates for BCS ranged from 0.09 at dry-off to 0.15 at postpartum in first lactation. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.07 before dry-off to 0.20 at pregnancy check in second lactation and from 0.08 before dry-off to 0.19 at first service in third lactation. Genetic correlations between adjacent BCS within first lactation were greater than 0.96 with the exception of calving and postpartum (0.74). In second lactation, adjacent genetic correlations were 1.0 with the exception of calving and postpartum (0.84). Genetic correlations across lactations were greater than 0.77. Phenotypic correlations between scoring periods were highest for adjacent scoring periods and when BCS was lowest. Phenotypic correlations were lower than genetic correlations, i.e., less than 0.70. Higher BCS during the lactation were negatively related to production, both genetically and phenotypically, but the relationship was moderate. Higher BCS were favorably related genetically to reproductive performance during the lactation. 3adairy cows 3amilk protein yield 3aconception rate 3afeed conversion 3agenetic correlation 3aage 3aphenotypic correlation 3alactation number 3amilk fat yield 3ametabolizable energy 3aselection criteria 3aheritability 3abody condition 3apostpartum interval 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aModels, Animal 2aPhenotype 2aPostpartum Period 2aPregnancy 2aReproductionxgenetics 0arepeat breeders 0amilk yield1 aRogers, G.W.1 aClay, J.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.266-274x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03205naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245016500144300001600309500001500325520141700340650001901757650001201776650002501788650002101813650001801834650001201852650001801864650002301882650001801905650000701923650001801930650001801948650002301966650002001989650001602009650001202025650002302037650001402060650001102074650001102085650001802096650003102114650001102145650001202156650001302168650001202181650003302193650001502226650001302241653001902254653001802273653001502291653002002306700001902326700002002345700001602365773008202381852000902463930003302472945001302505946001302518655001202531IND2323392820221122033531.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339282DNAL7 a112100312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWard, J.D.10aChemical composition, ensiling characteristics, and apparent digestibility of summer annual forages in a subtropical double-cropping system with annual ryegrass  ap. 177-182.  a2019-12-05  aA 2-yr study was conducted to determine the chemical composition and digestibility of silages made from forage sorghum, pearl millet, and tropical corn managed to optimize forage quality. Silages were ensiled in upright concrete silos lined with plastic and fed to heifers to determine in vivo apparent digestibility. Samples were collected before and after ensiling to determine ensiling characteristics and forage quality. After ensiling, tropical corn had the greatest dry matter (DM), the lowest crude protein, and the greatest water-soluble concentrations. Tropical corn silage had a pH of 3.96. The pH of forage sorghum silage was 4.09, and pearl millet had a pH of 4.50. Pearl millet had the lowest concentration of preensiled water-soluble carbohydrate, which likely caused the high pH in the silage. There were no differences among the forages in DM loss during ensiling in yr 2. Heifers fed pearl millet silage consumed more DM, but digestible DM intake was not different among the three groups of heifers. The results of this experiment indicate that pearl millet would be less desirable as a crop intended solely for silage production. Both forage sorghum and tropical corn could be grown specifically for ensiling based on DM digestibility. The decision on which crop to use should be based on factors such as production costs, forage yields, and local growing conditions rather than silage quality. 3asorghum silage 3aheifers 3avolatile fatty acids 3avoluntary intake 3afiber content 3agrazing 3acarbohydrates 3aPennisetum glaucum 3acrude protein 3apH 3asilage making 3adigestibility 3aLolium multiflorum 3adouble cropping 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDigestion 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFood Handling 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLolium 2aPanicum 2aProteins 2aSeasons 2aSilagexanalysisxeconomics. 2aSolubility 2aZea mays 0asilage quality 0asilage plants 0adry matter 0aprotein content1 aRedfearn, D.D.1 aMcCormick, M.E.1 aCuomo, G.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.177-182x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02065naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245011400173300002000287500002400307520057100331650001400902650002400916650002300940650002800963650001700991650004401008650001201052650002801064650001601092650006301108650006101171650002401232650003601256650005501292700001801347700001701365700001501382700001801397773011801415852000901533856007701542655001201619IND4459637920221122021159.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963792DNAL7 a214385572pmid7 a10.1021/jf200395g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Ranfeng10aDesign, Synthesis, and Insecticidal Evaluation of New Benzoylureas Containing Isoxazoline and Isoxazole Group  ap. 4851–4859.  aIncludes references  aTwenty-two new benzoylphenylureas containing isoxazoline and the isoxazole group were designed and synthesized, and their structures were characterized by 1H NMR and elemental analysis (or HRMS).

Patterns of efficiency over time for individual trees, or between trees at one time, result from changes in rates photosynthesis and shifts in the relative partitioning to wood. We measured the production ecology (stem growth, light interception, and light use efficiency) to explain patterns of growth among trees within plots through stand development, and tested three hypotheses: (1) dominant trees have higher light use efficiency than subordinate trees; (2) lower variation in the size distribution of trees within plots allows higher light use efficiency; and (3) uniform stand structure and high light use efficiency reduce the age-related decline in tree growth. The experiment used clonal plantations of Eucalyptus at four locations in eastern Brazil. Irrigation and fertilization treatments ensured the major resource limitation for tree growth would be light supply. The influence of variation in the sizes of trees within plots was tested by comparing plots with all trees planted in a single day (uniform treatment) with plots where planting was spread over 80 days (heterogeneous treatment). Light interception per tree was simulated with the MAESTRA model. Across sites, treatments and whole-rotation stand development, dominant trees showed higher rates of stem growth, light interception, and light use efficiency than subordinate trees (supporting the first hypothesis). For example, dominant trees (80th percentile rank) at the end of the rotation grew four-times faster than suppressed trees (20th percentile rank), as a result of 2.1-fold greater light interception, and 1.8-fold greater stem growth per unit of light interception. In some cases, greater variation among tree sizes within plots led to lower efficiency of light use by average-size trees, providing mixed evidence for the second hypothesis. Greater uniformity of sizes of trees within plots did not substantially mitigate the decline in stem growth from mid-rotation to the end of the rotation, refuting the third hypothesis. The high efficiency of dominant trees underscores the marginal contribution of subordinate trees to total stand growth, and should spur further work on thinning to increase growth and lengthen rotations for dominant trees. 3aprimary productivity 3aplant competition 3astand structure 3atropics 3asilviculture 3aclones 3atropical wood 3asimulation models 3aforest trees 3aEucalyptus 3adecline 3atropical forests 3aleaf area 3aradiation use efficiency 3adry matter partitioning 3atree growth 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3atree age 3aforest plantations 3aBrazil 0awood growth 0aMAESTRA model 0aBrazil Eucalyptus Potential Productivity (BEPP) 0alight1 aStape, José Luiz.1 aBauerle, William L.1 aRyan, Michael G.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 259, no. 9 p.1704-1713dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/347923Available in Treesearch, US Forest Service's digital repository  a20100518b20100605c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02745naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008500129300001600214500001500230520164500245650001501890650001901905650001901924650002201943650000801965650001901973650001801992650001102010650001102021650001302032650001202045650001102057653001902068653002102087653002102108700001302129700001802142773008502160852000902245930003302254945001302287946001102300655001202311IND2053513320221122021743.0961011e199205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205351332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiago, L.R.L.10aStudies of method of conserving grass herbage and frequency of feeding in cattle  ap. 319-336.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of the method of conserving grass herbage and the frequency of feeding on eating behaviour, rumen motility and rumen fill was studied in growing steers. Silage and hay were offered to twelve rumen-cannulated Friesian steers (average initial live weight (LW) 128 kg) at a restricted level of intake (20 g dry matter (DM)/kg LW) either once or eight times daily. With once daily feeding, the daily intake of hay was consumed in a single large meal which lasted about 2 h, while silage was eaten in many small meals throughout the day. The proportion of the day spent ruminating was higher (0.39) for steers offered hay once daily than for those offered silage (0.28) or hay eight times per day (0.29). There was little effect of conservation method on frequency of rumen contraction, but contractile intensity (integration of frequency and amplitude) increased during the second half of the 24 h feeding cycle in steers offered hay either once daily or eight times daily, while the same effect was only observed when silage was offered once daily. Total daily contractile activity (the integration of the frequency and duration of myoelectric spike bursts) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in steers offered hay, compared with silage, once daily. The mean weight of organic matter in the reticulo-rumen of steers offered hay was significantly higher than for silage both with once (1593 v. 1326 g organic matter (OM)/100 kg LW, P < 0.01) and eight (1367 v. 1160 g OM/100 kg LW, P < 0.05) times daily feeding. The proportion of the particulate pool which was present as small (< 1.2 mm) particles was always greater than 0.60. 3arumination 3aorganic matter 3acattle feeding 3afeeding frequency 3ahay 3arumen motility 3aparticle size 3asteers 3aforage 3aduration 3adigesta 3asilage 0arumen contents 0afood restriction 0afeeding behavior1 aGill, M.1 aSissons, J.W.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1992 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.319-336x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle03026naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245013200146300001600278500001500294520125800309650001501567650002601582650002001608650001701628650001601645650002701661650001901688650001801707650002101725650001201746650002001758650001501778650002301793650001801816650001201834650002501846650003901871650002801910650001101938650001501949650003801964650001102002650002802013650001902041650002602060650001902086653001602105653001702121653001502138700001502153700002202168700001902190700002902209773008202238852000902320930003302329945001302362946001302375655001202388IND2323392220221122021837.0011009e200101  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232339222DNAL7 a112100252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, M.V.10aPlasma ascorbate concentrations are not correlated with milk somatic cell count and metabolic profile in lactating and dry cows  ap. 134-139.  a2019-12-05  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the effects of stage and the number of lactation on plasma ascorbate concentration and to establish the association between plasma ascorbate concentrations and plasma glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), milk somatic cell count (SCC), milk yield, and body condition score (BCS) in dairy cows. Holstein cows (n = 193) from three different herds were used in this study. Animals were randomly selected, and assigned to five groups according to stage of lactation (group 1, dry cows; group 2, 1 to 28 d; group 3, 29 to 56 d; group 4, 57 to 140 d; group 5, 141 to 280 d), and the number of lactation (primiparous or multiparous). Plasma ascorbate concentration, plasma glucose concentration, serum insulin concentration, plasma NEFA concentration, plasma BHBA concentration, serum AST concentration, milk SCC, milk yield, and BCS were measured. The results of this study demonstrate that plasma ascorbate concentrations do not change in response to stage of lactation, or number of lactations. Among the several variables studied, none was found that, singly or in combinations, could explain variations in ascorbic acid concentrations. 3adairy cows 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3alactation stage 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody condition 3ablood glucose 3alactation number 3ainsulin 3aenzyme activity 3amilk yield 3asomatic cell count 3aascorbic acid 2aAnimals 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCattle 2aCell Count 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aHydroxybutyratesxblood 2aInsulinxblood 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxcytology 0afatty acids 0ablood plasma 0adry period1 aLima, F.R.1 aRodrigues, P.H.M.1 aBarros, S.B.M.1 aLaranja de Fonseca, L.F.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2001 Jan., v. 84, no. 1 p.134-139x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a20011202b20011206c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02110naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001700182245008200199300001800281500002400299500001500323520080400338650002101142650001701163650001801180650002301198653001901221700002201240700002301262700002101285773012801306852000901434856011201443856008801555930003301643945002501676946001101701655001201712IND4434575420140725000000.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Silviculturists explained growth of trees and stands in terms of unquantifiable “growing space,” explaining changes in productivity of trees and stands in response to increases and decreases in non-finite growing spaces (Oliver and Larson, 1990). Mechanistic understanding of the ecophysiology of tree growth developed in the late 20th Century to the point where growth could be examined in relation to acquisition and use of resources, and models could use a mechanistic foundation for estimating growth over time and across landscapes (Landsberg, 2003). 3atropical forests 3asilviculture 3aforest growth 3aforest plantations 0aforest ecology1 aLaclau, Jean-Paul1 aStape, José Luiz,1 aRyan, Michael G.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 259, no. 9 p.1681-1683dElsevier SciencewJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/347933Available in Treesearch, US Forest Service's digital repository40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.01.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20100504b20100605c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03828naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011000147300001600257500001500273520204000288650001702328650001802345650001002363650001902373650001302392650000902405650001002414650002302424650002502447650001202472650001602484650001002500650001402510650001802524650001902542650001302561650001402574650002102588650002602609650001202635650003102647650002802678650001102706650004402717650000902761650002702770650002202797650002202819650002502841650002302866653001902889653001702908653000902925653003802934653001102972700002002983773008503003852000903088930003303097945001303130946001103143655001203154IND2053513520221122021138.0961011e199205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205351352DNAL7 a13204032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDewhurst, R.J.10aEffects of diet, level of intake, sodium bicarbonate and monensin on urinary allantoin excretion in sheep  ap. 345-353.  a2019-12-05  aThe present experiment was designed to study the effects of factors likely to alter microbial purine yield from the rumen on urinary excretion of allantoin-nitrogen (UAN). Sixteen mature Clun Forest-Welsh crossbred wethers were used in a 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 factorial design to investigate the effects of (1) level of intake, (2) wheat: nutritionally improved straw (NIS) ratio, (3) sodium bicarbonate inclusion and (4) monensin inclusion on diet digestibilities, fractional outflow rates of solids and liquids from the rumen and urinary allantoin excretion. Each treatment occurred in each of two experimental periods. The treatments were designed to influence microbial purine yield via changes in rumen outflow rate and microbial maintenance coefficient. Increasing the proportion of NIS and increasing feeding level decreased digestibility and increased the fractional outflow rate of solids. Increasing the level of intake increased the fractional outflow rate of liquids. Urinary allantoin excretion (/kg live weight 0.75 per d) was significantly increased by an increased proportion of wheat in the diet and increased level of intake, and significantly reduced by NaHCO3. There was a significant interaction effect such that increasing level of intake did not increase UAN with the high-NIS diet, despite an increased fractional outflow of solids from the rumen, in contrast to the increase observed with the high-wheat diet. Taken together with other observations it is suggested that high sodium concentrations in the diet reduce the efficiency of microbial synthesis, probably by increasing the energy cost of maintaining osmolarity. Monensin had no overall effect on UAN but there were significant interactions between monensin and dietary Na; the inhibitory effect of monensin on UAN was eliminated or reversed in the presence of added NaHCO3. This is consistent with theories that monensin increases the net influx of hydrogen ions into microbial cells and that this influx can be reduced by increased extracellular sodium ions. 3arumen fluids 3adietary fiber 3aurine 3aorganic matter 3anitrogen 3aflow 3awheat 3asodium bicarbonate 3arumen microorganisms 3awethers 3afeed intake 3astraw 3aallantoin 3adigestibility 3aanimal feeding 3amonensin 3aexcretion 2aAllantoinxurine 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBicarbonatesxpharmacology 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aEating 2aGastrointestinal Motilityxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMonensinxpharmacology 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aSheepxmetabolism 2aSodiumxpharmacology 2aSodium Bicarbonate 0arumen contents 0arumen solids 0adiet 0amicrobial maintenance coefficient 0aratios1 aWebster, A.J.F.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1992 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.345-353x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle02984naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100002100202245015400223300001800377500002400395520123500419650001501654650002301669650001801692650001801710650002101728650002301749650002201772650002301794650001801817650002201835650003501857650001701892650000901909650001201918650001501930651001101945653002101956653002501977700002002002700002302022700001802045700002402063700001802087773011102105852000902216856008802225930003302313945002502346946001102371655001202382IND4434576020221122002146.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK120 0aX100 0aB200 0aJ200 0aX2001 aAlmeida, Auro C.10aMapping the effect of spatial and temporal variation in climate and soils on Eucalyptus plantation production with 3-PG, a process-based growth model  ap. 1730-1740.  aIncludes references  aIn the wet tropics, near the Atlantic Coast of Brazil, drought may reduce plantation yields by as much one-third over a six-to-seven-year rotation. For land owners, annual variation in production cannot be estimated with empirical models. In this paper, we examine whether the process-based growth model, 3-PG is sufficiently sensitive to climatic variation to provide a virtual record of changes in growing stock across 180,000ha eucalypt plantation estate. We first mapped variation in climate and soil properties, and then ran simulations for the current planted forest with ages varying from one to seven years. Model predictions of stand volume and mean tree diameter agreed closely with measurements acquired on 60 reference plots monitored over the test period; the prediction of mean annual increment (MAI) was less reliable. Available soil water (ASW) and leaf area index (LAI) were also measured and compared with the model estimations. Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and ASW accounted for most of the variation in yields. We conclude that this spatial modelling approach offers a reasonable alternative to extensive ground surveys, particularly when climatic variation extends beyond the historical average for a region. 3aEucalyptus 3aforest plantations 3agrowth models 3aforest growth 3aclimatic factors 3asoil water balance 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aforest yields 3asimulation models 3ageographic information systems 3aspatial data 3arain 3adrought 3aprediction 3aBrazil 0aspatial modeling 0aprocess-based models1 aSiggins, Anders1 aBatista, Thiago R.1 aBeadle, Chris1 aFonseca, Sebastião1 aLoos, Rodolfo0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 259, no. 9 p.1730-1740dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.10.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100413b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02416naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245007600191300001400267500002400281520100700305650002601312650001501338650001001353650002101363650002201384650001301406650001901419650001401438650001101452650004101463650004201504650002001546650001701566650001801583650004401601650002601645650003101671650002401702650002901726700002101755773010601776852000901882856005501891655001201946IND4399367720221122002133.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439936772DNAL7 a187058842pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2007.00448.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLINK, TOBIAS I.10aSecreted proteins of Uromyces fabae: similarities and stage specificity  ap. 59-66.  aIncludes references  aUromyces fabae on Vicia faba is a model system for obligate biotrophic interactions. Searching for potential effector proteins we investigated the haustorial secretome of U. fabae (biotrophic stage) and compared it with the secretome of in vitro grown infection structures, which represent the pre-biotrophic stage. Using the yeast signal sequence trap method we identified 62 genes encoding proteins secreted from haustoria and 42 genes encoding proteins secreted from in vitro grown infection structures. Four of these genes were identical in both libraries, giving a total of 100 genes coding for secreted proteins. This finding indicates a strong stage-specific regulation of protein secretion. Similarity with previously identified proteins was found for 39 of the sequences analysed, 28 of which showed similarity to proteins identified among members of the order Uredinales only. This might be taken as an indication for possible roles in virulence and host specificity unique to the Uredinales. 3aUromyces viciae-fabae 3aVicia faba 3agenes 3ahost specificity 3aprotein secretion 3aproteins 3asignal peptide 3avirulence 3ayeasts 2aBasidiomycotaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxsecretion. 2aGene Expression 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Fungal 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aRNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVicia fabaxmicrobiology1 aVOEGELE, RALF T.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2008 Jan., v. 9, no. 1 p.59-66dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2007.00448.x 7aarticle02767naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245011600171300001600287520185400303653003602157653000902193653001002202653001402212700002202226773013602248852000902384856008502393946001102478655001202489IND4440674820221122002307.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444067482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10974-010-9216-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando Olivera, J. 10aTwo inhibitors of store operated Ca²⁺ entry suppress excitation contraction coupling in frog skeletal muscle  ap. 127-139.  aTwo drugs, 2-APB and SKF-96365, commonly used to block Store Operated Ca²⁺ Entry (SOCE) were found to have inhibitory effects at different levels of the Excitation Contraction Coupling (ECC) process in frog skeletal muscle fibers. Treatment with either drug suppressed Ca²⁺ release from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum, but this effect was not due to inhibition of SOCE as it occurred in Ca²⁺-free conditions. 2-APB applied extracellularly at 100 μM, the usual concentration to suppress SOCE, reversibly reduced the charge movement elicited by pulses in the range between −45 and −35 mV from 7.99 ± 0.73 nC/μF (N = 17) before drug application to 6.27 ± 0.68 nC/μF in the presence of 2-APB. This effect was mostly on the delayed Qγ component. In fibers treated with the SERCA ATPase inhibitor CPA the Qγ component disappeared, under this condition the application of 2-APB did not suppress the remaining charge movement. Thus the effect of 2-APB on charge movement currents seemed to be secondary to the suppression of Ca²⁺ release, likely occurring directly on the release channels. No significant suppression of ECC was observed for concentration below 20 μM. 2-APB also inhibited the L-type Ca²⁺ current (20 ± 4%, N = 8). On the other hand SKF-96365 had a direct effect on the voltage sensor promoting its voltage dependent inactivation. Applied at 20 μM, a typical concentration used for inhibiting SOCE, to fibers held at −80 mV inhibited the charge moved in response to pulses ranging −45 to −30 mV from 7.95 ± 2.59 nC/μF to 3.48 ± 0.9 nC/μF (N = 12). A parallel reduction of Ca²⁺ release was observed. Wash out was drastically increased by hyperpolarization of the holding potential to −100 mV. SKF-96365 also inhibited the L-type Ca²⁺ current (41 ± 8%, N = 4) and increased its rate of inactivation. 0aExcitation-contraction coupling 0aSOCE 0a2-APB 0aSKF-963651 aPizarro, Gonzalo 0 tJournal of muscle research and cell motility.g2010 Aug., v. 31, no. 2 p.127-139dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0142-43197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10974-010-9216-73Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245014200143300001600285520127200301650001501573650001201588650002101600650001801621650002101639650002601660650001201686650001301698650001401711650001301725650002301738650000901761650002701770650001201797650003901809650001101848650001301859650004201872650004301914650001201957650004601969650001102015650001402026650007502040650003602115650000902151650002502160653001502185700002102200700001702221773008502238852000902323930003302332945001302365946001102378655001202389IND2053518120221121232157.0961011e199205  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205351812DNAL7 a16229862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, B.14aThe effects of acute and chronic administration of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on ethanol-induced gastric haemorrhage in rats  ap. 501-507.  aFemale weanling rats in three equal groups (n 12) were given orally by intubation 1 ml micellar solution of taurocholic acid (10 mM) and either arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6), linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) or eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) at a concentration of 120 mM.

The butterfat diet was not significantly different from the control diet (23.8 (SD 8.1)). 3ahemorrhage 3astomach 3ataurocholic acid 3alinoleic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aethanol 3acorn oil 3afish oils 3amilk fat 3aexperimental diets 3arats 3aenvironmental exposure 2aAnimals 2aArachidonic Acidsxtherapeutic use 2aButter 2aCorn Oil 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxtherapeutic use 2aEthanol 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxtherapeutic use 2aFemale 2aFish Oils 2aGastrointestinal Hemorrhagexchemically inducedxprevention & control. 2aLinoleic Acidsxtherapeutic use 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 0aprotection1 aMcDonald, G.S.A.1 aGibney, M.J.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g1992 May, v. 67, no. 3 p.501-507x0007-11457nnas  aDNAL  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US 7aarticle04169naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245015700174300002000331500002400351520239700375650001402772650001402786650001102800650002102811650001602832650001902848650001102867650001902878650001802897650002202915650001002937650002702947650002302974650002302997650002403020650001103044650003203055650002703087650001103114650001303125650002203138650000903160650003103169650002403200650002103224650004203245700002303287700002403310700002003334700002103354773011803375852000903493856007703502655001203579IND4459638620221121232111.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445963862DNAL7 a214566202pmid7 a10.1021/jf104376b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Damian10aProton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry and Time Intensity Perceptual Measurement of Flavor Release from Lipid Emulsions Using Trained Human Subjects  ap. 4891–4903.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of the fat component of liquid emulsions on dynamic “in-nose” flavor release was examined using a panel of trained human subjects (n = 6), proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), and time intensity (TI) sensory evaluation. A rigorous breathing and consumption protocol was developed, which synchronized subjects’ breathing cycles and also the timing of sample introduction. Temporal changes in volatile release were measured in exhaled nostril breath by real-time PTR-MS. Corresponding changes in the perceived odor intensity could also be simultaneously measured using a push button TI device. The method facilitated accurate examination of both “preswallow” and “postswallow” phases of volatile release and perception. Volatile flavor compounds spanning a range of octanol/water partition coefficient (K(o/w)) values (1−1380) were spiked into water (0% fat) or lipid emulsions with various fat contents (2, 5, 10, and 20% fat). Replicate samples for each fat level were consumed according to the consumption protocol by six subjects. Statistical comparisons were made at the individual level and across the group for the effects of changes in the food matrix, such as fat content, on both pre- and postswallow volatile release. Significant group differences in volatile release parameters including area under the concentration curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (I(max)) were measured according to the lipid content of emulsions and volatile K(o/w). In a second experiment, using single compounds (2-heptanone, ethyl butanoate, and ethyl hexanoate), significant decreases in both in-nose volatile release and corresponding perceived odor intensities were measured with increasing fat addition. Overall, the effect of fat on in vivo release conformed to theory; fat had little effect on compounds with low K(o/w) values, but increased for volatiles with higher lipophilicity. In addition, significant pre- and postswallow differences were observed in AUC and I(max), as a result of changing fat levels. In the absence of fat, more than half of the total amount of volatile was released in the preswallow phase. As the content of fat was increased in the emulsion systems, the ratio of volatile released postswallow increased compared to preswallow. These data may provide new insights into why low-fat and high-fat foods are perceived differently. 3abreathing 3aemulsions 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3afood matrix 3ahigh fat foods 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid content 3amass spectrometry 3aodors 3apartition coefficients 3asensory evaluation 3atemporal variation 2aEmulsionsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFlavoring Agentsxchemistry 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aLipidsxchemistry 2aMale 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aTaste Perception 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxchemistry1 aAppelqvist, Ingrid1 aPiyasiri, Udayasika1 aWooster, Tim J.1 aDelahunty, Conor0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 May 11, v. 59, no. 9 p.4891–4903-4891–4903x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf104376b3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03306naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002400175245009900199300001800298500002400316520177400340650002402114650002302138650001802161650000802179650002002187650001602207650001802223650001702241650002202258650002502280650001302305650001802318650001402336651001402350653003002364653002302394653001702417653002502434700002102459700001902480773011102499852000902610856008802619930003302707945002502740946001102765655001202776IND4434576220221121220208.0100326e20100415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443457622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK120 0aX1001 aForrester, David I.10aTranspiration along an age series of Eucalyptus globulus plantations in southeastern Australia  ap. 1754-1760.  aIncludes references  aMany of the world's Eucalyptus plantations are grown on short rotations of 15 years or less, which often covers the most rapid phase of stand development and peaks in growth rates and leaf areas. Since transpiration is related to stand leaf area these short rotations that make use of rapid early growth rates, may also maximise plantation water use, which has implications for predicting their water requirements and impacts on catchment hydrology. This study examined the transpiration, leaf area and growth rates of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantations aged 2-8 years. Transpiration (E), estimated using the heat pulse technique, increased from 0.4mmday⁻¹ at age 2 years to a peak of about 1.6-1.9mmday⁻¹ in stands aged 5-7 years. This was associated with similar trends for stand leaf area index (LAI) and periodic annual increments of aboveground biomass, which both peaked at about age 4-6 years resulting in a linear relationship between E and LAI. While stand sapwood areas were continuing to increase at age 8 years, E was already declining due to reductions in sap velocity, from 13.5cmh⁻¹ at age 2 years to 6.3cmh⁻¹ at age 8 years and reduced sapwood area growth rates. Trees compensated for this reduction in sap velocity with declines in the leaf area (A L) to sapwood area (A S) relationship (A L :A S) with age. There was also a reduction in growth efficiency (aboveground biomass increment per LAI) with age. However, reductions in WUE were small after age 4 years, which explained the linear relationship between E and LAI. If E continues to decline successive short rotation lengths may not only make use of rapid early growth rates but could also increase plantation water use compared to longer rotations over the same period of time. 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aforest plantations 3atranspiration 3aage 3aleaf area index 3atree growth 3aforest growth 3aforest trees 3aforest management 3awater use efficiency 3asap flow 3aforest canopy 3aequations 3aAustralia 0ashort rotation management 0acanopy conductance 0arotation age 0aheat pulse technique1 aCollopy, John J.1 aMorris, Jim D.0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Apr. 15, v. 259, no. 9 p.1754-1760dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.04.0233Available from publisher's Web site  a20100413b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/04/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02151naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011700166300001400283520075200297592002801049650002501077650002201102650002201124650001301146650002001159650002201179650001101201650002301212650001601235650002001251650001701271650001101288650000901299650001301308650003701321653002201358653001901380653001701399653002601416700001901442700002301461700002001484773010501504856005101609852000901660655001201669IND50088332720221120062224.0140414e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008833272DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2011.6530822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitte, Jana10aNanocrystalline Nickel and Cobalt Sulfides Formed by a Heavy Metal-Tolerant, Sulfate-Reducing Enrichment Culture  ap. 36-47.  aA soil enrichment culture of the sulfate-reducers Desulfosporosinus auripigmenti and Citrobacter freundii and of fermentative bacteria from a former uranium-mining site was studied for its metal retention potential by promoting metal sulfide precipitation.

T.10aLoss of Nitrapyrin from Soils as Affected by pH and Temperature  ap. 865-869.  aepub  aLittle information is available on soil characteristics that influence the persistence of nitrapyrin [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine] in soil. Knowledge concerning these characteristics could be helpful in determining the most effective time of nitrapyrin application and in identifying soils in which the most effective inhibition of nitrification by nitrapyrin might be expected. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soil pH and temperature on the disappearance of nitrapyrin and ammonium-N from the soil. Nitrapyrin was applied at rates of 2 and 4 ppm to three soils with pH levels adjusted to approximately 5.5, 6.3, and 6.8. In two of the three soils, the rate of nitrapyrin disappearance increased with increasing pH levels. However, nitrapyrin concentrations in the soil at the end of the 83-day incubation period were equal among pH levels. When pH influenced nitrapyrin disappearance, recoverable nitrapyrin decreased curvilinearly with time. When pH had no apparent effect on nitrapyrin, recoverable nitrapyrin decreased linearly with time. In the temperature study, nitrapyrin and N were applied to Drummer (Typic Haplaquoll) and Cisne (Mollic Albaqualf) soils and incubated for 154 days at temperatures of 4, 13, and 21 C. Disappearance of nitrapyrin and ammonium-N occurred at all temperatures and increased with increasing temperatures. The half life of nitrapyrin in the Cisne soil was 22 days when incubated at 4 C, and less than 7 days when incubated at 13 and 21 C. The half life of nitrapyrin in the Drummer soil was 92, 44, and 22 days, when incubated at temperatures of 4, 13, and 21 C, respectively. At all temperatures nitrapyrin was more effective in controlling loss of ammonium in the Drummer than in the Cisne soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbaqualfs 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3aapplication rate 3ahalf life 3anitrapyrin 3anitrification 3asoil pH 3atemperature1 aHoeft, R.

Group A (n = 30) underwent one repeated CT scan on a single scanner. Group B (n = 30) was scanned using two different CT scanners. All CT data were reconstructed using different reconstruction kernels (soft, intermediate, sharp) and slice thicknesses (one and three millimeters), resulting in twelve datasets per patient. Following ROI placement in fibrotic lung tissue, 86 RF were extracted. Intra- and inter-scanner RF repeatability and reproducibility were assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for corresponding kernels and slice thicknesses, and between lung-specific and non-lung-specific reconstruction parameters. Furthermore, test-retest lung volumes were compared.Test-retest demonstrated a majority of RF is highly repeatable for all reconstruction parameter combinations. Intra-scanner reproducibility was negatively affected by reconstruction kernel changes, and further reduced by slice thickness alterations. Inter-scanner reproducibility was highly variable, reconstruction parameter-specific, and greatest if either soft kernels and three-millimeter slice thickness, or lung-specific reconstruction parameters were used for both scans. Test-retest lung volumes showed no significant difference.CT RF of fILD are highly repeatable for constant reconstruction parameters in a single scanner. Intra- and inter-scanner reproducibility are severely impacted by alterations in slice thickness more than reconstruction kernel, and are reconstruction parameter-specific.

Many major pathways for mRNA decay involve the removal of the 5′ 7-methyl guanosine (m⁷G) cap in the cytoplasm to allow for 5′-to-3′ exonucleolytic decay. The most well studied and conserved eukaryotic decapping enzyme is Dcp2, and its function is aided by co-factors and decapping enhancers. A subset of these factors can act to enhance the catalytic activity of Dcp2, while others might stimulate the remodeling of proteins bound to the mRNA substrate that may otherwise inhibit decapping. Structural studies have provided major insights into the mechanisms by which Dcp2 and decapping co-factors activate decapping. Additional mRNA decay factors can function by recruiting components of the decapping machinery to target mRNAs. mRNA decay factors, decapping factors, and mRNA substrates can be found in cytoplasmic foci named P bodies that are conserved in eukaryotes, though their function remains unknown. In addition to Dcp2, other decapping enzymes have been identified, which may serve to supplement the function of Dcp2 or act in independent decay or quality control pathways.

Two modes of tilting were employed to simulate drained and partially drained conditions. The slow tilting mode ensured that the excess pore pressure generated in the tailings bed in response to shearing remained low and did not influence the shear strength of the bed. During rapid tilting, the excess pore pressure build-up was significant and ultimately led to bed failure. Failure occurred at a plane parallel to the surface of the bed and at a depth of 0.4 to 1.5 cm. Linear drained and partially drained shear strength envelopes with zero cohesion intercept were defined over the vertical stress range of 0 to 1 kPa. The effective friction angles were determined to be 40.4° and 40.8° for the 3 and 12 day old beds, respectively. For beds of the same thickness and age, the total friction angles obtained from partially drained tests were 23.3° and 23.8°, respectively. Small variations in total and effective friction angles with consolidation time were observed.  aPublisher supplied data 0amine tailings 0adrained shear strength 0afriction angle 0aconsolidation stress 0aslope failure1 aYanful, Ernest K.0 tCanadian geotechnical journal.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 49, no. 3 p.285-297dNRC Research Pressx1208-60107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/t11-0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007300174300001600247520100300263592002801266650001801294650001201312650002001324650001801344650002701362700002101389773010701410856008401517990002301601852000901624655001201633IND60089973220221118095413.0141102e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008997322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagrm.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHooper, Christopher10aPacking them up and dusting them off: RNA helicases and mRNA storage  ap. 824-834.  aCytoplasmic mRNA can be translated, translationally repressed, localized or degraded. Regulation of translation is an important step in control of gene expression and the cell can change whether and to what extent an mRNA is translated. If an mRNA is not translating, it will associate with translation repression factors; the mRNA can be stored in these non-translating states. The movement of mRNA into storage and back to translation is dictated by the recognition of the mRNA by trans factors. So, remodeling the factors that bind mRNA is critical for changing the fate of mRNA. RNA helicases, which have the ability to remodel RNA or RNA–protein complexes, are excellent candidates for facilitating such rearrangements. This review will focus on the RNA helicases implicated in translation repression and/or mRNA storage and how their study has illuminated mechanisms of mRNA regulation.

The aim of this study is to evaluate a community of Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii), northern plains grey langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) and Asian small-clawed otters (Aonyx cinerea) in the Zoological Garden of Gelsenkirchen.The behavioural monitoring of the animals reveals that the orangutans spend less time with feeding behaviour and locomotion than free ranging orangutans, whereas the percentage of resting periods is much higher. This difference is probably caused by the easy availability of food. The northern plains grey langurs show ethograms whose proportions are very similar to those of free ranging grey langurs in literature. In both species the juvenile individuals have higher activity levels than the adult animals.The analysis of the spatial use of the enclosure by the orangutans reveals that they use about half of the area and prefer places at the ground for resting. On an average the orangutans spend around 50% of the monitored situations on the ground which is a high level for an arboreal living species. The time spent on the ground is distinctly lower in orangutans reared by their parents than in hand reared individuals which are probably affected by humans. Another influencing point is the sex. Adult male orangutans spend more time on the ground. This is a fact which is also known from free ranging animals. Related to their environment free ranging northern plains grey langurs show a high adaptability and the individuals in the zoo use about 70% of the enclosure and use frequently all structuring elements like trees, roots and ropes. Like the orangutans the grey langurs have preferred areas in the enclosure where they spend their resting periods with grooming, lactating and the feeding periods. Generally, the Asian small-clawed otters spend less time in the enclosure than the monkeys and use less than one third of the area.Most of the time free ranging orangutans live solitarily and thus it was predictable that there is only a fraction of intraspecific interactions between orangutans whereas the percentage of interactions between langurs is higher. The northern plains grey langurs live in harem troops and social interactions are more than 40% of the zoo langur's ethogram on an average. Asian small-clawed otters are also highly social animals and intraspecific contacts take place very often.The analysis of the monitored interspecific interactions between all species reveals that the juvenile animals of both primate species have distinct more interspecific contacts than the adult animals. In most cases the interactions are positive or playful contacts. Especially between a 12-year-old female orang-utan and one of the juvenile langurs friendly interactions with body contact were monitored often. Between the adult animals agonistic contacts or submission are most common. The Asian small-clawed otters are very interested in the orangutans and often approach towards them to have a sniff or pull their hair.The community of all three species is quite harmonious and serves as behavioural enrichment for all individuals. For the visitors the mixed enclosure is a benefit as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPongo abelii 3aPongo pygmaeus 3aadults 3afeeding behavior 3afood availability 3ahumans 3ajuveniles 3alactation 3alocomotion 3amonitoring 3amonkeys 3aparents 3arearing 3aresting periods 3aroots 3aropes 3atrees 3azoos 0aMixed-species exhibit 0aSocial interaction 0aSpatial use 0aBehavioural enrichment 0aPongo abelii 0aSemnopithecus entellus 0aAonyx cinerea1 aGürtler, Wolf-Dietrich0 tZoologische Garten.g2013, v. 82, no. 1-2 p.40-59dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl17422x0044-51697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zoolgart.2013.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009100171300001800262520112800280536016501408592002801573596001701601596001101618650001201629650001401641650002001655650001101675650001001686650001701696650002101713653000901734653001401743653001501757653002501772653001401797653002701811700002501838700002101863773012401884856008502008852000902093655001202102IND60746323620221118104407.0210731e20210611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074632362DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2021.19226922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Henry J.10aHow robust is the evidence for beneficial hydrological effects of urban tree planting?  ap. 1306-1320.  aSustainable urban water management initiatives are increasingly required to combat rapid urbanization and climate pressures. Initiatives include the role of tree planting, for which there is a need for strong evidence of benefits and drawbacks to support effective future planning. We report on the robustness of evidence from an assimilated database of urban hydrological impact studies which often had differing primary purposes. Consistent impacts were found at the local level, with trees reducing runoff and infiltration. Despite the consistency of evidence, much is undermined by the studies being somewhat lacking in robustness and scientific rigour. Many studies lack adequate controls, and models are often not strongly tested against observations. Moreover, evidence of impact at larger scales is lacking. Effects of tree characteristics were also investigated, such as maturity and species (for which evidence is consistent and detailed) and arrangement (for which there is less evidence). Realizing the full potential of trees in urban water management decision-making would benefit from more rigorous evidence.  aThis work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number ES/T000244/1]; and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [grant number 821016].  aPublisher supplied data  aES/T000244/1  a821016 3aclimate 3adatabases 3adecision making 3arunoff 3atrees 3aurbanization 3awater management 0atree 0ahydrology 0astormwater 0agreen infrastructure 0amodelling 0anature-based solutions1 aHutchins, Michael G.1 aMiller, James D.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2021 June 11, v. 66, no. 8 p.1306-1320dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.19226923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010100164300001600265520189000281592002802171650002602199650001202225650003902237650001902276650001302295650001402308650003002322650003302352650002002385650001002405650001802415653003802433653002102471653002002492653001902512700001602531700001602547773008202563856008102645852000902726655001202735IND60638245420221120145304.0190426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063824542DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900015902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitin, Peter10aThree-Dimensional Imaging and Analysis of Differentiating Secondary Xylem by Confocal Microscopy  ap. 211-222.  aWe examined the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of differentiating xylem in a hardwood tree, Kalopanax pictus, by confocallaser scanning microscopy (CLSM) using relatively thick, hand-cut histological sections. 3-D studies of plant tissues by mechanical serial sectioning with a microtome are very time-con suming. By contrast, the preparation of samples for CLSM is easier and the 3-D structure of intact tissue is preserved during optical sectioning. We obtained extended-focus images of the surface of specimens and these images resembled the stereographic images obtained by scanning electron microscopy. In addition , we observed radial files of cambial derivative cells at various stages of differenti ation and the internal structure along the 'z' axis of specimens on serial optical sections. We analysed the developmental changes in the morphology of cambial derivat ive cells, for example, the 3-D shape and arrangement of cells, the readjustment of the position of cells, and the development of secondary walls, pits and perforation plates. Our results showed that the arrangement of the differentiating xylem cells mirror s that of the cambial cell s. Deviations from the longitudinal orientation of vessel elements were specified by similar patterns of orientation of fusiform and ray cambial cells. The development of vessel elements progressed more rapidly than that of other xylem elements. When secondary walls with bordered pits and perforation plates with membranes were present in vessel elements and their expansion ceased, no secondary wall formation was detected in adjacent ray cells. The delay in secondary wall formation by the ray parenchyma cells, as compared to that by vessel elements, might facilitate the readju stment of the position of cells in the developing xylem tissue that is a consequence of the considerable expan sion of the vessel elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKalopanax septemlobus 3acambium 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3adigital images 3ahardwood 3ahistology 3aparenchyma (plant tissue) 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asecondary xylem 3atrees 3axylem vessels 0aconfocallaser scanning microscopy 0aKalopanax pictus 0avessel elements 0awood formation1 aSano, Yuzou1 aFunada, Ryo0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 24, no. 3 p.211-222dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900015903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010800172300001600280520100600296592002801302650001201330650002201342650001401364650001901378650002001397650001901417650001601436650001401452650002001466650000901486650001401495650001001509650001401519653001301533653001401546653000901560653001501569653001601584700002401600700001801624773011501642856008401757852000901841655001201850IND60122409720221117045253.0150325e20150603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012240972DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2013.8721152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandure, Jerekias10aExperimental Investigations of Fuel Properties of Biodiesel Derived from Tylosema Esculentum Kernel Oil  ap. 620-634.  aThe alternative fuels debate continues to attract the attention of researchers and scientists globally. This paper reports experimental results on selected properties of biodiesel derived from Tylosema Esculentum kernel oil and compares them with similar properties of petroleum diesel to assess its suitability for use as fuel in diesel engines. Results indicate an ester content of 90% for tylosema biodiesel fuel, while its viscosity profile meets requirements of American standards for biodiesel fuel (ASTM D 6751 - 02). The flash point and cold flow properties of tylosema biodiesel were found to be typical of a biodiesel fuel, while its acidity is within range of both American and European standards by 72.5%, and 56% respectively. It was also observed that biodiesel engine performance is marginally better than that of petroleum diesel, with lower concentrations of hydrocarbon emissions. Levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (CO) are largely comparable to those of petroleum diesel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalternative fuels 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3afluid mechanics 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aseeds 3aviscosity 0aTylosema 0abiodiesel 0afuel 0aproperties 0aperformance1 aKetlogetswe, Clever1 aTemu, Abraham0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2015 June 3, v. 12, no. 6 p.620-634dTaylor & Francisx1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2013.8721153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009200167300001600259520124500275592002801520653002301548653002101571653002601592700002101618700002001639700002301659700002501682700001901707773010001726856008201826852000901908655001201917IND60126004820221119194654.0151104e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012600482DNAL7 a10.1525/cond.2009.0800962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlisle, Jay D.10aLandbird Migration in the American West: Recent Progress and Future Research Directions  ap. 211-225.  aOur knowledge of avian behaviors during the nonbreeding period still lags behind that of the breeding season, but the last decade has witnessed a proliferation in research that has yielded significant progress in understanding migration patterns of North American birds. And, although historically the great majority of migration research has been conducted in the eastern half of the continent, there has been much recent progress on aspects of avian migration in the West. In particular, expanded use of techniques such as radar, plasma metabolites, mist-netting, count surveys, stable isotopes, genetic data, and animal tracking, coupled with an increase in multi-investigator collaborations, have all contributed to this growth of knowledge. There is increasing recognition that migration is likely the most limiting time of year for migratory birds, increasing the importance of continuing to decipher patterns of stopover ecology, identifying critical stopover habitats, and documenting migration routes in the diverse and changing landscapes of the American West. Here, we review and briefly synthesize the latest findings and advances in avian migration and consider research needs to guide future research on migration in the West.  aPublisher supplied data 0alandbird migration 0astopover ecology 0awestern United States1 aSkagen, Susan K.1 aKus, Barbara E.1 aRiper, Charles Van1 aPaxtons, Kristina L.1 aKelly, Jeff F.0 tThe Condor.g2009 May, v. 111, no. 2 p.211-225dUniversity of California Pressx1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fcond.2009.0800963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010100164300001600265520088100281592002801162650001701190650001501207650002801222650001501250650001901265650002601284650001701310650000901327653001401336653002001350700002101370700002401391700002001415700002101435773008201456856008101538852000901619655001201628IND60638245520221120145239.0190426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063824552DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900015912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClair, Bruno10aImaging the Mechanical Properties of Wood Cell Wall Layers by Atomic Force Modulation Microscopy  ap. 223-230.  aAtomic Force Microscopy in force modulation mode was used to study the elastic properties of the different fibre wall layers of the tension wood of holm oak and normal wood of boco. The method is based on the measurement of the resonance frequency of the microscope lever in contact with the sampie. This frequency is related to the reduced Young modulus E* = E/(I-v²) of the material, supposed to be isotropie. 'Elastic' images of the cell are obtained simultaneously with the topographie images, which allows the observation of the mechanical properties of the cells at a nanometric scale. Layers G, S₁, S₂ and ML can clearly be distinguished. By comparison with known materials an estimation of the absolute modulus is given in the range 5-20 GPa, but should be considered with caution, because the inherent anisotropy of the materials has not been taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus ilex 3aanisotropy 3aatomic force microscopy 3acell walls 3aimage analysis 3amechanical properties 3atension wood 3awood 0acell wall 0aelastic modulus1 aArinero, Richard1 aLévêque, Gérard,1 aRamonda, Michel1 aThibaut, Bernard0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 24, no. 3 p.223-230dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900015913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002900143245013900172300001600311520078500327592002801112650001301140650001801153650001101171650002301182650002401205650001301229650001101242650003601253650004301289650001801332650002601350650001401376650002201390653003101412653002001443700002101463773012101484856007701605852000901682655001201691IND60699911120221121051504.0200623e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069991112DNAL7 a10.1093/nutrit/nuw0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, Bénédicte L.10aNutrigenomic point of view on effects and mechanisms of action of ruminant trans fatty acids on insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes  ap. 214-223.  aEvidence from observational studies suggests beneficial effects of ruminant trans fatty acids (rTFA) on insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).

In addition, the review presents factors, including measures of IR and T2D, dose and duration of studies, as well as health status, ethnicity, and genotypes of subjects, that may help explain the heterogeneity in response to rTFA supplementation. Future studies should consider these factors, as well as research in nutritional genomics, to better understand the effects of rTFA on IR and T2D.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenotype 3ahealth status 3ahumans 3ainsulin resistance 3amechanism of action 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrigenomics 3aobservational studies 3aruminants 3atrans fatty acids 0aruminant trans fatty acids 0atype 2 diabetes1 aRudkowska, Iwona0 tNutrition reviews.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 75, no. 3 p.214-223dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44763x1753-48877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuw0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012200172300001800294520096500312536009301277592002801370650001101398650001401409650001301423650001101436651001101447653002301458653002701481653001901508653001701527700002701544700002101571773012401592856008501716852000901801655001201810IND60746323820221118104329.0210731e20210611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074632382DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2021.19252852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrison, Fernando10aTesting the Leopold-Maddock and the Dingman hydraulic geometry hypotheses with detailed measurements in a small river  ap. 1372-1382.  aHow well do traditional and analytical hydraulic geometry hypotheses predict discharge? We tested whether Dingman’s analytical expressions can be validated with field data by comparing it with the traditional Leopold-Maddock at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG). Data from a small basin (66 km²) in southern Brazil were used. The correlations for all the coefficients and for the exponents of depth and velocity of AHG relations were strong. Other results were confirmed: (i) there is a strong linear correlation between bankfull width and the AHG width coefficient; (ii) the hydraulic depth exponent and coefficient κ from generalized hydraulic equation are well predicted using relations between exponents and coefficients of AHG. The test of the hypotheses of the Leopold-Maddock and Dingman hydraulic geometry shows similar results and can be used to estimate discharge. However, the Leopold-Maddock method is simpler to apply from field measurements.  aThis study was supported by funding from the Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq).  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aequations 3ageometry 3arivers 3aBrazil 0ahydraulic geometry 0aLeopold-Maddock method 0aDingman method 0aBugres River1 aMota, Aline de Almeida1 aKobiyama, Masato0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2021 June 11, v. 66, no. 8 p.1372-1382dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.19252853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01633naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006200172300001400234520054900248592002800797650001700825650001300842650001200855650001200867650001300879650001400892650001300906650001600919650000900935653001400944653001800958653001700976653001100993653001501004653001601019773010401035856008701139852000901226655001201235IND60112330720221120134523.0190318s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011233072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.zoolgart.2013.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbler, Benjamin10aZur Biologie und Evolution der Lebenserwartung von Tieren  ap. 72-95.  aBiodemography is an emerging field of biology.

Silica-based geothermometric calculations for the Marangala and Nelumwewa springs showed the highest average reservoir temperatures of 122°C and 121°C, respectively. Samples of low temperature (<35°C) groundwater from nearby springs, piezometers and open wells were also collected for comparison. All samples were analyzed for their major and trace element compositions as well as stable isotope ratios 2H/1H and 18O/16O (expressed as δ2HH2O and δ18OH2O). Discharge temperatures of the thermal waters varied from 39–62°C. These waters showed low concentrations of selected trace elements (Fe<0.09; Mn<0.04; Cu<0.01; Cr<0.01; As<0.025mg/L)) and were also comparable to that of non-geothermal groundwaters. Stable isotope compositions of geothermal waters ranged from −6.5 to −5.0‰ for δ18OH2O and between −39 ‰ to −28 ‰ for δ2HH2O. In the non-geothermal waters, the isotope values were almost identical within the analytical uncertainties of 0.1‰ and 1‰ for δ2HH2O and δ18OH2O, respectively. In addition, all isotope ratios of geothermal and non-geothermal water samples scattered around the local meteoric water lines for the dry and intermediate climatic regions of Sri Lanka, thus indicating origin from precipitation without further influences of evaporation or water rock interaction. This similarity to the local meteoric water lines also makes influences of seawater an unlikely factor. Close matches of geochemical and isotope data from geothermal and corresponding non-geothermal waters confirm the hypothesis of a common source. The proposed model for Sri Lanka subsurface waters is that rainfall from the dry and/or intermediate climatic zones percolates with little time delay downward through structurally weaker zones in high-grade metamorphic rocks. They are subsequently heated by steep or heterogeneous geothermal gradients that are most likely associated with the Highland–Vijayan thrust zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aclimatic zones 3aevaporation 3agroundwater 3ametamorphic rocks 3amodels 3arain 3aseawater 3asoaking 3asprings (water) 3astable isotopes 3atrace elements 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3awater temperature 3awells 3aSri Lanka 0aGeothermal springs 0aGondwana terrain 0aAqueous geochemistry 0aIsotope geochemistry 0aHighland complex 0aVijayan Complex1 aBarth, Johannes A.C.1 aSubasinghe, N.D.1 aMerten, Dirk1 aDissanayake, C.B.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2013 Jan. 07, v. 476 p.360-369dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011000186300001400296520147300310592002801783650002601811650001801837650001001855650001501865650002001880650001001900650001001910650001401920650001801934650001401952653001201966653001901978653002501997653002502022700002402047700002302071700002402094700002002118773011502138856008202253852000902335655001202344IND60517257720221116205835.0190729e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051725772DNAL7 a237460482pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820130007472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Paul W.,10aProgressing the global antimalarial portfolio: finding drugs which target multiple Plasmodium life stages  ap. 66-76.  aThe number of novel antimalarial candidates entering preclinical development has seen an increase over the last several years. Most of these drug candidates were originally identified as hits coming from screening large chemical libraries specifically targeting the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum. Indeed, a large proportion of the current antimalarial arsenal has mainly targeted the asexual blood stage which is responsible for clinical symptoms of the disease. However, as part of the eradication agenda and to address resistance, any next-generation antimalarial should have additional activity on at least one other parasite life stage, i.e. gametocytocidal and/or tissue schizonticidal activity. We have applied this approach by screening compounds with intrinsic activity on asexual blood stages in assays against sexual and liver stages and identified two new antimalarial chemotypes with activity on multiple parasite life stages. This strategy can be expanded to identify other chemical classes of molecules with similar activity profiles for the next generation antimalarials. The following review summarizes the discovery of the spiroindolones and imidazolopiperazine classes of antimalarials developed by the NGBS consortium (Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, Genomic Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, Biomedical Primate Research Center, and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute) currently in clinical trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantimalarials 3ablood 3achemotypes 3aclinical trials 3adrugs 3aliver 3aparasites 3apublic health 3ascreening 0amalaria 0aspiroindolones 0aimidazolopiperazines 0aphenotypic screening1 aDIAGANA, THIERRY T.1 aYEUNG, BRYAN K.

Short-chain fatty acids influence colonic health through various mechanisms. In vitro and ex vivo studies show that SCFAs have anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic effects, play an important role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in colonocytes, and protect colonocytes from external harm. Animal studies have found substantial positive effects of SCFAs or dietary fiber on colonic disease, but convincing evidence in humans is lacking. Most human intervention trials have been conducted in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. Only a limited number of those trials are of high quality, showing little or no favorable effect of SCFA treatment over placebo. Opportunities for future research include exploring the use of combination therapies with anti-inflammatory drugs, prebiotics, or probiotics; the use of prodrugs in the setting of carcinogenesis; or the direct application of SCFAs to improve mucosal healing after colonic surgery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abutyrates 3acarcinogenesis 3adietary fiber 3adigestive system 3aex vivo studies 3afermentation 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3apropionic acid 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asurgery 0amucosal healing 0ashort-chain fatty acids1 aDejong, Cornelis H.C.1 aTroost, Freddy J.1 aMasclee, Ad A.M.1 aLenaerts, Kaatje0 tNutrition reviews.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 75, no. 4 p.286-305dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44763x1753-48877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuw0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013900174300001300313500001500326520199200341592002802333650002002361650001302381650002302394650001002417650001602427650001302443650000902456650001002465650002002475650001302495650001102508650001202519650000902531650001602540650001202556650000902568650000902577651001202586653001302598653002202611653001302633653002702646653001602673653002302689653001502712653001302727700002202740700001802762773010302780856008702883852000902970655001202979IND60112330820221120134624.0190318s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011233082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.zoolgart.2013.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrockmann, Thomas10aErfahrungsbericht über die Haltung und deutsche Erstzucht der Borneo-Flussschildkröte (Orlitia borneensis Gray, 1873) im Zoo Dresden  ap. 8-25.  a2019-12-04  aDresden Zoo bred successfully the Malaysian giant turtle (Orlitia borneensis) in summer 2012. This was the first successful breeding of this species in Germany.Little is known about biology and behaviour of this large river turtle and keeping and especially breeding of this endangered species in captivity is a rarity. In order to create optimal breeding conditions Dresden Zoo rebuilt an enclosure for the turtles in 2010. An area with soil and sand was built for the expected egg deposition. After arranged matings one female dug a nest on this area and buried her eggs. Nine eggs were secured and transferred into an incubator in a box filled with a 1:1 mixture of vermiculite and water. The average temperature was 29°C. After problems with the temperature regulation the damaged incubator had to be replaced. Because of an estimated incubation period of 3–4 months, one egg was opened on day 127 of incubation. A live hatchling with a big yolk sac was fetched. Because of the non-reabsorbed yolk sac the hatchling was further incubated. On day 154 of incubation all eggs were manually opened and the hatchlings were fetched. All of these hatchlings showed a non-reabsorbed yolk sac and were incubated onwards in a box with wet paper towel until the yolk sac was completely reabsorbed. After that the hatchlings were housed solitarily in a box with water of approximately 4cm height and a small land area. Two days after housing food was offered for the first time. All hatchlings accepted the offered food consisting of herbal as well as of animal products and later turtle pellets and self-made turtle jelly.Though little is known about breeding this species, the breeding success of Dresden Zoo demonstrates a possible approach to this topic. But there are still things to optimize. For example the manual hatching is something that should be avoided in future. Fertilization and hatching rate of 100% are promising and up to date eight out of nine hatchlings are still alive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal products 3ayolk sac 3aendangered species 3anests 3avermiculite 3abreeding 3asoil 3apaper 3acaptive animals 3ahatching 3asummer 3aturtles 3asand 3atemperature 3apellets 3aeggs 3azoos 3aGermany 0aHatching 0aincubation period 0aBreeding 0aMalaysian giant turtle 0aGeoemydidae 0aOrlitia borneensis 0aIncubation 0aYolk sac1 aHoffmann, Michael1 aZiemssen, Eva0 tZoologische Garten.g2013, v. 82, no. 1-2 p.8-25dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl17422x0044-51697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zoolgart.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010400172300001600276520067500292592002800967650001900995650002001014650001301034650001501047650001701062650000901079653001601088653001701104653002401121700002101145700002001166773008201186856008101268852000901349655001201358IND60638245820221120145249.0190426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063824582DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900015952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiedenhoeft, Alex C.10aAnalysis of Turee Microscopic Cuaracters for Separating the Wood of Pinus Contorta and P.

The tangential diameter of the resin canals, including the epithelium, was compared to the tangential diameter of the entire resin canal complex. The latter measurement was shown to give diagnostic results for these species. Data from the examination of ray composition do not support previously published methods for separating P. contorta and P. ponderosa. The presence or absence of small elongate crystals in the subsidiary parenchyma of the resin canal complexes was shown to be the most powerful diagnostic character for separating the wood of these species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus contorta 3aPinus ponderosa 3acrystals 3aepithelium 3aresin canals 3awood 0aResin canal 0awood anatomy 0awood identification1 aMiller, Regis B.1 aTheim, Terra J.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 24, no. 3 p.257-267dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900015953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245006900159300001600228520132800244592002801572653002301600653002601623653002401649653001901673653003801692700002201730700002801752700002701780700001701807700001901824773011001843856007101953852000902024655001202033IND60515390320221118171827.0160314e20120216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051539032DNAL7 a10.1139/t11-1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiglari, Mahnoosh10aSmall-strain stiffness of Zenoz kaolin in unsaturated conditions  ap. 311-322.  aAn experimental study has been carried out to investigate the effects of isotropic compression, wetting, and drying on the initial shear stiffness of Zenoz kaolin, an unsaturated lean clay, both in normally consolidated and overconsolidated conditions. The proposed study was conducted using fixed–free resonant column – torsional shear (RCTS). Specimens were compacted using the undercompaction technique. Initial shear stiffness was measured almost continuously along complex stress paths including (i) an initial equalization stage to a suction value of 0, 50, 150, and 300 kPa; (ii) an isotropic compression stage at constant suction, up to a net stress high enough to move the loading collapse line; (iii) an isotropic unloading stage at constant suction; (iv) a wetting and (or) drying path. The mentioned stress path allowed elimination or determination of the overconsolidation effect on the initial shear stiffness measured. The behavior observed is qualitatively similar to that of saturated soil, while wetting data clearly indicate that G₀ depends significantly on volumetric behavior. In normally consolidated samples where wetting is accompanied by collapse, reduction in suction has no remarkable effect on G₀. Conversely, in overconsolidated samples G₀ reduces significantly as suction decreases.  aPublisher supplied data 0aunsaturated kaolin 0asmall-strain behavior 0avolumetric behavior 0astress history 0aisotropic compression and wetting1 ad’Onofrio, Anna1 aMancuso, C.q(Claudio),1 aJafari, Mohammad Kazem1 aShafiee, Ali1 aAshayeri, Iman0 tCanadian geotechnical journal.g2012 Feb. 16, v. 49, no. 3 p.311-322dNRC Research Pressx1208-60107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/t11-1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010300171300001500274520058100289592002800870650002300898650003500921650002000956650002200976650001000998650002101008650001801029650005301047650001601100650001601116650002001132650001901152700001801171700002101189773010901210856008101319852000901400655001201409IND60474645320221119035907.0151223e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047464532DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348151100392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBol’shakov, D.

Since there are few rainfall stations in this basin, it is important to validate multisource data for multiple purposes. This is the first time that a lumped hydrological model (i.e. Probability Distributed Moisture (PDM)) has been used for this basin. Various statistical indicators, including the correlation coefficient, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), percent bias (BIAS) and Taylor diagram, were used to evaluate the applicability of the global precipitation data and the PDM model. The precipitation datasets showed a good correlation with the raingauge rainfall data. In contrast, CPC underestimates while PERSIANN-CDR overestimates the raingauge rainfall. In general, PERSIANN-CDR performed slightly better than CPC. The daily streamflow simulation driven by PDM and all data sources underestimates the actual flow.  aThis research work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University [under Grant Number RGP. 2/173/42].  aPublisher supplied data  aRGP. 2/173/42 3abasins 3aclimate models 3adata collection 3ahydrologic models 3ameteorological data 3aprobability 3arain 3arain gauges 3aremote sensing 3astream flow 3aVietnam 0aglobal precipitation datasets 0aprobability distributed moisture 0aCPC 0aPERSIANN-CDR 0ahydrological modelling1 aPhạm, Quó̂c Bảo,1 aZhu, Dehua1 aElahi, Ehsan1 aLinh, Nguyen Thi Thuy1 aAnh, Duong Tran1 aKhedher, Khaled Mohamed1 aAhmadlou, Mohammad0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2021 June 11, v. 66, no. 8 p.1383-1392dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.19359643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01667naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007600163300001800239520071700257592002800974650001201002650002101014650002501035700002201060700002801082700001901110700001901129773013401148856007401282852000901356655001201365IND60744750520221119110903.0210716e20210715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074475052DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc02257a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiel, Marie-Claire10aAminium cation-radical catalysed selective hydration of (E)-aryl enynes  ap. 6991-6994.  aThe hydration of carbon–carbon triple bonds is an important and atom economic synthetic transformation.

They were accompanied by two colleagues from Basle Zoo and the Monterey Bay Aquarium, who joined the tour.Their goals of the tour were focused on new innovative husbandry methods, on new aquarium buildings and new zoo enclosures as well as on rare Japanese endemic animals, which are never or seldom seen outside of Japan.The perfect new aquariums in Kyoto and Kitami City (Hokkaido), but also the very specialized aquariums like the Kamo Aquarium (for jellyfish) in Yamagata, the Chitose Salmon Aquarium (for salmons), the Otaru Aquarium (for sea mammals) and the Umi Kirara Kujukushima Aquarium (for the fauna of the Kujukushima island National Park) have been destinations for this trip. Besides the aquariums also the Asahiyama Zoo (new enclosures for endemic animals of Hokkaido), Kobe Oji Zoo, Kushiro Zoo (many endemic Hokkaido species), Nagasaki Bio Park, Sapporo Maruyama Zoo (new area for South East Asian animals) and the Sasebo Zoological & Botanical Garden were visited.During this tour it was obvious that neither the colleagues in Japan nor the staff in the zoos outside of Japan know sufficient enough about the conception and the husbandry methods in the different institutions in this part of the world. Therefore it is recommendable to organize such tours often for more people, thus both sides can benefit and learn from each other. This again will influence to help to keep the animals better, to attract more visitors in order to inspire them for the conservation of nature and environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScyphozoa 3aaquariums 3abotanical gardens 3abuildings 3aconception 3afauna 3aindigenous species 3amammals 3anational parks 3anatural resources conservation 3apeople 3azoos 3aJapan 0aNagasaki Penguin Aquarium 0aUmi Kirara Kujukushima Aquarium 0aYama-No Aquarium 0aKobe Oji Zoo 0aNagasaki Bio Park1 aTai, Motofumi0 tZoologische Garten.g2013, v. 82, no. 3-4 p.137-166dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl17422x0044-51697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zoolgart.2013.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01166naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245008900159300001600248520028800264592002800552650002600580650001200606650001600618650001200634650000900646650001100655700002200666773009600688856007100784852000900855655001200864IND60518536220221123033135.0160418e197103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051853622DNAL7 a10.2307/19346012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeyers, Robert J.12aA Colorimetric Method for Determining Oxygen Concentration in Terrestrial Situations  ap. 374-375.  aA method for the determination of gaseous oxygen is described.

The approach uses a nonlinear single degree of freedom system to satisfy force and energy equilibrium with a global genetic inversion approach. By balancing force and energy from inertia, damping, and stiffness against the measured tip data, the unknown parameters (mass, damping, and nonlinear stiffness) are estimated. Requiring a few seconds for analysis for each blow, the algorithm ensures a real-time assessment of static tip resistance as a function of displacement, which is important when setting pile lengths. The proposed approach was applied to four test piles at two bridge sites (Florida and Louisiana). Mobilized static tip resistances ranging from 400 to 1500 kN as a function of displacement were predicted. The predicted static resistance versus displacements compared favorably with measured values from static load tests. Interestingly, the maximum recorded increase in tip resistance in silty to clayey sands was less than 20% when piles were re-struck at times ranging from 2 to 30 days after initial drive.  aPublisher supplied data 0atip resistance 0adriven pile 0agenetic algorithm 0areal-time assessment1 aMcVay, Michael1 aHerrera Ojeda, Rodrigo,1 aLai, Peter0 tCanadian geotechnical journal.g2012 Mar. 16, v. 49, no. 4 p.381-393dNRC Research Pressx1208-60107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/t2012-0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02003naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012600169300001400295520114000309592002801449650001601477650001401493650001701507650001501524773010801539856008101647852000901728655001201737IND60474646420221119035541.0151223e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047464642DNAL7 a10.1134/S106193481512014X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlinskii, G. V.10aX-ray fluorescence analytical signal of elements with small atomic numbers as a function of the energy of primary photons  ap. 22-26.  aThe dependence of the intensity of X-ray fluorescence on the energy of photons exciting X-ray radiation is considered. For elements with small atomic numbers, the direct ionization of atoms, the major process for the majority of elements of the Periodic Table, is the main only at low energies of primary photons. With the growth of photon energy, the intensity of fluorescence due to photo and Auger electrons arising in the irradiated material increases. This component at certain energy becomes predominant. The further increase in the energy of primary photons leads to the suppression of the ionization of atoms by recoil electron arising in the incoherent (Compton) scattering of primary radiation. The effects of the energy of primary photons on the intensity of X-ray fluorescence for the studied processes differ significantly. The depth of these effects determines their contributions to the formation of the analytical signal. Study of the influence of excitation conditions allows the analyst to intelligently solve problems of the optimization of the X-ray fluorescence determination of elements with small atomic numbers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aelectrons 3afluorescence 3aionization0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2016 Jan., v. 71, no. 1 p.22-26dPleiades Publishingx1061-93487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S106193481512014X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245009500178300001600273500001500289520123300304592002801537650002601565650001501591650001401606650002901620650002701649650000801676653001301684773010701697856008401804990002301888852000901911655001201920IND60089974120221118095333.0141102e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008997412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagrm.2013.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuller-Pace, Frances V.14aThe DEAD box proteins DDX5 (p68) and DDX17 (p72): Multi-tasking transcriptional regulators  ap. 756-763.  a2019-12-06  aMembers of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases, which are characterised by the presence of twelve conserved motifs (including the signature D-E-A-D motif) within a structurally conserved ‘helicase’ core, are involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. Apart from unwinding RNA duplexes, which established these proteins as RNA helicases, DEAD box proteins have been shown to also catalyse RNA annealing and to displace proteins from RNA. DEAD box proteins generally act as components of large multi-protein complexes and it is thought that interactions, via their divergent N- and C-terminal extensions, with other factors in the complexes may be responsible for the many different functions attributed to these proteins. In addition to their established crucial roles in the manipulation of RNA structure, it is becoming increasingly clear that several members of the DEAD box family act as regulators of transcription. In this review I shall focus on DDX5 (p68) and the highly related DDX17 (p72), two proteins for which there is a large body of evidence demonstrating that they function in transcriptional regulation.

HCN synthase is encoded by a cluster of three genes, hcnABC, which form an operon. Polymorphism in the three genes may affect the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and influence HCN production. In this study, we selected a ∼570 bp portion of hcnAB gene consisting of a cysteine cluster at the 3′ end of hcnA that matches the iron-sulfur binding signature of 2[Fe–S] ferredoxins and the ADP binding-fold in the 5′ end of hcnB from 50 strains of HCN producing bacteria to analyze polymorphism in the gene. Both motifs have been credited to have a role in bacterial HCN synthesis. Analysis of the partial hcnAB gene showed that the bacteria grouped into four groups. Pairwise comparison of the distinctness ratios revealed that the HCN groups identified in this study were ecologically distinct populations and distinctness between the groups was reflected in HCN production by the bacteria.

If ground methods are biased against canopy birds, as has been suggested, this bias could affect our understanding of forest ecology as well as biological monitoring and conservation practices. This study is the first to quantitatively compare results from ground- and canopy-based methods of censusing canopy birds. I used three methods to assess differences in ground-based and canopy-based methods for detecting forest birds in a 100-ha plot of lowland forest in northern Honduras: (1) point counts from the ground, (2) 22 repeat censuses from two canopy trees, and (3) single censuses from 22 canopy trees. I counted birds for a full annual cycle from April 2006 to April 2007 and recorded 157 species in over 4000 individual detections. Ground methods significantly underestimated species and familial richness as well as abundance of individuals in the canopy stratum. On the basis of these results, I predict that the use of ground methods alone misses 25 to 50% of the species richness for some migrant and resident families and underestimates the density of some species by as much as 25%. These findings highlight the risk of relying on ground-based methods for bird studies in structurally complex tropical forests; reliance on ground-based methods may negatively affect long-term biological monitoring and the setting of conservation priorities for tropical forests.  aPublisher supplied data 0abiological monitoring 0abirds 0acommunity composition 0aforest canopy 0aHonduras 0arain forest0 tThe Condor.g2009 May, v. 111, no. 2 p.226-237dUniversity of California Pressx1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fcond.2009.0900323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016200171520170100333592002802034650004402062650002502106650002802131650001102159650002302170650001802193650002102211650001702232650001702249650003702266650001802303650001102321650002502332650001302357650001402370650001702384650003302401653002602434653002102460653002302481653000902504653001702513653001702530700002202547700005802569700002202627700005502649773011202704856008502816852000902901655001202910IND60698583420221120230824.0201025e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069858342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussein, Saif S.10aNovel chemical modification of polyvinyl chloride membrane by free radical graft copolymerization for direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) application  aPolyvinyl chloride-graft-poly ethyl acrylate (DHPVC-g-PEA) novel membranes were prepared for highly saline water desalination using DCMD. Free radical graft copolymerization was used to prepare DHPVC-g-PEA by applying an ethyl acrylate (EA) onto a PVC polymer backbone. The influence of the grafting reaction time on the PVC grafting percentage and on the resulting copolymer's characteristics was measured. The DHPVC-g-PEA preparation was affirmed via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). The use of EDX revealed a new peak associated with oxygen, while the increased carbon percentage confirmed that an ester group was present on the PVC backbone. The best reaction time for obtaining excellent DHPVC-g-PEA membrane properties for membrane distillation (MD) application was 1 h. The following membrane characteristics were investigated: atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle (CA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thickness and porosity as well as the pore size and how it was distributed. Grafting PVC by the 1-hr reaction time of the EA affected the morphology of the modified membranes and decreased the membrane thickness, whereas the mean and maximum pore size as well as the roughness and contact angle were improved. The DHPVC-g-PEA membrane's upper surface had a very porous structure. The pure water permeate flux of the DHPVC-g-PEA membrane was enhanced by approximately twelvefold. When operated under the specified conditions (i.e., 35, 70, 100, and 200 g/L; 0.6 L/min; and 65 °C), the DCMD results for the DHPVC-g-PEA membrane demonstrated that its salt rejection was greater than 99.9%, with a permeate conductivity below 27 μS/cm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aartificial membranes 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3acopolymerization 3adesalination 3adistillation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afree radicals 3aoxygen 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aporosity 3aroughness 3asaline water 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aMembrane modification 0aPolymer grafting 0aMembrane formation 0aDCMD 0aPVC membrane 0aDesalination1 aIbrahim, Salah S.1 aToma, Manal A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5692-56331 aAlsalhy, Qusay F.1 aDrioli, E.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1092-53680 tJournal of membrane science.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 611 p.118266-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2020.1182663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009200164300001800256520102900274536017301303592002801476596003501504596002301539650002201562650001701584650004301601650001701644650002701661650001401688650001801702653001701720653001401737653001601751653003001767700001601797700001701813700001301830700001401843700001501857773014601872856008502018852000902103655001202112IND60746324620221118105303.0210731e20210727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074632462DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2020.17775262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yong10aDetection of adulteration in food based on nondestructive analysis techniques: a review  ap. 2351-2371.  aIn recent years, people pay more and more attention to food quality and safety, which are significantly relating to human health. Food adulteration is a world-wide concerned issue relating to food quality and safety, and it is difficult to be detected. Modern detection techniques (high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometer, etc.) can accurately identify the types and concentrations of adulterants in different food types. However, the characteristics as expensive, low efficient and complex sample preparation and operation limit the use of these techniques. The rapid, nondestructive and accurate detection techniques of food adulteration is of great and urgent demand. This paper introduced the principles, advantages and disadvantages of the nondestructive analysis techniques and reviewed the applications of these techniques in food adulteration screen in recent years. Differences among these techniques, differences on data interpretation and future prospects were also discussed.  aThis work was supported by the National key R&D program of China (2018YFD0101002, 2017YFD0700501) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (61705195, 31471417).  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0101002a2017YFD0700501  a61705195a31471417 3aadulterated foods 3afood quality 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3anondestructive methods 3anutrition 3aspectrometers 0aAdulteration 0adetection 0afood safety 0anondestructive techniques1 aBai, Xiulin1 aXiao, Qinlin1 aLiu, Fei1 aZhou, Lei1 aZhang, Chu0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2021 July 27, v. 61, no. 14 p.2351-2371dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.17775263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009000170300001600260520159100276592002801867650002201895650001201917650001701929650001101946650001101957650001401968650001401982650002101996650001802017653002002035653001002055653003102065700001402096773008202110856008102192852000902273655001202282IND60638246520221120154715.0190426s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063824652DNAL7 a10.1163/22941932-900003452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajput, Kishore S.10aCambial variant and xylem structure in the stem of cocculus hirsutus (menispermaceae)  ap. 411-420.  aDevelopment of cambial variant and xylem structure were studied in the stem of Cocculus hirsutus (Menispermaceae). In the early stages of stem development several collateral vascular bundles are joined by interfascicular cambium resulting in the formation of a complete cambial cylinder. After functioning for two to three years the cambial ring ceases its activity. Subsequently a second ring of cambium is formed from the innermost cortical parenchyma cells. These parenchyma cells undergo periclinal divisions to give rise to cells that become lignified, abaxially, and cambial cells, adaxially. The cambial cells divide periclinally giving rise to individual vascular bundles with xylem and phloem. Later the cambium in each bundle is joined by interfascicular cambium. Subsequent cambia develop similarly resulting in the formation of successive rings of xylem and phloem. During the leafless condition, all the cambial rings are dormant, and flanked by mature xylem and phloem elements. With the sprouting of new leaves, either the existing outermost cambium reactivates or an entire new ring of cambium develops. The xylem is diffuseporous with indistinct growth rings. It is composed of fibre-tracheids, tracheids, vessel elements, libriform fibres, and parenchyma cells. Xylem rays are multiseriate, compound and heterocellular. Deformed libriform fibres and vessel elements commonly occur among the ray cells in all the successive rings of xylem. The length of fibres and the height and width of xylem rays increase gradually from the centre towards the periphery of the stem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCocculus hirsutus 3acambium 3agrowth rings 3aleaves 3aphloem 3asprouting 3atracheids 3avascular bundles 3axylem vessels 0aCambial variant 0axylem 0aanomalous secondary growth1 aRao, K.S.0 tIAWA journal.g, v. 24, no. 4 p.411-420dBrillwJournal:6290x0928-15417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-900003453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01620naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245005600136300001600192520041200208592002800620650001700648650002600665650001300691650001400704650001900718650001200737650001900749650001900768650002100787650001300808650001200821651001200833700002200845700003000867700001700897700001600914700001800930700002300948700002300971700002000994700002901014773012201043852000901165655001201174IND4514281120221118021107.0150917e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451428112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBussetti, Ana Valeria10aGenomic and antigenic characterization of Jos virus  ap. 293-298.  aJos virus (JOSV), originally isolated in Jos, Nigeria in 1967, has remained unclassified despite cultivation in tissue culture, development of animal models of infection and implementation of seroprevalence surveys for infection.

The molecularly imprinted sponge mesoporous silica (MISMS) material obtained was characterized by FT-IR, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. The results show that the MISMS possessed a large specific surface area (850.55m2g−1) and a highly interconnected 3-D porous network. As a result, the MISMS demonstrated a superior specific adsorption capacity of 169.22μmolg−1 and fast adsorption kinetics (reaching equilibrium within 3min) for BPA. Good class selectivity for BPA and its analogues (bisphenol F, bisphenol B, bisphenol E and bisphenol AF) was also demonstrated by the sorption experiment. The MISMS as solid-phase extraction (SPE) material was then evaluated for isolation and clean-up of these bisphenols (BPs) from sediment samples. An accurate and sensitive analytical method based on the MISMS–SPE coupled with HPLC–DAD has been successfully established for simultaneous determination of five BPs in river sediments with detection limits of 0.43–0.71ngg−1 dry weight (dw). The recoveries of BPs for lyophilizated sediment samples at two spiking levels (50 and 500ngg−1 dw for each BP) were in the range of 75.5–105.5% with RSD values below 7.5%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3abisphenol A 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amolecular imprinting 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3arivers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asediments 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aSMS 0aMISMS 0aNISMS 0aTEOS 0aICPTES 0aAPTES 0aACN 0aDCM 0aBET 0aBJH 0aTEM 0aBPs 0aBPA 0aBPF 0aBPB 0aBPE 0aBPAF 0aDDT 0aE2 0aDES 0aBPA-Si 0adw 0aMolecularly imprinted 0aSponge mesoporous silica 0aSolid-phase extraction 0aClass-selectivity 0aBisphenols1 aLi, Yun1 aWang, Jincheng1 aSun, Xiaoli1 aShah, Syed Mazhar1 aCao, Rong1 aChen, Jiping0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 853 p.311-319dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2014.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245013600157300001400293520139100307592002801698596004201726596003501768596002701803596002301830596003201853650001101885650001401896650003601910650001401946650002401960650001601984650002302000650002202023650003102045650002202076653001002098653002902108653000902137653001202146653001302158653002202171653001902193653000802212700002002220700001602240700002502256700002102281700002302302700002702325700002202352700002102374700001702395773012502412856007702537852000902614655001202623IND60699912020221121030321.0200623e20170601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069991202DNAL7 a10.1093/nutrit/nux0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeo, Lynn10aPhytochemicals to optimize cognitive function for military mission-readiness: a systematic review and recommendations for the field  ap. 49-72.  aOptimizing cognitive performance and preventing cognitive impairments that result from exposure to high-stress situations are important to ensure mission-readiness for military personnel. This systematic review assesses the quality of the evidence for plant-based foods and beverages, or their phytochemical constituents, across various outcomes related to cognitive function in healthy adult populations to develop research recommendations for the military. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials published in the English language were eligible. Twenty-five trials were included and assessed for methodological quality, and descriptive data were extracted. The acceptable (n = 16) to high-quality (n = 4) studies produced either no statistically significant effect or mixed results for enhancing cognitive function. The evidence suggested that healthy populations do not experience significant changes in cognitive performance when consuming soy- and non-soy-sourced isoflavones or cocoa. Heterogeneity among other interventions precluded reaching formal conclusions surrounding the evidence. Research recommendations are offered, including conducting more studies on the effect of plant-based interventions on populations reflective of military populations when exposed to military-like situations.  aPublisher supplied data  cUS Army Medical Research and Materiel  cofficial Department of Defense  cDepartment of the Army  cDepartment of Navy  cDepartment of the Air Force 3aadults 3abeverages 3achemical constituents of plants 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3aisoflavones 3amilitary personnel 3aplant-based foods 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review 0acocoa 0acognitive brain function 0adiet 0ahealthy 0amilitary 0amission-readiness 0aphytochemicals 0asoy1 aCrawford, Cindy1 aSnow, James1 aDeuster, Patricia A.1 aBingham, John J.1 aGallon, Matthew D.1 aO’Connell, Meghan L.1 aChittum, Holly K.1 aArzola, Sonya M.1 aBerry, Kevin0 tNutrition reviews.g2017 June 01, v. 75, no. suppl_2 p.49-72dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44763x1753-48877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nux0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245007400159300001600233520099700249592002801246650001201274650002001286650001101306650000801317650001201325650002001337650001501357650002101372650001501393651001201408773009601420856007101516852000901587655001201596IND60518536720221120123058.0160418e197103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051853672DNAL7 a10.2307/19345952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLowrie, Donald C.10aEffects of Time of Day and Weather on Spider Catches with a Sweep Net  ap. 348-351.  aThe effects of time of day, season, trampling by the collector, cattle grazing, wetness of vegetation, and air temperature are analyzed for the size of sample catches of four species of oxyopid spiders living in a long—leafed pine community of northern Florida. All of these factors modify the sizes of sample catches although there are only slight changes, if any, in the population size. Therefore, changes due to these variables can cause erroneous population size estimates and judgments on the effects of ecological factors. Night collecting, warm winter weather, periods of heavy dew, and lack of cattle grazing contribute to greater catches of Oxyopes. Sweeping as a population sampling device may be inaccurate due to the inconsistency of these factors. Sampling must be supplemented with observation of spider activities (and the same probably applies to other inhabitants of the vegetation) to evaluate properly the results of sweepings and the causes of variation in catch sizes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxyopes 3aair temperature 3acattle 3adew 3agrazing 3apopulation size 3asweep nets 3atrampling damage 3avegetation 3aFlorida0 tEcology.g1971 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.348-351dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19345953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245005400173300001600227520143100243592002801674650001901702650001301721650001001734650001301744650001201757650001301769650001101782650002501793650000901818651001201827653000901839653001601848653001401864653002401878653001601902700001601918700002401934700001501958700001801973700001801991773010602009856008702115852000902202655001202211IND60112331720221120134516.0190318s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011233172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.zoolgart.2014.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDollinger, Peter10aFlugunfähigmachen von Vögeln – Für und Wider  ap. 293-339.  aThe techniques and biological functions of avian flight are briefly presented. The reasons for rendering zoo birds flightless are explained taking into account the tasks and obligations of modern zoos, and the various deflighting procedures are described. The legal situation regarding deflighting as it currently exists in Germany and other countries is clarified. It is discussed in detail under which circumstances it would be justifiable to render a bird flightless, to what extent keeping the birds in aviaries would be an alternative and whether reversible or irreversible methods should be preferred. A legal opinion has been sought which came to the conclusion that even under the restrictive Animal Welfare Law of Germany interventions to render a bird flightless were admissible if based on veterinary indication on a case-by-case basis. Such indication may be justified by the anticipation that a bird may be injured or die from an accident in future if not deflighted. Contrary to the views of some legal experts commenting on the German Animal Welfare Law the authors consider feather clipping not to be an intervention prohibited under the law. In the interest of the good functioning of european and international breeding programmes the authors suggest that the German legislation should be modified with a view of containing a general derogation for rendering flightless at least certain species of zoo birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aaviaries 3abirds 3abreeding 3aexperts 3afeathers 3aflight 3alaws and regulations 3azoos 3aGermany 0aAves 0aDeflighting 0aEducation 0aBreeding programmes 0aLegislation1 aPagel, Theo1 aBaumgartner, Katrin1 aEncke, Dag1 aEngel, Heiner1 aFilz, Andreas0 tZoologische Garten.g2013, v. 82, no. 5-6 p.293-339dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl17422x0044-51697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zoolgart.2014.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245011600172300001600288520170800304592002802012650001502040650001202055650001802067650001002085650002102095650001202116650001402128650002002142650004302162650001002205653001202215653000902227653004002236653002402276653001902300700001502319700001902334700001802353700001902371773012402390856009002514852000902604655001202613IND60532519620221121021834.0190403e20140130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053251962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Woo-In12aA specific inhibitor of CDK1, RO-3306, reversibly arrests meiosis during in vitro maturation of porcine oocytes  ap. 102-108.  aCDK1 plays pivotal role in meiotic progression of oocytes from G2 to metaphase II (MII) stage. In this study, we investigated the possibility of utilizing a selective inhibitor of CDK1, RO-3306, as a novel agent for the synchronization of oocyte maturation. Two groups of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were treated with 10μM RO-3306. The first group was treated for 44h, whereas the second group was transferred to drug-free medium after a 20h treatment. MII-stage oocytes from each group were confirmed by cytoplasmic maturation and embryonic development assays. Treatment of immature porcine oocytes with RO-3306 for 20h arrested them at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage. The GV-arrest effect of RO-3306 was reversible: when RO-3306-arrested COCs were subsequently cultured for 24h in the absence of RO-3306, 76.19±2.68% of these oocytes reached the MII stage after 44h of in vitro maturation, a rate similar to that of non-treated control oocytes (79.08±3.23%). Furthermore, RO-3306-treated oocytes transferred to drug-free media did not differ significantly from controls (P>0.05) with respect to cleavage and blastocyst formation upon parthenogenetic activation. To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the expression patterns of four representative maternal transcripts, CDK1, Cyclin B1, GDF9, and BMP15, by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and poly(A)-test PCR (PAT assay). RO-3306 treatment increased expression of CDK1 but had no effect on the expression of the other genes. These data suggest that RO-3306 efficiently blocks and synchronizes the meiotic progression of porcine oocytes at the GV stage without affecting their meiotic and cytoplasmic maturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3acyclins 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3agerminal vesicle 3ameiosis 3ametaphase 3aparthenogenesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aswine 0aRO-3306 0aCDK1 0aMaturation/M-phase promoting factor 0aIn vitro maturation 0aPorcine oocyte1 aLin, Zi-Li1 aLee, Sung Hyun1 aNamgoong, Suk1 aKim, Nam-Hyung0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 Jan. 30, v. 144, no. 3-4 p.102-108dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245014400164300001600308520166300324592002801987650004402015650002202059650001002081650002302091650002202114650001302136650003802149650001102187650002602198650001902224650001002243650001502253650002402268650002702292650001102319650001602330650002302346650002102369650003202390653002102422653000802443653002102451653001502472653002502487700001602512773011002528856008002638852000902718655001202727IND60616430220221119080810.0181016e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061643022DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166313222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Li-Kun10aPreparation and characterization of cationic dyeable polycaprolactam modified with 5-sulfoisophthalic acid sodium and poly(ethylene glycol)  ap. 433-443.  aUnmodified nylon is dyeable to a single color only, and is almost exclusively dyed with acid dyes that are absorbed with amine groups of nylon molecules. Two types of polycaprolactam (PA6) copolyamide were successfully prepared with 5-sulfoisophthalic acid monosodium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) units named cationic dyeable polyamide (CD-PA6) and easy cationic dyeable polyamide (ECD-PA6). The chemical and crystalline structures of CD-PA6 and ECD-PA6 were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and wide angle x-ray diffraction, and their thermal properties were tested by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. In addition, the rheological behavior and mechanical properties of copolyamide are presented in this paper. The influence of chemical modification in polyamide 6 fibers on the dyeing properties was investigated using cationic dye (methylene blue). The incorporation of PEG not only destroyed the regularity of the molecular chain arrangement and created more amorphous regions of ECD-PA6 samples, but also led to nylon 6 changing from the α-form to the γ-form. In addition, the crystallinities and degradation temperatures of samples which corresponded to different mass losses of CD-PA 6 and ECD-PA6 declined as the sulfonic group content increased, since large –SO₃Na side groups in the copolymers prevented the chain molecules from tightly coagulating and obstructed the formation of larger crystals. Based on the analysis of the dyeing, a distinct improvement in tinctorial affinity and wash fastness for modified fibers compared with unmodified fibers was revealed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acolor 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adyeing 3amechanical properties 3amethylene blue 3anylon 3apolyamides 3apolyethylene glycol 3arheological properties 3asodium 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 0acationic dyeable 0aPA6 0acopolymerization 0adyeability 0astructure properties1 aYin, Cui-Yu0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 4 p.433-443dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166313223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245007000164300001800234500002000252520130700272592002801579650001601607650002001623650002401643650001701667650002401684650001001708650001401718650001301732650001201745650001101757650000701768650002301775650002101798650001401819650001201833700002401845700002901869773012601898856007902024852000902103655001202112IND60580108020221122222736.0170909e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058010802DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.138272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrenes, Manuel10aOptimization of Ripe Olive Processing with a Single Lye Treatment  ap. 2078-2084.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe development of a method for darkening black ripe olives during the washing step with a single NaOH treatment and preservation liquid was studied. Olives of the Hojiblanca cultivar were darkened at pilot plant scale, packed, sterilized, and analyzed after 2 mo of storage at ambient temperature. It was found that the use of a mixture of preservation liquid:water at a ratio of 1:1 during the first washing gave rise to darker olives with slightly better firmness and no effect on sensory quality. However, care must be taken with the concentration of acetic acid in the preservation solution, as a content of this organic acid higher than 25 g/L can cause adverse effects on olive color due to the low pH that can be reached in the flesh of the fruit. Additionally, the re‐use of the preservation solution in the first washing resulted in enrichment in antioxidant compounds of the packed product. Black ripe olives processed with preservation liquid had a total phenolic content of 629 mg/kg, whereas those with only tap water had 376 mg/kg, in particular hydroxytyrosol and hydroxytyrosol‐4‐glucoside. These findings mean that it is possible to get darker olives with higher contents in bioactive substances by reusing the preservation liquid during the darkening step of black ripe olives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadverse effects 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3acolor 3acultivars 3afirmness 3aliquids 3aolives 3apH 3asensory properties 3asodium hydroxide 3atap water 3awashing1 aRomero, Concepción1 aGarcía‐García, Pedro0 tJournal of food science.g2017 Sept., v. 82, no. 9 p.2078-2084dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.138273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245007100174300001500245520170100260592002801961650001501989650001402004650001602018650001202034650001402046653001202060653001702072653002102089653001802110700005402128700001602182700005502198700001502253700001702268700001802285700001802303773012302321856009002444852000902534655001202543IND60532519720221121022010.0190403e20140130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053251972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasparrini, B.10aInfluence of oocyte donor on in vitro embryo production in buffalo  ap. 95-101.  aThe aim of this research was to estimate the variability between buffalo as oocyte donors. In Experiment 1, reproductive variables were retrospectively analyzed in buffalo (n=40) that underwent repeated ovum pick up (OPU), over 16 puncture sessions (PS). The follicular recruitment among individuals and the relationship between follicular population and oocyte production were evaluated. In Experiment 2, eight buffalo underwent OPU for 28 PS and the oocytes were processed separately to correlate follicular and oocyte population at the first PS to blastocyst (BL) production. In Experiment 1, the average number of total follicles (TFL), small follicles (SFL), cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) and Grade A+B COC recorded in each 4-PS period had great repeatability (r=0.52, 0.54, 0.60 and 0.57, respectively). The average number of Grade A+B COC recovered during the subsequent 15 PS was positively correlated with the first PS number of TFL (r=0.60; P<0.001), SFL (r=0.68; P<0.001), COC (r=0.48; P<0.01) and Grade A+B COC (r=0.40; P<0.05). In Experiment 2, a large variability among animals was observed in blastocyst yields. When animals were grouped according to the BL yield, the greatest BL yield group had a greater (P<0.05) number of TFL (8.3±0.9 compared with 5.6±0.7) and SFL (7.3±0.3 compared with 3.8±0.7) at the first PS than the lesser BL yield group. The average number of BL produced over the subsequent sessions was correlated with the number of TFL (r=0.80; P<0.05) and COC (r=0.76; P<0.05) observed at the first PS. These results demonstrated a donor influence on the oocyte and BL production, suggesting a preliminary screening to select the donors with greater potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3abuffaloes 3acorrelation 3aoocytes 3ascreening 0aBuffalo 0aOvum pick-up 0aBlastocyst yield 0aRepeatability1 aNeglia, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0989-60721 aDi Palo, R.1 aVecchio, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8766-72241 aAlbero, G.1 aEsposito, L.1 aCampanile, G.1 aZicarelli, L.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 Jan. 30, v. 144, no. 3-4 p.95-101dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007900166300001600245520155500261592002801816650003401844650002601878650002101904650002701925650002601952650001601978650002901994650002502023650001302048650002802061650004302089650001802132650001102150650001102161650001502172650001102187650002002198650003302218650003702251650002102288650001102309653002002320653002302340653001202363653002502375653002702400700001802427700002802445700001802473700002002491700002102511773011002532856008002642852000902722655001202731IND60616430320221119080601.0181016e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061643032DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166313232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeršin, Zdenka10aBio-nanofibrous mats as potential delivering systems of natural substances  ap. 444-459.  aConsidering the increasing resistance of numerous bacteria to antibiotics, a novel wound dressing material was developed with naturally acquired olive leaf extract, which shows not only good antimicrobial activity, but also very good antioxidant activity. Besides that, the leaves are treated as waste in agriculture, giving an impact on waste management. An environmentally friendly procedure, electrospinning, was used for the first time to prepare polysaccharide nanofibrous mats with incorporated olive leaf extract, with the unique property of releasing the active phenolic components in a prolonged manner over 24 hours. The developed electrospun mats were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy for determination of free radical scavenging activity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, antimicrobial testing and release kinetics. Antimicrobial tests have shown that electrospun mats with olive leaf extract achieve reduction towards the tested microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (G+), Escherichia coli (G-), Enterococcus faecalis (G+) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (G-), while the high antioxidant activity of olive leaf extract was preserved during the electrospinning procedure. Release of olive leaf extract from electrospun mats was mathematically modeled, and the release kinetics evaluation indicates the appropriateness of the Korsmeyer–Peppas model for fitting the obtained results of release ability due to erosion of polysaccharide nanofiber mats.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3afree radical scavengers 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amodels 3ananofibers 3aolives 3apolysaccharides 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awaste management 3awastes 0aelectrospinning 0aolive leaf extract 0arelease 0aantioxidant activity 0aantimicrobial activity1 aRavber, Matej1 aStana Kleinschek, Karin1 aKnez, Željko1 aŠkerget, Mojca1 aKurečič, Manja0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 4 p.444-459dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166313233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014900164300001400313520117800327592002801505650001501533650001501548650002001563650002101583650001401604650002801618650002101646650002501667650000701692650001301699650001301712700001501725700001501740700001801755700001601773700001801789700001201807700001701819700001801836773010101854856008201955852000902037655001202046IND60091527320221116172013.0141103e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009152732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Lihua10aElectrochemical sensor based on molecularly imprinted membranes at platinum nanoparticles-modified electrode for determination of 17β-estradiol  ap. 29-33.  aIn this paper, an electrochemical sensor for 17β-estradiol (E2) based on the molecular imprinting polymer (MIP) membranes had been constructed. 6-mercaptonicotinic acid (MNA) and E2 were first assembled on the surface of platinum nanoparticles-modified glassy carbon electrode (PtNPs/GCE) by the formation of Pt–S bonds and hydrogen-bonding interactions, and subsequently the polymer membranes were formed by electropolymerization. Finally, a novel molecularly imprinted sensor (MIS) was obtained after removal of E2. Experimental parameters such as deposition time, scan cycles, pH value and accumulation condition were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the MIS exhibited a large adsorption capacity and high selectivity. A good linearity was obtained in the range of 3.0×10⁻⁸–5.0×10⁻⁵molL⁻¹ (r=0.996) with an estimated detection limit of 1.6×10⁻⁸molL⁻¹. MIS had been successfully used to analyze E2 in water samples without complex pretreatment. Meanwhile, the average recoveries were higher than 93.9% with RSD<3.7%. All results above reveal that MIS is an effective electrochemical technique to determine E2 real-time in complicated matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aestradiol 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular imprinting 3apH 3aplatinum 3apolymers1 aZhang, Jun1 aZhou, Ping1 aChen, Jiaxing1 aWang, Ruoyu1 aWen, Tingting1 aLi, Yun1 aZhou, Xuemin1 aJiang, Huijun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 29, no. 1 p.29-33dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03333naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245017800172520189000350592002802240650001702268650002102285650000802306650001602314650001602330650001902346650001602365650002502381650001002406650001102416650001102427650001702438650002502455650001402480650001802494650000902512650001102521650001402532650002202546650001002568651001702578700001802595700002402613773012302637856008202760852000902842655001202851IND60791062120221117180222.0220826e20220817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079106212DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110809272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChauhan, Ravendra P.10aMetagenomic Analysis of RNA Fraction Reveals the Diversity of Swine Oral Virome on South African Backyard Swine Farms in the uMgungundlovu District of KwaZulu-Natal Province  aNumerous RNA viruses have been reported in backyard swine populations in various countries. In the absence of active disease surveillance, a persistent knowledge gap exists on the diversity of RNA viruses in South African backyard swine populations. This is the first study investigating the diversity of oral RNA virome of the backyard swine in South Africa. We used three samples of backyard swine oral secretion (saliva) collected from three distantly located backyard swine farms (BSFs) in the uMgungundlovu District, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Total viral RNA was extracted and used for the library preparation for deep sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq X instrument. The FASTQ files containing paired-end reads were analyzed using Genome Detective v 1.135. The assembled nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the PhyML phylogenetic tree. The genome sequence analysis identified a high diversity of swine enteric viruses in the saliva samples obtained from BSF2 and BSF3, while only a few viruses were identified in the saliva obtained from BSF1. The swine enteric viruses belonged to various animal virus families; however, two fungal viruses, four plant viruses, and five unclassified RNA viruses were also identified. Specifically, viruses of the family Astroviridae, according to the number of reads, were the most prevalent. Of note, the genome sequences of Rotavirus A (RVA) and Rotavirus C (RVC) at BSF2 and RVC and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) at BSF3 were also obtained. The occurrence of various swine enteric viruses in swine saliva suggests a high risk of diarrhoeic diseases in the backyard swine. Of note, zoonotic viruses in swine saliva, such as RVA, RVC, and HEV, indicate a risk of zoonotic spillover to the exposed human populations. We recommend the implementation of biosecurity to ensure sustainable backyard swine farming while safeguarding public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstroviridae 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aRNA 3aRotavirus A 3aRotavirus C 3aanimal viruses 3abiosecurity 3adisease surveillance 3afungi 3agenome 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3arisk 3asaliva 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3aSouth Africa1 aSan, James E.1 aGordon, Michelle L.0 tPathogens.g2022 Aug. 17, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110809273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245015100163300001600314500001900330520094500349592002801294650001401322650001501336650001701351650001601368650001501384650001101399650001601410650001701426650001301443653001701456653001501473653002401488653001601512653001301528653001601541700002801557773012001585856007501705961001301780852000901793655001201802IND60698679820221118080716.0200615e20110928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069867982DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.22.20992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGates, Michael W.10aDescription of two techniques to increase efficiency in processing and curating minute arthropods, with special reference to parasitic Hymenoptera  ap. 133-140.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe describe and illustrate two techniques for enhancing curatorial and processing efficiency as it pertains to parasitic Hymenoptera (Chalcidoidea, Cynipoidea).

The first technique uses small, crystal polystyrene boxes with tight-fitting lids to store dehydrated specimens prior to mounting. Locality information is affixed to the box and specimens are spread in a layer for ease of examination by researchers. Solutions for managing static electricity within the specimen boxes are discussed. The second involves a vacuum pump connected to a funnel with a filtration membrane and flask apparatus to rapidly dehydrate hard-bodied parasitoids (Figitidae) that are not subject to collapse during air-drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFigitidae 3aair drying 3abiodiversity 3aelectricity 3afiltration 3ahumans 3aparasitoids 3apolystyrenes 3aresearch 0aChalcidoidea 0aCynipoidea 0acrystal polystyrene 0avacuum pump 0acuration 0adehydration1 aBuffington, Matthew L.,0 tJournal of Hymenoptera research.g2011 Sept. 28, v. 22 p.133-140dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2122x1314-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/jhr.22.20993Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245019300165520216500358592002802523650001402551650002402565650002102589650002602610650001802636650001302654650001802667650001402685650001102699650001702710650001802727650001002745650002202755650001702777650001002794650001302804651001102817651001202828651001502840651001502855651001702870651001302887651001102900651001302911700002502924700002002949700002302969700002102992773012303013856008203136852000903218655001203227IND60791062320221117180301.0220826e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079106232DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110809292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTawana, Mpho 10aEpidemiology of Ticks and Tick-Borne Pathogens in Domestic Ruminants across Southern African Development Community (SADC) Region from 1980 until 2021: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aTicks are hematophagous ectoparasites that are capable of infesting a wide range of mammals, including domestic animals, ruminants, wildlife, and humans across the world, and they transmit disease-causing pathogens. Numerous individual epidemiological studies have been conducted on the distribution and prevalence of ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in the Southern African Developing Community (SADC) region, but no effort has been undertaken to synchronize findings, which would be helpful in the implementation of consolidated tick control measures. With the aim of generating consolidated pooled prevalence estimates of ticks and TBDs in the SADC region, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published articles using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A deep search was performed on five electronic databases, namely, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, AJOL, and Springer Link. Of the 347 articles identified, only 61 of the articles were eligible for inclusion. In total, 18,355 tick specimens were collected, belonging to the genera Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, and Rhipicephalus (including Boophilus) across several countries, including South Africa (n = 8), Tanzania (n = 3), Zambia (n = 2), Zimbabwe (n = 2), Madagascar (n = 2), Angola (n = 2), Mozambique (n = 1), and Comoros (n = 1). The overall pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) of TBPs in livestock was 52.2%, with the highest PPE in cattle [51.2%], followed by sheep [45.4%], and goats [29.9%]. For bacteria-like and rickettsial TBPs, Anaplasma marginale had the highest PPE of 45.9%, followed by A. centrale [14.7%], A. phagocytophilum [2.52%], and A. bovis [0.88%], whilst Ehrlichia ruminantium had a PPE of 4.2%. For piroplasmids, Babesia bigemina and B. bovis had PPEs of 20.8% and 20.3%, respectively. Theileria velifera had the highest PPE of 43.0%, followed by T. mutans [29.1%], T. parva [25.0%], and other Theileria spp. [14.06%]. Findings from this study suggest the need for a consolidated scientific approach in the investigation of ticks, TBPs, and TBDs in the whole SADC region, as most of the TBDs are transboundary and require a regional control strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma 3aAnaplasma marginale 3aBabesia bigemina 3aEhrlichia ruminantium 3aHaemaphysalis 3aHyalomma 3aRhipicephalus 3aTheileria 3acattle 3aepidemiology 3ameta-analysis 3asheep 3asystematic review 3atick control 3aticks 3awildlife 3aAngola 3aComoros 3aMadagascar 3aMozambique 3aSouth Africa 3aTanzania 3aZambia 3aZimbabwe1 aOnyiche, ThankGod E.1 aRamatla, Tsepo 1 aMtshali, Sibusiso 1 aThekisoe, Oriel 0 tPathogens.g2022 Aug. 18, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110809293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245007400165506025800239520138400497592002801881650001801909650002701927650002801954650002501982650001102007650001902018650002602037650001502063650003502078650002102113650001102134650001102145650002102156650001402177651001002191653001102201653002702212653001802239653002802257653002002285653001202305700001602317700002302333700002202356700001602378700001602394773013902410856007802549852000902627655001202636IND60478798120221119062431.0160114e20150423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047879812DNAL7 a10.4081/jear.2015.45652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, A.

These parasites are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito and develop into adult worms in the lymphatic vessels, causing severe damage and swelling (lymphoedema). Mosquito control, in view of their medical as well as economical importance, assumes global importance. Geographic information system (GIS) is a powerful tool to analyse the distribution of mosquitoes and their relationship to different environmental factors, and can substantially improve our ability to quantify the impacts of demographic, climatic and ecological changes in vector distribution. In the present study Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex gelidus were recorded in the study area. Few other factors such as larval mosquito density, number of breeding sites, human population, etc. were also analysed for its impact on the distribution of Culex mosquitoes. Distribution of Culex in the present study affirmed that C. quinquefasciatus is predominant in the entire focal area, which explains the behavioural response and capability of the species in varied zones. Information gathered from this study is being used to construct a GIS-based mapping system for distribution of Culex mosquitoes in the Coimbatore District, Tamil Nadu, India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrugia malayi 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aCulex tritaeniorhynchus 3aWuchereria bancrofti 3aadults 3abreeding sites 3aenvironmental factors 3afilariasis 3ageographic information systems 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3alarvae 3amosquito control 3aparasites 3aIndia 0aArcGIS 0aCulex quinquefasciatus 0aCulex gelidus 0aCulex tritaeniorhynchus 0alarval habitats 0amapping1 aMurugan, K.1 aVincent, C.

The ATP-binding aptamers hybridize with the probe DNA (DNAₚ) immobilized NPs to form the aptamer/DNAₚ duplex on the NPs surface. The conformational change of the aptamer leads to the decrease of the aptamer/DNAₚ duplex on the NPs due to the ATP-binding aptamer switches its structure from the aptamer/DNAₚ duplex to the aptamer/target complex in the presence of ATP. ATP detection can be easily realized by separating the silica nanoparticles and adding the hoechst33258 of intercalating to aptamer/DNAₚ (dsDNA). Good selectivity between ATP and CTP, GTP or UTP has been demonstrated, which is due to the specific recognition between ATP aptamer and ATP. The Kd was estimated to be ∼1mM from 0 to 4mM and a liner response was observed from 0 to 0.2mM with a detection limit of ∼20μM. Compared with other methods, the carboxyl-modified silica nanoparticles (∼60nm) prepared by the reverse microemulsion method can serve as a stable and sensitive sensor platform because of their smaller size and facile conjugation with amine-containing molecules. In addition, the high sensitivity and selectivity of hoechst33258 was employed for the ssDNA and dsDNA determination, which takes advantage of the label-free aptamer and lower cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aguanosine triphosphate 3ananoparticles 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoligonucleotides 3asilica 3asingle-stranded DNA 3auridine triphosphate1 aChen, Ze-Zhong1 aDong, Xiao-Min1 aTang, Hong-Wu1 aPang, Dai-Wen0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 29, no. 1 p.46-52dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011000171500001900281520157900300592002801879650001901907650002301926650001301949650001901962650001901981650002202000650002402022650001402046650001802060650001902078650001602097650002502113650001902138650001102157650001602168650001502184650002002199650001802219650000902237650002802246650001602274650001002290653001802300653001602318653003202334653001802366700001802384700002202402700001802424700002002442700002602462773011802488856008602606852000902692655001202701IND60736752820221123031712.0210601e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073675282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1136012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Pervinder10aNanoemulsion of Foeniculum vulgare essential oil: A propitious striver against weeds of Triticum aestivum  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEssential oil based bioherbicides are topic of interest for the new era agriculture because of growing concern worldwide to develop herbicide with low environmental impact. In the present study, oil in water nanoemulsions of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) essential oil were formulated by ultrasonic emulsification method and evaluated for herbicidal potential against Phalaris minor Retz., Avena ludoviciana Durieu, Rumex dentatus L. and Medicago denticulata Willd through Petri dish bioassay. The germination of P. minor, A. ludoviciana, R. dentatus and M. denticulata was totally inhibited at concentrations 0.4, 0.3, 0.3 and 0.05 wt%. Major constituents of F. vulgare essential oil, estragole, anethole and binary mixture did not completely inhibit the germination of the tested weed species even at highest concentrations. Nanoemulsions having 0.05 and 0.01 wt% F. vulgare essential oil were spherical in nature with average size below 130 nm and have good stability to centrifugation and dilution. The formulated nanoemulsions were clear and transparent even after 30 days of storage at ambient temperature. Nanoemulsions were more effective and completely inhibited the germination of P. minor, A. ludoviciana, R. dentatus and M. denticulata even at low dose of 0.05 wt% by adversely affecting the physiological processes like membrane leakage and reactive oxygen species mediated cellular damage. Nanoemulsions of F. vulgare essential oil have bioherbicidal properties and can contribute to the development of alternative tool for sustainable management of weeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sterilis 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3aMedicago 3aPhalaris minor 3aRumex dentatus 3aTriticum aestivum 3aambient temperature 3abioassays 3abiopesticides 3acentrifugation 3aemulsifying 3aenvironmental impact 3aessential oils 3afennel 3agermination 3aherbicides 3amethyl chavicol 3ananoemulsions 3aoils 3areactive oxygen species 3aultrasonics 3aweeds 0aEssential oil 0aAllelopathy 0aFennel (Foeniculum vulgare) 0aBioherbicides1 aGupta, Sonali1 aKaur, Khushwinder1 aKaur, Navjyot1 aKumar, Rajender1 aBhullar, Makhan Singh0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 168 p.113601-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.1136013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245014100177300001400318520174500332592002802077650001402105650001102119650002102130650001202151650001402163650001902177650002002196650002002216653001902236653002002255653001802275653002002293653001102313700001802324700005802342700002102400700001902421700002002440700002002460773012202480856009002602852000902692655001202701IND60532520120221119095521.0190403e20140130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053252012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorto-Filho, R.M.10aDetection of estrous behavior in buffalo heifers by radiotelemetry following PGF2α administration during the early or late luteal phase  ap. 90-94.  aThis study examined the usefulness of radiotelemetry for estrous detection in buffalo heifers and the impact of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) administration during the early or late luteal phase on estrous behavior and ovulatory follicle variables. Induction of estrus with PGF2α at a random stage of the estrous cycle was followed by the arbitrary division of heifers into groups receiving a second dose of PGF2α during either the early (n=33) or late (n=17) luteal phase (6–9 or 11–14 days after estrus, respectively) for the induction of synchronized estrus. The electronic detection of synchronized estrus by radiotelemetry was confirmed using ultrasonography every 6h until ovulation. Radiotelemetry was 90% efficient and 100% accurate for estrous detection. Intervals between the PGF2α dose and the beginning of synchronized estrus (40.7±10.9 vs. 56.7±12.8h) or ovulation (70.0±11.3 vs. 85.6±12.5h) were shorter (P<0.05) for heifers receiving PGF2α during the early luteal phase. PGF2α administration during the early or late luteal phase produced similar (P>0.05) results for the duration of estrus, the intervals from the beginning or end of estrus to ovulation, the number and duration of mounts per estrus, the duration of mounts, the diameter of the ovulatory follicle and the luteal profile on day 5 after estrus. In conclusion, radiotelemetry was a suitable tool for the efficient and accurate detection of estrus in buffalo heifers. Treatment with PGF2α during the early luteal phase had a shorter interval to synchronized estrus and ovulation; however, estrous behavior, ovulatory follicle dynamics and subsequent luteal activity were similar following PGF2α administration during the early or late luteal phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffaloes 3aestrus 3aestrus detection 3aheifers 3aovulation 3aprostaglandins 3aradio telemetry 3aultrasonography 0aRadiotelemetry 0aBuffalo heifers 0aProstaglandin 0aSynchronization 0aEstrus1 aGimenes, L.U.1 aMonteiro, B.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4272-97401 aCarvalho, N.A.T.1 aGhuman, S.P.S.1 aMadureira, E.H.1 aBaruselli, P.S.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2014 Jan. 30, v. 144, no. 3-4 p.90-94dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008300165300001600248500001900264500000900283520184500292592002802137650002202165650001402187650001302201650003702214650001702251651001202268700001502280700001902295700002102314773012002335856008402455852000902539655001202548IND60665225520221119232157.0191228e200005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066522552DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2000.403597x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Weikai10aCultivar Evaluation and Mega-Environment Investigation Based on the GGE Biplot  ap. 597-605.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aCultivar evaluation and mega-environment identification are among the most important objectives of multi-environment trials (MET). Although the measured yield is a combined result of effects of genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype × environment interaction (GE), only G and GE are relevant to cultivar evaluation and mega-environment identification. This paper presents a GGE (i.e., G + GE) biplot, which is constructed by the first two symmetrically scaled principal components (PC1 and PC2) derived from singular value decomposition of environment-centered MET data. The GGE biplot graphically displays G plus GE of a MET in a way that facilitates visual cultivar evaluation and mega-environment identification. When applied to yield data of the 1989 through 1998 Ontario winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) performance trials, the GGE biplots clearly identified yearly winning genotypes and their winning niches. Collective analysis of the yearly biplots suggests two winter wheat mega-environments in Ontario: a minor mega-environment (eastern Ontario) and a major one (southern and western Ontario), the latter being traditionally divided into three subareas. There were frequent crossover GE interactions within the major mega-environment but the location groupings were variable across years. It therefore could not be further divided into meaningful subareas. It was revealed that in most years PC1 represents a proportional cultivar response across locations, which leads to noncrossover GE interactions, while PC2 represents a disproportional cultivar response across locations, which is responsible for any crossover GE interactions. Consequently, genotypes with large PC1 scores tend to give higher average yield, and locations with large PC1 scores and near-zero PC2 scores facilitates identification of such genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acultivars 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3awinter wheat 3aOntario1 aHunt, L.A.1 aSheng, Qinglai1 aSzlavnics, Zorka0 tCrop science.g2000 May, v. 40, no. 3 p.597-605dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2000.403597x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245011200165300001400277500001900291520142800310592002801738650001101766650001501777650002401792650001401816650001601830650001401846650001301860653002101873653001601894653001601910653001301926653001601939700002401955700002201979773011702001856007502118852000902193655001202202IND60698680220221116232545.0200615e20111021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069868022DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.23.11002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharkey, Michael J.12aA new genus of Agathidinae with the description of a new species parasitic on Samea multiplicalis (Guenée)  ap. 43-53.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new genus of Agathidinae (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), Neothlipsis, is proposed to include 10 species.

One of the most popular oil seeds is safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), which belongs to the Asteraceae family. Due to the ability of this plant to grow in dry and semi-dry conditions, safflower oil has the potential to be a commercially profitable product in Iran. Seasonal populations of safflower capsule flies were studied in Kohgiluyeh safflower farms, Iran, from March to May in 2008 and 2009. Four yellow sticky traps were used to monitor populations of fruit flies in the safflower farms. Traps were checked once a week during the sampling period. The traps were emptied weekly into insect collection vials containing 70% ethanol. Data were analysed with a two-way ANOVA. The relation between abiotic factors and species abundance was analysed with multiple linear regression. The results emphasized that Acanthiophilus helianthi was the most serious pest of safflower under the ecological conditions found in Gachsaran, being present in the field throughout three months of the year (March to May). Chaetorellia carthami was present in safflower fields from March to May, but in significant numbers only during April and May. Terellia luteola was present in safflower fields from March to May and in significant numbers only in late April, it does not seem to be a serious pest in safflower farms under Gachsaran’s ecological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthiophilus helianthi 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aChaetorellia carthami 3aHelianthus annuus 3aTerellia 3aanalysis of variance 3aannuals 3acanola 3aethanol 3afarms 3aflax 3afruit flies 3ainsect collection 3alinear models 3apests 3apopulation dynamics 3asafflower oil 3asoybeans 3asticky traps 3atree fruits 3avegetable oil 3aIran 0aFruit flies 0aAcanthiophilus helianthi 0aChaetorellia carthami 0aTerellia luteola 0apopulation fluctuation 0aKohgiluyeh va Boyerahmad province1 aMirfakhraei, S.1 aMehrkhou, F.0 tJournal of entomological and acarological research.g2015 Aug. 28, v. 47, no. 2dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2279-70847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jear.2015.46843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010000166300001600266520100700282592002801289650002101317650001201338650001701350653001601367653002001383653001701403653002001420700001901440700002701459700001901486773011001505856008001615852000901695655001201704IND60616430920221119080750.0181016e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061643092DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166324762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVas, László M10aNew method for determining the bending modulus of solid and hollow fibers from deflection tests  ap. 542-551.  aThe bending moduli of solid and hollow glass fibers were determined by means of fiber deflection tests. The test method was modified by measuring both the vertical and horizontal displacements of the end of the deflected fiber, without increasing the number of tested fibers, in order to reduce the high scatter of conventional test results obtained by measuring only the vertical displacement. Upper and lower boundary curves of the fiber end displacements were determined to filter out inaccurate measurements, for example, when the neutral line of the fiber is not a plane but a spatial curve. The mean and coefficient of variation of the fiber bending modulus were estimated from the recorded coordinates of the fiber ends, applying two newly-developed statistical evaluation methods based on the individual coordinates or on their average. After comparing several evaluation methods, it was demonstrated that the individual coordinate-based method provided the least relative error of the average.  aPublisher supplied data 3abending strength 3afabrics 3aglass fibers 0aglass fiber 0adeflection test 0ahollow fiber 0abending modulus1 aKling, Sándor1 aCzigány, T.q(Tibor),1 aCzél, Gergely0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 5 p.542-551dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166324763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245006300174520164500237592002801882650002001910650002601930650000801956650001601964650002601980650002702006650001602033650002102049650002002070650001302090650001602103650001602119650003002135700002102165700001702186700002102203700002502224700002002249773012302269856008202392852000902474655001202483IND60791062820221120030512.0220826e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079106282DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110809302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonald, Jacquelyn R.10aLocalization of Epigenetic Markers in Leishmania Chromatin  aEukaryotes use histone variants and post-translation modifications (PTMs), as well as DNA base modifications, to regulate DNA replication/repair, chromosome condensation, and gene expression. Despite the unusual organization of their protein-coding genes into large polycistronic transcription units (PTUs), trypanosomatid parasites also employ a “histone code” to control these processes, but the details of this epigenetic code are poorly understood. Here, we present the results of experiments designed to elucidate the distribution of histone variants and PTMs over the chromatin landscape of Leishmania tarentolae. These experiments show that two histone variants (H2A.Z and H2B.V) and three histone H3 PTMs (H3K4me3, H3K16ac, and H3K76me3) are enriched at transcription start sites (TSSs); while a histone variant (H3.V) and the trypanosomatid-specific hyper-modified DNA base J are located at transcription termination sites (TTSs). Reduced nucleosome density was observed at all TTSs and TSSs for RNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I (RNAPI) or RNAPIII; as well as (to a lesser extent) at TSSs for the PTUs transcribed by RNAPII. Several PTMs (H3K4me3, H3K16ac H3K20me2 and H3K36me3) and base J were enriched at centromeres, while H3K50ac was specifically associated with the periphery of these centromeric sequences. These findings significantly expand our knowledge of the epigenetic markers associated with transcription, DNA replication and/or chromosome segregation in these early diverging eukaryotes and will hopefully lay the groundwork for future studies to elucidate how they control these fundamental processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aLeishmania tarentolae 3aRNA 3acentromeres 3achromosome morphology 3achromosome segregation 3aepigenetics 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3ahistones 3anucleobases 3anucleosomes 3atranscription termination1 aJensen, Bryan C.1 aSur, Aakash 1 aWong, Iris L.

In the presence of acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) as a substrate, ZnSNPs promoted electron transfer reactions at a lower potential and catalyzed electrochemical oxidation of enzymatically formed thiocholine, thus increasing detection sensitivity. Under optimum conditions (phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 and 30°C), the inhibition of AChE by malathion and chlorpyrifos was proportional to their concentrations in the range, 0.1–50nM and 1.5–40nM, respectively. The biosensor determined malathion and chlorpyrifos in spiked tap water samples with a acceptable accuracy (95–100%).

A.10aProspecting for Unannotated Enzymes: Discovery of a 3′,5′-Nucleotide Bisphosphate Phosphatase within the Amidohydrolase Superfamily  ap. 591-600.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn bacteria, 3′,5′-adenosine bisphosphate (pAp) is generated from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate in the sulfate assimilation pathway, and from coenzyme A by the transfer of the phosphopantetheine group to the acyl-carrier protein. pAp is subsequently hydrolyzed to 5′-AMP and orthophosphate, and this reaction has been shown to be important for superoxide stress tolerance. Herein, we report the discovery of the first instance of an enzyme from the amidohydrolase superfamily that is capable of hydrolyzing pAp. Crystal structures of Cv1693 from Chromobacterium violaceum have been determined to a resolution of 1.9 Å with AMP and orthophosphate bound in the active site. The enzyme has a trinuclear metal center in the active site with three Mn²⁺ ions. This enzyme (Cv1693) belongs to the Cluster of Orthologous Groups cog0613 from the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase family of enzymes. The values of kcₐₜ and kcₐₜ/Kₘ for the hydrolysis of pAp are 22 s–¹ and 1.4 × 10⁶ M–¹ s–¹, respectively. The enzyme is promiscuous and is able to hydrolyze other 3′,5′-bisphosphonucleotides (pGp, pCp, pUp, and pIp) and 2′-deoxynucleotides with comparable catalytic efficiency. The enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing short oligonucleotides (pdA)₅, albeit at rates much lower than that of pAp. Enzymes from two other enzyme families have previously been found to hydrolyze pAp at physiologically significant rates. These enzymes include CysQ from Escherichia coli (cog1218) and YtqI/NrnA from Bacillus subtilis (cog0618). Identification of the functional homologues to the experimentally verified pAp phosphatases from cog0613, cog1218, and cog0618 suggests that there is relatively little overlap of enzymes with this function in sequenced bacterial genomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3aEscherichia coli 3aactive sites 3aadenosine monophosphate 3abacteria 3acatalytic activity 3acoenzyme A 3acrystal structure 3aenzymes 3agenome 3ahydrolysis 3aions 3amanganese 3aoligonucleotides 3aorthophosphates 3astress tolerance 3asulfates1 aVetting, Matthew1 aGhodge, Swapnil V.1 aXu, Chengfu1 aHillerich, Brandan1 aSeidel, Ronald D.1 aAlmo, Steven C.1 aRaushel, Frank M.0 tBiochemistry.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 53, no. 3 p.591-600dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi401640r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001800181245010900199300001600308506007600324520145100400592002801851506003701879650002101916650002601937650001301963650001101976650001701987650001602004650002402020650000902044650001702053650001402070650001502084650002402099650001702123650001202140650004102152650005302193650004202246650000902288650005802297650001102355650000902366650005902375650001502434650001702449650002202466650006302488650002202551700001902573700001802592700002002610700001902630700002102649700002002670700001502690773011602705856004102821852000902862655001202871IND50066746720221207075330.0130528e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006674672DNAL7 a235816082pmid7 aPMC37081042pmcid7 a10.1111/jsap.120642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeakin, L.

METHODS: Case records were reviewed retrospectively to identify dogs with post thoracic surgery pyothorax, defined as septic neutrophilic inflammation within the pleural space based on cytology and/or a positive bacterial culture of pleural fluid. Those identified were reviewed for potential risk factors for postoperative pyothorax based on biological plausibility and previously published data. These potential risk factors were explored by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 232 dogs undergoing thoracic surgery, 15 (6·5%) dogs developed pyothorax. Bacteria cultured included methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi‐resistant Escherichia coli. Of these dogs, six died, four were euthanased and five were treated successfully. A diagnosis of idiopathic chylothorax [Odds Ratio (OR)=12·5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=2·7‐58·5, P=0·001], preoperative intrathoracic biopsy (OR=14·3, 95% CI=1·7‐118·7, P=0·014) and preoperative thoracocentesis (OR=11·2, 95% CI=1·6‐78·2, P=0·015) were identified as independent risk factors for development of postoperative pyothorax. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Idiopathic chylothorax, intrathoracic biopsy and prior thoracocentesis are independent risk factors for postoperative pyothorax, which was associated with a 67% mortality rate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3abiopsy 3acell biology 3achylothorax 3aconfidence interval 3adogs 3ainflammation 3amortality 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 2aAnimals 2aBiopsyxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aChylothoraxxcomplicationsxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aDog Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aDogs 2aEmpyema, Pleuralxepidemiologyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPostoperative Complicationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aSurvival Analysis 2aThoracic Surgical Proceduresxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aTreatment Outcome1 aSalonen, L.

Yet with agricultural industrialization, rural forests have been in decline in many regions across Europe. To reverse this trend and promote the sustainable use of farmland, ‘greening’ measures have been introduced by the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in recent years. However, their effectiveness depends on local farmers’ values and reaction to these measures. In this study, we investigated the socio-cultural value accorded to rural forests in southwestern France by interviewing 19 farmers. The positive and negative contributions cited were categorized as ecosystem services/disservices and analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. The results indicate that farmers in this region have mixed views, as they cited 32 positive and 25 negative contributions (material and non-material) of rural forests. They felt trees provide services (e.g. erosion control, windbreak) and disservices to agriculture (e.g. decline in yield, damage to tractors and infrastructures). Depending on their farming practices, farmers had contrasting opinions on how to reconcile rural forests and agriculture. Our results suggest that CAP greening measures need to better target rural forest conservation and further adapt to local contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAgroforestry 0aTrees on farm 0aLocal knowledge 0aLandscape features 0aFarmer studies 0aEU Common Agricultural Policy1 aSourdril, Anne1 aDeconchat, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4638-38581 aBarnaud, Cécile,1 aSan Cristobal, Magali1 aAndrieu, Emilie0 tEcosystem services.g2020 Apr., v. 42 p.101066-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.1010663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245016100210300001600371520141000387592002801797650001101825650001901836650001201855650002101867650002901888650001301917650002801930650001301958650000901971650002401980650002802004650000902032650002102041651001502062653000802077653000902085653001402094653001202108653001602120653001702136700002002153700001402173700002002187773012502207856008302332852000902415655001202424IND60525450220221121225738.0201202e20160115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052545022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowlings, David W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1618-930910aAnnual nitrogen dynamics and urea fertilizer recoveries from a dairy pasture using 15N; effect of nitrification inhibitor DMPP and reduced application rates  ap. 216-225.  aDirect nitrogen (N) losses from pastures contribute to the poor nitrogen use efficiency of the dairy industry, though the exact fate of applied N and the processes involved are largely unknown. Nitrification inhibitors such as DMPP can potentially increase fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE), though few studies globally have examined the effectiveness of DMPP coated urea in pastures. This study quantified the NUE of DMPP combined with reduced application rates, and the effect on N dynamics and plant–soil interactions over an annual ryegrass/kikuyu rotation in Queensland, Australia.Labeled ¹⁵N urea and DMPP was applied over 7 winter applications at standard farmer (45kgNha⁻¹) and half (23kgNha⁻¹) rates. Fertilizer recoveries and NUE were calculated over 13 harvests, and the contribution of fertilizer and soil N estimated. Up to 85% of the annual N harvested was from soil organic matter. DMPP at the lower rate increased annual yields by 31% compared to the equivalent urea treatment with no difference to the high N rates. Almost 40% of the N added at the conventional fertilizer application rate as urea was lost to the environment; 80kgNha⁻¹ higher than the low DMPP. Combining the nitrification inhibitor DMPP with reduced fertilizer application rates shows substantial potential to reduce N losses to the environment while sustaining productivity in subtropical dairy pastures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium 3adairy industry 3afarmers 3afertilizer rates 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3apastures 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asoil-plant interactions 3aurea 3aurea fertilizers 3aQueensland 0aNUE 0aDMPP 0aInhibitor 0aPasture 0aSubtropical 0a15N recovery1 aScheer, Clemens1 aLiu, Shen1 aGrace, Peter R.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 216 p.216-225dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245015800166300001400324520216700338592002802505650001302533650002202546650001602568650001402584650002002598650002502618650001502643650001002658650001402668650001502682650002602697650001202723650002202735650001302757650002002770650001802790650002002808650001702828650002402845650001102869650001902880650001402899651001502913700001802928700001802946773008802964856008303052852000903135655001203144IND4472939820221120195740.0141112e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447293982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2011.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraunack, M.V.10aReduced tillage planting and the long-term effect on soil-borne disease and yield of sugarcane (Saccharum inter-specific hybrid) in Queensland, Australia  ap. 85-91.  aPachymetra is a major root disease of sugarcane causing yield and economic loss in the Australian sugar industry, with planting of resistant cultivars being the control strategy practiced by the industry. To adopt reduced tillage and not be affected by soil compaction in the old inter-row it is necessary to re-plant into the old crop row. The hypothesis was: would reduced tillage and planting in the old crop row in conjunction with rotation of resistant and susceptible cultivars minimise the effect of this soil borne disease on crop yield? To facilitate the adoption of reduced tillage in the Australian sugar industry randomized block field experiments were undertaken on Alfisols, near Tully, north Queensland and Bundaberg, south Queensland, Australia comparing reduced tillage with conventional cultivation for planting sugarcane Results showed that, providing Pachymetra resistant cultivars were used, there was no yield reduction with reduced tillage. Levels of Pachymetra remained close to the threshold of 40,000 spores per kilogram of soil under the resistant cultivar but increased under the susceptible cultivar as the crop cycle progressed. Planting a resistant cultivar after a susceptible cultivar or vice versa did not affect cane yield. Over a crop cycle of a plant and three ratoons at Bundaberg the average yields of the susceptible and resistant cultivars were 114 and 89t/ha, respectively, an increase of 28% with the resistant cultivar. Similarly at Tully the average yield for the resistant and susceptible cultivar was 75 and 69t/ha, a 9% increase in yield with the resistant cultivar. Earthworm numbers recovered quicker under reduced tillage compared with conventional tillage suggesting that in the medium to long-term soil health will benefit by the adoption of reduced tillage for planting sugarcane. Reduced tillage did not affect the population of Pratylenchus zeae and increased the number of Rotylenchus nematodes under stool sprayout compared with all other tillage treatments. It is concluded that sugarcane cultivars are available that allow the adoption of reduced tillage in Pachymetra areas without compromising yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aPratylenchus zeae 3aRotylenchus 3aSaccharum 3acontrol methods 3aconventional tillage 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acultivars 3aearthworms 3afield experimentation 3ahybrids 3along term effects 3aplanting 3areduced tillage 3aroot diseases 3asoil compaction 3asoil quality 3asoil-borne diseases 3aspores 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3aQueensland1 aGarside, A.L.1 aMagarey, R.C.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2012 Apr., v. 120 p.85-91dElsevier B.V.x0167-19877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2011.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001800163245006700181300001600248500001900264500000900283520161400292592002801906650003801934650002501972650001101997650001402008650001102022650001302033650001202046650001502058650001102073650001402084650001102098650001102109650001702120700001902137700001602156700002002172773012202192856009802314852000902412655001202421IND60665226220221119232040.0191122e198109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066522622DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1981.0011183X002100050024x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanson, A.

Because gramine occurs in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaves, 20 cultivars of barley and four races of Hordeum spontaneum Koch were analyzed for gramine and related alkaloids after growth in controlled environments (21/16 C, day/night) to the fourleaf stage. Shoot gramine levels ranged from <30 to >10,000 μg/dry wt; 10 ‘high-gramme’ genotypes (six H. vulgare, four H. spontaneum) contained at least 2,000 μg/g. Other indole alkaloids were absent or present only in trace amounts. Beginning at the two-leaf stage, the high-gramine barley cultivars ‘Arimar’ and ‘Maraini’ were grown for 2 weeks at 21/16 C and 30/25 C, with either adequate or limited water supply. Growth of both cultivars at the higher temperatures approximately doubled their gramine concentrations (to about 4,000 μg/g). Cyclic wilting, which resulted from limiting irrigation, did not greatly affect gramine concentrations. In a cool, spring, field planting at a loamy, non-irrigated site, the gramine concentration in Arimar shoots was 1,700 μg/g at the three-to-four-leaf stage, but fell to 200 μg/g at the six leaf stage. In a warm, summer, field planting at a sandy irrigated site, the gramine concentrations at both three-to-four and six-leaf stages were ≥2,700 μg/g in Arimar and ≥4,500 μg/g in Maraini. Gramine merits attention as a potential anti-quality factor in breeding programs for barley suited to grazing or other forage uses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3abarley 3acultivars 3aforage 3agenotype 3agramine 3airrigation 3aleaves 3aruminants 3aspring 3asummer 3awater supply1 aTraynor, P.

However, organic production is only defined by the ban of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers and each farmer can still apply a wide variety of management practices that may also directly and indirectly influence arthropod biodiversity. Taking epigeal spiders inhabiting apple orchards as a case study, we first characterised the main agricultural practices applied in 20 selected organic orchards around Avignon in the South-East of France. Using ordination (PCA) and classification (HAC) methods, we identify three groups within these organic apple orchards: (i) the Biodynamy group, (ii) the Net group and (iii) the Classic group. The growers from the Biodynamy group used significantly less insecticides (40% less than those from the Classic group) and had more favourable habitat management practices (hedge and ground cover). We then sampled spider communities in each orchard in spring (April) and summer (June) using pitfall traps and showed that the spider communities in the Biodynamy and Net groups were significantly more abundant (+4% on average), species rich (+60% on average) and diverse (+70% on average) than those in the Classic group. GLM analysis showed that these differences were mainly due to reduced insecticide use but also the hedge quality of these orchards. A trait-based approach was further used to differentiate the spiders found in the three groups of orchards. The most striking finding was that spiders that use webs to forage (Linyphiidae, Agenilidae and Titanoecidae) were favoured in the Net group. This is probably because these nets protect the orchards from the major pest, allowing reduced pesticide use but also because the nets protect orchards from the windy conditions frequently observed around Avignon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLinyphiidae 3aapples 3aarthropods 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3afertilizers 3agrowers 3ahabitat conservation 3ainsecticides 3aorchards 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3apests 3apitfall traps 3aspring 3asummer 3aFrance 0aOrganic pesticides 0aTrait-based approach 0aBiodynamy 0aInsect-proof nets1 aMazzia, Christophe1 aPasquet, Alain1 aCornic, Jean-François1 aHedde, Mickaël1 aCapowiez, Yvan0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 216 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01605naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245017200160300002000332520060900352592002800961650002400989650001401013650001301027650001601040650001101056650001301067650001601080773012401096856007401220852000901294655001201303IND60640853020221121212605.0190505e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064085302DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra10801f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahu, Pramod K.10aRole of surfactant and micelle promoted mild, green, highly efficient and sustainable approach for construction of novel fused pyrimidines at room temperature in water  ap. 67651-67661.  aA facile, efficient and green protocol for surfactant catalyzed synthesis of fused pyrimidines in water at room temperature was developed for the first time.

These pretreatment regimes reduce assay throughput and increase testing costs. Technologies that make it possible to eliminate sample pretreatment are of great industrial interest. Here we report the development of a dual-signal flow injected analysis device which eliminates the need for sample pretreatment. The device employs thermal traducers to measure the signal from an enzyme and a reference column. This makes it possible to independently monitor and correct for non-specifically generated heat, thereby eliminating the need for sample pretreatment. The ability of the dual-signal device to determine urea and lactate in milk samples without any prior treatment was evaluated. The spiked milk samples, the urea assay had a linear range from 0.1 to 50mM (R=0.996), and the lactate assay had a linear range from 0.025 to 5.0mM (R=0.9998). The linear regression values for urea and lactate for 0.5%, 1.5% and 3.0% fat milk were at least 0.990. The dual-signal design improves assay reproducibility, accuracy and sensitivity. Addition benefits are shorter assay times and lowers costs, as well as reducing equipment and training requirements. The potential application of the technology for multi-analyte analysis in point of care and decentralized diagnostic testing in healthcare, agriculture and environmental areas is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood 3ahealth services 3aheat 3alinear models 3amilk 3amilk fat 3aurea1 aAndersson, Anneli1 aMecklenburg, Michael1 aXie, Bin1 aZhou, Yikai0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 29, no. 1 p.115-118dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01677naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245013400162300001400296500001900310520051100329592002800840650001500868650001400883650001600897650001300913651001700926653001600943653001700959653002000976653001600996653001401012653001301026700002401039700002701063773011701090856007501207852000901282655001201291IND60698680920221116232810.0200615e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069868092DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.24.19092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTucker, Erika M.12aA new species-group of Camptothlipsis (Braconidae, Agathidinae) from South Africa, with notes on the evolution of long mouthparts  ap. 59-74.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new species-group of Camptothlipsis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Agathidinae), Lingualongis, endemic to the Western Cape of South Africa is proposed and three new species are described, i.e., Camptothlipsis lingualongis, Camptothlipsis aagota and Camptothlipsis inertusursus.

Conductive fibers have already been developed by many research groups using metal and carbon nanotubes (CNT); however, productivity is limited. Conductive fibers composed of conductive additives embedded in a polymer matrix were fabricated by a melt-spinning process. This enables the scaling-up of production and gives high mechanical strength compared to fibers prepared by other processes. Silver (Ag) was selected for the conductive material, and embedded in polypropylene (PP) fiber. However, the melt-spinning process has an inherently lower filler content threshold; therefore, it was difficult to fabricate with sufficient silver for the required electrical properties. CNT forests were introduced to make up for this shortcoming, and they could serve as a conductive bridge between unconnected Ag. The CNT percolation effect confirmed that non-conductive Ag/PP increases electrical conductivity after CNTs were added. It was determined that 80 nm Ag (46 wt%) and single wall CNT (4 wt%) embedded PP composite fiber (Ag80/SW_46/4) was the optimum fiber; with a thickness of less than 100 µm its electrical conductivity was 4.1–7.2 × 10⁻² S/cm. Conductive fabric was fabricated using our composite fiber, and it had higher electrical conductivity than that of a single fiber because multi-filaments induced lower electrical resistance.

Size and lipid effect on the relationship between fin and muscle were also investigated. Dorsal muscle (DM) and fin clip (FC) were collected from A. sinensis with different body length (120–373 mm) in the Yangtze Estuary for isotope analysis. The result showed that (1) muscle isotope values could estimated by the values of fin, from either use the regression model (δ¹³CDM = 0.939 × FC − 2.577; δ¹⁵NDM = 0.737 × FC + 4.638) or constants factors (δ¹³CDM = δ¹³CFC − 1.27; δ¹⁵NDM = δ¹⁵NFC + 0.59); (2) no size‐based relationships with δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N from either fin or muscle; (3) lipid extraction significantly improving the fin and muscle regression model fit for both δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values. Therefore, this study support the use of nonlethal fin tissues for isotope analysis of juvenile A. sinensis, and will allow trophic studies to avoid the effect of lipid accumulation from muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser sinensis 3abody length 3acarbon 3aestuaries 3ajuveniles 3alipids 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3aregression analysis 3astable isotopes 3atissues1 aXu, C.1 aWang, Y.1 aYang, G.1 aZhang, T.

The aim of this study was to evaluate different methods in terms of recovery efficiencies of bacteriophage PP7 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, measured by real-time PCR, using it as a viral control process in water analysis. Different nucleic acid extraction methods (silica–guanidinium thiocyanate, a commercial kit (Qiagen Viral RNA Kit) and phenol–chloroform with alcohol precipitation) exhibited very low recovery efficiencies (0.08–4.18 %), being the most efficient the commercial kit used for subsequent experiments. To evaluate the efficiency of three concentration methods, PBS (as model for clean water) and water samples from rivers were seeded to reach high (HC, 10⁶ pfu ml⁻¹) and low concentrations (LC, 10⁴ pfu ml⁻¹) of PP7. Tangential ultrafiltration proved to be more efficient (50.36 ± 12.91, 17.21 ± 9.22 and 12.58 ± 2.35 % for HC in PBS and two river samples, respectively) than adsorption–elution with negatively charged membranes (1.00 ± 1.34, 2.79 ± 2.62 and 0.05 ± 0.08 % for HC in PBS and two river samples, respectively) and polyethylene glycol precipitation (15.95 ± 7.43, 4.01 ± 1.12 and 3.91 ± 0.54 %, for HC in PBS and two river samples, respectively), being 3.2–50.4 times more efficient than the others for PBS and 2.7–252 times for river samples. Efficiencies also depended on the initial virus concentration and aqueous matrixes composition. In consequence, the incorporation of an internal standard like PP7 along the process is useful as a control of the water concentration procedure, the nucleic acid extraction, the presence of inhibitors and the variability of the recovery among replicas, and for the calculation of the sample limit of detection. Thus, the use of a process control, as presented here, is crucial for the accurate quantification of viral contamination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPseudomonas phages 3aRNA 3abacteriophages 3adetection limit 3amodels 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprocess control 3ariver water 3arivers 3asurface water 3aultrafiltration 3awater analysis 2aAdsorption 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aLevivirusxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aLimit of Detection 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxgrowth & developmentxvirology. 2aRiversxmicrobiology 2aUltrafiltration 2aWater Microbiology1 aRajal, Verónica Beatriz1 aBlanco Fernández, María Dolores1 aBarril, Patricia Angélica1 aGiordano, Miguel Oscar1 aMasachessi, Gisela1 aMartínez, Laura Cecilia1 aIsa, María Beatriz1 aFreire, María Cecilia1 aLópez Riviello, Gabriela1 aCisterna, Daniel1 aNates, Silvia Viviana1 aMbayed, Viviana Andrea0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Mar., v. 185, no. 3 p.2565-2576dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2731-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009700207520099300304592002801297650002301325650001401348650001901362650001501381650001401396650002201410650001601432650003101448650001301479650001401492650001901506650001601525653002501541653002201566653002001588653001901608653001801627700006001645700005901705773012101764856008201885852000901967655001201976IND60727601220221117084509.0211106e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072760122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2021.1111972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTortora, Fabiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7594-102X10aEffects of long non-coding RNAs on androgen signaling pathways in genitourinary malignancies  aThe non-coding RNA (ncRNA) are generally classified, based on length, into small ncRNAs less than 200 nucleotides, such as miRNA, and long ncRNA (lnRNA) with more than 200 nucleotides.The transcription of ncRNAs, similarly to genes that code for proteins, is highly deregulated in cancer. Their expression level can influence physiological processes, e.g. epigenetic regulation of gene expression, regulation of cell cycle and modification of chromatin. Recent studies on androgen receptor in oncology revealed that it exerts a pivotal role in genitourinary malignancies, in particular in prostate tumor was demonstrated that its deregulation takes part in all stages of carcinogenesis. Here, we discuss present learning of the main lnRNAs involvement on androgen signaling pathways in genitourinary neoplasms, highlighting lnRNAs potential in the regulating network comfortable to cancer onset and progression, and discuss the lnRNAs prognostic and diagnostic value in cancer management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogen receptors 3aandrogens 3acarcinogenesis 3acell cycle 3achromatin 3adisease diagnosis 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3anon-coding RNA 3anucleotides 0aLong non-coding RNAs 0aAndrogen receptor 0aProstate cancer 0aBladder cancer 0aKidney cancer1 aCalin, George A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7427-05781 aCimmino, Amelia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0004-92990 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 526 p.111197-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.1111973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006800169300001600237520133000253592002801583650000801611650001501619650002601634650002001660650001301680650003101693700001801724700001801742700002001760700002001780700001901800700002401819773010301843856008201946852000902028655001202037IND60091528720221116172011.0141103e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009152872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMussi, Valentina10a“DNA-Dressed NAnopore” for complementary sequence detection  ap. 125-131.  aSingle molecule electrical sensing with nanopores is a rapidly developing field with potential revolutionary effects on bioanalytics and diagnostics. The recent success of this technology is in the simplicity of its working principle, which exploits the conductance modulations induced by the electrophoretic translocation of molecules through a nanometric channel. Initially proposed as fast and powerful tools for molecular stochastic sensing, nanopores find now application in a range of different domains, thanks to the possibility of finely tuning their surface properties, thus introducing artificial binding and recognition sites. Here we show the results of DNA translocation and hybridization experiments at the single molecule level by a novel class of selective biosensor devices that we call “DNA-Dressed NAnopore” (DNA²), based on solid state nanopore with large initial dimensions, resized and activated by functionalization with DNA molecules. The presented data demonstrate the ability of the DNA² to selectively detect complementary target sequences, that is to distinguish between molecules depending on their affinity to the functionalization. The DNA² can thus constitute the basis for the design of integrable parallel devices for mutation DNA analysis, diagnostics and bioanalytic investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectrophoresis 3amutation 3anucleic acid hybridization1 aFanzio, Paola1 aRepetto, Luca1 aFirpo, Giuseppe1 aStigliani, Sara1 aTonini, G.

The production of phosphorus free radical scavengers in the gas phase and the barrier effects of GO nanosheets, catalytic charring and the unique Si-O-Si framework of P-HBPSi flame retardant in the condensed phase contributed to the outstanding flame retardancy and toxic gas suppression of TPU/P-HBPSi@GO nanocomposites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflame retardants 3afree radicals 3agraphene oxide 3aheat 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aphosphorus 3apolyurethanes 3asiloxanes 3asmoke 3asol-gel processing 3athermoplastics 3atoxicity 0aHyperbranched polysiloxane 0aThermoplastics polyurethane 0aFlame retardant1 aHuang, Jingshu1 aYu, Bin1 aMeng, Yuan1 aCao, Xianwu1 aZhang, Qunchao1 aWu, Wei1 aShi, Dean1 aJiang, Tao1 aLi, Robert K.Y.0 tComposites.g2021 Nov., v. 150 p.106614-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2021.1066143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01521naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012100161300001800282500002000300520042700320592002800747650001100775650001400786650000900800650001500809651001100824700002100835700002000856700001900876700002300895700002900918700001600947773011400963856007301077852000901150655001201159IND60580109320221121005246.0170909e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058010932DNAL7 a10.1111/jai.134152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, C.

To determine the molecular prevalence of E. bieneusi in edible bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeiana) and evaluate the possibility of its potential zoonotic transmission to humans via food or water, the intestinal contents of 295 bullfrogs were intermittently collected from two open markets in Aksu, China. The samples were screened for the internal transcribed spacer by polymerase chain reaction amplifications, revealing that 20.7% (61/295) of them were infected with E. bieneusi, with no significant differences found between the two sampling locations (p > 0.05). Twenty-two different E. bieneusi genotypes were identified, including one known genotype (EbpC) and 19 novel ones (named BLC1 to BLC19). The zoonotic genotype EbpC was identified in most of the E. bieneusi-positive samples (65.6%, 40/61). The remaining genotypes were identified in either one or three samples each. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that 20 of the E. bieneusi genotypes belonged to Group 1. As far as we are aware, this is the first report of E. bieneusi infections in edible bullfrogs. Our findings suggest that E. bieneusi can be maintained in edible bullfrogs and potentially transmitted via food or water. It is possible that these amphibians are unsuspected zoonotic reservoirs of E. bieneusi.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterocytozoon bieneusi 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aamphibians 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aintestinal mucosa 3amarkets 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3azoonoses 3aChina 0aBullfrogs 0aZoonotic1 aZhao, Aiyun1 aWang, Lingyun1 aGao, Na1 aSun, Yangang1 aLi, Junqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6417-09011 aQi, Meng0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2020 Apr., v. 11 p.103-107dElsevier LtdwJournal:21679x2213-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijppaw.2020.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245011000160300001300270500001900283520078000302592002801082650000901110650001101119650001301130650001201143650001901155650001101174650002301185650001301208650001301221650001301234650001101247650000901258653001601267653002801283653002401311653001901335653002701354653001401381700001901395700002101414700001701435773011601452856007501568852000901643655001201652IND60698681320221116232323.0200615e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069868132DNAL7 a10.3897/jhr.25.25652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawasaki, Maya10aTrimodal adult emergence in summer generations of the rose sawfly Arge nigrinodosa (Hymenoptera, Argidae)  ap. 1-14.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe explored the variable adult emergence in summer generations of a multivoltine sawfly [Arge nigrinodosa (Argidae)], larvae of which feed gregariously on the foliage of Rosa spp. (Rosaceae), and its ecological significance. The sawfly showed a trimodal adult emergence under long-day conditions in the laboratory. Following the first and largest cluster of emergence, a small tail of slightly delayed emergence was observed, which most likely was heritable. The third cluster of emergence after nonheritable partial diapause in prepupae seemed to match the synchronous emergence of a portion of adults in September under field conditions, probably as a risk-spreading (i.e., bet-hedging) strategy to cope with food shortage during unpredictable periods of drought in summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArge 3aadults 3adiapause 3adrought 3afood shortages 3aleaves 3amultivoltine habit 3aprepupae 3aresearch 3asawflies 3asummer 3atail 0aBet-hedging 0apartial summer diapause 0apolymodal emergence 0arisk-spreading 0astochastic polyphenism 0avoltinism1 aFujita, Mariko1 aSakurai, Atsushi1 aMaeto, Kaoru0 tJournal of Hymenoptera research.g2012 Mar. 23, v. 25 p.1-14dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2122x1314-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/jhr.25.25653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002100170245009000191300001600281500001500297520126300312592002801575650001301603650001301616650002401629650001301653650000901666650001101675650001401686650001601700650002101716650001801737650001301755650001901768650001101787650001501798650001601813650004701829650004401876650001601920650004501936650002001981650004202001653001902043700002502062700002502087773010202112856008702214852000902301655001202310IND4466993520221120195901.0141112e20120415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446699352DNAL7 a224017892pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Diana L.D.10aSorption behavior of EE2 on soils subjected to different long-term organic amendments  ap. 120-124.  a2019-12-06  aThe transport and fate of hydrophobic organic contaminants in the environment involve complex phenomena that are influenced by many processes that include sorption by soil components. Sorption behavior of EE2 molecules onto different soil samples was studied and results correlated with the content and type of organic matter present. The highest K value, among all soils presented in this study, was obtained for soil fertilized with compost (1.22) which presented the highest organic carbon content. Also the sorption behavior depends greatly on the soil specific organic matter characteristics. A strong positive correlation was observed between aromatic and carboxylic units and KOC values. The results also suggested an association of the EE2 aromatic nuclei face to face with the surface and/or another EE2 molecule and also sorbent–sorbate interactions due to hydrogen or covalent bonding, likely to occur due to the presence of phenolic function at C-3 and hydroxyl function at C-17 of the EE2 molecules that can react with carboxylic functional groups of soil organic matter. The stronger EE2 sorbs to soil organic matter lower is the leaching into drinking water resources and runoff to rivers and surface water, minimizing its residual toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3asorption 3acomposts 3asoil organic matter 3aleaching 3asoil 3acarbon 3apollution 3ariver water 3ahydrogen bonding 3asoil sampling 3atoxicity 3adrinking water 3arunoff 2aAdsorption 2aCalibration 2aEndocrine Disruptorsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEthinyl Estradiolxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFertilizers 2aNuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 0aorganic matter1 aSchneider, Rudolf J.1 aEsteves, Valdemar I.0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Apr. 15, v. 423 p.120-124dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245007400172300001600246520130900262592002801571650001601599650001101615650001601626650002801642650001101670650001001681650002101691650001001712653001201722653003101734653003201765653002101797700001901818773011001837856008001947852000902027655001202036IND60616431820221119080632.0181016e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061643182DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166360002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSriprateep, Keartisak10aCAD/CAE for stress–strain properties of multifilament twisted yarns  ap. 657-668.  aA method is presented for modeling the tensile behavior of multifilament twisted yarns. A filament assembly model and a computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering (CAD/CAE) approach are proposed for the tensile analysis. The geometry of the twisted yarn and the nonlinear filament properties were considered. The finite element method (FEM) and large deformation effects were applied for computation of the stress–extension curves. Ideal yarn structures of five layers with different twist angles were simulated to predict the tensile behavior of each filament and each layer. The stress acting on the filaments after yarn extension could be directly analyzed by the FEM. The stress distribution in the filaments showed that the highest stress regions were located at the filament in the center of the yarn and decreased slightly to the yarn surface. The stress–extensions of the filaments were converted to yarn tensile behavior that is shown in terms of the maximum and average stress–extension curves. The results of this prediction model were compared with the stress–strain curves of high-tenacity rayon yarn and the energy method. The maximum stress–extension curves showed very good agreement with experimental results and are more accurate than those obtained by previous methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aenergy 3aengineering 3afinite element analysis 3amodels 3arayon 3atensile strength 3ayarns 0aCAD/CAE 0astress–strain properties 0amultifilament twisted yarns 0atensile behavior1 aBohez, Erik LJ0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 87, no. 6 p.657-668dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166360003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013700173300001400310520117100324592002801495650002601523650003401549650001301583650001001596650003001606650002801636650001401664650001401678650001401692653002601706653002801732653003801760653002401798653001801822653000701840653000801847653000901855653001001864653000901874653000801883700002301891700002601914700002401940700006301964700002402027700002402051773009002075856008502165852000902250655001202259IND60563366020221121202412.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056336602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2017.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFonseca, Maisa S.10aOrnithine decarboxylase or gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase overexpression protects Leishmania (Vianna) guyanensis against antimony  ap. 36-43.  aTrypanosomatids present a unique mechanism for detoxification of peroxides that is dependent on trypanothione (bisglutathionylspermidine). Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSH1) produce molecules that are direct precursors of trypanothione. In this study, Leishmania guyanensis odc and gsh1 overexpressor cell lines were generated to investigate the contribution of these genes to the trivalent antimony (SbIII)-resistance phenotype. The ODC- or GSH1-overexpressors parasites presented an increase of two and four-fold in SbIII-resistance index, respectively, when compared with the wild-type line. Pharmacological inhibition of ODC and GSH1 with the specific inhibitors α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), respectively, increased the antileishmanial effect of SbIII in all cell lines. However, the ODC- and GSH1-overexpressor were still more resistant to SbIII than the parental cell line. Together, our data shows that modulation of ODC and GSH1 levels and activity is sufficient to affect L. guyanensis susceptibility to SbIII, and confirms a role of these genes in the SbIII-resistance phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania guyanensis 3aalpha-difluoromethylornithine 3aantimony 3agenes 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3aornithine decarboxylase 3aparasites 3aperoxides 3aphenotype 0aLeishmania guyanensis 0aOrnithine decarboxylase 0aGamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase 0aAntimony-resistance 0aTrypanothione 0aLg 0aODC 0aGSH1 0aSbIII 0aDFMO 0aBSO1 aComini, Marcelo A.1 aResende, Bethânia V.1 aSanti, Ana Maria M.1 aZoboli, Antônio P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4347-45401 aMoreira, Douglas S.1 aMurta, Silvane M.F.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2017 Apr., v. 175 p.36-43dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2017.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007500167300001600242520164500258592002801903650002101931650001501952650003501967650002502002650001702027650001802044650001802062650001302080650002102093700002102114700001802135700002002153700002002173773010302193856008202296852000902378655001202387IND60091525420221116165733.0141103e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009152542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jin Hyung10aEnhancing immunoassay detection of antigens with multimeric protein Gs  ap. 146-151.  aThis paper describes a method for the effective and self-oriented immobilization of antibodies on magnetic silica-nanoparticles using a multimeric protein G.

The optimal conditions for the reaction between the protein Gs and the SiO₂-MNPs was a time of 60min and a concentration of 100μg/mL, resulting in coupling efficiencies of 77%, 67% and 55% for the monomeric, dimeric and trimeric protein Gs, respectively. Subsequently, anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was immobilized onto protein G-coupled SiO₂-MNPs. The quantitative efficiency of antibody immobilization found the trimeric protein G to be the best, followed by the dimeric and monomeric proteins, which differs from the coupling efficiencies. Using all three protein constructs in an HBsAg fluoroimmunoassay, the lowest detectable concentrations were 500, 250 and 50ng/mL for the monomeric, dimeric and trimeric protein G-coupled SiO₂-MNPs, respectively. Therefore, multimeric protein Gs, particularly the trimeric form, can be employed to improve antibody immobilization and, ultimately, enhance the sensitivity of immunoassays. In addition, the multimeric protein Gs devised in this study can be utilized in other immunosensors to bind the antibodies at a high efficiency and in the proper orientation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibodies 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahepatitis B antigens 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananoparticles 3aproteins 3asurface antigens1 aChoi, Hong Kyung1 aLee, Soo Youn1 aLim, Myung-Woon1 aChang, Jeong Ho0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 28, no. 1 p.146-151dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245015600158506025800314520082600572592002801398650002001426650002001446650002601466650002501492650001401517650001901531650001001550650001101560650002501571650000901596650001901605653001801624653002401642653002601666700001901692773013901711856007701850852000901927655001201936IND60478796120221119062455.0160114e20140414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047879612DNAL7 a10.4081/jear.2014.7152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeidi, K.10aEfficiency of Mentha Piperita L. and Mentha Pulegium L.

However, there is still scope to re-examine some of the major assumptions of the technique with reference to the number of fingerprint properties used in the model, the number of model iterations and the potential uncertainties of using more than one sediment core collected from the same floodplain sink. We investigated the role of subsurface erosion in the supply of fine sediment to two sediment cores collected from a floodplain in a small degraded catchment in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The results showed that increasing the number of individual fingerprint properties in the composite signature did not improve the model goodness-of-fit. This is still a much debated issue in sediment source fingerprinting. To test the goodness-of-fit further, the number of model repeat iterations was increased from 5000 to 30,000. However, this did not reduce uncertainty ranges in modelled source proportions nor improve the model goodness-of-fit. The estimated sediment source contributions were not consistent with the available published data on erosion processes in the study catchment. The temporal pattern of sediment source contributions predicted for the two sediment cores was very different despite the cores being collected in close proximity from the same floodplain. This highlights some of the potential limitations associated with using floodplain cores to reconstruct catchment erosion processes and associated sediment source contributions. For the source tracing approach in general, the findings here suggest the need for further investigations into uncertainties related to the number of fingerprint properties included in un-mixing models. The findings support the current widespread use of ≤5000 model repeat iterations for estimating the key sources of sediment samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloodplains 3amodels 3asediments 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aSouth Africa 0aSediment source fingerprinting 0auncertainty analysis 0aEastern Cape 0agully erosion 0amass balance modelling1 aRowntree, Kate1 aKakembo, Vincent1 aFoster, Ian1 aCollins, Adrian L.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 June 01, v. 194 p.27-41dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245011800170300001800288500002000306500001500326520171900341592002802060650001702088650001102105650001802116650001502134650001602149650001102165650001202176650001302188650001402201650001502215650000902230650001902239650001402258650002202272650002602294650001302320650001402333653001802347700002102365700002402386773010802410856007902518852000902597655001202606IND60580106620221120162334.0170909e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058010662DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.138252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoivumäki, Tuuli P.10aTryptophan and Cysteine Oxidation Products Dominate in α‐Lactalbumin‐Derived Peptides Analyzed with LC–MSn  ap. 2062-2069.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aα‐Lactalbumin (α‐La), a major milk whey protein, is comprised of several amino acids prone to metal‐catalyzed oxidation (MCO) typical in processing and during storage of foods. New tools are needed for the detection of characteristic oxidation products especially from tryptophan and cysteine that often remain unrecognized when using the traditional methods of carbonyl formation monitoring. In this study, the oxidative changes in α‐La were investigated through tryptic digestion and collection of 3 descriptive peptides fitted into a metal‐catalyzed oxidation (Fenton reaction) model. The peptide samples were oxidized at +37 °C for 14 d and explored with liquid chromatography–quadrupole ion trap‐mass spectrometer (LC–MSⁿ). The fractionated α‐La peptides were valyl‐glycyl‐isoleucyl‐asparaginyl‐tyrosyl‐tryptophyl‐leucyl‐alanyl‐histidyl‐lysine (VGINYWLAHK), leucyl‐aspartyl‐glutaminyl‐tryptophyl‐leucyl‐cysteinyl‐glutamyl‐lysine (LDQWLCEK), and tryptophyl⁺¹⁶‐leucyl‐alanyl‐histidyl‐lysyl‐alanyl‐leucyl‐cysteine (W⁺¹⁶LAHKALC). Oxidation of several amino acids, such as cysteine, histidine, lysine, and tryptophan was observed. In the peptide LDQWLCEK, cysteine was rapidly trioxidized to sulfonic acid, followed by other amino acid side chains as secondary oxidation sites. Tryptophan oxidation was more pronounced in the peptides W⁺¹⁶LAHKALC and VGINYWLAHK, and also formation of the harmful N‐formylkynurenine was observed. As a conclusion, several stable and promising oxidation markers are proposed for α‐La, which could be implemented in the evaluation of quality and safety of dairy protein‐containing products.  aPublisher supplied data 3awhey protein 3alysine 3afractionation 3amonitoring 3alactalbumin 3amodels 3aliquids 3apeptides 3adigestion 3atryptophan 3amilk 3asulfonic acids 3aoxidation 3amass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3acysteine 3ahistidine 0asulfonic acid1 aGürbüz, Göker1 aHeinonen, I.

The early detection of MRSA in the specimens of the patients is important to enable the appropriate treatment, to decrease morbidity and mortality rates, and to manage control actions in the healthcare units. Thus, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic systems with high sensitivity and specificity are essential to prevent MRSA to be an emerging public health threat. The design and fabrication of new diagnostic systems necessitates working in collaboration between different disciplines to make new challenges in the field of clinical diagnosis and to meet the demands of clinicians. It is certain that in the near future, MEMS and nanotechnology based detection methods will take the place of current methods in clinical diagnosis. The evaluation of new trends for specificity, sensitivity, cost effectiveness, disposability, low weight, ease of use, and facile access should be taken into consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3ahealth services 3amethicillin 3amorbidity 3amortality 3ananotechnology 3apatients 3apublic health1 aKülah, Haluk1 aÖzgen, Canan1 aAlp, Alpaslan1 aHasçelik, Gülşen0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 29, no. 1 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03475naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245015400178300001400332520159200346592002801938650002001966650002201986650002602008650002702034650001602061650001102077650001902088650002002107650001602127650001202143650001502155650001502170650001702185650001602202650000902218650001402227650001302241650002002254653001902274653002602293653001202319653002202331653000802353700002202361700002702383700002302410700002502433700002302458700006202481700002002543700006202563700002402625700002802649773009002677856008502767852000902852655001202861IND60563366120221121202436.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056336612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2017.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ado Carmo, Guilherme M.10aPurinergic enzymatic activities in lymphocytes and cardiomyocytes of mice acutely infected by Trypanosoma cruzi modulating the inflammatory responses  ap. 44-50.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of purinergic enzymes in lymphocytes and cardiac tissue of mice experimentally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. Twelve female mice were used, divided into two groups (n = 6): uninfected and infected. On day 12 post-infection (PI), the animals were anesthetized and after euthanized, and samples were collected for analyses. Infected mice showed reduction in erythrocyte counts, hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration, as well as reduced number of total leukocytes in consequence of neutrophilia (P < 0.01). The number of monocytes increased in infected mice (P < 0.001), however the number of lymphocytes and eosinophils did not differ between groups (P > 0.05). The E-NTPDase (ATP and ADP substrate) and E-ADA activities in lymphocytes increased significantly in mice infected by T. cruzi (P < 0.01). In the heart, multiple pseudocysts containing amastigotes within cardiomyocytes were observed, as well as focally extensive severe necrosis associated with diffuse moderate to severe inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes. Although, the NTPDase activity (ATP and ADP substrate) in the cardiac homogenate did not differ between groups, a reduction on 5'-nucleotidase activity (P < 0.001) and an increase in the ADA activity in infected animals (P < 0.05) were observed. Thus, animals infected by T. cruzi experienced the disease, i.e., showed anemia, leucopenia, and heart lesions. Associated with this, purinergic enzymes showed altered activities, which might be related to the modulation of the inflammatory response.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5'-nucleotidase 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamastigotes 3aanemia 3acardiomyocytes 3aenzyme activity 3aeosinophils 3afemales 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ainflammation 3alymphocytes 3amice 3amonocytes 3anecrosis 3atrypanosomiasis 0aChagas disease 0aInflammatory response 0aNTPDase 0a5’-nucleotidase 0aADA1 aDoleski, Pedro H.1 ade Sá, Mariângela F.1 aGrando, Thirssa H.1 aBottari, Nathieli B.1 aLeal, Daniela B.R.1 aGressler, Lucas T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2109-01751 aHenker, Luan C.1 aMendes, Ricardo E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9222-34791 aMonteiro, Silvia G.1 aDa Silva, Aleksandro S.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2017 Apr., v. 175 p.44-50dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2017.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245010900180300001800289500001900307500000900326520162400335592002801959650002001987650001102007650002302018650001402041650001502055650001702070650001302087650001402100650002702114650001702141650002402158650001802182700002202200700002502222700002102247700002102268700002502289700002402314700001702338700002102355773013302376856008402509852000902593655001202602IND60665223020221119231409.0191122e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066522302DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2012.01.00292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonce-Molina, Luis Jonatan10aQuantitative Trait Loci and Candidate Loci for Heading Date in a Large Population of a Wide Barley Cross  ap. 2469-2480.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aSpanish barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) landraces exhibit good adaptation to Mediterranean conditions. This study aims at revealing the genetic control of heading date on a large population of 464 doubled haploid lines from the cross between the Spanish line SBCC145 (a 6-row barley with low vernalization requirement and good agronomics) and the German cultivar Beatrix (a 2-row, spring-type, short stature, high yield, malting quality barley). The population was evaluated using augmented designs in two field trials with contrasting sowing dates. The study was done in a two-step process to optimize cost effectiveness of genotyping. First, a sample of 184 lines was genotyped with 1536 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which allowed building a map with 408 markers. Then the entire population was further genotyped with markers from flowering time genes VrnH1, VrnH2, VrnH3, and PpdH1 and a simple sequence repeat linked to Eam6. Quantitative trait loci were detected for growth habit, heading date, plant height, and individual grain weight on chromosome 3H in a region that possibly contains the denso gene. The effect of VrnH3 on heading date confirmed previous results from association mapping, and showed an interaction with PpdH1, to which it is linked in the photoperiod pathway. PpdH1 had an opposite effect on heading date at the two trials. Besides revealing interesting effects for particular alleles of the genes studied, this population demonstrates that it is possible to combine short stature with early heading date and good grain size in six-row barley and shows good prospects for its use in breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3acost effectiveness 3acultivars 3agenotyping 3agrowth habit 3ahaploidy 3alandraces 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant height 3aquantitative traits 3avernalization1 aMaría Casas, Ana1 aPilar Gracia, María1 aSilvar, Cristina1 aMansour, Elsayed1 aThomas, William B.T.1 aSchweizer, Günther1 aHerz, Markus1 aIgartua, Ernesto0 tCrop science.g2012 Nov., v. 52, no. 6 p.2469-2480dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2012.01.00293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245007200214300001600286520102100302592002801323650002101351650002901372650003001401650001901431650001401450650001001464650001801474650001101492650001101503650001101514653002601525653004001551653001801591653002101609653001901630653002101649700002401670700001901694773010401713856008501817852000901902655001201911IND60681592620221119042454.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068159262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2020.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Alistair J.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1406-425110aThoughts on the evolution of Core Environmental Responses in yeasts  ap. 475-481.  aThe model yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, display Core Environmental Responses (CERs) that include the induction of a core set of stress genes in response to diverse environmental stresses. CERs underlie the phenomenon of stress cross-protection, whereby exposure to one type of stress can provide protection against subsequent exposure to a second type of stress. CERs have probably arisen through the accumulation, over evolutionary time, of protective anticipatory responses (“adaptive prediction”). CERs have been observed in other evolutionarily divergent fungi but, interestingly, not in the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans. We argue that this is because we have not looked in the right place. In response to specific host inputs, C. albicans does activate anticipatory responses that protect it against impending attack from the immune system. Therefore, we suggest that C. albicans has evolved a CER that reflects the environmental challenges it faces in host niches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3across immunity 3aevolution 3agenes 3aimmune system 3amodels 3aniches 3ayeasts 0aCore stress responses 0aEvolution of anticipatory responses 0aFungal memory 0aFungal pathogens 0aImmune evasion 0aStress responses1 aLarcombe, Daniel E.1 aPradhan, Arnab0 tFungal biology.g2020 May, v. 124, no. 5 p.475-481dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2020.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04551naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245018900169300001600358520220400374592002802578650002502606650002702631650001202658650001302670650001002683650000902693650000902702650001802711650002202729650002202751650001102773650001402784650001202798650002102810650001002831650001102841650001502852650002102867650002902888650001502917650001802932650002402950650001002974653000702984653001002991653001003001653000803011653000803019653001103027653001003038653000803048653000703056653000903063653000703072653000703079653000903086653000703095653000703102653000803109653000703117653000803124653000703132653001103139653001003150653002203160653000903182653004903191653004003240653002203280653001803302653000903320653001503329700001803344700001303362700002103375700002203396700001503418773011803433856008903551852000903640655001203649IND60532518320221121033513.0190403e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053251832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanghe, S.10aNutrient composition, digestibility and energy value of distillers dried grains with solubles and condensed distillers solubles fed to growing pigs and evaluation of prediction methods  ap. 263-275.  aThis study had two objectives: (1) to determine the nutritional value of 13 batches of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and 5 batches of condensed distillers solubles (CDS), and (2) to evaluate the prediction of the nutritional value of DDGS by using either mean values per DDGS type or lab measurements as potential predictors of nutrient content. The DDGS batches were derived from either wheat (n=3), corn (n=3) or a mixture of grains (n=7). The CDS batches were mainly wheat-based. The batches were collected from 11 European ethanol plants. Six barrows per dietary treatment were placed in individual metabolism cages and fed either a basic diet or a diet in which 30% of the basic diet was replaced by DDGS or CDS. Chromium oxide (4g/kg) was included in the feed as an external marker. Fecal and ileal samples were collected and the apparent fecal digestibility (AFD) and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of the diets were calculated using the indicator method. Consequently, AFD and AID values for DDGS and CDS were calculated through difference. Nutrient components, color measurements and in vitro protein values were evaluated as variables to predict the AFD, AID and net energy (NE) value of DDGS by means of multiple regression analysis. The DDGS corn samples had a higher gross energy and crude fat (CFAT) content (P<0.001) and were more red (a*; P=0.002) and yellow (b*; P=0.003) than the DDGS wheat and DDGS mix samples. The NE value was also higher for DDGS corn (P<0.001). Large variation existed between DDGS samples in amino acid digestibility (particularly of Lysine), even when DDGS was produced from the same type of grain. Hence, the use of mean values for each DDGS type did not result in a good estimation of the nutritional value. The NE value of DDGS could be predicted by the color parameter b* (R2=71.1; P<0.001) and CFAT (R2=76.2; P<0.001), or by combining CFAT and acid detergent fiber (R2=94.0; P<0.001). No good prediction equations could be established for the amino acid digestibility. The CDS samples also showed high variation in nutrient and amino acid composition and digestibility, which limits their usability in practical pig feed formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid detergent fiber 3aamino acid composition 3abarrows 3achromium 3acolor 3acorn 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3adistillers grains 3aenergy 3aequations 3aethanol 3afeed formulation 3aileum 3alysine 3ametabolism 3anutrient content 3anutritional intervention 3aprediction 3aprotein value 3aregression analysis 3awheat 0aAA 0aADFom 0aADICP 0aAFD 0aAID 0aaNDFom 0aBPSCP 0aCDS 0aCF 0aCFAT 0aCP 0aCV 0aDDGS 0aDM 0aGE 0aGOS 0aNE 0aNSP 0aOM 0aPDIKOH 0aPHSCP 0aSGd1, SGd6, SGd24 0aWSCP 0aDistillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) 0aCondensed distillers solubles (CDS) 0aNutritional value 0aDigestibility 0aPigs 0aPrediction1 aDe Boever, J.1 aAmpe, B.1 aDe Brabander, D.1 aDe Campeneere, S.1 aMillet, S.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2015 Dec., v. 210 p.263-275dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2015.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014300170300001400313520159700327592002801924650001701952650002301969650001301992650002402005650002302029650001202052650001802064650001102082650001602093650001102109650001502120650001502135650002002150650001502170650001302185650001302198650002502211650001902236650001002255651000902265653001702274653001702291653002302308653001502331653001602346653001102362700002602373700003202399773012302431856008302554852000902637655001202646IND60525448420221120051957.0190318e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052544842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2015.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Sylvia L.R.10aIntensification of tropical fallow-based agriculture: Trading-off ecosystem services for economic gain in shifting cultivation landscapes?  ap. 47-56.  aFarmers are under ever growing pressure to increase productivity to meet both food and fibre needs, as well as rising household economic demands. In many shifting cultivation systems, farmers are taking advantage of restorative forest fallow periods to plant commercially-oriented orchards to increase output. While there is an economic benefit to this intensification pathway, we ask: what are the trade-offs in ecosystem services with planting low diversity orchards? We compare the capacity of native forest fallows vs. planted umarí orchards (Poraquieba sericea) to provide critical regulating services (soil fertility regeneration, woody biomass accumulation), provisioning services (commercial fruit production, timber, charcoal, wild fruits and handicraft materials production), and tree biodiversity in lowland forests of Peru. In addition, we estimate their potential contribution to farmer livelihoods to better understand the economic incentives behind orchard planting. Orchards were found to provide similar or higher levels of both regulating and provisioning services than forest fallows, apart from harvestable timber. Although biodiversity was lower under orchards, tree diversity and composition recovered fully in subsequent fallow rotations. Potential revenues from orchard planting were greater than from fallows, however they were small compared to median incomes suggesting that the motivation to plant orchards is income diversification. Together these results highlight that orchard fallows may be an ecologically and economically viable pathway for intensification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiomass production 3acharcoal 3aeconomic incentives 3aecosystem services 3afarmers 3afruit growing 3afruits 3ahandicrafts 3aincome 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3alowland forests 3amotivation 3aorchards 3aplanting 3ashifting cultivation 3asoil fertility 3atrees 3aPeru 0aAgroforestry 0aBiodiversity 0aEcosystem services 0aTrade-offs 0aLivelihoods 0aAmazon1 aRhemtulla, Jeanine M.1 aCoomes, O.

The success of this strategy in modern breeding history can be highlighted in dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), where an enhancement in dry bean production was facilitated in the last 25 yr by replacing Type III prostrate growth habit with Type II upright growth habit. This growth habit leads to disease avoidance and enables cost‐effective management practices. To better understand the ideotype breeding trajectory in dry bean, and guarantee further improvements, we characterized 16 traits at three locations using a panel consisting of 122 genotypes with different growth habits. Among the growth habit types, significant differences were detected for seven architectural traits, three seed yield (SY) traits, and one phenological trait. Genetic variance was greater in the Type II genotypes than the Type III genotypes for five of the significant traits, including canopy height (CNH) and SY. Furthermore, in Type II genotypes, moderate narrow‐sense heritability was detected for CNH, lodging (LDG), plant length (PL), and stem diameter (STD), suggesting positive gain can be made for growth habit from crosses between Type II genotypes. A network analysis of Type II genotypes revealed these four traits are highly correlated, and suggests possible genetic relatedness among the traits. Breeders often use CNH as a selection criterion, and the positive correlation between this trait and STD suggests a possible anatomical mechanism responsible for the more upright plant types.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013‐67014‐21367cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a2013‐67014‐21367cU.S. Department of Agriculture 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3acanopy height 3acost effectiveness 3adry beans 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variance 3agrowth habit 3aheritability 3aideotypes 3aphenology 3aseed yield1 aBello, Marco1 aMndolwa, Eninka1 aSchröder, Stephan,1 aMoghaddam, Samira Mafi1 aOsorno, Juan M.1 aMiklas, Phillip N.1 aMcClean, Phillip E.0 tCrop science.g2016 Nov., v. 56, no. 6 p.3005-3015dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2016.02.01193Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04006naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003900134024002500173024004000198024002300238040001800261100001900279245012300298520196400421592002802385650003402413650001902447650000902466650002902475650002702504650002102531650001502552650001802567650002102585650001102606650001602617650002902633653001902662653001802681653003802699653002902737653001202766653001102778700001502789700001602804700005402820700006002874700001502934700002102949700006202970700001903032773013103051856008603182856011403268961001303382852000903395655001203404IND60727598620221214224109.0211219e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072759862DNAL7 a3773852aris7 a10113/72759862hdl7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1120972doi7 a4355922aris_accn_no7 a3042-11210-003-00D2aris_project_no7 a3773852seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Haomiao10aEffects of residue removal and tillage on greenhouse gas emissions in continuous corn systems as simulated with RZWQM2  aAgricultural production is a major source of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) globally. The effects of conservation practices on soil CO₂ and N₂O emissions remain a high degree of uncertainty. In this study, soil CO₂ and N₂O emissions under different residue and tillage practices in an irrigated, continuous corn system, were investigated using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2). Combinations of no/high stover removal (NR and HR, respectively) and no-till/conventional tillage (NT and CT, respectively) field experiments were tested over the four crop-years (Apr. 2011–Apr. 2015). The model was calibrated using the NRCT, and validated with other treatments. The simulation results showed that soil volumetric water content (VWC) in the NR treatments (i.e., NRCT and NRNT) was 1.3%–1.9% higher than that in the HR treatments (i.e., HRCT and HRNT) averaged across the four years. A higher amount of CO₂ and N₂O emissions were simulated in the NRCT across the four years (annual average: 7034 kg C/ha/yr for CO₂ and 3.8 kg N/ha/yr for N₂O), and lower emissions were in the HRNT (annual average: 6329 kg C/ha/yr and 3.7 kg N/ha/yr for N₂O). A long-term simulation (2001–2015) suggested that the CO₂ and N₂O emissions were closely correlated with the stover removal degree (SRD), tillage, VWC, soil temperature (ST), years in management (Y), and fertilizer application. Stover and tillage practices had cumulative effects on CO₂ emissions. The simulated annual CO₂ emissions in 1st year from NRCT, NRNT, and HRCT were 7.8%, 0.0%, and 7.7% higher than that from HRNT, respectively; then the emissions in 15th year were 63.6%, 47.7%, and 29.1% higher, respectively. Meanwhile, there were no cumulative effects on N₂O emissions. The results also demonstrated that the RZWQM2 is a promising tool for evaluating the long-term effects of CO₂ and N₂O emissions on different conservation practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRoot Zone Water Quality Model 3acarbon dioxide 3acorn 3aenvironmental management 3afertilizer application 3agreenhouse gases 3airrigation 3anitrous oxide 3asoil temperature 3astover 3auncertainty 3avolumetric water content 0aCarbon dioxide 0aNitrous oxide 0aConservation management practices 0aStover residue retention 0aTillage 0aRZWQM21 aShu, Kexin1 aQi, Zhiming1 aMa, Liwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7451-52211 aJin, Virginia L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4146-84971 aLi, Youjia1 aSchmer, Marty R.1 aWienhold, Brian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3066-69651 aFeng, Shaoyuan0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 May 01, v. 285 p.112097-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1120973Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/72759863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009400157300002000251520079400271592002801065650002201093650001101115650002201126650001601148650003701164700001901201700001601220700001401236700001901250700001801269700002401287700001901311700001701330700001601347773012401363856007401487852000901561655001201570IND60640850420221120075222.0190505e20160622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064085042DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra10696j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianxun10aUnintentionally doped high resistivity GaN layers with an InGaN interlayer grown by MOCVD  ap. 60068-60073.  aHigh-resistivity GaN (HR-GaN) epilayers with an in situ annealed InGaN interlayer were grown by MOCVD technique.

Combining the high-resolution X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectroscopy characterization, the compensation mechanism through the carbon acceptors impurities induced by increased edge-type threading dislocations (TDs) was demonstrated.

However, data on sugar intake are still scarce in China. This study aimed to provide time trends in the total and added sugar intakes among Chinese children and adolescents from 1997 to 2011. A nationwide ongoing open prospective cohort study of Chinese children and adolescents aged 3–17 years (n = 13,212) was conducted by using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) 1997–2011 (six 1-year cycles). An individual dietary intake was collected from three consecutive 24-h recalls during randomly allocated home visits. Data for total and added sugar contents were determined based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 28 (SR28), the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) 2015–2016, and the labeled ingredients and nutrient contents. General linear regression was used to estimate time trends. Over the 15-year period, total sugar and added sugar intakes increased among all age groups studied (3–17 years: total sugar increased from 11.2 ± 0.3 g/d to 28.1 ± 0.5 g/d, added sugar increased from 1.0 ± 0.1 g/d to 7.2 ± 0.3 g/d; 3–6 years: 9.5 ± 0.6 g/d to 25.1 ± 0.9 g/d, 1.3 ± 0.2 g/d to 6.9 ± 0.4 g/d; 7–12 years: 11.4 ± 0.5 g/d to 28.1 ± 0.8 g/d, 0.9 ± 0.1 g/d to 7.1 ± 0.5 g/d; 13–17 years: 11.8 ± 0.4 g/d to 31.4 ± 1.1 g/d, 1.0 ± 0.2 g/d to 7.6 ± 0.6 g/d) (all p for trend < 0.001). Adolescents aged 13–17 years had the highest total sugar intake, and children aged 3–6 years had the highest added sugar intake, except for 2011. Children and adolescents living in urban areas and who were overweight had much higher total and added sugar intakes than those residing in rural areas and of non-overweight/obesity. Furthermore, the dietary sources of total and added sugars have become more diverse over the study period. In conclusion, we observed a notable rise in total and added sugar intakes among children and adolescents across all age groups, both genders, both urban and rural areas, and all BMI categories, with dietary sources of total and added sugars becoming more diverse in China over 15 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aadded sugars 3acohort studies 3afood intake 3afood quality 3anutrient databanks 3anutrition surveys 3aoverweight 3aregression analysis 3aChina1 aCheng, Jing 1 aWan, Lijin 1 aChen, Wei 0 tNutrients.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu141633403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
